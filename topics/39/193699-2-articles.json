The sounds of the woods were changing, the day shift clocking out as the night shift began arriving; at one point a loud squeak indicated that one of the former had just fallen prey to one of the latter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZero noticed all the details, saw the small predator with its latest meal dangling limply in its jaws trotting away through the undergrowth. Zero was utterly in tune with the surrounding environment, because to be anything else was fatal in Zero\u2019s line of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Nobody really knew Zero\u2019s real name, not even Zero.

Zero knew how to combat those insects, how to treat their bites and how best to prepare them for eating. Zero did none of those things and instead watched as it pounced on an unfortunate forest critter, paralysing it with venom before laying its eggs inside it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Darkness was never truly dark, even on an overcast and moonless light, and tonight the stars were more than enough to illuminate their target. Not that they needed to- its entrance was lit by two bright spotlights and more lights were scattered around the perimeter. Two security guards were at the entrance paying only token attention to the world outside their little hut and the small TV inside it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlpha to all units. Engage.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0For a long time there was no obvious result to this order. Nothing changed and nothing moved. Zero wasn\u2019t worried by that; on the contrary, that was the plan they had agreed on. Move up silently into position unnoticed, then strike without warning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Delta moved first, unfolding from a large bush like some kind of forest troll and hurling a smoke bomb straight into the open door of the guard hut. Both guards stumbled into the open, coughing and blinded by the smoke, where Beta was waiting and struck once, twice, dropping them before they even knew what had hit them. Delta lumbered up silently and moved the two unconscious guards into the bushes where they would be found by first responders bound, gagged and completely unharmed save for identical lumps on the backs of their heads and with no clue what had happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Beta scaled the entrance gate in seconds and moved inside the compound, followed shortly after by Delta who went through the gates in a very literal but surprisingly quiet manner. Two clicks followed by three over the radio was the only warning before all the lights went out, courtesy of Gamma. Zero\u2019s eyes were perfectly adjusted to the darkness and could easily see Beta and Delta moving to their next objectives, planting the explosive charges as they went. Nothing else moved and there was no sign of the other two guards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeta, charges set, moving to position 3.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CDelta, charges set, moving to position 3.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Torches flashed on the other side of the compound as the remaining guards came out to try and fix the lights. The first encountered Beta and abruptly went out; the second encountered Delta and simply vanished. Beta moved to the last objectives while Gamma carried the second pair of unconscious guards, one under each arm, to leave them with their colleagues in the bushes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeta, objectives complete.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CDelta, objectives complete.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CGamma, objectives complete.

The charges were small and did only moderate damage, but each was placed to cause maximum disruption by destabilising foundations, destroying equipment or in one case knocking out the compound\u2019s power and phone lines. No dramatic fireballs to attract attention and no ka-booms to carry over the breeze, exactly as planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CAlpha, mission complete. Fall back to position 7 for exfiltration.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Zero took one last look at the objective, the sign outside the gates completely legible even at this distance in the faint afterglow from the lights that had previously lit it up. The damage to the facilities complete with Gamma\u2019s hacks would be putting a huge dent in the latter half of Jebediah Kerman\u2019s Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Company\u2019s activities for some time to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZero was still there in the morning when the proprietors arrived to find the Junkyard in disarray, gates broken open and much of the machinery destroyed or rendered inoperable. Local law enforcement arrived, did some preliminary investigations but were clearly at a loss to explain how, or indeed why, anyone would try to sabotage a junkyard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Zero was still there when the Children\u2019s video message hit the media, claiming responsibility for the sabotage and warning that it was merely an overture to a far greater campaign. Unless and until the destructive and wasteful Space Program was halted, it warned, more action would follow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZero was still there when Jebediah Kerman III, proprietor and CEO of Jeb\u2019s Junkyard (and uncle to the famous Kerbonaut) gave an interview in front of his business denouncing the Children as \u2018ignorant imbeciles\u2019, pointing out that Jeb\u2019s Junkyard was the biggest site not only for upcycling discarded scrap and unwanted machinery into useful products for the aerospace industry but also for refurbishing and reusing spent rocket boosters. By destroying that capability, Jeb the 3rd said, the Children had just removed one of the most environmentally friendly parts of the space supply chain and now instead of reusing those stages the Space Program would have to buy in brand new rockets made from virgin resources, precisely the opposite of what they wanted and as ironic as it was idiotic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Zero was still there when darkness had fallen again, a police cruiser parked by the gates and twice as many guards as before prowling the perimeter. Slowly, imperceptibly, Zero backed away into the woods, blending into the shadows and vanishing without a trace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/193699-audacity-memoirs-of-a-kerbonaut/page/2/\u0026amp;tab=comments#comment-3802425\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-31T22:20:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2020 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpellchecking edit\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Misguided Kerbal","CreatedById":203209,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T02:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this is getting exciting.

School was finished, exams completed and now all she had to do was wait for the results to be sent out in the next few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was usually up before dawn for an early morning run, currently followed three times a week by swimming lessons and the other four by gym sessions. She had scaled back a bit while studying for the exams only because she didn\u0027t want to tire herself out too much and because there were just not enough hours in the day to fit it all in. The Astronaut Program had very strict criteria for physical health and her size was a disadvantage (there were girls three years younger at school who were taller than her now!) so she was determined to do everything in her power to mitigate against it. But not today- today she was staying in bed and having a well-earned lie-in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe woke up again about half an hour later and felt hands wandering across her chest.

Why did babies have such ridiculously strong grip?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha found the whole thing immensely amusing, which meant that she flailed her arms around in the uncoordinated way that young babies move and pulled her hair even more.

Now just wait there a minute while I...\u201D She was already out of the room before Tina could object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe noticed that Sasha was peering up at her with one eye and made a silly face at her; Sasha closed the eye disdainfully and loosed a staccato burst directly where Tina\u0027s left hand was supporting her along with a sound that could best be described as \u0027moist\u0027, or possibly \u0027squelchy\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMum, she needs changing!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll be there in a minute!\u201D was the shouted reply from downstairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha was looking at her again in a slightly unnerving way. Maybe talking to her would be better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey there. This must be strange for you, you\u0027re thinking \u201CWho are you?

Well, I am Tina. \u003Cem\u003EVery nice to meet you Tina, I am Sasha\u003C/em\u003E. Nice to meet you too.\u201D She put on a silly voice when speaking Sasha\u0027s part, which Sasha found amusing. \u201CI wonder what\u0027s going on downstairs. \u003Cem\u003EMe too, why don\u0027t we go and see? \u003C/em\u003EWell, I thought about that, but I don\u0027t want to disturb you and make you start crying because then I\u0027ll look bad. \u003Cem\u003EFair point, let\u0027s just stay put for now. \u003C/em\u003EExcellent suggestion!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shimmied along the bed to reach her phone sitting on the bedside table and started trawling the internet for information on her newly-found ability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...chemical signals released by babies triggers release of the hormone Prolactin in the mother which activates the biochemical blah blah blah- positively regulated by Postgesterone which is only present from the 22nd week of pregnancy, peaks immediately after birth and then remains high until the infant is weaned at around 8-12 munths. Pretty much what she had already heard in Kerbal Biology class. So if Postgesterone was only present after actually having a baby, then how...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2026in rare cases, a minor mutation in the Postgesterone receptor gene regulator (PGR2-rf) can result in low level signalling being produced spontaneously. Most common from onset of puberty to age 30 and thought to be prevalent at a rate of around 7 per million in the general population- so much for 7 per thousand!- close contact with a newborn induces Prolactin activity which will also increase Postgesterone production and results in sympathetic lactation or symp-lac- wait a second. She re-read the last couple of paragraphs and realised what they meant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, Sasha, I\u0027m going to move you to the other side because my left arm is going numb, and then we\u0027re going to go and have a little talk with Mummy. \u003Cem\u003EAbout what? \u003C/em\u003EAbout her little scheme to try and get me to deal with your crying little face in the middle of the night. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s a pretty good idea actually, I like it. \u003C/em\u003EWhose side are you on?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe got half way down the stairs just as Mum was about to head out the front door, coat and shoes on and car keys in her hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDad stuck his hand through the greenhouse door, I\u0027m taking him to hospital. I\u0027ve called Aunt Linley, she\u0027s working an early shift so she\u0027ll be done by noon and come straight round to give you a hand if you need it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027ll be fine, Tina. You\u0027re a rocket scientist, I think you can deal with a baby for a couple of hours on your own.\u201D Sasha made another moist, squelchy sound. \u201CAs I recall, you\u0027re pretty used to dealing with hazardous gases.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry, I really do have to go. Just call me if you need something. Lock the door behind me, bye.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina was left staring at the door as the car started and drove off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u003Cem\u003E told you to go down earlier, but noooooo, you knew better\u003C/em\u003E. Don\u0027t you start!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big bag of baby stuff was in one corner of the lounge; Tina rummaged through it to find the changing mat and put Sasha down on it to have both hands free. She peeled open the soiled nappy, trying very hard not to look at its contents, rolled it up and stuck it in a bag then tied the handles together in a double knot just to be safe. She dug through the bag to find the baby wipes and turned back to see a puddle spreading across the mat and trickling off onto the carpet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, Sasha! Not on the carpet!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe picked her up and immediately felt something squelch under her left hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEeeewwww, it\u0027s up to your neck, Sasha! How did you even do that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha replied by burping a little glob of sick straight into her lap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s it. You\u0027re going for a bath.\u201D She sniffed under her own arm. \u201CActually, we\u0027re both going for a bath.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe took Sasha back upstairs and took the baby bath seat out of the bath, then put Sasha in the bath seat and turned the taps on. While it was running, she went back downstairs and tried to clean up the mess quickly before it soaked into the carpet. A sound from upstairs made her almost literally fly back to the bathroom, taking the stairs three at a time, but it was just a bottle of shampoo that had slipped and fallen into the bath. She glowered at it as she put it back on the shelf under the shower and it immediately fell back into the bath again. This was clearly not going to be her day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe peeled Sasha\u0027s soiled top off and dumped it in the washing basket before stripping off her sicked-on pyjamas and adding them to the basket as well. The bath was shin-deep by this point and not too hot so she picked up the baby bath seat and put it in the bath; Sasha\u0027s face was almost comically shocked when she touched the water, but seconds later she was happily splashing her hands in the water with a big grin on her face. Then she burped another little sick glob into the water and Tina remembered what you were supposed to do with a baby after feeding them. Fortunately the sick glob stayed together in a lightly congealed lump so she scooped it out with a little plastic cup and dumped it in the toilet, then draped a towel over her shoulder, picked Sasha up and put her on her shoulder and started patting her on the back to get her to burp up the air she had swallowed. And then remembered why she had run the bath in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI bet if they went into Sex-Ed classes with some babies and said: \u0027Last week we told you how babies are made; this week you find out the things that babies make. Here are some babies, their lunch just went in the top end and their breakfast just came out the bottom end; deal with them.\u0027 they could end teenage pregnancies overnight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha demonstrated both of those things at the same time and seemed quite startled by it. Tina sighed, deployed the cup and dumped its contents in the toilet again. She put Sasha back into the bath seat and tried to wash the cup out in the sink with some soap before giving up and switching the shower on at low power and low heat. At first Sasha didn\u0027t really know what to make of it, but she quickly decided it was fine and went back to happily splashing around while Tina scrubbed her clean with a soft sponge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce Sasha was clean, she turned her attention to herself and turned the shower up to a more reasonable temperature and pressure. Five minutes later she was (reasonably) clean, turned off the shower and grabbed a towel off the towel rail, completely forgetting that it was heated and burning her fingers before snatching them away with a yelp. She held them under the tap and ran cold water over them, grumbling the whole time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is your fault, Sasha.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha looked up at her blankly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I didn\u0027t have to mess around dealing with you, I could have had a shower and be downstairs eating breakfast by now. I blame you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha thought for a moment, then responded with \u201CBuh.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLess of that language, young lady!\u201D She pulled the plug out to drain the bath. Sasha squawked in protest as the water drained away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou weren\u0027t even supposed to be having a bath until this evening, so stop complaining! And don\u0027t give me those big, sad eyes and that wobbly lip either, it won\u0027t work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha looked up at her with big, sad eyes, lower lip trembling slightly. \u003Cem\u003EYou cold, heartless monster, \u003C/em\u003Ethey said, \u003Cem\u003Ehow could you do such a terrible thing to a poor little baby?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI told you, it won\u0027t work. No matter how cute you look... No.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took another ten minutes to get them both dried and dressed, mostly because Sasha kept wriggling and squirming, pulling her arms and legs out of the little pink onesie as soon as Tina got them in before she eventually resorted to the trick Mum had shown her earlier, stroking the back of Sasha\u0027s head to make her go limp and then shoving all her limbs into place and fastening the buttons as fast as she could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight then, the plan is: breakfast, then a nice walk down to the park. The weather forecast said it should be nice and sunny today.\u201D She looked out the window just as a huge bolt of lightning lit up the sky, almost immediately followed by a tremendous thunderclap that made both of them jump; rain and occasional hailstones were coming down almost sideways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn the other hand, I never trusted the forecasts anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to eat breakfast and hold a baby at the same time was nearly impossible so she stuck Sasha in her little springy chair thing (was it called a baby bouncer, or was that the thing that hung under the door?) and sat that beside her while she ate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBreakfast, check; walk in the park, cancelled. Ooh, I know what we\u0027ll do!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe found the baby carrier thingy that vaguely resembled a backpack, only it could also be worn on your front, and rather than being a bag it held a baby instead. A brief and one-sided struggle later Sasha\u0027s flailing limbs were inserted into the right holes and the straps were secured so she could see where they were going without any risk of falling out or straining her neck, which still wasn\u0027t strong enough to support the weight of her head for more than a minute or so. They headed upstairs to Tina\u0027s room and she switched on her computer, then loaded up Terrin Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPay attention- stop eating your own fingers, you just had breakfast! This is Terrin Space Program, and it\u0027s essentially what I\u0027m going to be doing in a few years but easier, because it\u0027s a game. Those weird little orange creatures with their weird little heads are Terrins, and they live on that nice planet there called Terr. Now if you just wait a little while for the save game to load up... And then we go to the Tracking Station... Tada! That\u0027s Terr, with its little Mun called Moen and the little Minmus called Minimun- very imaginative... They\u0027re about a third of the size of the real Kerbolar system to make the game a bit easier than real life. Over here, this pretty purple one is Venis, the little brown one there is Murcrey, that red one there is Mors and the big green one here is Joviter. Then there\u0027s Plootu, Seerees and that little thing there is Hayley and it\u0027s a comet, not a planet, so it has a pretty tail behind it, see?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027, Times, serif;\u0022\u003E[04:46] EssKayEss \u2013 Hey Tee, you\u0027re here early.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s just someone else on the server saying hi.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027, Times, serif;\u0022\u003E[04:46] WeeTeeKay \u2013 Hey SKS.

They were also both huge TSP fans and after discovering that Tina had launched a home-made rocket into space (which was technically true) SKS had invited her to a private server; initially sceptical of the dodgy email she hadn\u0027t responded, until he had name-checked her on a live stream and she knew it was genuine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also turned out that TLK was a decidedly mediocre TSP player when he wasn\u0027t using it to demonstrate some obscure rocketry principle, which was a continuous source of amusement for everyone else on the TSP server; his habit of blaming every mishap on \u0027kraken attacks\u0027 a.k.a. game glitches, rather than poor construction and piloting, only made it funnier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe switched over to the game\u0027s modelling and development systems where a nearly finished DAGGER Mk5 was waiting for a final coat of paint and detailing work before it was ready to be unleashed on the unsuspecting Terrinauts. The game used parts at a 40% scale compared to real life, so the 0.625m DAGGER could have been scaled down to 0.25m, but she chose to go for 0.5m instead as it was closer to reality (and because it made the integrated fuel tanks have enough fuel to work for more than ten seconds) and had adjusted the thrust and weight accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mk5\u00A0was pure fantasy, a hypersonic version with a ramjet ring around the outside and a variable geometry shock cone inlet for use on spaceplanes, which was slightly superfluous since orbital velocity on Terr was a mere 2400m/s and the plain old DAGGER Mk2 could fly itself into orbit and back again using the same configuration that had just crept over the K\u00E9rm\u00E1n line at Darude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr at least, it did when she switched on the \u0027infinite power\u0027 cheat because she forgot to put solar panels on it and the battery ran out.

In the end, she decided to catch\u00A0 up on that story she had found online about how the entire Space Program was just a cover to save the world from marauding magic trees by planting them on Duna, or something like that- she still hadn\u0027t quite figured it all out yet- but there weren\u0027t any new chapters out since yesterday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer phone let out a loud PING and Sasha stirred; a bit of shushing later she was asleep again and Tina switched the phone to silent mode before checking the message.

She already knew that English was going to be her biggest weakness, wasn\u0027t expecting any better than a 3 but would be more than happy to scrape a 2, and she was only sitting six exams total: a 3 in Geography would scupper her chances of getting into Rising Stars that year and push her into a much more competitive field the next year with all the other school leavers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Trebuchet MS\u0027, Helvetica, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EWhat!?

Now comprehensively panicking, she ran through to her own room and found the empty baby carrier, but no baby; in the bathroom, an empty baby bath but no baby; she tripped and almost fell down the stairs before bursting through the door to the lounge-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, look who just woke up,\u201D said Aunt Linley, more to Sasha than to her. Tina collapsed onto the couch in relief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen did you get here?\u201D She asked, slightly out of breath and talking faster than usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout twenty minutes ago. I tried the bell but you didn\u0027t answer, so I used the spare key to the back door. You looked like you needed that nap so I just left you to sleep.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwenty minutes?

Aaaaand now it\u0027s weird again. OW! How can your nails be that small but that sharp?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSasha responded with another moist, squelchy sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf this goes up to your neck again I am NOT dealing with it.\u201D She looked over to Linley. \u201CDid Mum ever do this with you when you were a baby?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe was three when I was born, so no. And don\u0027t you go complaining about the old \u0027fizzy nappy\u0027 either- there was one time you did one so bad your mum actually had to cut your hair because it had dried in.\u201D Tina turned a shade greener and looked down warily at the little biological weapon in her arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of minutes later Sasha started squirming and crying for no obvious reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust a bit of air stuck in her stomach, she\u0027ll be fine once you\u0027ve winded her.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina put Sasha over her shoulder and started patting her back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou might want this,\u201D Linley suggested, holding out the vomit-catching blanket thingy (she really needed to find out what all these baby-related things were actually called!), but when Tina moved Sasha off her shoulder to put the blanket over it she immediately projectiled half of what she had just eaten all over her; some of it went down the neck of her top too, yuk!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSasha! I liked that top!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027ll wash out,\u201D Linley reassured her. \u201CNobody ever said looking after a baby was glamorous, and what\u0027s a little vomit between family, eh?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina gladly handed Sasha over then went upstairs to get a fresh top, one that was old and she didn\u0027t like much in case Sasha decided to share any more bodily fluids. She peeled off the old one (carefully, to avoid smearing baby sick over her face), mopped up the rest with the towel she had used earlier then pulled the fresh top over her head with some difficulty as the elastic was old and didn\u0027t stretch as much as it should have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the bitter struggle between Kerbal and T-shirt her phone came loose from her pocket and clattered to the floor. She noticed that she had four new emails since the last time she had checked and opened them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first was from the exam board with her grades for Chemistry (1), Physics (1) and English (3); a good start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second was also from the exam board and contained her grades for Maths (1) and Metalwork (level A, grade 1- the teacher had bumped her up to the level A class after finding out about her Science Fair project and she had risen to the challenge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third was from the exam board too and had her grade for Geography... She could barely read the screen because her hands were shaking but eventually she held it still enough that she could see the grade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA strange, high-pitched eeeeeeeeee sound started leaking out of her throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final email had come from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s public outreach department and contained confirmations of both her acceptance into the Rising Stars program and award of the Kanopus scholarship covering the full entry fee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eeeeeeeee became an EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and she flew downstairs without even touching the ground just as the front door opened and her parents returned, Dad\u0027s left hand heavily bandaged. She tried to tell them what had happened but the only sound she could make was EEEEEEEEEEEEE so she handed them her phone so they could read the emails while she grabbed Sasha and cavorted round the room with her (still going EEEEEEEEEEEE) until Sasha\u0027s eyes were spinning in different directions and the adults were looking concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally she managed to string together a coherent sentence.

How could NOBODY know what the argument of periapsis was, and why did it take nearly a whole day for the lecturer to explain it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make matters worse, most of her classmates would leave at the end of the day and spend their evenings in the common room playing games, drinking and generally causing a ruckus instead of actually trying to learn anything. Her new room-mate Megan wasn\u2019t much better, posting incessant updates on every social media network there was and staying up into the small hours replying to comments and counting her \u2018likes\u2019, but at least she seemed competent enough at the theory of space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn day 9, she finally snapped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hapless fool who had been called on to write the rocket equation on the board had produced something that looked like a scientific calculator had exploded, with a lot of crossing out and arrows pointing in every direction.

I\u0027ve seen people describe orbital mechanics better in five minutes than you did in five hours.

The time it took to get back to her room was a blur, but she remembered slamming the door hard enough to make the walls shake and to rattle her picture frame off its hook. She picked up the frame and was going to throw it across the room but realised what it was- the old, slightly faded Valentina name badge and Jeb\u2019s IOU from after that dramatic Dynawing landing all those years ago, complete with a picture of her with the four astronauts taken on her phone moments before its destruction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe could remember how incredible that day had been, how desperately she had wanted to follow in their illustrious footsteps, but the reality was rather different. Her anger gave way to a sense of hopelessness and she curled up on her bed and cried bitterly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u2019t know how long it had been but eventually someone knocked on the door. Probably Megan wanting into their room, or else it was another classmate with some spiteful comment; either way she didn\u2019t want to see them and shouted \u201CGo away!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was surprised when they knocked again, more insistently than before, so she went over and peered through the peep-hole. It wasn\u2019t Megan, or another classmate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Val.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe opened the door and Val walked in, pulled out a chair and sat down, but said nothing.

I feel like I\u2019m stuck in a class a year below where I should be where nobody else knows anything at all about space or spacecraft. I know people who would sell kidneys to get into this program but these morons just goof around in the classes and get drunk every night instead of trying to learn anything. They have such a privilege being here and they don\u2019t...\u201D She groped for the right word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey don\u2019t respect it, treat it like it\u2019s all a big joke. This is astronaut training, not some college frat party!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u2019t realise she was shouting until she heard her voice echo slightly off the walls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI feel like there\u2019s a problem with everyone else, which makes me afraid that the real problem is with me. What do I do?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you keep going like this, you will eventually fail.\u201D There was no condemnation in Val\u2019s voice, which made the words hit home even harder. \u201CNobody can learn everything, and when you finally reach the point when there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand, they will remember how you acted now when they needed help and will respond in kind. Unless you change your attitude towards them, you will inevitably fail and drop out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut how? How can I get through to them if they don\u2019t\u003Cem\u003E listen\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can start by apologising to them. Some will accept it, some won\u2019t, but that\u2019s up to them. If whoever you\u2019re sitting beside is struggling, offer to help them and take the time to explain the problem until they understand it. Not everyone builds suborbital rockets in their garden; for some of them all of this is brand new information. You have an advantage here, use it to build them up not knock them down. If they choose not to engage with you then that\u2019s on them, not you. Space is not a solo occupation and you will end up working with people you dislike or disagree with, but learning to work with them is absolutely vital because in space even an minor mishap can be fatal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike Jeb?\u201D Tina asked and Val laughed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet. We may have our differences, but there\u2019s nobody I\u2019d rather have in that pod or cockpit beside me when things go wrong.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Val.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t mention it. You\u2019re not the first Cadet who had difficulty adapting and you won\u2019t be the last.\u201D She looked around as if to check nobody was listening in before leaning in close and speaking just above a whisper. \u201CJust between us, when we first set up out here I wasn\u2019t much older than you are. I was an exchange student barely off the plane when I got sent out to this patch of nowhere, and for the first five days I cried like a baby every night from homesickness.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReally?\u0022\u00A0Tina was surprised, but hearing that even the great Valentina had struggled at first was also strangely comforting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt takes a while to settle in when you first move away from home. You will feel lonely and you will feel homesick, those are normal emotions so don\u2019t worry too much about it. Phone home as often as you like, even if it\u2019s just to check in and you have nothing in particular to say, it can do a lot for your mood.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone knocked on the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s probably Megan, my room-mate.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, now\u2019s your chance to apologise to her. Think of it as a prototype apology before deploying it to the whole class.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat am I meant to say?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBe honest, don\u2019t make excuses and don\u2019t try to blame someone else. And above all, don\u2019t apologise unless you actually mean it. An insincere apology will only make things worse.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second, more insistent knock came from the door. Val stood up and headed over towards the door, then turned back to face Tina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd one more thing- fix that frame.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFix it how?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIsn\u2019t it obvious? You have Jeb\u2019s note above my name badge! So much for me being your \u2018favourite astronaut\u2019.\u201D Val aimed an exaggerated scowl at her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I put the badge above the note it just slides down behind it!\u201D Tina protested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPah. You expect me to believe that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal opened the door, still looking back into the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u2019t Megan at the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was several large tins of paint, raided from a store cupboard and swung in synchronised arcs to empty their contents on whoever opened the door. Apart from one which decided it wasn\u2019t giving up its contents so easily and kept going, minus handle, and smacked into Val\u2019s left elbow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the paint also hit her, but some missed and spattered Megan\u2019s bed or the floor beside it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0paint slingers let out a raucous cheer before walking unsteadily away, dishing out back slaps and high fives and making a racket, leaving a trail of paint spots on the carpet behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHEY!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of them turned round and replied \u201CHa! We got you g-\u003Cem\u003Euuurk\u003C/em\u003E!\u201D The rest turned round as well and saw Val, one side covered in paint and a murderous look on her face, and ran. And tripped over each other, and the paint pots, and each other again, disappearing into a fire escape with a trail of painted footprints behind them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI take it back.\u201D Val said, holding the door handle like she was trying to strangle it. \u201CThose morons have got to go. Yesterday.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe came back into the room, wincing and wiggling her left hand as if it had pins and needles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAargh, pins and needles. Can I borrow your shower?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina was still too shocked to reply beyond a small nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal went into the bathroom and closed the door. Tina heard the shower start, then a continuous stream of muttering; she couldn\u2019t make it all out, but what she could hear made blush brightly. When Val has said she knew a lot of swear words, she wasn\u2019t kidding!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone knocked on the door. Wary of a second attack, Tina checked the peep-hole to see who was outside, then unlocked the door when she saw it was Megan. Who took one look at her paint-spattered bed and turned to Tina with a face like thunder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat did you do!?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201D Tina protested. \u201CThose morons tried to get me with tins of paint when I opened the door, but they got Val instead so they all ran off-\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal? As in the Val? Why was she here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo tell me I\u2019m an idiot and to stop being an idiot or I\u2019ll never get to space. Then they threw paint over her and she went in there.\u201D She pointed to the bathroom door just as it opened and Val poked her head out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI need more towels.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMegan just stood and stared, so Tina had to get more towels from a box under Megan\u2019s bed and hand them through the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought you were kidding...\u201D Megan eventually said. \u201CIt really is Val and she\u2019s- wait, those were my towels!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina shrugged. Megan threw a pillow at her face and missed; Tina threw one back and didn\u2019t miss. Megan retaliated with a towel that unfolded in midair and covered Tina\u2019s head, then tried to press the advantage but slipped on the wet paint on the carpet and they both collapsed in a heap on Tina\u2019s bed laughing. Until Val stuck her head out again and cleared her throat loudly, making them leap apart while looking anywhere but at each other and both blushing furiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMegan, is it? I need to borrow some clothes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with her clothes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s too small, you look about my size. I\u2019ll get them back to you shortly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMegan opened a drawer and removed a small stack of clothes, neatly prepared for the next day, then handed them over and said \u201CI thought you said she was the shorty.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTina stuck her tongue out at her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMegan pulled the paint-spattered bedding off her bed and carried it off to find a replacement set while Tina fought to keep the spill on the carpet contained but eventually had to give up as the fumes were making her light-headed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal emerged from the bathroom with her injured arm still inside the T-shirt and a pained look on her face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSomething\u0027s definitely not right, I\u0027m going to head down to the medical bay and are you OK you look very pale maybe you should soigf rewnfr asv hhkf igisd-\u201D the floor suddenly flipped sideways and everything went very fuzzy; the next thing she could remember was lying in a bed in the medical bay with a familiar looking young doctor shining a light into her eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLewis- no, Lewwise- was talking to her but it took a few seconds for the words to start making sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...no signs of concussion, responding to stimuli-\u201D He ran something sharp and spiky over the top of her hand and she snatched it away and glowered at him- \u201Cso I reckon it\u0027s probably just the paint fumes.

To him I was just an object to act out all his twisted and depraved fantasies on, and he enjoyed making every day of my life more miserable than the last. The only thing that made life bearable was the idea that some day I could escape and join the Space Program. I hacked the computer- the password was password123- and set up a secret admin account he couldn\u0027t access then while he was out working I read everything I could find online about rockets, planes, spaceships and anything remotely related to going to Duna; he never caught me using it but there were a few close calls.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHe wanted a son to continue the family bloodline- because a mere girl just wouldn\u0027t do- and he was so happy when he found out I was expecting.

Then it happened again, and again, and again- six times in three years, that I know of- and each time it happened the violence got worse. The doctor said stress was making it worse, but how could I \u003C/em\u003Enot \u003Cem\u003Ebe stressed knowing what had happened before and what \u0027he\u0027 would do to me when it happened again?

The doctor came round and everything was fine, he did the scan and there it was, that tiny little smudge that was a tiny little person growing inside me.

It was only after we were gone that I realised I was hit and losing blood fast. I told the doctor to take the baby away, as far away as possible, and to never tell anyone where she went. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital two days later and being told they had done a hysterectomy to save my life. As soon as \u0027he\u0027 found out what that meant- no more babies, ever- \u0027he\u0027 just turned and walked away and I never saw \u0027him\u0027 again.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIt was a big hospital in a big city so pretty soon someone put the pieces together and realised what had happened to me. I got bounced between a few places until one day I just left, took any train or bus I could find towards the Space Centre and finally turned up here with nothing but the clothes I was wearing and told them I was four years older than I was, and they believed it. I could barely believe it- no ID, no qualifications, no experience but just like that, I was in the Space Program like I had always wanted to be.

Tina, Carrie and Derrek were all crying and even the usually stoic Gene was struggling to hold back the tears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHave you told anyone about this before?\u201D Carrie broke the silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy would I tell anyone?\u201D Val whispered back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou don\u0027t have to suffer in silence or carry this terrible burden by yourself. I think you\u0027d gain a lot from proper counselling.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t need a shrink!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou gave away your only child; that alone would get you three munths of grief counselling, never mind everything else that happened to you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt might not be the only one, though,\u201D Derrek interjected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYour tests are wrong. I can\u0027t- I physically can\u0027t-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot necessarily. You\u0027ve been launched into space more than any other woman alive, pulled more G-forces and spent more time in microgravity too. It\u0027s not a stretch to say something could have shaken loose inside you and if that happened and the results are accurate, your life could be in danger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u0027s right.\u201D Carrie agreed. \u201CIf that little embryo has latched onto the wrong place, it could cause all sorts of complications even in someone who still had all the components in place. We need to be sure one way or the other.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal nodded weakly, either recognising the logic or just too exhausted to argue any further. Derrek brought the ultrasound machine over and began the scan, although he was clearly having some difficulty with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe last time I did one of these was in med school, and that wasn\u0027t as recently as I like to think.\u201D He said as ghostly grey shapes moved across the scanner\u0027s screen forming weird monochrome blobs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere it is!\u201D Tina exclaimed suddenly and Derrek flinched, immediately losing the image. He tried to find the same angle again, angling the sensor in different directions-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere! Right there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerrek and Carrie squinted at the screen, seeing only smudges and smears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight...\u201D Tina leaned forwards and tapped the screen which produced a yellow box where she had touched it and which somehow stayed focussed on the blob despite the image moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow did you see that?\u201D Carrie asked her, realising she was right. \u201CAll I saw was a bunch of blobs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI saw my sister in one of these last year, a little peanut-looking thing with a tiny little heartbeat in the middle.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m getting old,\u201D Derrek sighed, rubbing his eyes with his free hand. \u201CI would never have spotted that.\u201D He flicked a switch on the scanner and it began making little tap tap tap noises in time with the fluttering pulse on the screen. Val was utterly transfixed by it, staring at the screen with a mix of wonder and terror on her face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat happens now?\u201D Gene asked. \u201CYou said there could be complications?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt can\u0027t ever grow enough to survive on its own. If we leave it there, it could start growing around blood vessels and nerves and that could potentially be fatal. We really don\u0027t have any other option than removing it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wordless cry of anguish escaped from Val\u0027s mouth as she curled back up and let out a series of choking sobs that shook her whole body. Tina hobbled to the other end of the bed and sat down before lifting Val\u0027s head and put it on her lap; Val responded by wrapping her arms around Tina\u0027s waist and clinging on tightly while Tina tried to comfort her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI saw a thing on the news a few weeks ago about some researchers who managed to transplant embryos into a surrogate mother. They were only doing it with lab rats but they said they wanted to start Kerbal trials soon.\u201D Tina said after a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI actually know one of the researchers involved in that study,\u201D Derrek responded. \u201CIf you give me five minutes, I can call him up and see how far they\u0027ve progressed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene looked at him and mouthed \u201CReally?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can\u0027t just do nothing,\u201D he replied, quietly enough that Val couldn\u0027t hear him. Gene nodded and Derrek left the room, pulling the ultrasound trolley with him. The entire time he was gone nobody said anything at all, each increasingly unwilling to break the silence as it grew longer and longer. It was almost a relief when Derrek returned and they all looked at him expectantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe said they\u0027ll do it. But- and this is a big but- he also said the odds of success are about 10% at best.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThose are some pretty long odds,\u201D said Gene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I was in space and something went horribly wrong, and you had a 10% chance of bringing me back alive by doing something but a 0% chance by doing nothing, would you take it?\u201D A small spark of the Val they all knew and loved had reappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene didn\u0027t even hesitate before responding with \u201CYes. Absolutely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen I have to try.

If you had asked me a few weeks ago, definitely, but we haven\u0027t even spoken to each other recently and I don\u0027t want to scare her off for good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you think she\u0027ll do it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf I told her what I just told you, maybe; or she\u0027d run away and never come back.
