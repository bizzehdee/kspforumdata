Their lander- the Penumbral Sunrise- had toppled on touchdown, a victim of a top-heavy design and a crater wall that was that little bit too steep. Oddly enough, despite this issue, Jonbald was absolutely adamant that they didn\u2019t need a rescue mission, merely a winch or hydraulic piston to right the stricken lander before they flew it back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonbald was either oblivious to the potential dangers of his plan or just trying to handwave them away through sheer force of personality, but in any case the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was all hands on deck to build and launch the necessary lander-pointer-upper before the Penumbral Sunrise\u2019s supplies ran out and doomed its crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeswell was one of many working through the night to get the rescue rocket ready for launch, perched on top of the launch escape tower to check the abort systems were ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrigger abort key one,\u201D she said into her walkie-talkie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u201CAbort key one, on.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E Replied Desford in Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA green light appeared on the panel in front of Jeswell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbort key one checks out.

With no hope of rescue, Jonbald decided that they would just have to push their lander around so it was pointing uphill, use the landing legs to bounce the nose up and then gun the engine at full power to try and clear the crater rim. Despite having no proper equipment to work with, somehow the crew managed to drag the spacecraft around, detach the legs and reattach them ready for \u201COperation Leapfrog\u201D before strapping themselves in for their only remaining chance of getting home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe legs functioned perfectly, propelling the spacecraft\u2019s nose up for launch, but when the engine fired it kept on pitching up until it did a backflip and pointed back down at the ground, slamming into the surface at unsurvivable speed. When the nose was bounced up, the entire weight of the lander had been pushed onto the engine at the back, pushing the engine gimbal all the way over to pitch up and jamming it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe public inquiry into the failure of the rescue mission uncovered a devastating truth: the faulty panel on the capsule that had caused the entire incident had been wired incorrectly; simply removing the panel would have immediately revealed this mistake, while fixing it would take less than a minute. This led to the development of what became known as the Bobak Doctrine- \u201Cless haste, more speed\u201D- that was adopted by a wide variety of organisations and companies worldwide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA number of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E employees including Desford were fired for gross misconduct in the wake of the inquiry, while Jeswell quit her job and become a nun with the Order of the Monoliths, crushed by the guilt of knowing that had she followed her instincts and stood up to her boss, those poor souls on the Penumbral Sunrise would probably have made it back alive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there are any typos in this then all I can say is I wrote it in about an hour and a half without proofreading, while down with a high fever and symptoms of a cold/flu/covid/other viral infection. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
