Although Edgur was perplexed, he wasn\u0027t scheduled to come home for another week but the big heads at the launch center wanted him home early, he was sad at first as the Kersolis Orbital Research Station had been his home for the past two months and he didn\u0027t want to see it go. He was lost in thought when he heard a loud WOMP and the sound of shearing metal Edgur quickly turned to the indicator lights and found he had no power to the rotation wheels, I can compensate for that he thought then all the emergency systems started going off in his ear. As Edgur hastily tried to figure out what was going on he glanced to his altimeter it read 200 meters.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Edgur woke up drenched in sweat as he laid there trying to figure out what he had dreamed about. He just couldn\u0027t remember he suddenly realized he was parched, he climbed out of bed and went to his fridge in his tiny dorm room at the K wing of the kerbalnaut complex at the BNK Industries Space and Aerospace Center (BNKISAC). Edgur knew these dreams had been going on for weeks it all started after his second rocket launch which had ended horribly and they were all the same. As he reached the fridge he grabbed a Tylonain Cocktail from the night before but as he realized by the pounding in his head he needed something else. Edgur walked over to the coffe pot and started brewing a pot of strong Kermbark brew as it was starting Edgur glanced at his clock it read 4:24. \u0022Might as well start my day\u0022 he thought as he thought this he remembered it was m\u00C3\u2026\u00C2\u00ABnday he had a briefing this morning with the engineers about an upcoming mission.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022Edgur wait up!\u0022 Edgur turned around as his crew member and best friend Greglan ran up to him. \u0022I just want to know if you knew anything about the briefing today, I heard it was about a mission to Duna.\u0022 \u0022 I don\u0027t know anymore than you do but I am intrigued about what it\u0027s about.\u0022 Edgur replied, as he sulked through the hallway Greglan looked at him puzzled. \u0022What\u0027s wrong with you, did you one of those dreams again?\u0022 \u0022Yeah there\u0027re really bugging me I just ca-\u0022 Edgur was cut off as a large explosion rocked the Kerbalnaut complex. \u0022Oh for the love of Kracken those engineers need to test those rockets before they launch them!\u0022 Edgur ranted as they both turned to the large window in the hallway, the watched as debris rained down on the lawn of the BNKISAC, then Greglan turned to Edgur and said \u0022How much do you wana to bet the capsule exploded? You\u0027re on we got 30 minutes anyway.\u0022 Then they both ran off towards Greglan\u0027s jeep then to the VAB.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Edgur felt good with the 20 Kerbbux in his pocket as when he and Greglan had gotten over to the VAB the capsule slammed into the ground and disintegrated, Greglan then reluctantly handed over the money. \u0022Kerm! The briefing we have to get to Vehicle System Check and Engine Testing!\u0022 (VSCET) Edgur and Greglan took off in the jeep before they were late. They burst in at the last minute, all heads turned towards them as they embarrassingly took their seats. \u0022As I was saying\u0022 said the executive producer \u0022I will be overseeing this project as our president is away on leave, now on with the presentation I will hand this over to our mission control director Greglan!\u0022 Greglan stepped up to the stand as applause swept through the audience. \u0022Thank you Ladies and Kerbalmen as you know our Gecko Surface Probe we sent to Eve recently arrived there well I can now tell you now that\u0022 Greglan paused for dramatic effect, \u0022 it landed safe and sound and sent back the first pictures of Eve\u0027s surface!\u0022 The crowd erupted into cheers, whistles and applause. \u0022Now please settle down I have more to tell you!\u0022 Gerglan had to shout to get his voice a-crossed to the crowd \u0022as I said there is more, the pictures the probe sent us were successfully recovered.\u0022 Greglan pressed a button and images of a barren purple landscape flashed onto a screen behind Greglan, also a bright purple sea came up this interested Edgur \u0022 This is peculiar I wonder what the composition of that sea is?\u0022 At that thought Edgur then raised his hand in which Greglan called on him. \u0022Yes umm Greglan do you know what that sea is made of.\u0022\u0022 Actuality Edgur when the probe sent back data it couldn\u0027t get a reading on the liquid in the sea.\u0022 Greglan then pulled up a graph on the screen it then showed an unreadable graph showing liquid makeup. \u0022Now I have one more thing to say before I\u0027m done, after seeing these images the President and his executives have decided that now...we plan a manned mission to Eve!\u0022 The crowd went berserk.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BNKirby","CreatedById":111072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T04:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is only the first of many posts and maybe I might add in some pics \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
