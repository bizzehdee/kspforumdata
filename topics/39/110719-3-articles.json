It\u0027s definitely one of the smarter things to have been developed / thought about. We can also blame manufacturers (I\u0027m looking at you Apple!) for designing obsolescence into their products. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it\u0027s come from a fear of litigation (spurred by the wave of crazy stuff in the USA) which is why they\u0027ve put in so many legal loop-holes about what can and cannot be done.\n\nThis is what has driven a good portion of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) laws here down-under. It\u0027s good, as a preventative (and keeps the business owners accountable) but it is a double-edged sword, as it overcomplicates things. Most would say that this legislation has been good in preventing accidents. \n\nOlder tech can still be bought via electronics surplus stores, or some waste transfer stations (aka. rubbish tips) actually have little \u0027thrift store\u0027 style huts where they sell off electronics and stuff that still works. \n\nI\u0027m pretty sure they sell it as \u0027untested\u0027 (similar to the way ebay does) but hey, it\u0027s one way of reusing.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Re-use is a GREAT way to keep old e-waste from contaminating the Earth, and gets us all cool parts to hack and salvage for Kerbal Space Program! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nApart from the game, and yes - keeping the contaminates away from the earth, I feel it\u0027s very important to minimise wasted resources; This tv works, so why acquire materials from the planet to go and make a newer one? The function is the same.\n\nIt\u0027s very difficult to convince people who have been brain-washed by the consumerist mind-set of this though :/"},{"CreatedByName":"Krewmember","CreatedById":144837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T17:39:46Z","Content":"I got the television mounted to the console.
