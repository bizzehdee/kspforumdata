(Go expectations, eh?)\u00A0I hope that this story has a lot of good response and an even better storyline. In writing, I hope that I\u0027m going to easily convey my new writing style for this story. I\u0027m planning for this story to be a lot more laid-back, relaxed, snarky, and (hopefully)\u00A0funny, compared to the war series\u0027s seriousness (Quick little note to the moderators- I\u0027m not going to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etry\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to break any rules, but if I do then I\u0027ll try to keep my fingers in check for the next chapter). The story\u0027s going to be first person (Another first for me), which will definitely be a big challenge for me.\u00A0Now note: This\u00A0\u003Cem style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0going to be written with\u00A0\u003Cem style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe Final Stand\u003C/em\u003E.

Don\u0027t worry, Thomply, our air racing epic, will be Part 2. This is by far my biggest challenge, I think. First Person, characters with... Character (Wordsmith is obviously not in the office at the moment), and what I hope will be my longest-lasting series yet, and most enjoyable to read and write.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nSo without further ado, I hope you enjoy this.

Back when you could run a 5-second 40 meter? Back in the day when you could jump up higher than 2 feet without breaking a bone? Back when you were a little kid? What\u2019s the word\u2026 Nostalgia. That\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling right now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Anyways, here I was, in Bahmuto City. The illustrious Bahmuto KPark. 15 turns, max speed in all-electric karts. Now let\u2019s backtrack a bit. I got into racing when I was like\u2026 5. The legends of Damon Kerman, Jason Kerman, and the almighty Enzo Kerman. Then, I eased myself into competitive stuff. And now, here I was at Bahmuto KPark about to compete for my first ever karting championship. Let me clarify for a second.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The \u201CBahmuto City Under 13 Karting Championship\u201D was a city-wide racing league. And it wasn\u2019t all in Bahmuto actually. In fact, one race went all the way to \u003Cem\u003EPort Vargo\u003C/em\u003E of all places! But anyways, that didn\u2019t change my thoughts on it. So here I was, preparing to race in the high-powered, super fast (By my standards) kart. Top speed of a blazing 22 meters a second, the karts were beasts to drive. And now it was time to race.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CReady?\u201D My friend Max asked as we got ready. \u201CAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201D I grabbed my helmet and Max grabbed his. Then, we did what we\u2019d done for the entire season, and knocked our helmets together. Now looking back on it, I realize how stupid we must have looked and I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead doing that now, but that was what the pros did back then, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna judge. Then, the announcement came up over the speaker system. \u201CAll drivers in the under 13 class, please report to the start line. All drivers, to the start line please.\u201D \u003Cem\u003EThis is it!\u003C/em\u003E Max and I both sprinted towards the grid, and now was the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0As I got in my kart, I looked up at the sky. It was a dreadfully cold and cloudy day, and just above Bahmuto\u2019s High School Football field, I saw the windmill blades ascending up and spearing into the low hanging clouds, before retreating back to where we could see them. A light mist was falling down, and I could feel little droplets falling onto my arms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I strapped myself in, and looked up at the portable bleachers that had been erected all over the track. Over the course of the season, we had gathered the attention of a few dedicated fans, but mostly there were parents in the stands. Also, some had gathered because they had nothing else better to do on a Saturday morning. And some had gathered for a much more important reason; at least for me. Up in the top step of the stands were 4 kerbals in nice, fancy tailored suits; too good to be just a normal parent or spectator. They held clipboards and stopwatches, and stared down at us like hawks waiting for a tasty meal. Yes, I knew who they were, though I hadn\u2019t heard anyone talk about them, nor heard their voices. They were the Scouts. And at the end of the day, a lucky few of us would go home with a ride in a K1 program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A05 laps into the 28-lapper and I had established domination by a landslide, already being out front by a full straightaway. Max was trailing (I think; I mean I couldn\u2019t see him), with my arch nemesis, Ricklen Kerman in hot pursuit. A quick word on Ricklen. He\u2019s snotty, arrogant, cares nothing for anyone but himself, a dirty racer, and cocky. Max and I both hated him with a passion, but fortunately he had taken himself out of contention for the title last week by binning the kart into a wall on the warmup lap. Now, it was down to me and Max.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I was cruising along, minding my own business, when I hit the 1/4th mark. Each lap was incredibly short; only about 30 or 45 seconds, and I grinned beneath my helmet. Max and I made a pact with each other at the start of the season that at the 1/4th mark, we\u2019d punch it and start blazing. I took myself out of my normal driving mode, and began setting hot lap after hot lap; getting more and more confident at my abilities. Before long, I had caught up to the slower bunch; the back-markers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I flew clean around the outside of one of them, and then filed into line behind the rest of the pack. At the end of the lap, however, disaster struck. One of the markers about 3 or 4 in front of me gently kissed the grass with the left side wheel. He yanked the wheel hard, and sure enough, he spun right in front of me. Just my luck. The spinning cart was slammed in the left rear by the kart in front of me, and I dove to the right hand side in an attempt to avoid the crash. A kart spun across the road in front of me, and I slammed the brakes in a desperate attempt to stop the kart. The other kart in front of me went off into the grass, and I gunned it; shooting ahead and leaving the wreck behind me. As I looked to the left, I realized that not only had the yellow flag come out, but the Scouts were furiously writing notes down on their clipboard and talking among themselves quicker than a hive of bees.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The red flag was called, and 5 minutes later I was describing my experience to Max over a styrofoam cup of lemonade. Just as I got to the good part, Ricklen came over. \u201CHey there. Fancy seeing you out here.\u201D Ricklen crossed his arms and smiled a sickly, evil looking grin. \u201CThought you\u2019d be off partying.\u201D As always, never changing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnd I\u2019d thought you\u2019d have been in that wreck back there,\u201D I retorted. \u201CYour survival and dodging skills are worse than a tree I\u0027m the middle of a wood farm.\u201D Max covered his mouth to keep from laughing, but his smile was still visible. \u201CApply cold water to burned area,\u201D He chuckled, making Ricklen\u2019s face redden. \u201CYou\u2019ll see,\u201D He muttered as he went back to his kart. \u201CYou\u2019ll see.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E5 years later\u2026\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHurry up, you\u2019re gonna be late!\u201D Mom shouted at me from the front door.

We were in River City, Owlia for the K1 trials. It was a huge gamble, but I hoped that somehow it would all work out okay. \u201CGot your lucky hat?\u201D Mom asked. \u201CYup. And my lucky watch.. Hopefully it\u2019ll work\u2026\u201D I absentmindedly rubbed the face, and remembered.. Dad had given it to me as a present.. It was the last time I had seen him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0We rolled up to the building, and I felt my breath catch a bit. The elaborate glass and marble building was a large, modern structure. A huge K1 logo was plastered on the door, the window, and just about every surface that could identify them. A loud noise blasted past, and I saw the 2035 Test Cars shooting past, their figures a blur as they went down the straight. We walked in, and I saw the waiting room. It was as extravagant as it had looked on the website. Fancy, luxurious couches, a massive hall, and overall glorious features. \u201CWow..\u201D We walked towards the desk, where a receptionist was hurriedly typing away.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUm.. hi, my name\u2019s Jebediah Kerman; I\u2019m here for the Young Drivers Test?\u201D The receptionist looked up and smiled at me. \u201CDown that hall, third door on the right. Ask for Andy.\u201D She handed me a pass. \u201CGood luck.\u201D I walked to the door, and went in. The room was an office, and a young-looking kerbal was checking his computer for notes and chatting away on his phone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell I don\u2019t care if he wants to or not, what did he say about the money? Mmhmm. Uh huh. Fine. Just.. Offer him a bonus. But if he says no, make sure to call Alexis. Oh she\u2019s on the way? How long? Really? Great; cancel the contract, he doesn\u2019t seem interested anyways. \u003Cem\u003EGracie\u003C/em\u003E. Uh huh. Yeah, let him represent someone else; Jeb doesn\u2019t need him. Yeah. Thanks. \u003Cem\u003ECaio\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D He clicked off the phone and looked me straight in the eye. Then, he stood up, and walked over to me. \u201CAndy Kerman. Chief Engineer. How are you?\u201D He escorted me to a chair. Without waiting for a reply, he soldiered on. \u201CMy job- if everything works out that is- is going to be to get you the car and setup you need to win races. Also, I\u2019m kind of like the crew\u2019s representative to you, the driver. Same goes for driver-to-team. If you\u2019re uncomfortable, we\u2019re uncomfortable.\u201D I smiled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCan\u2019t wait,\u201D I said as I rubbed my hands together. \u201CSo who\u2019s Alexis?\u201D Right then, the door opened, and I turned. There was an incredible figure standing in the doorway, wearing a dark grey dress. Her hair was chestnut brown, and tiny auburn highlights streaked through. She looked powerful, but also delicate. I got the feeling that if I stood up, she\u2019d be about 3 or 4 inches shorter than me. From what I guessed, she couldn\u2019t have been more than 20; maybe 19 at most. Her face was beautiful; smooth skin with a smile that seemed to light up the room. She began walking towards us.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlexis Kerman,\u201D She said, walking over to Andy. \u201CSuperstar Talent.\u201D Andy stood up and shook her hand. \u201CPleasure to meet you, madame,\u201D Andy replied with an equally huge smile. She turned to me and I stood up. Just as I thought, about 3 inches taller. Probably 3 and a half. \u201CSo. You\u2019re my new client, eh?\u201D She seemed to be sizing me up. \u201CUh.. Yes ma\u2019am. Jebediah Kerman. And you are\u2026?\u201D She pulled out a tiny business card. \u201CYour new Agent. If what everyone\u2019s saying about you is true, you\u2019re going to be really hot on the market. And that\u2019s where I come in. World Championship-caliber drivers don\u2019t handle their own affairs by themselves. The Agent is the one who handles all the\u2026 \u2018Behind-the-scenes\u2019 bits. Contract offers, news, sponsors; all that\u2019s going to come through me. Of course, a win or two wouldn\u2019t make my job any more difficult, after all. I handle you off-track, and you handle the on-track. Sound good?\u201D She didn\u2019t appear breathless in the slightest, while if \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E had tried that, I would be passed out on the floor wheezing for air. Very good first impressions. \u201CSounds great,\u201D I grinned in reply. \u201CSo.

Jeb, you got a copy?\u201D I jumped a bit in my seat. \u201CUh.. I\u2019ve got a copy. Could you maybe turn down the volume? Or take the mic out of your throat?\u201D Andy chuckled and asked \u201CBetter?\u201D I nodded and gave the thumbs up. \u201CGood. So we\u2019ve got to start up the engine. First test the transmission to make sure everything\u2019s running smoothly.\u201D I flipped the car up into first gear, and then back down. \u201CAlright, everything\u2019s ready. You can go ahead and pull out.\u201D This was it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The jack lowered the car down, and I saw the wheels go up a bit as the suspension settled, and Chris, the lead mechanic, went out to check if the pits were clear. When he gave the go command, I exhaled. Then, I lightly eased onto the throttle, pushed in the clutch, and\u2026 The car stopped. I jammed the throttle, and the car lurched forward a bit, before shuddering to a halt. Chris shook his head, and Andy committed the almightiest of face palms I ever have seen (And probably ever will see). The guys pushed the car back, and I couldn\u2019t help but laughing underneath the helmet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell that went about as well as it could have,\u201D Alexis sighed as the team checked the car over to make sure I hadn\u2019t broken anything on my escapade. \u201CYou\u2019ve got to push the clutch in harder on the start. You accidentally activated AntiStall, and the car\u2019s computer didn\u2019t know you wanted to go. Okay?\u201D Andy lectured me as I was about to get in the car. \u201CUh\u2026 Where\u2019s the clutch?\u201D I asked pretty stupidly. He looked at me like I had just come from space. \u201CYou drive an \u003Cem\u003Eautomatic\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D He stressed automatic like you would say \u201CYou eat \u003Cem\u003Eshoes \u003C/em\u003Efor breakfast?!\u201D Which made me feel even more embarrassed. Imagine my horror when I confided in him \u201CI don\u2019t even drive.\u201D Now to this day, I\u2019m not even sure who was more embarrassed; me for admitting that or him for choosing to be my engineer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A015 minutes, 3 red faces, and 1 car tour later, I had found out where the stupid clutch was (Behind the steering wheel) and was heading out on track. \u201CAlright, remember the clutch this time. Pinch it as hard as you can; act like it\u2019s a really resilient clip that\u2019s not wanting to open up.\u201D Andy\u2019s analogies were among the greatest I\u2019ve ever heard in my many years of racing. I pushed in the clutch, and eased onto the gas. The engine began to howl; first low, then high, until finally it sounded like a horrible, anguished and angry hive of bees being chased by a vacuum was behind me. I released the clutch, and the car shot forward. I turned into the pit lane, and \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E missed the pit wall. Then, I hit the Pit Limiter button, and went off down the lane.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0As soon as I exited the pit lane, the car slammed me against my seat as it yowled and whooped down the track, my foot still planted on the gas. I felt the wind knocked out of me as I went forward, speed climbing. 40 meters per second. 50. 60. 70. 80. \u003Cem\u003E90\u003C/em\u003E. Then, I saw the brake boards coming up, and I slammed the brakes; sending up a massive cloud of smoke from the front tires as I went into the hairpin. I turned in neatly, just clipping the apex curbing. I slid onto the throttle, and the EPB helped me out a ton, allowing me to just blast out of the corner. The lap was really choppy as I got to grips with the\u2026 grip. I know this isn\u2019t really a problem most drivers face, but I was having trouble with the amounts of grip available from the car; it was insane!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Finally, after I had pulled into the pit lane, Andy crossed over the pit lane to talk to me. \u201CThat was really good Jeb,\u201D He said, giving me a smile. \u201CAs of now, you\u2019re top in the session. You\u2019ve got some places to improve, but with time, I thi-\u201C A car blasted past at full speed, drowning out everything and anything Andy was saying. I heard loud clapping in the garage next to me, and someone cheered. I looked over at the telemetry screen, and saw a new name on top of mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C1.

My foot rapid-fire tapped on the floor as I waited nervously for the call. The Young Drivers Test had ended 2 days ago. It was a clear fight between Me and Max, both of us dueling over both of the two days. I was a lot faster in the wet sessions (The series had soaked the track with sprinklers), and it felt good to hear praise from numerous teams. So far, MonsterGP, LakeFront Racing, TT Motorsports, and OTech Race Team had said they were \u201Cinterested\u201D in my future. Alexis was busy hashing out the contracts and deals, and hopefully she would call soon. Mom walked in and sat down next to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt\u2019s not going to ring if you keep staring at it,\u201D She said. I sighed and set it down next to me. \u201CThey\u2019re not calling. They\u2019re not going to call.\u201D I slammed my flat down on the floor, and fell back into the bed. \u201CYou know how the legendary Hannah Kerman started his racing career?\u201D Mom asked. I scoffed and laid back as she started talking about her role model. \u201CShe started out in the ISA as an undrafted rookie out of River City. No-one thought she could do anything. She was short, underrated, and not from a wealthy family. But she kept on fighting. And you know what happened?\u201D She turned to me to finish the story. \u201C5 titles, National Squad Selection, 257 Goals, 400 assists, and 7 International Competition Titles.\u201D Mom smiled. \u201CExactly. Just give it some time! They\u2019ll need you.\u201D As soon as she finished saying that, the phone began vibrating in my hand. \u201CSee?

I just got off the phone with some teams. 3 teams in fact.\u201D I gasped out loud. \u201CWh- Are you serious?!\u201D Alexis laughed. \u201COTech, MonsterGP, and LakeFront are all bidding for \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E to come race for them this season. I told each of them that you\u2019ll make your decision as soon as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNow, we\u2019ll go over the teams. First, we\u2019ve got LakeFront. They\u2019re fairly new, inexperienced, and they\u2019ve got a long fight ahead of them. They\u2019ll have a lot of struggles, being the back marker team for most-if not \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E- of the next few seasons. However, there isn\u2019t going to be much of a fight for a driving spot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNext, there\u2019s MonsterGP. Modern, fast, and they\u2019ve got an OTech Chassis. They\u2019ve got tons of funding, and don\u2019t tell everyone, but I think you\u2019d look amazing in that black and green firesuit. However, there might be a bit of competition for the driving spot, but if you can get there it\u2019ll be amazing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFinally, we\u2019ve got the best team in K1; OTech Race Team. This year, they\u2019re going with a high-downforce setup, and it looks like it will be another year of domination for the team. The only problem? It\u2019ll be like fighting through honey for the spot; Hard, but not impossible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSo? What\u2019ll it be? 3 teams, 3 great chances.\u201D I felt the seconds ticking mentally. 3 choices\u2026 I had wanted to drive for OTech since I was like 5. Monster though.. Promising deal.. And with LakeFront.. No competition, and I could build the car around me.. I turned to mom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlexis?\u201D Mom smiled. \u201COTech.

I\u2019ll let you know more soon!\u201D The phone clicked off, and I jumped up, punching the air in celebration. \u201CYES!

The engine sounded moody. Fast, but like it was peeved at being forced to be stuck at a dead halt. Outside the garage, the sky was equally moody, with white and dark grey hues rolling through the sky. It had been raining just 45 minutes ago, but now the track and the skies were relatively dry, so I could get underway for my \u201Caudition\u201D for the team.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CComm check.

I eased onto the gas and the car went forward much smoother than it had with the 77I/K1-30 Stock Chassis. Probably the Launch Assist, which lowered wheelspin and increased launching grip. \u201CAlright, so just run a couple banker laps; test your pace.\u201D I have always had a small problem. I don\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E banker laps. Every lap I do is all-out, all the time. I immediately set off on my run, which was going max speed. When I went through Turn 5, the fast, long corner, I felt so much more confident running the inside groove at max speed, my car\u2019s left wheels just kissing the apron. \u201COh boy this thing has grip!\u201D I jammed the gas and threw the car up into Rich, activating the third engine and giving me around 20 extra kilo-newtons of power to work with.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFeeling good,\u201D I said as I zoomed past the finish line to start the lap timer. Entering the Turn 1 and 2 complex for the first time felt amazing; the car responding to the simplest twitch of the steering wheel with unfailing confidence and stability. Then I lunged up into Turn 3, and as I was getting ready to go into Turn 4, another blue and white car came out of the pit lane right in front of me. \u201CYou can overtake Ricklen; go for the overtake if you can.\u201D \u003Cem\u003ERicklen?!\u003C/em\u003E I thought to myself. \u003Cem\u003EHow did he get a drive for OTech?!\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I punched the DRS button and got into his slipstream in an attempt to overtake. However, by the time I had hit 75 meters per second (About 175 miles an hour), I felt the rear beginning to lift up from the lack of downforce and the application of actual \u003Cem\u003Elift\u003C/em\u003E. I closed the flap and held back off Ricklen, keeping in his slipstream. After we got towards the end of the backstraight, I was right on Ricklen\u2019s rear. I lunged the car up the inside and felt the aero grip coming back to me as I made the move stick.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGreat job Jeb. Now full attack. Remember, you can use DRS everywhere; just don\u2019t take stupid risks, okay?\u201D After that notice, I was a speed demon, blasting into and out of every braking zone at max speed. However, I was locking up almost everywhere. Really sloppy. Finally, after so much trying, I set the absolute perfect lap. And then I went faster. And faster. Eventually, I had set 5 purple laps in a row with speed to spare. But then.. Then I made an absolute idiot of myself. I got too greedy; simple as that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0When I went through Turns 1 and 2, I kept my foot planted. DRS was still open, and I felt the rears losing grip. However, I kept in it, and straightened the wheel out just in time. \u201CThat was close,\u201D I breathed to myself as I went through the 90 degree turn of 3. Then it was off to 4, another 90 degree turn, and then into the super long 180 of Turn 5. It was like a super speedway that turn. 33 degrees of banking, max throttle, and top speeds of up to 190 miles per hour through the corner alone; the straight topped out at over 205! After my turn 1 and 2 escapade, I decided to do something stupid, that no K1 driver has ever accomplished; much less done it well. I opened the DRS at 160 miles per hour, on the fastest turn in K1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Quick physics lesson. DRS stands for \u201CDrag Reduction System\u201D. When activated properly, slots on the rear wing open up to remove airflow and drag on the car to increase top speed. Now see, that drag creates Grip. How? Well, the air is normally stationary. But with a K1 car, we\u2019re moving so fast that we\u2019re literally cutting through the air as we go. And when the still air contacts the wing parts, it creates lift. Well in K1, flaps are angled \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E to make the air shove us into the ground, and this action (or force) is called \u201CDownforce\u201D. But back to DRS. So when we activate DRS, those flaps that make the air push us down open up and reduce the airflow, sometimes creating lift, or \u003Cem\u003Enegative\u003C/em\u003E downforce. So when we open DRS, Downforce is reduced, and speed is increased. But when downforce is gone, rear grip is gone, making the rear end of the car much less stable. Basically, Drag = Grip, Drag = Slow. DRS makes it so Drag is lowered, and speed gets higher. Got it? Good. Now back to the session.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I opened up DRS mid-turn and immediately felt the rear losing grip. I squeezed the wheel tightly and straightened the wheel out as good as I can, sliding up the track. However, I was running out of track- \u003Cem\u003Efast\u003C/em\u003E. When I was just inches from the wall- throwing up old dust from who knows when- I twisted the wheel to cut back down. Now I\u0027m not sure what exactly happened there. My guess would be that the dirt and DRS combined just was a horrible mix. The rear picked up, and I heard loud squealing from behind me as I lost everything. I let go of the steering wheel as the car took control. The car slammed down onto the apron, whipping the steering wheel around and sending up sparks as I hit. White smoke enveloped the entire cockpit as I spun downwards; the noise from the tires becoming almost too much. The apron was stupidly bumpy; almost like going over dirt. Then, I hit the grass. I slammed into the wet grass at max speed, and dirt, mud, and green grass assaulted my visor. Loud rumbling shook the entire car as I slid over the grass, and finally it stopped. The engine had stalled out, and the car appeared to be jammed in the grass. White steam was hissing out of the rear side ports, and the steering wheel was saying I had temperature warnings from the radiator and MEU. If there\u2019s one thing all racing drivers dread, it\u2019s having to admit you screwed up to the team over the radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAh, yeah, I messed up. Tried to take too much out of the car. I.. I can\u2019t get out. Yeah. No dice.\u201D I punched the wheel and shut down the car, removing the steering wheel. And putting it on the top of the nose base, just above the top of the steering wheel. \u201CAlright. There\u2019s a car coming to pick you up. Any damage?\u201D Andy was incredibly down-to-kerbin about the whole situation. \u201CI think I screwed up the underbody; hit the apron pretty good, but I kept it out of the wall.\u201D I sat back and waited to get a ride back to the pit lane. That was the worst moment of my career, and it was only 1 week old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbinorbiter","CreatedById":172446,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-21T19:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223223851\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022167536\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221511191610\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarkOwl57\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/20/2017 at 3:26 PM, DarkOwl57 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this, I\u0027m thinking of Jeb as a mix of\u00A02009-2013 Vettel, and Daniel Ricciardo.

Up to the 3rd floor on the elevator and then 2 doors down.\u201D I swear her eyes never left the screen. \u201CCould you give me a hint on how I did?\u201D I asked. I didn\u2019t have to. Just then, Ricklen came sprinting down the hallway, with Claire, his engineer, following close behind. Then, he slid onto the white marble with his knees, looking like a pro soccer player just scored the game winning goal. His arms extended, and he shouted \u201CWOO HOOO!!!!!\u201D At the top of his lungs, his voice echoing off the walls of the building. Claire gave him a double high-five, and they celebrated in the lobby. That gave me all the info I needed. Feeling sick at my stomach, I trudged towards the elevator. Every inch I climbed, I felt like I was heading to my execution. I got to the door and heard angry shouting from behind it. Slowly, I opened. Alexis was absolutely berating Matty, Andy was trying to keep her from punching Matty in the face (While still shouting at him of course), and Matty was trying to explain himself. Then, Alexis saw me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb. Jeb, please. Trust me, I tried. We tried.\u201D I sat down next to them and acted like I didn\u2019t hear anything. \u201CWhat\u2019s up Matty?\u201D I asked. Matty sighed in relief that I wasn\u2019t going to light up on him. \u201COkay, so we\u2019ve got a problem. We\u2019ve got only 1 spot on the team available. And even though you\u2019ve got the pace\u2026 We\u2019ve decided to sign on Ricklen as the number 2 driver.\u201D After the showcase from Ricklen, I didn\u2019t expect any different. But still.. Formula? I\u2019d expected reserve and test driver at the least. \u201CWhy?\u201D I asked. \u201CHe set the fastest time of the test!\u201D Andy exclaimed. \u201CBut he wasn\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Econsistently\u003C/em\u003E fast, which is the problem,\u201D Matty explained. I sighed. \u201CSo.. what am I supposed to do now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWe\u2019ve got a seat open for you in the Formula K team. If you take it, you\u2019ll be driving the #13 car. We\u2019ve got a pretty good car for Formula, but you\u2019ll have some competition. If we think you\u2019re ready to come up, we\u2019ll take you back in. Basically, it\u2019s going to be like going out on loan.\u201D I nodded. \u201CJeb, remember that Monster and LakeFront still have their offers on the table,\u201D Alexis cautioned. \u201CYou can get out if you want.\u201D I considered my options. One one hand, I had the team that I\u2019d wanted to stay with my whole life.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFine. Formula it is then.\u201D Matty seemed happy that there wouldn\u2019t be any bloodshed (yet), and handed me the contract. Quick as a flash, Alexis snapped it up. She reviewed it, and after 10 minutes, she nodded. \u201CAre you sure you don\u2019t want to take the fallback option?\u201D She asked. I shook my head. \u201CWho knows. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to turn some heads in Formula. And anyways, it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201D I grabbed a pen and signed a very sharp and neat signature. My fate was sealed. Another kerbal who was keeping silent in the background walked up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHi. Paddy Kerman. Head boss for OTech GP. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy your stay with us; it\u2019s really nice. World class facilities, a great crew, and not to mention a lot of fun. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it. I\u2019ll expect you at 9:00 tomorrow morning to get a debrief on everything.\u201D He shook my hand, and sat down in a chair. We continued talking some more, before I finally stood up after what had seemed like forever. \u201CThank you Matty. We\u2019ll be getting on our way, I guess.\u201D We (Alexis, Andy, and I) all got up and walked out of the office. \u201CJeb?\u201D Matty said.

It skittered along the marble floor, and when I reached it, I picked it up. Somehow, it had no cracks. Ricklen walked up, looking smug. \u201CBetter kerb won?\u201D He extended his hand. Alexis hovered behind me, and Andy got right up next to my ear. \u201CDon\u2019t do something stupid you\u2019re going to regret,\u201D He warned in a whisper. I extended my hand and shook. \u201CGood luck,\u201D I replied to him, before going out. I went out to the bench, and sat down. Alexis and Andy came over and sat next to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt was a bluff,\u201D Alexis admitted. \u201CI had hoped that if I mentioned other teams, he might get worried and let you back\u2026\u201D I shook my head. \u201CIt\u2019s fine. I did it to myself. I just wanted it too much.\u201D I felt a tear squeeze out of my eye. \u201CThis just sucks!\u201D I leaped up and kicked the bench, making my foot bounce back.

The Formula test track was the exact same as the K1 test track- just smaller. I had so far had to wrench the wheel around 3 times to keep the thing from spiraling into a wall. The car was a lot slower (Only 40kN instead of 60), and the rear had so little grip it was almost like I didn\u2019t have a wing at all back there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGo easy for a couple laps!\u201D Andy cautioned over the radio. \u201CJust test your abilities before going full tilt the whole time.\u201D I responded by \u201Cdrifting\u201D (i.e. Doing a slide that dirt drivers would dream of) through the high speed left hander of Turn 12.

Remember, this is your first race; no need to go out and go for every gap.\u201D I nodded as Andy continued giving me advice. The first race of the season was always stressful for any driver; much less the first race of a career. The first corner in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was a massive cluster, and it tightened up so much into 2 that first-corner contact between someone was a given. \u201CFinishing goals?\u201D I asked. \u201CTop 8.

The crew was on either side of the walkway don to the paddock area, clapping for us and giving me high-fives as I passed. I had my firesuit on, and it felt muggy as summer in the desert with all that insulation. Before I went to the paddock, though, a reporter stopped me and Andy dead in our tracks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u2026KRN Report\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSo, Jeb, first career race for you.

I feel like this is going to be a good race.\u201D I put on my helmet and got in the car. \u201CComm check; Jeb, you good?\u201D I keyed the mic and did the standard test. \u201CAll systems looking good. Good luck.\u201D The engine\u2019s fired up and I could feel the deep pounding through my helmet. As we set out on the formation lap, I felt my heart rate jack up a couple notches. Heading into the Tempesta Chicane, I saw the infamous Wall of Champions. Then, behind the Wall sat thousands of spectators. Even on a good day, live viewership topped 100,000, but today you could feel the crowd before you saw it. They cheered as we passed and their voices bounced off the wall of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Instead of going through the most famous corner in K1- \u003Cem\u003EVelocidad\u003C/em\u003E- we passed by it on the cut-off road. I exhaled as I got ready. 20 laps. My first race. We went into Turn 19, and I pulled into the grid spot of 10th position. I waited for the other cars to roll in. Then, a green flag waved at the back of the grid. \u003Cem\u003EThis is it!!!\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0A single red light came on above us, and the engines revved up.

I prepared, and looked in my mirror.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The lights went out, and the front-straight crowd cheered as we got underway. I got a monster launch over the car in front of me, and I went up the middle of 2 cars. I managed to slip right between them, and into Turn 1 everything was looking good. I eased into the corner, and prepared for my corner exit. As I hit the gas however, disaster.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I got into the middle of the corner, and as soon as I straightened up, I heard and felt a huge \u003Cem\u003EBOOM!\u003C/em\u003E from behind me, and the car jumped up into the air sideways. When the car sat back down, I was sliding through the grass, and the nose pounded the outside wall for Turn 2. My front wing shattered off, and the front suspension was toast as the left front wheel was bent dead to the left. The steering wheel was twisted sideways, following the left front. I clicked the car into reverse, and turned out of the wall. The Safety Car drove past behind me, and I tried to follow it around. I went into first gear, and tried to drive away. The car was busted. The left front wheel was trying to spear me off into the outside wall, and the left rear was also bent left, making me crab along the circuit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAh, someone got me. Suspension\u2019s pretty bad\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s toast. Sorry guys.\u201D I turned off the track and shut the engine down. The car sounded about as sad as I was at the moment as the engine whined down. I unstrapped my harness and with great difficulty unclipped the HANS device from the seat, and removed the steering wheel. I stood up and kept my helmet on, not wanting to look at anyone. A marshal helped me up over the wall and 5 others came to push the car back behind the wall. I shook my head in disgust. This was supposed to be my first race. And already I was screwing up.

Now just remember to not be so aggressive on the start; that\u2019s what put us in that spot to begin with. Just stay smooth, stay calm, and stay confident. You\u2019ve got the pace, we saw that in Quali. We\u2019ve just got to keep you from getting ahead of yourself. Now. You\u2019re starting in second. We\u2019re running the aggressive strategy of the undercut. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to get a spot or two in the pits, but it\u2019ll mainly be up to you. Make sure to not overtake in the Industry Section; it\u2019s way too risky. If you do decide to ignore my advice, at least wait until Turn 13 or 14. That\u2019s where it\u2019s widest and the best opportunity to get up the inside. Sound good?\u201D I nodded as I fidgeted with my fingers. 25 laps. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was hard, but this\u2026. This track was insane. The final corner had a 1 meter high wall. \u003Cem\u003E1.

The rears gripped perfectly, and I shot into P1, leaving Max in the dust. Yes, Max. He\u2019d been picked up by MonsterGP, and I absolutely blasted him. By Turn 3, he was half a second back. I swear I could see his face, laughing through the helmet visor. Our rivalry was so on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0As I came out of the final corner, I felt the rears giving out. I did what I had been taught, and gently straightened out the wheel.

I was so far ahead, I couldn\u2019t even see Max in the mirrors anymore- even on the back straight. \u201CAlright Jeb, Lilly has just pulled into the pits; Lilly into the pits. Box this lap please; box this lap.\u201D I chucked the car up into Rich and prepared to get into the pits. There wasn\u2019t any real need to push; I had a huge lead with no-one anywhere in sight. It would come back to bite me. I dove down into Turn 14, and as soon as I hit the gas, the car shifted down into neutral. The engine whined down to a shuddering halt. \u003Cem\u003ENo\u2026\u003C/em\u003E I looked back in the mirror, and I saw billowing white smoke coming out the rear, and bright yellow flames licking at the rear wing.

Even EEP wouldn\u2019t work. I undid the harness and got out of the car, not even worrying about HANS. As soon as I stepped out of the car, I crouched down on the ground, stunned. A loose radio cable dangled out of my helmet, and I heard the other cars driving past.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I had lost again\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJeb!

Starting off today, Rookie Phenom Danny Kerman set a new IGL Record at the Masters, sinking in 3 hole-in-one\u2019s in a row, becoming the first ever to do so. \u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnd now, onto racing. We are hearing reports out of the OTech GP Team camp that young superstar Jebediah Kerman may be getting released from the program. Jebediah has failed to score more than 1 point this entire season, and in the greatest team in motorsports, that\u2019s a problem.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYeah, well I can see this, but at the same time, those 2 DNF\u2019s weren\u2019t his fault. The first race he just got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and in Port Vargo he was showing that he can get up to the front, before an electrical power malfunction that caused an engine failure. But in Grestin, he just didn\u2019t have it. He was way off the pace, and ended up finishing a full lap down, in a car that has won 5 straight titles in Formula K.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnd what, do you think, has caused this lack of pace?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI don\u2019t really know. Inexperience. Pressure. Maturity. He\u2019s driving for a top-level team, and he isn\u2019t driving like a top-level driver. I\u2019m just going to throw this out: Jebediah Kerman isn\u2019t ready; at least not yet. He\u2019s far too young, and in my honest opinion, I just think he\u2019s falling to the pressure too much.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell thank you Darrel.

EPB helped me to hold my grip, and I launched up the middle of 4 other cars, making it 5 wide on the widest straight in the IFR. I blasted through all 4 of them, and went way up to the outside of the track, preparing to enter Turn 1. When I entered the corner, I saw a puff of smoke up in front of me. Then, one car spun around and debris slid across the racing line. Then, a red car- I think Redwind Racing- flew right up the track. I slipped in between the spun car and the straight car, and found myself in P3 by the end of the second corner.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGreat start Jeb! Slow it down here; Safety Car\u2019s out, Safety Car out. Watch your delta here, and make sure not to overtake.\u201D I went down into Lean mix and pedaled the throttle, falling into line behind Car Number 33; Max Kerman. When the Safety Car came out, I decided to stay out, as did the other two ahead of me. \u201CAlright, so Wiley has retired. Lewis was spun, but he\u2019s alright for now we think. Let\u2019s buckle down and try to get this win.\u201D Easy enough. I smirked and weaved the car around as we got on the back-straight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The Safety Car dove into the pits, and I leaped at the chance. I flew past Max, who was caught napping. I flew clean around the outside, and managed to get straight in front of him heading into the first corner. \u201CYeehaw!\u201D I shouted as I passed. \u201CNice job, Jeb. Let\u2019s get P1.\u201D Heading into Turn 4, I attempted a move. The car locked up a bit, and I slid wide, allowing Max to get by up the inside. \u201CSorry. Locked up.\u201D I tried to get by Max but it was useless when we got into the S section. Owlia\u2019s S section was the most exhilarating and entertaining sections on the entire calendar; maybe even in the whole world. Max speed, loads of grip, elevation change from up to down to back up- it was tons of fun. Unfortunately, the cars are super twitchy through that bit of track, and trying to pass through there was all-but impossible. You\u2019d need guts, a good car, and nothing to lose to make that move work.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0After a lap of hanging behind Max, I decided to try one last move up the inside of Turn 1. The fronts looked like they were going to lock up, but thankfully they held. However, as I went up the inside, I had overcooked the entry and the rears were trying to slide up the track. I wiggled the wheel as I made the turn, and the crowd went insane as I drifted all the way through the corner- still just a couple inches from Max. Max managed to get the better exit (I mean he wasn\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Esideways\u003C/em\u003E, so that might have helped), and got away from me. \u201CAh, good try. Go ahead and hang back; we don\u2019t want to risk the tires too much.\u201D I shut off Rich revs and slotted into line, letting Max go by a couple hundred meters.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0On Lap 7, it was time to hit the pits. I came in fast, and just got the speed limit cleared before the line. The lane was busy, but there was only one car I cared about. Max. I pulled into the stall, and the team responded like they should. The tires flew off of the car with a single whirr, and then back on. Then, I waited until the fuel was put in. The second the jack dropped I was gone, tires squealing as I departed. I looked, and Max was still in the stall. He was having to wait for me! I went past him, grinning beneath my helmet. I exited out of the pit lane, and jammed the gas on exit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Now, Lap 18. I had made the tires last a good bit, but Max was right on my tail heading into the S. I went defensive into the left-hander, but he was full-on attacking. The crowd roared as Max flew around the outside of my car, and we went side-by-side through the corner. Just as he looked like he would get it done, a slight wiggle made him lose all the momentum he had gained, and I managed to swing around his outside through the right-hander of 6. Max was right on top of me the rest of the lap, but then\u2026 Oh, then. See, we were fighting for second place. First was long-gone to the tune of about 25 seconds. As we entered the final corner, the fans screamed, and the yellow flag came out through Sector 1. When I got through the corner, Max still trying to get past, I saw it. A huge cloud of white engine smoke obscuring the outside of Turn 1. \u201CThe leader\u2019s had an engine failure, repeat: The leader\u2019s had an engine failure; go for the win.\u201D Max and I dueled it out before we got to the Yellow Flag zone. It was so close between us, but I just edged him as my wheel turned yellow. We both slowed down, and then I saw the boards on the side of the track turn yellow and black. Safety Car. It was over. I had won.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0As I crossed the line on Lap 20, I stuck my arm up into the air in celebration, enjoying the moment. \u201CYES! WE DID IT!! WE WON!!\u201D I pumped my arm into the air again and again, and enjoyed the victory. This was the comeback.

How does that affect you heading into the title race?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell as a racing driver, you\u2019ve got to put that all out of your head. I mean outside of the car, you can be as scared or nervous as you want. You can be nervous about the track conditions, or the other drivers, or crashing out, or something on your car breaking and throwing you into a wall at 200 miles an hour. But once you put that helmet on, you can\u2019t think about that kind of stuff. All you\u2019ve got to focus on is the race, and how you\u2019re going to finish your race. I am a bit nervous to be honest with you, but again, once I put that helmet on and that engine fires, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m going to be nervous about except for how much fuel I\u2019ve got, and when I make that stop.\u201D The camera flashes intensified, and Cali said \u201CThank you for your time,\u201D Before the flashing got to be too bright. \u201CNo problem, thank you.\u201D I turned and walked off, but I just heard Cali giving the outro. \u201CBrave words coming from the rookie; we\u2019ll be eager to watch his performance in the race today.\u201D I smiled, and kept on walking. I had a title to win.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I rubbed my hand over the fresh grass, and traced it all the way out to the old skid-marks from about 4 months ago. It felt like so long ago\u2026 The fans were cheering my name, and I saw so many waving flags larger than themselves with a countries flag. I waved, and the crowd went ballistic. \u201CEnjoying the spotlight?\u201D Alexis asked as she walked over. \u003Cem\u003EOh yeah\u003C/em\u003E, I thought. \u003Cem\u003EI\u2019m ready.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The 5-plane formation thundered overhead, and their screaming, piercing tone rattled everything from my teeth to the super-light front wings on the cars. It was time. The final race. I got my radio earplugs in, and as soon as I picked up my helmet, Max walked over. \u201CYou ready, buddy?\u201D I asked. \u201CReady as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201D Max replied, holding up his helmet. \u201COld times sake?\u201D I rolled my eyes, and hit the helmet. Camera flashes flew to life, almost blinding me as I got into the car as every reporter wanted a shot of the future champion. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u2019s showtime.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The car launched well, and we set off on the formation lap. I was starting from Pole position, and Max was right behind me in second. All the cars on the grid formed one huge conga line as we snaked around the course. I rumbled over the curbing into the Turn 3 Hairpin, and waved to the crowd on the outside of the corner. They cheered and clapped, and I felt like maybe, for once, I was doing something right with my life. The circuit was fast, fun, and flowing. It also gave the fans some really amazing places to watch the race from as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright buddy, you know what you\u2019ve got to do. 20 laps, easy as a breeze.\u201D I was startled a bit as Paddy\u2019s voice filtered in over the radio. \u201CAh thanks, boss! I\u2019m really happy to be a part of this. Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to make something work, eh?\u201D Paddy chuckled, and answered, \u201CHopefully. Now get out there and show em what you\u2019ve got.\u201D The crowd cheered when we got down the Grand Straight- \u003Cem\u003EIl grande rettilineo\u003C/em\u003E- and I could feel the energy pulsing out of the grandstands. I entered the Turn 18-19-20 complex, and got ready for the start. I blipped the throttle, and the car fishtailed, cleaning off the tires one last time. The 15 other cars on the grid all filed in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0One light. \u003Cem\u003EHere we go.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Two. \u003Cem\u003EOne\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Three. \u003Cem\u003ELast\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Four. \u003Cem\u003ETime\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Five.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The lights went out, and I flew forward off the grid. Max had a perfect launch, and we were side-by-side through 1. Entering 2, I got the gap out, and it was smooth sailing all the way through Turn 3. Behind me, the crowd cheered, and through the hairpin I saw smoke rising from Turn 1. Max slotted into line behind me entering 4 and 5, and as we entered the R\u0026amp;D Section, the yellow flag came out. \u201CVSC Deployed, VSC; slow it down and hold your time to the Delta. VSC Deployed.\u201D Normally the VSC didn\u2019t come out; this must be for the debris from the Turn 1 crash. Max was just chilling a couple feet behind me, occasionally darting up before going back. It was a 3-way fight for the lead between me, Max, and some RedWind Racing Team driver; I think it was Jim. Entering the back straight, my worst fear was confirmed. Safety Car deployed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGah dangit!\u201D I shouted, punching the side of the car as I slowed. \u201CAlright, we can work with this. Stay out; we\u2019ll keep to the original strategy.\u201D I weaved the car around down the straight and when we went into the third hairpin (Turn 15), I shut off EPB to preserve the system. We passed by the wreck fest of Turn 1, and I saw 3 cars resting off to the side of the track, and debris was scattered over the length of the track. I looked back, but Max was gone. He had pulled off into the pit lane, and now Jim was in Max\u2019s place. \u003Cem\u003EGood\u003C/em\u003E, I thought as the Safety Car picked us up and led us around. \u003Cem\u003ENow I can get a bit of a gap.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0On Lap 4, the Safety Car came in, and it was time to get back going. The roaring tune of now 13 Formula cars rumbled through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I got off to a massive start. As soon as I got into Turn 4, I had left Jim in the dust; he was still at the hairpin! I continued extending the gap, and when it was time for my pit stop on Lap 10, there was no-one in sight. I wheeled in perfectly, and the team responded like magic; getting me in and out with almost 5 seconds to spare on the pit timer. I sat in the box and waited until the light came on. As soon as the pillar above me switched to green, the jack dropped and I powered out of the stall. A loud hissing behind me sounded. As soon as I looked back, a huge \u003Cem\u003EBANG!\u003C/em\u003E came out of the rear end, and all power from EPB was lost. I hit the throttle as soon as I left the pits, but no matter what I did, EPB was just gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUh.. guys? What the heck is going on here?\u201D The radio was silent, but as I entered the Canyon Section, Andy came on. \u201CUh, Jeb? We\u2019ve got a big problem. The EEB is disabled. We believe that the bank has either come loose or the Generator\u2019s suffered way too much damage to be fixed. If it\u2019s the Generator, then the Alternator should work.\u201D I looked in my mirror and saw Max. \u201CIf it\u2019s the bank, how much time am I going to lose per lap?\u201D Andy calculated the odds. \u201CAt least 2. Probably 3 plus. Just try to manage the gap best you can; 10 to go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0With 2 laps remaining, Max was hot on my tail. Only a couple seconds separated us, and it was all or nothing. I was running Rich revs, and employing as many devious tricks I could to keep Max behind. He was closing fast, but I was slamming into every apex, using as little brakes as possible, and hunkering down into my seat as best I could to reduce the drag. We flew into Turn 15, and Max absolutely leaped up towards me on the exit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLet\u2019s go Jeb!\u201D Andy yelled into my ear. \u201CLast lap! Give it all you\u2019ve got!\u201D I flung myself into Turns 1 and 2, and Max oversteered a bit from my dirty air. That completely compromised his entry into Turn 3, and I managed to get a good gap out. I fishtailed on exit though, and behind I saw the tiny little skid marks from a car losing traction. We blazed into the Turn 4/5 Tunnel, and the sounds of our two cars echoed all around me. We popped out of the tunnel, and the circuit was again bathed in a huge, florescent white light. The crowd roared as Max make a look up to the outside. However, I had one last trick up my sleeve. I was planning to save this for the trip back to the pits on EEP, but now I knew I had to use it. The Auxiliary Battery Bank; ABB. It had only 100 units of Electric Charge, which would only last about 4 seconds. Gotta make it count. Through Turn 10, Max was right up on me. 11 and 12 came up, and then Max was all over me. Slipstream, Rich Revs, and his EPB all worked into his favor as he powered alongside me. But then, he stalled. I took advantage and jammed the EPB button. An extra 6 meters per second kicked in, and I blasted past him- the crowd roaring behind me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Now that I had let my little secret slip, I had to keep it safe. Through Turn 15, the bank had recharged from Alternator Power. It was a short, grueling, 5-turn stretch to the line. I kept the AAB energy ready, and through Turn 18 I used it again. This time, Max was no match.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0100 meters from glory. The crowd thundered like a jet engine. 75. I saw the crew leaning off the wall and pumping their fists for joy. 50. The flag official began waving the flag. 25. I stuck my arm up into the air and dove down the track right under the stand. 0. Fireworks went off, and I felt the warm, orange glow through my suit. \u201CYES!!!! YES! YES! \u003Cem\u003EYEEEEEEEEESSSSSSAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! \u003Cstrong\u003ECHAMPIONS!!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u201D I pumped my fist up into the air as I coasted down the track. \u201CYou did it!!\u201D Andy shouted from the box. \u201CJebediah Kerman, you are the World Champion!\u00A0World! \u003Cem\u003ECHAMPION!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D I heard loud cheering in the background, and Alexis was screaming for joy somewhere in the mix. \u201CI can\u2019t believe it! Oh my god..\u201D I felt immediately tired, and decided to open up my visor. \u201CBWAGH!\u201D I shouted as a wave of cold air assaulted my face. I clapped the visor shut as quick as I could, and realized that I was already entering Turn 3. The crowd was chanting my name, and when I passed the stands, I pulled out my secret item I\u2019d stuffed into the car pre-race, just in case. The flag whipped up against the side of the car, and I lifted it up as high as I could. The crowd went wild, cheering so loud that they drowned out the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJebediah Kerman, you are the 2034 Formula K World Champion!!!\u201D Paddy shouted at me as I went through the R\u0026amp;D sector. \u201CThanks Paddy! Means a lot coming from you.\u201D Paddy laughed. \u201CNow. Burn \u2018er down bud!\u201D I went onto the backstraight and smiled. \u201CWith pleasure.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0In front of the crowd, I pulled off to the side of the track. As soon as the final car had passed, I began fiddling with some dials on the car, and grinned. I waved my arms up and down to get the crowd going, and jammed the gas. The car responded like I knew it would, and when I blipped the wheel. To the right, the rears lost every bit of traction they possible could have. I spun around, and smoke filled my vision. Now, I turned the wheel hard right, and the car continued to spin around, filling my vision and the air with a massive cloud of white smoke. The crowd whooped and whistled, and by now the entire team had run across the track to stand on the wall in front of the stands and cheer me on. I grinned as my car finally ran out of fuel. Responding perfectly on cue, the crew leaped up over the wall and ran over to the car. I had unstrapped and was getting out when they arrived.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYEAH!!\u201D I shouted, standing up in the seat and sticking my arms up. They jumped up around me and gave me huge hugs and clapped me on the back and helmet. After we had finally finished my celebrating, I realized that the fans had gone behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, where the podium was going to be held. \u201CCome on! Let\u2019s just push it!\u201D Now in hindsight, I could have just used the limited amount of EEP to get to the podium. But come on; how awesome is it, having the whole crew pushing you into the space after you\u2019ve just won the title? You know you\u2019d want to do it to.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0As soon as I got into the podium parking space, I decided to do what Lewis had done after his home-race victory. I jumped up onto the tiny little wall that separated the fans from the podium, and did a little bit of crowd surfing. I mean, why not? I was World Champion. Now it\u2019s on to K1. And maybe\u2026 Maybe my new legend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E12:25am.

Red, Green, and White frequently illuminated the sides of the plane, but I had my eyes closed. My hand slowly drifted over the trophy, which had my name stamped on it. Also, I would have my name on every other Formula K trophy for the rest of time. I smirked, thinking about my name on that trophy for the next little kid who would win, and see \u201C\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJEBEDIAH H.

My eyes snapped operand I picked up the trophy. It was super light; Alexis had said it was made out of Aluminum and some steel to reinforce it. My eyes traveled down to the base of the shiny, wavy piece of metal. I decided to read off some of the names and see if maybe I would be able to pick out any of my heroes. I saw legends like Jack, James, Enzo, Damon, and- my hero-, Sebastian Kerman, #5, Driving for OTech.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSebastian V.

It was a 10-minute period where drivers could drive around the track to get a feel for the course pre-race. Kind of like a warm-up period. The car responded with all the grip, and I enjoyed the entire experience. I was no longer a rookie, but now it seemed that more pressure and expectations were being put on me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECan he continue his dominance?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Was 2034 just a fluke?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Will he be moved up to K1?\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The media and fans kept on asking the questions that at most times I didn\u2019t even have the answers to myself. But every time someone came up and asked me, I just flicked down my sunglasses and kept on walking. Pretty easy to just ignore the confusion and the questions. I was 100% in my element, no matter what the reporters, or the internet columnists, or the rivals said. I pulled up to my grid spot, and the team was ready and waiting. I stopped right in the grid spot (In First place I might add), and the team was waiting for me. I shut the car off, and began unstrapping. When I was finally feeling okay, I took the wheel off and laid it down on the nose of the car, and began running up to the flagpole for the international anthem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The crowd was a rumbling wall of noise that I was able to hear even through the walls of the hospitality suite. That was 45 minutes ago. Now, it was a loud, almost impossible-to-hear din that seemed to penetrate everything both on and off the track. I swear they could hear the crowd in the helicopters hundreds of meters above. I waved up into the stands towards the thousands of fans, who cheered even louder. Then, the anthem started playing. It rose and fell, and when it was finally over, a squadron of 5 Air Force jets- F/A-18 Hornets- flew over. The engines piercing scream broke through the crowd noise, and I watched them fly off into the distance over the water, before breaking off and flying away.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I went over to the car, and got all my stuff. I reached down into my seat and pulled out my helmet. \u201CYou ready?\u201D Alexis asked while I was getting everything on. \u201CYeah,\u201D I replied; my voice muffled by the helmet\u2019s grip on my head. Alexis nodded, and got up right in my visor slot, to where only I could hear her. \u201CI don\u2019t want to say anything, but Paddy said that if you do good these next few races, the team might take you back to K1.\u201D My eyes leaped open. Before I could ask for a clarification, Alexis had said \u201CGood luck!\u201D Given me a hug, and run off to back behind the pit wall. I sat into the car, and some engineers helped me tighten up the straps and make sure everything was nice and buckled in. Finally, when the crew felt everything was nice and safe with the car, they scampered back to the pit wall with Andy to get ready for the race.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The Gen2 engine roared to life, and I looked back at the new lowered spoiler. Formula K had gotten right peeved at us after we\u2019d unveiled a new double-decker rear wing last season, but for some reason they\u2019d let us keep it. Now, thanks to the series, we had been forced to changed it up. But now it was lower (The top of the wing was \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E above the rear wheels) and a lot more awesome-looking. I mean I don\u2019t think it really made much of a difference; if anything if felt like we had more grip than before. The lights turned green, and we all launched onto the formation lap. \u201CAlright, go ahead and cycle through the gears,\u201D Andy said as I went through Turn 1. I complied, and flicked the car up into 8th, and then back down to first through the turn.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I preformed some more pre-race checks for the team, and now, finally, I had gone through Turn 19 and was waiting for the rest of the grid to arrive. My heart was speeding up from the adrenaline. The final car- a LakeFront- filed into their spot. I saw a green flag waving behind in the mirror. This was it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0One light. I activated Rich.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Two. I hit the gas, and the new engine yowled behind me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Three. EPB ready.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Four. Breathe in\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Five. Breathe out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The lights went out, and I released the clutch. The car leaped out of the space, and my head was slammed against the seat-back. The rears slipped a bit, but then grabbed traction as quick as they had lost it. Within a second I was already lining up for Turn 1, and the rest of the field followed. Max hung right behind me, and I saw the rest of the pack lining up nice and easy; single-file through the radius. Entering the double-apex of Turns 2 and 3, the crowd cheered when I passed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Now, out of 3 and into the short straight to Turn 4, Max made his move. He peeked inside, and I sliced down, stopping his move. However, I was stuck on the inside as Max attempted to get around the outside entering the tunnel. To keep both of us from committing suicide-by-wall, I slammed the brakes early. Max flew around the outside before we turned in, but I had miscalculated my speed. Now, we were side-by-side going through the tightest section on the entire track.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!\u201D I screamed as we went into Turn 5. I gave Max plenty of space entering the corner, and again Max went past. Then, without warning, he slammed on the brakes and I was flung right up the inside of him through 6. \u201CSafety Car\u2019s out, Safety Car; Max had to let you past.\u201D \u003Cem\u003EAh\u003C/em\u003E. We went under the bridge and I went into Lean Fuel mode. Why is it that every time I get a fairly good start, some wreck has to foul it up?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0When I went into Turn 19, Max tried to fake me out and look like he was going into the pits. He dove down the track just in time, and I chuckled. The Safety car picked us up in 3, where the wreck was. It looked like an exact copy of my wreck last season, with one car spun off into the inside wall. \u201CSo we\u2019re keeping on the same pit strategy, right?\u201D I asked as we wormed through the R\u0026amp;D section. \u201CWe\u2019re changing it around a bit; pit on Lap 8 now instead of 10. You alright with that?\u201D Throughout the period, Andy and I debated on which strategy would work out best, and then it was time to get back going on Lap 5. I launched forward, and Max kept it calm and clean entering Turn 1. The track tightened up immensely through that part of the track, and overtaking was practically impossible. I extended my gap through the R\u0026amp;D Section, and now I had gotten a healthy lead heading down the backstraight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBox, Box, Box,\u201D Andy called out on Lap 8. I eased into the lane and stopped right on the mark. The crew lifted the car up, and took off the 4 worn tires. Now, 4 new ones came on, but I stayed jacked up until the 12 second minimum had ended. I counted. 9. 10. 11. 12. I jammed the gas, but the wheels spun helplessly as the wheels were still hovering a few inches above the ground. Finally, the jack dropped me, but I had lost 4 or 5 seconds. \u201CWhat just happened?\u201D I asked as I rejoined the track. \u201CThe jack was jammed we believe. Nothing we can do about it now; push for the win.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0I pushed on, and on Lap 14, Max \u003Cem\u003Efinally\u003C/em\u003E came in. I wheeled myself out of the final corner- the rears losing a bit of traction and making me have to make a slight correction. I mounted the exit curb and tried to hold as much momentum as possible. I looked ahead and saw a jet-black and lime green car break out of the pit lane exit. Max had jumped me in the pit stop cycle. I turned up the engine and went off like a mad-kerb; trying to catch up. On lap 19 of 20, I finally had. We went down the back-straight and I held in the slipstream. I was right on top of him, but I decided to hold back and wait. We passed the finish line, and I was right on Max\u2019s tail. Entering Turn 1, I made a dummy move but Max didn\u2019t bite. We flowed through 2 and 3 smoothly, and I kept on looking for places to sneak by.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0When we went through Turn 6, I tried to get around the outside. Max didn\u2019t see me, but as we entered the tightening apex of Turn 7, I had to let out of the gas. I was running out of time, but I knew I had the pace. We were inches from each other entering Turn 9, and into 10 I locked up. I managed to avoid Max, but now he had gained about 50 or 75 feet. I still wasn\u2019t out of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Max went cautiously into \u003Cem\u003ETempesta\u003C/em\u003E, but I was having none of it. I mounted the curbing, and through 11 the right wheels lifted up off the ground. Then, I turned in for 12 and the car slammed down onto the ground- sending up a flurry of bright yellow and orange sparks. I had gained all the time back, and now it was all or nothing. I stayed in the slipstream until the last second and when I thought I was about to wreck into Max\u2019s car, I cut out to the right. I flew around the outside, but I ran out of track into the braking zone. I had to slam the brakes to avoid running wide, and I felt a huge thud from the rears as the car bounced up. I hurriedly snapped the wheel around, and looked back. An endplate and numerous cascade elements from Max\u2019s wing flew out to the far outside wall. His wing wasn\u2019t totaled, but it was really damaged on the left side. I hoped and prayed the tire would hold long enough to make these final 5 turns.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Through 15, I slammed the brakes and felt the car understeer a bit. Max was right behind me though. 16, 17, and 18 was the technical chicane- left, right, and left again. I rumbled over the curbing, and now it was up to the final corner. Turn 19. Wide-ish approach and loads of curb on the exit, the corner was a perfect mix of entry speed, mechanical grip, aero grip, and guts. I blazed into the corner at max speed, and I clipped the inside curbing. I smiled as I felt that satisfying rumbling of the left-side tires shooting over a curb, and I used the momentum to slingshot out of the corner. I felt the rears losing grip, and I corrected just in time. When I straightened up, I was already on the outside curbing. The Right Rear tire brushed the outside wall, and I felt the rear jump up a little bit. I fish-tailed all the way down the straight, and punched the air as I crossed the line.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYES!!\u201D I shouted. \u201CThat was frickin\u2019 \u003Cem\u003EAWESOME!!!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D I let off the throttle, and the engine revved down. \u201CThat was incredible, Jeb; absolutely incredible!\u201D Andy said as I went into the Turn 1/2 complex. \u201COh man, that was amazing!\u201D Alexis shouted. I waved to the fans and grinned. A great start to a new season. \u003Cem\u003EK1, here I come.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiffedStarfish","CreatedById":175356,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-08T21:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat!
