My last challenge, the Duna Architectural Challenge was long winded, months longwinded! This one was a single trip to Duna. How long could it take? Yeah... right. Well, over a week later and I\u0027m done. One or two mistakes that cost me points, but overall well done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those that haven\u0027t seen the challenge here is a link to the appropriate thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40515-Duna-Apollo-Style\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDuna Apollo Style Challenge\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy effort used the \u0027E K Bod launcher\u0027, which is named after a famous Kerbol in a poem that fought a headless ghoul that was stealing all the drinking goblets from a village. The mission profile is named after the ghoul itself: The \u0027Kup Hollow\u0027 program. Yeah, I was in that kind of mood when I came up with this *sigh*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the EK Bod launcher:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Duna%20Apollo%20Challenge/E%20K%20Bod%20Launcher.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022E K Bod Launcher.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the rules state it\u0027s a three stage to LKO orbit launcher with a fairing to cover the lander stage (optional rule) and the Command Moduel\u002BService Module (CM and SM) on top, just like Kup Hollow.. I mean Apollo. It\u0027s all done with no mods that add any aids to flight or add components. I did use one mod that affected flight: the Actions on the Fly mod. It allows you to reallocate action groups as you go. Hope fully that won\u0027t affect the scoring. The other mods I know from the thread aren\u0027t an issue. I used the universe replacer mod (merely graphics), the Editor Extensions mod (doesn\u0027t affect game play), the subassembly manager (ditto), and the Select Root mod (ditto also). I had hyper edit and Mech Jeb installed, but only used them for testing the hardware on a seperate save game. Neither were used in the actual mission. Basically they helped me to figure out what dVs were needed and to test to see if the landers came apart during descent on Duna when the chutes open (They did at first *sigh*).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilots need no introduction, Jeb and Bob as Lander crew and Bill stuck on duty in the Command Module during the Duna exploration. The ship carries two Kerballed rovers on the lander and each of those rovers carries two mini probe rovers. It was supposed to be that all of these would be science packages, driven to places and left there... but I forgot to install any science stuff on the two Kerballed rovers... this left me one short for a mission objective \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E five points lost there! Of course I only figured this out after I landed *Face palm* Unfortunately I also didn\u0027t realise that to get 20points you had to have your two stage lander leave the lower stage on Duna! I used it for a minor part of the ascent. What\u0027s annoying is that it was unneccessary.
