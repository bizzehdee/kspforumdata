MechJeb wasn\u0027t confused... I was. I had \u0022control from here\u0022 set to the LM instead of the CSM. Therefore, the guidance was coming from the LM but the propulsion from the CSM (i.e. backwards). My ship was trying to do a super retrograde burn to REVERSE it\u0027s orbit and then add MORE to do the Hohmann transfer to Minimus. In the process of the Kerbin orbital velocity going down, through zero(!!!) and then back up the other way, gravity did it\u0027s thing and that\u0027s why we crashed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll looked fine until I realized that my new orbital path (the Hohmann transfer orbit to Minimus) passed THROUGH Kerbin!
