I like Jeb. Always smiling, never complaining. You can put him in a trash can with some fourth of July fireworks strapped on and he\u0027ll put it in orbit. Come to think of it... That\u0027s how we *got* him into orbit at first!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBob\u0027s a different story. OSHA this, Safety that... so when when we had to retrieve Jeb after that little, ehm, \u003Cem\u003Edocking point shear-off at launch\u003C/em\u003E snafu with the new space tug we decided to use prototype #2 and send Bob to get him. Now, you have to understand... the Space Tug is a new era in Kerbal spaceflight. It\u0027s basically a big ass fuel tank, three atomic engines strapped on it in a radial fashion and a 2.5m docking port \u003Cem\u003Eat the rear\u003C/em\u003E, as we want our pilots to have a good view at the front, so we used the cupola as a cockpit. And since we\u0027re intending long missions we added some crew quarters as well. There\u0027s room for four in the crew cabin, but the idea is to fly with a two man crew, and have only a single pilot launch. You know, \u003Cem\u003Ein case she goes boom during launch\u003C/em\u003E. Not that it\u0027ll ever happen of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo we came up with this contraption where we have a stack of 2.5m tanks strapped underneath the docking port (\u003Cem\u003Ewe changed the design later as the docking ports kept getting ripped off during launch\u003C/em\u003E) and a huge tower of 1.25m tanks as asparagus boosters underneath the atomic motors. It looks kind of neat, really. Makes you wonder if it goes into space, so that\u0027s a plus for the design!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd here\u0027s Bob. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s only a cupola. What if she blows up at launch? How do I escape?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D We told him to quit whining. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EJeb put the friggin\u2019 thing in orbit so why won\u2019t you,\u003C/em\u003E\u201D we said. We told him to be reasonable. Do you know how much weight and complexity an escape tower for the cupola would involve? Not to mention that we now would have a decoupler underneath the cupola and we all know what happens when one of those idiots triggers it because they\u0027re still in staging mode when they think\u2019ve switched to target mode. So no, that wasn\u2019t an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen we got an idea... Why not use a Mk-I capsule, and strap \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E on top of the copula? Bob will launch from there, it can easily be detached and once\u2019s he\u2019s in orbit he can detach it. \u003Cem\u003EAfter he EVA\u2019s back into the main control cabin, \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ebut that\u2019s his problem\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E[chuckles]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo we propose the setup to Bob, and he\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es all smiling. Now, we learned a few things at launch. This structure is pretty wide and stable, so we figured \u201Ca launching tower is for sissies. We don\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Et need no stinkin\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003E launching tower. Turns out we do. All the weight initially rested on the Mainsail engine which sheared off the fuel lines. So come launch time, the whole thang\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es just sitting there spitting fire and stuff and not taking off, as the Mainsail ain\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Et workin\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow, we just thought we had them staging order wrong. So I tell the boys \u201C\u003Cem\u003EI guess the Mainsail somehow went to second stage. Why don\u2019t you fire her up?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D and without a moment\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es hesitation we did. You see, she\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es burning up precious fuel, and if the choice is Bob or 25 tonnes of Kethane, well it\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Es easy to decide where the priorities are, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo we wack the stager, and next thing I know I see them fairings of the atomic engines come off. Now why would that happen? On closer examination, the atomic engines kicked off and started running! That means that we just booted of the \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E second stage, and with the decouplers activated there\u0027s no way we can shut the boosters down. And of course the atomic engines are now firing straight on top of the fuel tanks. Too bad they drain from the top or we would have had some great fireworks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/p472725769/e6cbd2d04\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p1824337156-4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/img/s9/v88/p1824337156-4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe quickly held a team meeting to decide what to do: inform Bob to test his emergency contraption, or wait and see what happens. The vote tied, so we flipped a coin, and the weighted decision was made to inform\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust as things got interesting, Bob hit\u0027s the Big Red button. The good news is that there wasn\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Et a lot of work for the cleaning crew, as it was a pretty clean blow up. They found two decoupler rings and a strut, and that was about it, I think\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/p472725769/e60ad3821\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p1621964833-4.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://willems.zenfolio.com/img/s10/v98/p1621964833-4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo we changed the design a bit. The good news is we\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Ere now using \u003Cem\u003Ethree\u003C/em\u003E mainsails (guess where they\u003Cem\u003E\u2019\u003C/em\u003Ere attached to!) with an ungodly amount of boosters strapped on. Leaves the rear end of the tug free to drag all kinds of stuff into space.
