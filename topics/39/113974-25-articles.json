Nevertheless, Valentina had no idea how long she\u0027d been standing here, facing the Kommissar\u0027s rigid back across his desk. Hours? Days? Years? She was amazed she could still stand at all. Each time she thought she had finally achieved the zenith of weariness, something happened and kicked it all up another level. \n\nThere had been no rest on the long journey back here. She had landed at the abandoned airfield as ordered, and was immediately taken into custody. Someone had *tried* to handcuff her, but a single growl from Igor convinced them otherwise. Then a helicopter to a waiting aircraft carrier, followed by a swift departure in a high-speed transport. All through the long flight skirting the horn of Kerfrica with escort fighters on either wing and several aerial refuelings, Igor never strayed more than a meter from her. Whether he was guardian or warden, she couldn\u0027t quite tell. \n\nNeither, it would seem, could the pair of black-suited NKOTB agents who had spent the entire time interrogating her. They had looked completely unsettled, not at all the demeanor she would have expected from such. Yet neither rain nor snow nor giant, irritable... things... could stay these envoys from their appointed task. They had questioned her without end, and when they finally *did* reach the end, they asked the same questions again but in a different way. Then, they asked the original questions again. \n\nValentina had answered honestly. There was no sense lying to the secret police. They were well-skilled at cutting to the truth, and even telling the truth was no guarantee against cutting. Besides, if she really did sound as mad as she thought she sounded, maybe they would get it over with quickly. Mad Kerbs don\u0027t typically make quota in blutonium mines. \n\nAnd now they stood just off to the side, in the wood-paneled office of the Kommissar. Another drop of sweat ran down her temple. This was certainly the *last* place she would have expected to end up. The air was thick with acrid stink of rattail smoke, the Kommissar clutched a smoldering one in his folded hands. He must have smoked several packs by now. Yet in all this time, he said nothing. Just stood there, still as a dormant volcano, staring out the window and occasionally smoking. \n\nApparently even the agents were beginning to wane, \u0022comrade Kommissar, can we move this along, please?\u0022 one of them said with plain annoyance, \u0022our superiors are anxious to get the prisoner to a *proper* interrogation facility.\u0022\n\nSilence. Valentina blinked as a blob of sweat slid into her eye. \n\n\u0022This *formality* is only being granted out of respect for your long service,\u0022 said the other, \u0022say your peace and be done with it. Need I remind you she is wanted for the murder of an *equally* well respected political officer? To say nothing of being at the center of an international incident. The Ambassador is *still* trying to secure the release of,\u0022 he turned to his associate, \u0022what was his name?\u0022\n\n\u0022Kerman.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, a certain Lieutenant Kerman, the pilot, also one of of your personnel.\u0022\n\nMore silence. The only motion the drifting of continents. \n\nThe agent produced a handkerchief and dabbed at his brow, \u0022just do your scary kommissar thing and let us move along.\u0022\n\n\u0022Do you have any idea, what it is you have done?\u0022 the Kommissar spoke finally, not turning.\n\n\u0022There, you see?\u0022 one agent nudged the other, \u0022watch this, he really can be quite terrifying. Never even raises his voice.\u0022\n\nThe agent blinked in surprise as the Kommissar turned and approached *him*.\n\n\u0022Do you,\u0022 The Kommissar laid hands amicably on his shoulders, \u0022*comrade?*\u0022 \n\nThen snapped his neck. \n\nThe other one\u0027s eyes barely had time to widen before the Kommissar\u0027s closed fist came down on the top of his head, and *his* neck disappeared. He imploded to the floor and laid there, twitching and gagging. \n\nThe very instant his throes ceased, the door swung open, and the strange desk clerk from that horrid anteroom shuffled in. He seized the two corpses by their collars and disappeared back through the door without making a sound. Or looking up. \n\nValentina didn\u0027t bother blinking. Or gawking. Get it over with quickly. Right. For the umpteenth time she thought that *now*, she had finally gone mad. She absently wondered what could *possibly* happen later on to think that, no, *now* she had really, truly gone mad. There would certainly be something. Then the Kommissar\u0027s piercing eyes fell on her, freezing the sweat on her brow, and such thoughts ceased. \n\nHe stared at her for a long while. Like so many times before, she could feel that frigid, weighing gaze boring into her. Like some bizarre inversion of distant Moho, half her head felt frozen in that view while the other sweltered. \n\n\u0022And *you*,\u0022 he thundered, \u0022do you realize what *you* have done?\u0022\n\n\u0022I... er...\u0022 Valentina struggled to mount a coherent thought before that scouring glare, \u0022I acted in the best interests of the Union, to thwart a grand conspiracy against the Imperium and--\u0022\n\n\u0022Do not *lie* to me,\u0022 he never did raise his voice, yet she shrank back from him, blasted like a planet that had wandered too close to its star, \u0022you, who have stood before the Empress herself with no guile of politics; you, who have beheld the eyeless stare of the shadowstained and not lost your soul.\u0022\n\nHe leaned in closer, his eyes piercing right though her, \u0022do not play the mindless comrade with me. I have warned you of such.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... the Imperium...\u0022 when had her mouth gotten so dry?\n\nThe Kommissar crushed the stub of his rattail between his fingers with a soft hiss, \u0022the Imperium parades a bear on a leash, thinking it controls its power, while the rats infest its home and eat its stores.\u0022 His eyes were only centimeters away, now. The whole world seemed to disappear into them. \u0022Do not speak to me of the Imperium.\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s mouth worked helplessly like a fish. Reality seemed to have gone from crinkly to crunchy. Now this, *this*, *THIS* was surely madness. \n\n\u0022You have felt it. Sensed it,\u0022 the Kommissar turned away, moving to stare at the tip-less knife on the shelf; his back straight, his knees rigid, \u0022you have *seen* it. The darkness that spreads across the land, blacker than the sins of any mortal kerb. Even *them*.\u0022\n\nSuddenly, he rounded on her, \u0022why are you here?\u0022\n\nShe blinked in genuine confusion, \u0022I... was brought--\u0022\n\nIn an instant, he was looming over her like a planet, \u0022*why. Are you here.* Why are you not in a factory somewhere. Or working at a collective farm. Or scrounging a living in a shack in the taiga.\u0022 Again, his eyes bored into her, \u0022why. Are. You. Here. What is it that drives you.\u0022\n\n\u0022What,\u0022 *his eyes...* \u0022do you *want?*\u0022\n\nBefore this onslaught, there was no conscious thought. As his eyes tore into her, images, feelings, memories drifted by... Anastasia... the Political Ofiicer... Donald... Sergei... the Director... her *deda*... her parents... all the burdens she carried... as if he were drawing them forth. As if he were *seeing* them.\n\nShe said simply, \u0022to atone.\u0022\n\nAnd then, the Kommissar did the most terrifying thing yet. He *laughed*. It was every bit as mirthless and cold as his eyes. \n\n\u0022To atone?\u0022 his voice was distant thunder on open plains, \u0022to you even know the meaning of the word?\u0022\n\n\u0022I...\u0022 Valentina\u0027s lips felt dry as a tomb. \n\n\u0022I will tell you a story, of what it is to want to atone,\u0022 the room grew darker. Surely... surely it was just her exhausted state... her critical lack of sleep... but now, images, *feelings*, seemed to flow the other way... like... *she* could see...\n\n\u0022There was a boy,\u0022 the Kommissar rumbled, \u0022he wore sackcloth on his back, and wrapped his feet in rags, though his toes had already turned black from the cold. For his entire short life, he knew nothing but pain. Yet he wanted nothing else from life, but to go on breathing for one more day. \n\nOne. More. Breath. \n\n\u0022So he goes to the soldiers, and he tells them where the People are hiding, and the soldiers come and take them away, like all the times before. And for this, the soldiers laugh at him. They call him *shinok* and make him to crawl on his hands and knees in the snow. But they let him lie with the dogs and share their warmth. He eats their food, drinks their water, and he goes on breathing for one more day. \n\n\u0022One. More. Breath. \n\n\u0022The next day, now he goes out and finds the People, because they know him and trust him as one of their own. And again he tells the soldiers where they are, and the soldiers come and take the People away. And again they laugh at the boy. They give him the coat off a corpse and paint rank stripes on it. The make him parade up and down the empty streets, and call him *nemnogo komissar*; but they give him a ragged tent, and share their food and rattails with him, for he makes their work easier. \n\n\u0022And one day, he has a coat with real stripes, and the soldiers obey *him*. They look at him with terror as he orders the last of the People away with a face as cold and heartless as the long winter. But the People do not fear, for they are far beyond fear. They jeer at him, and call him *da\u0027tsang*, and betrayer, and cursed. \n\n\u0022But the Powerful, they commend him, for now the People are all gone. They give him names and citations and a real Kommissar\u0027s badge, and send him to find *other* people, because he is good at it.\n\n\u0022But every night when he sleeps, the People return to him in his dreams, and they whisper to him all the torments that await him, when one day he takes his last breath. So despite all he has... the boy still wishes nothing more from life than to go on breathing for one more day. \n\n\u0022One. More. Breath.\u0022\n\nThe world felt like it was spinning. More than usual. Valentina\u0027s exhausted mind tried to process everything she had just... seen? What?\n\n\u0022So do not speak to me of \u0027atone,\u0027\u0022 the Kommissar lit another rattail, \u0022and now, you have put me in a most difficult position,\u0022 he took a long drag, \u0022I have been ordered by the Imperium itself to have you disposed of in a fitting manner.\u0022\n\nShe stumbled at that. She had been expecting *some*thing unpleasant, but to hear it so directly...\n\nThe Kommissar turned toward the window, and the large rocket waiting on the pad beyond, \u0022in thirteen hours and forty-seven minutes, that rocket will lift off. It is ostensibly an uncrewed test launch of a system to finally land an Ussari on the M\u00FCn. At exactly three minutes and twelve seconds after the trans-M\u00FCnar injection burn, the rocket will explode. You will be on that rocket.\u0022\n\nValentina swallowed against the lump in her throat. Well, she wanted \u0027quickly.\u0027 \n\n\u0022Sometime after, it will be revealed that you were aboard, that it was not a test,\u0022 he continued, \u0022you will have a grand state funeral the likes of which have not been seen since the death Vladimir Kermin himself. Every Kerb, Kerbelle, and Kerbling in the world will hear that Valentina Kermanova is *dead*.\u0022\n\nHe stalked up to her, \u0022do you believe that I can kill you? Do you *believe*, that with a word, I could have you drug out into the street and shot like a dog?\u0022 he thundered.\n\nReeling, all she could manage was a quiet, \u0022yes.\u0022\n\nHe sneered, \u0022which is why I do not have to.\u0022\n\nWait, *what?*\n\n\u0022*Belief* is the most powerful thing in the universe. When the transfer stage explodes, it will scatter several chaff packages, creating a massive debris field that will mask the lander and return craft until they are well out of radar range. All the world will *believe* that you are dead, but you will navigate them to the M\u00FCn, unaided, land at the KSA\u0027s abandoned M\u00FCnbase, and investigate it... and the artifact they were sent there to study.\u0022 \n\nThe odd little clerk reappeared from somewhere, holding a stack of binders, \u0022Kegbraid, here, will supply you the necessary flight manuals, and a room to study in.\u0022\n\nValentina felt like someone had stuck a spoon in her brain and stirred it all around. But one lump in particular bobbed back up.\n\n\u0022Wait, what artifact?\u0022 she managed.\n\nThe Kommissar\u0027s gaze turned colder than ever, \u0022it is an object of most concentrated evil. I fear its contents may have already been released.\u0022\n\nThe world spun a little faster. Too fast, in fact. When *had* she last slept? She could vaguely feel her own head bobbing about. Finally, at long last, ***this*** was madness. Pure, immaculate madness. Perhaps here would be a good place to lie down. Yes, right here on the floor, sleep and then--\n\n**\u0022*Don\u0027t you dare faint!*\u0022** the Kommissar\u0027s roared, and Valentina was instantly wide awake. \n\nShe snapped a salute, \u0022Yes, sir, Comrade Kommissar, sir!\u0022\n\nHe leaned in once more, drawing his rattail to a bright red glow, \u0022are you afraid?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, sir, Comrade Kommissar, sir!\u0022\n\nSmoke billowed from his mouth and took on ominous, misshapen forms, \u0022you will be.\u0022 His lips hardly moved.\n\n**\u0022You.

They would speak of how, for a few, brief moments, lightning crashed and wind raged. Windows shattered, trees toppled; and here, where none had ever been recorded before, an earthquake tore the ground asunder. They would say it was as if the very world itself had cried out. And then, as quickly as it began, was suddenly silenced. \n\nThe rains followed. For three days, and three nights, it rained. This was not unusual, but the rain that fell was light, and slow, and mournful. No one wanted to go out in it; anyone who could stayed indoors and held their loved ones close. No one would speak it, no one would acknowledge it, the feeling that permeated the dark days and still nights. But they all knew.  \n\nThe muggy evening that had preceded the storm turned into unseasonably cold, even frigid weather. Now, as the rains passed and low clouds lingered overhead, lit from below by the city lights, a Figure came walking down a deserted street. Nearly deserted. Huddled by a damp, pitiful fire in a barrel, a derelict who had not escaped the rains watched him with tired, glassy eyes. The Figure wore a wide hat and long coat, hiding his face; garb that at any other time might have seemed silly, but tonight, seemed not a bit out of place. \n\nThe Figure walked on, his shoes clicking and echoing in the stillness, and paused before a humble door. Stenciled on it were the words: **KERBIN CITY MORGUE**. Collecting himself, the Figure entered. \n\nA clerk at a desk waited politely as he approached, \u0022may I help you, sir?\u0022\n\n\u0022Aye, lad,\u0022 the Figure said, \u0022you\u0027ve the victim of a recent crime here. Ah\u0027ll be needing her personal effects.\u0022\n\nThe clerk scoffed at him, \u0022sir, I can only release such things to lawful next-of-kin or--\u0022\n\nA golden badge hit the desk.\n\n\u0022Of course, how foolish of me,\u0022 the Figure said, \u0022they dunna call it the red eye for nothin\u0027.\u0022\n\nPeering at it, the clerk\u0027s eyes grew wide, \u0022Gednalna yard??\u0022\n\n\u0022Aye lad, this matter has now become an international investigation.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wow...\u0022 the clerk ran a hand through his thinning hair, \u0022but... I\u0027ll still need copies of--\u0022\n\nA stack of papers hit the desk. \n\n\u0022In triplicate. Registered by the Solicitor General and sealed by His Majesty the King himself.\u0022\n\nAgainst all probability, the clerk\u0027s eyes grew wider. He ran a stubby, callused thumb over the raised wax seal. \n\n\u0022Wow,\u0022 he breathed again, \u0022I\u0027ve been doing this a long time, and I\u0027ve never actually *seen* one of these forms.\u0022\n\n\u0022Pray you never do again, lad. Nasty business, this.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 he picked up a thick ledger, \u0022er, what was the victim\u0027s name, again?\u0022\n\n\u0022Anastasia Kerman.\u0022\n\nAnd dropped it with a thud, \u0022oh.\u0022 He shook himself, and leafed through the pages, \u0022sign here, please, and here, and just here. Thank you.\u0022 He disappeared down the hallway for a long while before finally returning. \n\n\u0022Are you quite all right, lad? You\u0027re looking a bit green. Er.\u0022\n\nThe clerk sat down roughly, plopping a large clear plastic bag marked \u0027EVIDENCE\u0027 on the desk. He ran a hand through hair considerably more damp.\n\nHe sighed, \u0022KCPD has already closed the file, just chalked it up to a random act of violence. Said the storm probably washed away any real evidence.\u0022 His eyes lingered on the bag. Smears of blood could be seen on the smaller bags inside, and hints of green cloth. \u0022This is one of those cases that just gets to you. I\u0027m sure you know how it is.\u0022\n\n\u0022Aye, lad,\u0022 the Figure said, taking the bag, \u0022Ah do.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, one more signature here. Thank you.\u0022 The clerk looked up at him, still not able to make out a face, \u0022good luck with your investigation, sir. I really hope you get the guy. We all do.\u0022\n\n\u0022In my experience, these things have a way of working themselves out. One way... or another.\u0022\n\nThe clerk nodded, \u0022will there be anything else, sir?\u0022\n\n\u0022That\u0027ll do, lad, that\u0027ll do,\u0022 the Figure tipped his wide-brimmed hat, still shrouding his face, \u0022you have yourself a pleasant evening.\u0022 And with that, he disappeared through the door and out into the dolent night. \n\nHe didn\u0027t go very far. He sought the beam of a nearby street lamp, its pallid glow falling on his broad shoulders like a mantle of light, embracing him against the surrounding darkness. He considered the plastic evidence bag for a moment before fishing around inside and withdrawing a small, grey, sparkly rock. \n\n\u0022Well now, aren\u0027t you a beauty,\u0022 he observed as he turned it over in his stubby fingers. Even in the dim cast, the light seemed to play and dance off the crystals in the rock, in mirthful defiance of this lachrymose night. \u0022It may take some time, but Ah\u0027ll see that you get to your rightful owner. Given what Ah may have t\u0027 put him through, it\u0027s the least Ah can do.\u0022\n\nHe tucked the rock away in a pocket, the bag under his arm, and brought out something that looked like a white porcelain disk, roughly split down the middle. He stared at it beneath the light, running a finger along the angular markings around its edge. \n\n\u0022Fairy tales...\u0022 he said slowly, shaking his head, \u0022fairy tales dunna give us our first idea of evil, they give us our first clear idea of the *defeat* of evil. The baby has known the dragon intimately, ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him, is a knight to slay the dragon.\n\n\u0022Fairy tales are *more* than true \u2013 not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons... can be *beaten*.\u0022\n\nThe figure raised his eyes to the light above, and for the first time it bathed his face. It cast soft shadows on creases and wrinkles not yet fully formed, and highlighted the brilliant streaks of red still left in the shaggy hair beneath the brim of his hat. \n\n\u0022Ah happen to be a knight...\u0022 he turned his eyes away, and looked once more on the bag and its bloodstained contents, \u0022and now, you\u0027ve gone and pist. Me. Off.\u0022 The bag crumpled in his clenched fist, \u0022Ah do beleive the time has come... t\u0027 pull some strings.\u0022\n\nHe left the comforting mantle of the light behind, stepping again into the shadows, \u0022of course... in all those tales, it\u0027s usually the hapless young squire who saves the day.\u0022\n\nDrawing near to the derelict and his pathetic fire, the Figure tossed the bag into the barrel, where it burned with frightful intensity. The shivering old kerb looked on him with vacant eyes. \n\n\u0022Ch... change, mishter?\u0022 a grubby hand in a grubby mitt came up. A large wad of bills appeared in it. \n\n\u0022Go sleep someplace warm for a while, lad, have a good meal,\u0022 the Figure said kindly. \n\n\u0022And forget that you ever saw me.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-05T07:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2018 07:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**\n  \nMinor addition."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T08:23:12Z","Content":"And so it begins..."},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T11:18:59Z","Content":"Dun dun dunning!\n\nChadvey\u0027s investigation begins!"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha 360","CreatedById":166007,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-30T08:35:34Z","Content":"Great point, evil can be beaten.
