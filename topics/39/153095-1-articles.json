The \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:italic;\u0022\u003EJesca II\u003C/span\u003E was fully fueled and ready to go into space. It would be the last time he and the others would see Kerbin. Twenty-three Kerbals, eleven male and twelve female ones, had been chosen for the Mission. His wife, Valentina, a pilot like him, was also onboard. Kerbin had been undergoing a dramatic change. Sea Level had been going lower constantly since the planetoid Saphen had passed Kerbin two years ago. Mun and Minmus were on their Way into the Sun, and the year was almost twenty days shorter than it used to be. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:italic;\u0022\u003E\u201CCommander Jebediah Kerman to Control Tower.

You can\u2019t anymore rely on an emergency watering\u201D\u003C/span\u003E. Jeb knew that. By now, Kerbin\u2019s shore was too far away to guarantee that safety. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:italic;\u0022\u003EJesca III\u003C/span\u003E would bring the other about fifty employees with the left familys, altogether only a hundred and twenty-one Kerbals. Expectations were that from the 70 million Kerbals about 10 000 had survived. One and a half years, and Eve, which had a much bigger problem, as Saphen had been intersecting at two Megametres, or less than three Eve radii from center to center, would further mess things up, estimately setting perikerbol at about four Gigametres, intersecting Eve\u2019s and possibly even Moho\u2019s Orbit.

But the command had a plan. The two ships met at the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:italic;\u0022\u003EDairea\u003C/span\u003E, which had been fully fueled for the Mission. The Target: the Ciro System, seven light years away. Their Astronomers had detected periodic anomalous gravitational influences, the System had three known planets, one of them possibly habitable. Boarding on that ship, featuring seats for about two hundred Kerbals, was without any problems. Jeb took over Command again, as chief Officer he chose Bill, a reliable Engineer and friend from back at University. The ship was piloted by Desmond and Malcolm Kerman, both known as skilled from various Duna and Jool Missions. \u201CAltitude, Desmond?\u201D \u201CPoint four two Megametres.

Jeb noted: \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:italic;\u0022\u003EYear 6651 after the first manned flight. The last Kerbals destined to live are now on their way to a new home. Hopefully successful. Kerbals may live long, but not forever.\u003C/span\u003E Minutes later Malcolm took over control of the Drive and shot out of the Kerbol System at full throttle. It would be a matter of two hours to manage to fly into the System of Ciro. Hopefully they could land on a planet there. Hopefully they\u2019d be able to build up a new civilization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter days of an empiric search(they had luckily brought telescopes, three in total), they found a candidate. Apart from the three known Gas Giants, known to Kerbalkind as Nero, Otho and Gauss, there seemed to be a fourth planet. The Image was surprisingly similar to what they had as a faraway photo of Kerbin, and Life was expected there too. They flew to the position, and indeed, there was a planet, and they called it Gael. It was a planet younger than Kerbin, but had the same Rotational and Orbital Periods as their former home planet. Of course, as the Star, Ciro, was smaller and lighter, so Gael was farther away. The last thing he saw before he got unconscious was the Spacecraft lighting the upper Atmosphere up because of the incredible Speed they still had. It was like a direct Aerobraking on Kerbin from a Moho Mission. at about five Kilometres per Second the four inflatable Heat Shields tried to keep up with the Reentry, but ultimately, the Mission seemed to end in Disaster. But Malcolm, as he had done quite a bit of Atmospheric Entry training, piloted the Ship safely downwards anyway, paying close attention to the Retrograde Marker. He knew about the responsibility he had. But he knew how to handle the Situation very well too. As he switched Instruments to Landing Mode to deploy the parachutes when Safe, he was confident that the Mission would go to Plan. And he was right about this. \u0022Five thousand Metres. Parachute Deployment\u0022, the mechanical voice sounded through the cockpit of the \u003Cem\u003EDairea\u003C/em\u003E. They soon had safely Landed and walked away to build homes. The Space Program was not that important for now. They could rebuild it later. But they would do. They had always rebuilt things when something got wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list in no paricular Order:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 GPP(This mod is awesome Work!

Before we escaped from Kerbin, we all would have turned away from this challenge. But we have no option to do this if we want to achieve once more what our species has achieved on Kerbin. This time we do a different approach however. Our ancestors might have strapped themselves in Rockets, demonstrating a \u2018safety is irrelevant\u2019 attitude. I have done this too, over and over. As of now, the problem here is: we are less than two hundred Kerbals currently. We would need a thousand years or even more to be even able to do that again. This time however, safety is important. Our first launch will, because of those reasons, not be manned. We have developed \u201CSounding Rockets\u201D, small, solid-fuel-boosted probes automatically controlled. We think it is safer that way. Safer for Kerbalkind. For Kerbalkind! For science! For progress!\u201D Jeb looked at Bill, the current lead engineer. \u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D \u201CWe\u2019ve got another problem. We haven\u2019t got big enough facilities to build what we are used to.\u201D \u201CAre you able to build small atmospheric probes? The engines we have aren\u2019t big enough for orbit. And we only have very limited control over our probe once it has launched. Staging is the only thing we\u2019ll be able to do anyway.\u201D Bill smiled at those words. Kerbals liked to build those massive spaceships, but they could build small too.

They had launched what Bob had called a \u2018Sounding Rocket\u2019 in his speech to the public. Those were small, relatively cheap rockets designed to gather some data. The Gael Atmospheric Probe I (GAP I) in particular had got a simplistic and very kerbal design. Static fins simply strapped on the outer booster shell, solid-fuel boosters with built-in decouplers to lift the payload off the ground and no control but staging. This was due to the fact that they neither had other fuels nor engines for those. It had got some, albeit limited battery storage stored in standard AA Batteries. The Parachute was, at best, a roundish thing designed for \u2018emergency\u2019 plane droppings (or fearless plane jumpers, e.g. Jeb).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the rocket shot into the sky(and I cannot speak of \u2018launching\u2019 anymore when the Launch \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is \u0026gt;5, might have overdone it), the Staff at Mission control looked closely to their monitors. Luckily, the data they got on that was fairly accurate. Staging got done pretty well, and the rocket, despite the lack of steering, eventually reached Apogael at about 13 km. This was the time the probe was told to log the science data found in the probes. Landing, albeit criticized later as unsafe by some, was done perfectly too. On purpose, the full-open Altitude had been set to a hundred metres above ground only, as the probe would, by then, be slow enough to not need 300 metres for full opening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone in the viewing room clapped their hands when splashdown happened.

As \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-style:italic;\u0022\u003EIota I \u003C/span\u003Epicked up more speed with the second stage, consisting of another three Thuds and three Swivels, it headed constantly prograde to get as much horizontal speed as possible while not wasting too much to steering losses.

To combat this, Catarina and Malcolm quickly set up another mission, the \u0022Gael Manned Craft II\u0022, basically an awkward-looking rocket out of some droptanks, three Thuds, because they were the only Engine justifying such a design, and a quite standard central core.

But, before going to Ceti, another mission was on the schedule: A Mapper, about eight point eight tons with the launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a low resolution Gael mapping mission, steered by a low-tech probe compared to what they had achieved on Kerbin, the first stage being three Sounding-XL Boosters, followed by a lifting core out of four Spark engines and a total of seventeen \u0027Oscar-B\u0027 Tanks, after that four Sounding-S Boosters sequentially fired, and for the final Insertion and Orbital Maneuvers the \u0027Ant\u0027.

Where are you?\u0022 \u0022We just passed eleven thousand kilometres. We\u0027ll lose connection soon.\u0022 Jeb gave a few not-so-nice words to the Engineering team for not supplying an antenna. He was able to fly this craft himself though, thanks to his piloting skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour days later, Mission control\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No connection for four days now, Sir.

Not a problem however, as we\u0027ll be recovering contact about a day before we return.\u0022, Jeb said into his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb spotted Ceti on the map first. Having piloted more than one thousand flights outside the atmosphere, and countless hours inside it, he really knew what he was doing. As they got close to Periapsis, he burned retrograde to capture in orbit. After capture Gemel got out to collect the science and then restore the Experiments. Then Jeb began the Descent Burn. And got into a problem: The Ceti lander had too much descent speed. No problem for Jeb though, who simply switched to manual control and pitched the vessel up a bit. After a short time they had landed on Ceti.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStanding on the ground, everyone got out for a group photo with flag. Bob collected the Science for this Mission before returning into his capsule with his crewmates. They launched quickly from that moon, heading directly eastward into Orbit. After Orbital Insertion, they just had to wait until they were about between Ceti and Gael to then burn until Perigael dropped below 70 kilometres. They then waited until they could gain back communication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sir! Ceti I is back on screen!\u0022 \u0022Good. Call them and ask what they did the last days.\u0022 \u0022Mission Control here. We have got communication with you. Can you confirm?\u0022 \u0022Confirmed. We\u0027ll be back in about a day. Damn Engineers. Not even an Antenna they\u0027d got spare. But we can talk when I\u0027ve landed this thing. Still got a crapload of Fuel left.\u0022 \u00A0The second time they tried to get a communication Jeb was in the middle of Re-Entry. But they landed safely, even if they landed far from the GSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience Earned: 783\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
