The\u00A0birds were chirping and skies were clear. Just a normal morning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Control is full of activity because there is a\u00A0interplanetary mothership\u00A0in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and it\u0027s about to depart for Duna. This seems like a normal mission. But it\u0027s about to be cut short.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Tracking Station is currently tracking the mothership but something massive was detected entering Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. There hasn\u0027t been an interplanetary mission in 2 years. What is\u00A0it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe object appears to be\u00A0perfectly radio silent and appears to be an\u00A0asteroid. But much more larger\u00A0than even the largest asteroid ever detected. And it\u0027s orbit appear to be changing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe object later entered \u003Cabbr title=\u0022High Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003EHKO\u003C/abbr\u003E using an unknown form of propulsion. It later performed several Hohmann Transfers and settled into the same orbit as the mothership. Mission Control started to get worried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the news sent a shockwave throughout the planet. We were not alone this entire time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe object in question was discovered to be Gilly. It was no asteroid all along. Who could have guessed? It has moved from Eve orbit to Kerbin orbit\u00A0using a form of propulsion that is\u00A0yet to be invented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, scientists propose that Gilly was an alien interstellar\u00A0probe disguised as an asteroid that arrived here around 4 billion years ago. The same time as the solar system\u00A0formed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interplanetary mission was later postponed and the Kerbin Space Agency begin planning for a mission to the now relocated Gilly. A mission to Gilly has never been this easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 months after\u00A0Gilly\u00A0arrived the Kerbal X rocket was ready for liftoff and the crew was ready. Now it\u0027s time for the preperation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0Kerbal X\u00A0was delivered onto the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s Launchpad by rocket crawler. The crew later entered it through the Launch Tower. Final checks are made and the mission is ready for liftoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002210, 9, 8, 7, 6, Ignition started, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and liftoff! We have liftoff!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spectator crowd cheered as the crew venture to orbit to discover the ancient secrets of Gilly and eventually discover we were not alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew capsule entered \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and eventually the crew begin plotting for a rendezvous with Gilly. Some delta-v required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some time the crew module\u00A0successfully rendezvoused with Gilly and entered orbit around it. The craft decelerated from orbit into a collision course with the surface.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing it\u0027s thruster, it softly landed\u00A0on the surface. A crew member looked outside through the window and saw the\u00A0beautiful blue marble Kerbin, hanging in the sky, shining brighter than the full Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew went outside for EVA, and saw the desolate landscape. There\u0027s barely any gravity here so the crew\u00A0used their jetpacks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a deep valley, they saw sharp spikes poking out of the ground made out\u00A0of some unknown material of biological origin and it\u0027s glowing white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What on kerbin is that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is it the aliens? Maybe we should have listened to the\u00A0conspiracy folks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These aliens don\u0027t look like the black aliens they imagined. Instead it\u0027s whatever that thing is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Can you guys shut up for a moment? We\u0027re professionals here. Let\u0027s sample it for kerbin\u0027s sake.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually they did. They decided to put it into a\u00A0spare, empty mystery goo container. They described the biological material\u00A0as \u0022Similar to mystery goo but it\u0027s glowing white, possibly bioluminescence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey named it the \u0022Gilly Goo\u0022 i suppose that they have no other options other than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter they sampled the spikes. They lifted off into orbit once again. Then performed another burn to escape Gilly\u0027s minuscule \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. They returned once again to Kerbin orbit. Lastly they perfomed a final burn to deorbit the spacecraft and reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the fires of reentry burned the ablator\u00A0and the G forces buckled the capsule. They have returned to Kerbin\u0027s safety. They splashed\u00A0down into the ocean.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey turned the sample to the R\u0026amp;D. We got our first look at alien life. Although it was risky considering possible contamination to the enviroment or by us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe call a moist speck called\u00A0Kerbin our home. We once remained ignorant of the vast universe that lies above the skies. If we don\u0027t go above the sky, then the sky shall come to us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Chapter 2 is in WIP.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
