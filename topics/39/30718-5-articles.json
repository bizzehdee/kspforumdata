The Kermol chapters are a definite change of pace and scenery so I\u0027m glad you\u0027re enjoying them too. They\u0027re actually quite soothing to write in an odd sort of way!

Halnie stretched and yawned after the long drive whilst Thomplin looked around. Jeb\u0027s company seemed to be doing well judging by the fact that there were at least three warehouses sporting signboards with the familiar tilted rocket logo painted on them. It seemed that somebody had finally decided to give the place a lick of paint as well - it still didn\u0027t really look like the busy hub of Kerbin\u0027s first space program but at least it didn\u0027t look quite as dilapidated now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin looked around skeptically. It was busy but only with kerbals queuing to get into one of the warehouses. There was certainly a conspicuous lack of large rockets anywhere or signs that anyone was thinking about building them. Thomplin spotted the expression on his face. \u0022Yes - that\u0027s about what I thought the first time as well Shervin. Believe me though, it\u0027s a lot more impressive from the inside. The main warehouse is that one over there isn\u0027t it Halnie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie nodded happily. \u201CIt is. Two new warehouses though, Tom! Looks like there\u0027s going to be a lot more to see this time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Stratus team walked over to the main gates. Thomplin\u0027s eyebrows lifted as he saw the new doorway cut into the gates with a freshly painted Reception sign over it. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie gaped in astonishment as she followed Thomplin. Inside, the previously dingy warehouse was now brightly lit. The piles of junk that she remembered from the last visit had been corralled down one side and much of it was now neatly organised on a huge set of storage racks. Sets of enormous metal tubes were suspended from the ceiling girders, presumably to be turned into fuel tanks at some point. In the middle of the floor, two partially completed capsules rested on wooden cradles with what looked like a small army of kerbals working on them. A row of workbenches were placed nearby, with various parts neatly arrayed on them. Towards the back of the warehouse, other kerbals were busily assembling other parts of the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin was starting to look more impressed, especially at the partially assembled capsules. Before he had time to go and inspect them in more detail, a bell jangled overhead and Jeb emerged from the Reception office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi, Halnie, Thomplin, good to see you again!\u0022 he said cheerfully. \u201CAnd good to meet you too, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie made the introductions. \u201CShervin, this is Jebediah, owner, company manager and pilot. Jeb - this is Shervin, our director of engineering.\u0022\u00A0The two kerbals sized each other up and both inclined their heads politely. Jeb turned to Halnie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI sure hope you guys brought some more tanks with you,\u0022 he said. \u201CWe\u0027re just about as far through the assembly of Mohos Two and Three as we can get without them. We used most of them to build the Moho 1 of course, so we don\u0027t have many left.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Halnie grinned. \u201CWe\u0027ve got them in the van, Jeb. That was quite some order you placed. I hope the last set worked out?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hope they did as well,\u0022 said Jeb, \u201CI hope they did as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin was looking politely confused. \u201CYou\u0027ll forgive me for asking,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut I don\u0027t really see where our tanks fit in here. They do hold quite a lot for their size of course but I presume you\u0027re not using them as fuel tanks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Jeb glanced at him. \u201CActually we do,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut only to power the maneuvering thrusters. They\u0027re a pretty important part of the booster as well but I can show you more of that in a moment if you\u0027d like?\u0022\u00A0He cleared his throat.\u00A0\u201CSorry, I havn\u0027t really explained the plan for the next couple of days. I thought we\u0027d spend some time today touring the facilities here. Things have changed quite a bit around here since Thomplin and Halnie were here last and of course Shervin hasn\u0027t seen much of anything yet. This afternoon, we\u0027ll head out to the Space Centre and we can get you all set up with your stand. Some of the team here took the liberty of preparing some material for you which you might like to take a peek at. You\u0027re all very welcome to stay and meet the rest of the team this evening - Ornie is a pretty fair hand with a barbecue and the weather is about right for one tonight!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked at the Stratus team solemnly. \u201CTomorrow is launch day,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cso I\u0027m going to be a bit busy I\u0027m afraid but Ornie has volunteered to show you around and generally sort things out for you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s fine, Jeb,\u0022\u00A0said Thomplin, \u201CIt\u0027ll be good to see Ornie again. I guess you\u0027ll be busy with the flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb coughed modestly. \u201CIn a manner of speaking,\u0022\u00A0he replied,\u00A0\u201Calthough as the pilot, I hope I\u0027m not going to be \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E busy. Just an easy couple of orbits around Kerbin, re-entry and splashdown off the coast. If everything goes to plan we may try a couple of manevers too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin looked startled. \u201CYou\u0027re the \u003Cem\u003Epilot,\u003C/em\u003E Jeb?\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CIsn\u0027t that a bit risky? What happens to the company if...\u0022\u00A0His voice trailed away in embarassment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked him squarely in the eye. \u201CIf I don\u0027t come back?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin nodded unhappily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shrugged. \u201CI\u0027ve left instructions to cover that,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThe company will probably change its name but there are plenty of good people on the team who\u0027ll be able to carry it on without me. Seriously though, Thomplin, I\u0027ve got a lot of good friends on the this team. How can I possibly let any of them fly a spacecraft that I wouldn\u0027t be prepared to fly myself?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin glanced up sharply but only saw complete conviction on Jeb\u0027s face. He looked at the younger kerbal with increased respect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, the door swung open and two kerbals stepped cautiously in to join them. Again Halnie introduced everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is Leland from KBS news. Leland, you know Thomplin and me but this is Shervin, our director of engineering and this is Jebediah, owner of the Junkyard and Spaceship Parts company and pilot of tomorrow\u0027s flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland shook Jeb\u0027s hand enthusiastically. \u201CDid I just hear that right?\u0022 he said. \u201CYou\u0027re flying into \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E tomorrow?\u0022\u00A0Jeb nodded slowly as Leland\u0027s eyes sparkled. \u201CThanks Halnie!\u0022 he said, \u201CWhen you said this would be a chance to cover a big space story, I had no idea it would be \u0027First Kerbal in Space\u0027 big! Oh sorry everyone - this is my cameraman Donbart, or just Don for short.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb rubbed his hands together briskly. \u201CRight. Now that everybody is here, how about we take a little tour. Feel free to ask any questions along the way and Don - you\u0027re welcome to take any pictures you like.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive enthusiastic kerbals squashed themselves around the table in Jeb\u0027s office. Leland and Don were practically bouncing up and down in delight with the film footage they\u0027d managed to record. Halnie was looking forward to a ride in the Whirligig later and even Thomplin\u0027s normal reserve had started to crack. Privately, Shervin thought that the most impressive part of the tour had been the engine test stands, the obvious level of detail and attention paid to the testing and the willingness of the propulsion team to discuss the problems they\u0027d faced. Their candid admission that they hadn\u0027t told him \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E about the new engine was reassuring too in its way. A little competitiveness was good and he really couldn\u0027t blame them for not spilling out all their secrets in front of the KBS news team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb retrieved a long cardboard tube from the corner and gingerly pulled out two rolls of thick shiny paper. He unrolled the first one onto the table and carefully weighed down the corners with odds and ends from his desk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland and Don looked decidedly puzzled but the Stratus team were fascinated. The poster showed a labelled cutaway drawing of a rocket booster, showing it\u0027s internal workings, including a spherical pressure tank which had been highlighted in red. The label for that part was prominently labelled with the Stratus company logo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCamrie, from our systems and logistics team, put these together,\u0022 said Jeb, \u201CWe thought you might be able to use them on your stand tomorrow. The other one is a schematic of the Moho capsule reaction control system - another part of the spacecraft which depends on a Stratus tank. I think Bill has some photos of the Moho 1 on the launch pad too - complete with Stratus logo on the lateral boosters. Incidentally, if all goes well, Camrie is slated as our pilot for the Moho 2 flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Reaction control system?\u0022\u00A0asked Shervin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie jumped in before Jeb could reply. \u201CThe steering system for the capsule once it\u0027s in space - right, Jeb?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded.\u00A0\u201CThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E also includes the retrorockets to bring the capsule out of orbit. Basically a slightly bigger version of the thrusters you and Thomplin saw, Halnie. Same idea though - and also powered by a Stratus tank.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin kept his face carefully impassive. \u201CSo what happens if there\u0027s a problem with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor his part, Jeb kept his voice deliberately casual. \u201CDepends what goes wrong and when, Shervin. Anything from leaving me stranded in orbit to burning up on re-entry. We\u0027re not just exaggerating for the sake of advertising - those tanks really are a vital part of the spacecraft.\u0022\u00A0Jeb smiled faintly. \u201CAnyway, lets move on. We\u0027ve got time for a closer look at the Moho 1 and a tour of the Space Centre before Ornie fires up the barbecue!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, Leland and Don were wide eyed as they watched the crowds pour through the gates. The launch was several hours away yet but the Space Centre was already getting crowded. Leland still thought that \u201CSpace Centre\u0022\u00A0was a slightly grandiose name for a pair of grandstands and a couple of, admittedly large, marquees. The commentary box was nice though, perched high above one of the stands to give him a good view of the launch and with a direct radio link to Mission Control so he could follow the details of the flight. \u003Cem\u003EThen again\u003C/em\u003E, thought Leland to himself, \u003Cem\u003EMission Control was fairly impressive with it\u0027s large display screens and control desks for the flight controllers\u003C/em\u003E. Presumably Jeb had spent most of his money there rather than on the rest of the Centre facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that anyone seemed to mind. The atmosphere was positively festive with young kerbals running helter-skelter over the grass - most of them wearing toy space helmets or clutching cardboard rockets. Leland grinned to himself - it looked like the Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products stand was doing some good business. He couldn\u0027t help noticing that some of the older kerbals were also carrying more sophisticated versions of the children\u0027s toys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver at the far corner of the field, a makeshift stage had been erected and the distant strains of musical instruments being tuned up drifted through the air. Leland shook his head. He figured that Jeb had been kidding about the preflight entertainment but apparently not. He tapped Don on the arm and pointed over at the stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COrnie said he\u0027d meet us by the stage. We should probably get over there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon nodded and packed up his cameras.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the KBS team strolled towards the stage, they could see Ornie waving at them. At that moment a huge roar went up from the crowd as four kerbals walked out and picked up their instruments. The tallest one strode over to the microphone and waved to the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHello Barkton! It\u0027s Launch Day and we are... Fire in the Sky!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlright - let\u0027s see your hands in the air Barkton! This one is called... Thunderbird!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe band launched enthusiastically into their opening number. A huge smile spread across Don\u0027s face as he started swaying along to the music. Ornie grinned. \u201CThey\u0027re only a local band but they\u0027re good - and their music definitely puts you in the mood!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood name too,\u0022 commented Leland.\u00A0\u201CFire in the Sky is about right for today.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie chuckled. \u201CApparently they used to call themselves the Crash Test Dummies,\u0022 he said. \u201CBetween you and me, most of the team thought that was pretty funny but we think Geneney had a little word with them and uhh persuaded them to change their name if they were going to play at the Space Centre.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland laughed.\u0022Yes - not really the image you want for a rocket launch. C\u0027mon Don, we\u0027ve got some interviews to run.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonbart looked wistfully back at the stage and then, rather reluctantly, followed Leland into the crowds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon held the camera steady and trained on Wilmy and Leland as the crowds flowed around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what does your brother do in the space program, Wilmy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a note of pride in the kerbal\u0027s voice as he answered Leland\u0027s question. \u201CHe started off as an engineer, working on the rocket boosters. Now he\u0027s training to be a kerbonaut and he\u0027s going to be commanding the Moho 3 flight!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCongratulations, Wilmy. That\u0027s a big career move though from engineer to pilot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, he\u0027s still an engineer. That\u0027s how things work at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E - everyone helps to build the spaceships and everyone gets a chance to fly them! Wilford had only been working there for a few weeks but he got his chance just like everyone else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat sounds like quite a place to work, Wilmy - do you have any plans to follow your brother into space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh not me. Wilford was always the engineer, even back in our village he would be the one to mend things that needed mending. I\u0027m actually thinking of going kermol again, go back to the old Grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell good luck with that too, Wilmy. Thank you for talking to KBS.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland made a cutting gesture to Don. They shook hands with Wilmy and moved off into the crowd. Leland was fairly satisfied with their footage from the crowd and was considering going over to the marquee to visit the Kerlington Model Rockets stand when he nearly tripped over a diminutive kerbal in a grey cloak. He stumbled back in embarassment and bowed respectfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon Keeper,\u0022 he said and then caught sight of the green trim on the kerbal\u0027s collar and bowed even more deeply. \u201CI beg your pardon. Good afternoon Ambassador. What brings you to the Space Centre?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ambassador\u0027s wrinkled face looked up at him impishly. \u201CThe same thing that brought you here I imagine,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CThe excitement of a rocket launch and a chance to see a little bit of history being made.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland was momentarily lost for words. \u201CI, I suppose so, Ambassador. Nevertheless I\u0027m surprised...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo see a Keeper here.\u0022\u00A0finished the old kerbal.

If all goes well they should re-establish contact with the capsule in exactly one hour and twenty-two\u00A0\u00A0minutes. If something goes wrong and the thrusters don\u0027t fire for long enough, Jebediah Kerman will be faced with the daunting prospect of a difficult and dangerous re-entry, alone on the far side of Kerbin. Even if he survives re-entry, Mission Control will have no way of finding the capsule once it lands.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll around the Space Centre, the festival atmosphere was long gone as thousands of kerbals waited anxiously for more news. The control bunker was packed with members of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society, eyes fixed on the screens.

Gradually the applause died away and the commentary turned to technical details of burn timings and re-entry interfaces as the camera panned around the surprisingly small looking room. The picture zoomed in on a map of Kerbin, with the flight path of the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 1\u003C/em\u003E superimposed on it and then faded to black as the voices of the flight director and the pilot faded out with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe screen brightened again as the scene from Mission Control was replaced by a view over the rail of a large boat. Either the sea was rather choppy or the cameraman hadn\u0027t quite got his sea legs because the picture was rocking erratically. A clock was counting down in one corner of the screen and the KBS commentator was busily explaining that if all had gone to plan, the flight control team should have established contact with the capsule by the time the clock reached zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly two minutes were left as the camera tilted towards the sky and began to pan back and forth as the cameraman hunted for any signs of the descending capsule. The voice of the flight director could be heard in the background calling out to the pilot, although all that could be heard in reply was the hiss and crackle of static. Obrick gnawed on one knuckle as he waited ;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C....to Control.

Standing by for drogues.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA great cry went up from the boat and the view from the camera tilted and blurred as the cameraman tried to find the capsule. There was brief flash of orange and the camera darted sharply back and zoomed in to the sight of two large orange parachutes unfurling against the clear blue sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe read you on the mains Jeb - welcome home!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick felt as drained as the flight director sounded as the boat pulled up alongside the bobbing capsule, its scorched sides a mute testimony to the fury of it\u0027s plunge from orbit. He watched as a team of kerbals jumped over the side and inflated a large collar around the base of the craft, before undogging the capsule hatch and swinging it open. Obrick caught a glimpse of a cramped space with the pilot strapped into his couch in the midst of control panels and other paraphernalia. As the credits rolled up the screen, the camera followed one of the recovery team as they climbed in through the hatch and helped the pilot out. The last image of the documentary was a close up of the grinning pilot, minus his helmet, sitting on a life raft in a bright orange spacesuit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flight attendant came up the aisle as Obrick flicked off the television screen. He leaned over and checked Obrick\u0027s seat belt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re on our final approach now, Mr President. Twenty minutes till landing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the plane banked low over the city, Obrick was struck once again by the simplicity of the skyline. After the drama of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s journey into space, it was curiously jarring to be reminded that for all their technological progress and forward looking optimism, kerbals were a rather traditional people at heart. Even in their capital city, most of the residential and administrative buildings were still based around the ages old Kermol hut. Where a larger building was required, kerbals tended to simply build a cluster of smaller buildings side by side, or even into each other, which gave the city architecture a pleasantly scalloped, almost organic look from the air. Indeed, many of the smaller buildings, were built around a central tree in the Kermol fashion but even where this was clearly not possible, there was an obvious fondness for building next to greenery, with the largest buildings nestling within leafy parks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane levelled out as it swooped over the city descending rapidly towards the airport. There was a rumble and then a solid thump from underneath the fuselage as the undercarriage lowered and locked into place. Even now, the view from Obrick\u0027s window was predominantly of trees and fields, although he knew that if he turned his head and looked out of the other side of the plane, he would see grey concrete and airport buildings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the briefest squeal of tyres, the plane dipped gracefully onto the runway and rolled towards a small private hangar. Obrick was pushed gently forward as the plane slowed to a walking pace. His mind was still very much on the KBS documentary and he found himself wondering what it must have been like in the \u003Cem\u003EMoho 1\u003C/em\u003E, thrown forward in your seat as the rocket engines shut down and the capsule flew on towards space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the plane came to a standstill, a set of steps was quickly rolled up to the cabin door. Obrick got to his feet, picked up his bag and reflexively checked his seat, in the manner of air travellers everywhere, to make sure that he hadn\u0027t left anything behind. Satisfied, he walked down the aisle of the small passenger cabin, thanked the pilots and flight attendant and marched briskly down the steps towards the waiting car.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scalloped architecture was rather less apparent from the ground but the capital was still a very leafy, pleasant place to drive through. The buildings to either side managed to be quite colourful despite being constructed largely of dressed stone, wood and glass. All manner of building stone had been used somewhere in their construction, from clean creamy limestone to grey speckled granites and yellowy sandstones, all set off with the deep gleam of polished timbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere and there a balcony garden or a brightly dyed drape of kaya wool added a splash of vibrant colour to the more muted natural tones of the walls. Taller buildings marked the offices of various companies. These tended towards the sober, with those of the larger companies striving bravely for grandiosity. Obrick noted that the current fashion for revolving billboards was in full swing, with each office proudly displaying a spinning corporate logo on its roof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pavements running along the sides of the road were generously wide and bustled with kerbals of all sizes hurrying here and there about their business. Much of the traffic of course consisted of the ubiqitous tik-tiks and a steady stream of the small four wheeled buggies trundled past, their drivers reclining in the typical deep set chair and pedalling furiously along. There were other cars around too but they were comparatively rare and much of the roadway was given over to the buggies. As Obrick whisked quietly past, the soft hum of the car\u0027s electric motors could barely be heard over the constant tik-tik-tikking of buggy chains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe car turned a corner onto City Avenue, a wide tree lined thoroughfare that split the city into two. Halfway along the Avenue and right in the very centre of the city, surrounded by it\u0027s own park, was the Capital building. A masterpiece of kerbal architecture, Obrick knew that this was perhaps the largest building in the city and certainly one of the largest enclosed spaces. It was still built along the traditional Kerbol hut shape but cunningly designed braced arches managed to support a very much larger structure than even the most optimistic office building. Twelve smaller buildings were symmetrically arranged around the centre, each building the foot of one of six graceful arches that soared into the air and crossed far above the exact centre point of the main building. A tall flag pole jutted into the sky from the confluence of the six arches and the flag of all Kerbin fluttered proudly in the morning breeze. Picked out in white and green on a blue background, the flag was a stylised plan view of the Capital building itself. The twelve smaller circles around the centre green circle formed a flower motif symbolising Kerbin and each of the six white bars crossing at the centre of the flower, represented the people of one of its six major regionalities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe car drove up to the park gates which silently swung open to let it through. As Obrick glided past he could see the kerbal guarding the gate lift a radio to his mouth. Obrick tucked his papers back into his briefcase and gathered his thoughts as the car purred up the road and stopped outside the Capital building. The driver hopped down and held the door open for him as he climbed out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally, Obrick would have taken the time to appreciate his surroundings and perhaps take a stroll along the outer gallery that encircled the Council chambers, the better to admire the many works of art on display from across Kerbin. Today though was not a normal day and he hurried across the outer gallery and onwards towards the centre of the building. Pale sunlight gleamed through the skylights, throwing the wood panelling into sharp relief as he strode down the corridor towards a set of ornately carved doors, guarded by two kerbals. Neither guard was openly carrying a weapon but they both looked lean and alert. The ceremonial uniform of the Capital Guards also tended towards the practical rather than the excessively ornate and did not appear to be significantly impeding either kerbal as they pulled the doors open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eleven kerbals seated around the large round Council table all turned towards him as Obrick stepped into the room. He nodded briefly to the guards and the doors swung shut behind him with a very definite sounding thud. He bowed formally towards the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMisters President, mesdames President, honoured chief Ambassadors. This session of the Council of Twelve Pillars is now open.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that, Obrick took his seat at the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll all be aware,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cthe first item on the agenda today, is spaceflight and more particularly, the recent orbital flight by Jebediah Kerman.\u0022\u00A0He paused, trying to judge the reaction from around the table. \u201CAs I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll also be aware, this is not the first kerbal made object to be successfully flown into space but it is certainly the most significant one and I believe the time is right for this Council to consider its response.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal opposite Obrick cleared her throat. \u201CDo we know who this Jebediah Kerman is?\u0022\u00A0she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick nodded. \u201CSo far as we\u0027re aware, he\u0027s a small businessman and noted aerospace enthusiast. He founded the so-called Kerbin Interplanetary Society - with your indulgence, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E for short - some time ago with a group of fellow enthusiasts, presumably with the intent of doing precisely what they have just done. Until recently, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E was a small informal organisation - I understand that it was somewhat larger to begin with but membership declined as it became clear that they were taking on a rather more ambitious project than they first imagined.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll eyes were on Obrick as he continued. \u201CHowever, one of my staff has recently visited the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E headquarters in Barkton and reports that they are now a much larger concern. Indeed they have recently expanded their operation into additional premises in order to support their piloted flights. They are quite admirably open about the whole business and my aide was able to take a tour of their factory floor and crew training facilities, as well as meeting several up and coming pilots in person.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick coughed. \u201CI think its fair to say that my aide was quite overwhelmed by the experience, or at least I\u0027ve never seen him quite as excited about anything else during my time in office.\u0022\u00A0He reached into his briefcase and drew out eleven grey folders which he passed around the table. \u201CI\u0027ve taken the liberty of preparing a short briefing on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E for you to peruse at your leisure. For now, I think the questions we need to address are quite clear. Where do we envisage this going and what, if anything, do we do about it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Enemone looked unconvinced. \u201CI\u0027m still not quite sure what business this Council has with a group of amateur spacekerbals, no matter how enthusiastic. Unless you seriously believe that there\u0027s going to be some enormous demand for joyrides around Kerbin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point one of the chief Ambassadors spoke up. \u201CMadam President. I have the honour to represent the kermol in President Obrick\u0027s Regionality. As fortune would have it, my Grove is not too distant from Barkton and I have also visited the Kerbin Interplanetary Society. With all due respect, I believe that a great many kerbals \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E want to \u0027take a joyride around Kerbin.\u0027\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman reached under his chair for a large envelope and shook out a number of glossy prints across the Council table. There were several sharp intakes of breath around the table as Donman pointed at one of the prints. \u201CThat one I believe was taken on their first flight. I understand it was only taken from thirty-five kilometres up - not nearly high enough to reach space but still rather a spectacular M\u00FCnrise, as I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll agree. These others were taken from an orbiting satellite, which they were able to bring safely back to Kerbin. I find this one of sunrise from space to be particularly inspiring.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnemone frowned. \u201CWhere did you get these prints from?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy, they are available for sale at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E museum, Madam President, along with many more.\u0022\u00A0Donman chuckled, \u201CWhatever else you may say about them, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E certainly have a flair for the dramatic and an eye for an opportunity. All the prints were selling very well indeed when I was there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnemone looked resigned. \u0022Well that\u0027s that gronnek out of the bag then.\u0022\u00A0She made a half bow towards Donman. \u201CI agree, Ambassador. If nothing else, those pictures are going to stir up demand.\u0022\u00A0She looked around the table. \u201CSo what do we do about this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Chadlin chose that moment to speak up. \u201CIt seems to me,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cthat space travel should be a matter for all of Kerbin. I put it to this Council that such travel should be under the auspices of a single Kerbin-wide organisation. It need not report directly to this Council of course but I believe that a centralised agency is the best approach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick could see a number of heads nodding around the table, although some were looking more doubtful. He had to give Chadlin credit as well - the old kerbal had clearly prepared his position well and was handling the resulting heated debate with aplomb. The chief ambassadors though, was looking increasingly unhappy and Obrick decided to step in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAmbassador Aldwell - I take it you have some concerns with President Chadlin\u0027s proposal?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ambassador looked mildly startled. \u201CThank you, Mr President but I don\u0027t have any particular problems with President Chadlin\u0027s proposal. I do however, have a great many concerns about the possible impact of a sudden explosion, if you\u0027ll excuse the word, of rocket launches. Even if the rockets themselves are relatively benign - which has yet to be proved - the industrial expansion needed to build all the rockets could have a very serious environmental impact on Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other Ambassadors nodded in agreement as Chadlin spoke up again. \u201CA pertinent point Ambassador Aldwell and another excellent reason why space travel should be centrally regulated.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnemone tapped on the table. \u201CWith all respect to President Chadlin, I think he might be being just a little hasty. Despite these extremely persuasive pictures, I think it will be quite some time before swarms of kerbals are flying rockets into space. After all, there has been a total of one kerbal in space so far and that took a great deal of time and effort. I would be inclined to wait and see how matters develop before pressing for a new agency.\u0022\u00A0Enemone cleared her throat. \u201CI also note in passing that only one other company so far has taken up the challenge of spaceflight and begun building their own rockets. This is not a vast industrial expansion to my mind.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually, Madam President,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick, \u201CI believe the Ambassadors have raised an excellent point - and it occurs to me that President Chadlin\u0027s proposal would have some serious merit in countering it.\u0022\u00A0He paused for a moment, mentally checking over his next words. \u201CCouncil members, may I suggest that our response to this issue is to embrace it wholeheartedly and without reservation. We\u0027ve all seen Ambassador Donman\u0027s pictures and if nothing else, we all know our fellow kerbal.\u0022\u00A0A polite ripple of amusement spread round the table. \u201CThroughout our history, the urge to explore and seek new lands has driven much of kerbal society - and I believe that the promise of spaceflight will only feed that urge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick took a sip of water. \u201CWithout wishing to disparage the Kerbal Interplanetary Society, I believe that the long term exploration of space will not be possible in any meaningful sense if we are restricted to launching tiny cargos on large, single shot rockets. And I agree with the Ambassadors that any attempts to do so will pose a grave threat to Kerbin\u0027s environment. I would therefore like to propose a two step plan for consideration by this Council.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn the short term, we should allow our fellow kerbals to guide us. Let the new companies spring up if they so wish. Let them build, let them fly, let them dream - and let them fail. Let them compete and in so competing, let them drive forward the development of new spacecraft and new ambitions!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn the meantime, I propose that we \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E set up a central space agency and task it with developing the longer term answers to the problems of space exploration. If I may give some examples, if it should prove possible to harvest resources from the moons of Kerbin, it would save us the trouble of launching them from Kerbin. How do we set about such a task? I have no idea - but the Kerbin Space Agency will find a way! Are there alternatives to rockets that could be used to get into space. Again, I personally have no idea but the Kerbin Space Agency should be tasked with finding out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The KSA will not be a large agency to begin with of course. Barely more than a committee charged with finding the right questions to ask, let alone finding out the answers. If President Enemone\u0027s skepticism proves to be correct then it need grow no further. But if spaceflight really does take off, then the KSA will be ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were murmurs of support from around the table. Donman tapped the table in front of him. \u0022An excellent plan President Obrick and one that I believe this Council should earnestly consider. If I may make one small suggestion it would be this. Rather than be \u003Cem\u003Ewholly\u003C/em\u003E guided by the endeavours of our fellow kerbals, why not let the fledgling KSA guide their early ventures?\u00A0If I may use your example of resource gathering, then surely the first step along that path is to identify what resources are available and where they might be found? Therefore might we not set our space companies the challenge of mapping the M\u00FCn from space?\u00A0Although,\u0022 he added dryly, \u0022It may well be that simply reaching the M\u00FCn will be sufficient challenge to begin with.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Council started to look more enthusiastic as it debated the merits and the details of the Obrick-Donman proposal. Then President Chadwick spoke up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What about crew safety?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick looked him in the eye. \u0022Without wishing to be callous, I suggest that this Council does not concern itself with such matters beyond setting certain basic requirements. We should certainly ensure that rockets are not being flown recklessly over inhabited areas - ideally they should launch over the sea. As far as crew safety is concerned, I would venture to suggest that any crew, or indeed passenger in a spacecraft will be well aware of the risks and will have chosen to go regardless.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell nodded in agreement. \u0022We could of course expand the remit of the Kerbin Air Accident Board to cover investigations into similar incidents with space vehicles but beyond that, I agree with President Obrick.\u00A0Besides,\u0022 he went on wryly, \u0022if I may borrow President Enemone\u0027s expression, the gronnek is already out of the bag. I suspect that other groups of enthusiasts will attempt to launch themselves into space regardless of any decision handed down by this Council.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick got to his feet. \u0022Let us put the proposal to the vote then. Let all those against, mark their disagreement with no fear of coercion nor fear of censure nor fear of reproach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked round the table at the silent figures before him. \u0022Speak now or forever abide by the lawful decision of this Council.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe council room was quite still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very well. As it has been spoken by the Twelve Pillars, let it be written by the Twelve Pillars. And may the Kerm give us wisdom to follow our course.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=522046\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022 style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(61,101,148);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=580674\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 12\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=620415\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 14\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-22T18:45:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2020 06:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeGrey","CreatedById":61242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T22:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow\u0027s that for timing?

Once in the bag, gronneks are reasonably docile (for certain definitions of \u0027docile\u0027) much after the fashion of a hooded hawk here on Earth. Until the gronnek is adequately trained however, letting it out of the bag without due precautions is usually a bad idea, hence the well known Kerbal saying \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T10:23:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T10:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore generally, as always, thanks for reading folks!
