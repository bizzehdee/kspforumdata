Built in orbit in three stages, they class was not designed for atmospheric landing and takeoff - they were capable of carrying up to three smaller craft for planetary landings. The class was also equipped with four outer docking rings to allow the transfer of crew and fuel via shuttle/tankers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough they sturdy and capable craft, the class tended to wobble at max speeds. This was due to an imbalance of its engines during fabrication. Despite this flaw, five Moretz Class Starships were built and were were instrumental establishing the first colonies beyond Duna. Before being retired, three of the five ships of the class were lost due to the before mentioned flaw in their design. Two exploded while in transit with the loss of all hands. Another was severely damaged when one of its engine nacelles tore away while maneuvering into low orbit around Moho. Unable to stabilize the ship, the crew was able to slow the vessel at it descended helplessly towards Moho\u0027s surface. Despite severe damage upon landing, the crew survived. To this day, the ship rest eerily on the planet\u0027s surface - a solemn reminder of the hazard of space exploration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s10.postimg.org/5nk9qsn3d/screenshot0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrewn across the surface of Duna, A few battered pieces is all that remain of this experimental craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s22.postimg.org/4a5cnfwwh/screenshot1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving lost an engine, this trillium powered shuttle drifts slowly out of the Solar System into interstellar space, its pilot our of reach and beyond any hope of rescue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s24.postimg.org/lk12om7lh/screenshot3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T04:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you mean tritium.
