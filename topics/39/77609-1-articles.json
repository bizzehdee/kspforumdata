So I made a spaceplane and picked up Bill. On the return, the plane crashed (luckily I had saved). After multiple landing attempts (due to bad CoM/CoL) I gave up on that plane and sent an asteroid hunter ssto to retrieve Bill. Unfortunately, this was an early prototype (it was already in orbit) and didn\u0027t have the modifications I later added for safer landings (wider wheel-base and detachable canards for balanced CoL if the wings fell off). It only took me about 7 tries to successfully land.
