I managed to do it in two launches and by ransacking Minmus and Mun for science I was able to complete the missions in 38 kerbal days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission 1 - 2194 points\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first mission was to orbit both moons and land on Minmus. I think the part of career that I enjoy the most is seeing what you can do using just the tier 0 parts. The plan had been to just land the craft on Minmus, but then I realised that I could make use of the ability to do EVA landings so was able to get readings from several biomes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne little trick I used in this one was to do with transmitting (or rather not transmitting) crew reports. In this tier0 land power is a real problem so you don\u0027t want to waste it but you still want more than 1 crew report. So do the crew report, then go EVA and click \u0027take data\u0027 on the command pod and then get back inside. This basically moves the crew report from its slot into the data bank with all the other reports and now you can do another crew report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yZkwoomnDFM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission 2 - 9750 points\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second mission just focused on Mun and now I had all the science parts unlocked I could do a tactical strike against all Muns biomes and wipe out all that filthy science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI toyed with two approaches for this mission; do I take a lab and 1 lander with 1 set of sci gear, or do I take multiple landers, one for each biome? In the end I went with the single lander and a lab approach because it was lighter, 15 sets of experiments alone outweighed the lab even before factoring in the extra engines. Of-course a single lander is a \u0022single point of failure\u0022 if something goes wrong, but that\u0027s why Jeb piloted it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPVXTRLZFUQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah, its a fast way of getting a full tech tree unlock, but tbh, I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s a really fun way to do it. The fun is in the design, there are some great challenges to solve; working with only tier0 parts is a nice challenge, and then trying to design for optimal efficiency in the second design was great. The missions however are more of an ordeal than a pleasant session of playing your fav. game. Doing those EVA landings one after the other was quite a trial, but I\u0027m pleased to say I didn\u0027t do a single reload on that mission. The multiple Mun landings was kinda tedious and tiring, so I spiced it up by doing suicide burn landings on most. That did cause me to need to do one reload during that mission as I overshot when landing in one of the midland craters. I had plenty of fuel on the lab (I totally over calc\u0027d that!) so I could have gone back up and come back down again but it was repetitive enough without adding yet another launch-\u0026gt;docking run, so I reloaded that one \u003Cspan\u003Eplz forgive me\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft Files\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve put the craft files up if you want them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/twe2tmlzxt1gg8b/PrimOrbital.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrimOrbital\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E - the tier 0 craft from the first mission\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/9wfencwvgb3zvg4/MoonMaster.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoonMaster\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E - the craft from the second mission\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second one you need the tech tree unlocked like this;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/pYWxVHX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pYWxVHXh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pYWxVHXh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould prob say something about the way querky way these craft work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith PimOrbital timing is everything. Throttle up to start with, it may be all SRB\u0027s but have a full throttle ready. Fire the first stage and then wait about 5 seconds before firing the 2nd \u003Cstrong\u003Ethis is really important\u003C/strong\u003E. The stage that has the extra command pods (for sas) has to run out before the stage that it is connected to. Otherwise when it seps it will be unbalanced and will smash into the main craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo work the explody sep system you need to time it so you fire the next stage just before the current stage runs out, but it must be before it or it won\u0027t be hot enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re on final set of 4 boosters you\u0027ll prob pick up some heat effects and when you sep that stage the explosion will knock you about and you have to compensate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have taken an optimal ascent path (and you want a really wide path for this) then the final SRB can push you way up to a 500\u002Bkm Ap. That maybe too high so you can cut that SRB off early by firing up the main engine (this is why I say to have throttled up already cos you suddenly want to explode the SRB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second craft is a bit more conventional, just has some odd action group setups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has extra science pods on the side which are intended for doing atmo science during the launch and are then jettisoned. Some of their action groups overlap with other functions which might seem odd. The lander will automatically run a grav report when you lower it\u0027s landing legs, this is so I didn\u0027t forget to run one from just above the biome and then its other main action group (sorry can\u0027t remember the no right now) will run all the other tests (and a 2nd grav report) and lower the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had real problems picking up the materials and goo reports from the lander. You have to go round behind it and hover about (and break solar panels off) to get at them, I should have put a second ladder on the back to make that easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for once these craft are pure stock, so I can share them with ease!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-13T12:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2014 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded craft files\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T22:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[REACTION IMAGE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat video says It all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou is KSP Mastah.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-25T16:57:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2014 04:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T05:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E....................................\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T19:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is impressive, must have taken you some time to get this right katateochi, stickied for August \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T00:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is impressive, must have taken you some time to get this right katateochi, stickied for August \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for stickying this for me Sal!
