So I experiment with removing it entirely, creating the illusion of being in space and docking to a space station - on fire - at only a few hundred metres above ground at 2300m/s. I then experiment with increasing the drag value - multiplying it by approximately 1,500,000 and then watching helplessly as the solar system practically tears itself apart!\n\nEnjoy! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nhk1BPQxoHE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:12:25Z","Content":"Haha!\n\nGreat video, very funny!\n\nNice parody as well!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T14:17:37Z","Content":"The best KSP madness that I\u0027ve seen in a long time ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
