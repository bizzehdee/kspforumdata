I remember I had a VERY early copy of the demo version. This was back when there was only the VAB and launch pad, in testing the old demo I found out there was no map mode, lol. Originally thought I would build a craft and do the whole import thing, but as it turns out the old version used dae files for the parts which Blender can natively import. It did use craft files, but as the parts are different I\u0027m not sure if the craft importer would work so I just did something simple with the chute and capsule.\n\u003E \n\u003E The textures didn\u0027t import with the model, but that wasn\u0027t an issue as the textures were in separate folders for each part. Luckily the models did come with UV coords so it was easy to texture, except I did have problems with the chute. I did have to modify the models in a text editor slightly, to remove something about diffuse, which may have been the references to the textures, but Blender didn\u0027t like it with those references included.\n\nAnyway...now I can move on to another scene I had an idea for, which will end up being an animation. I\u0027m planning on modeling the buildings at KSC, so it\u0027ll take some time, but I\u0027ll post some renders as I get parts done."},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T01:58:14Z","Content":"I remembered after I posted the above, that I had planned on doing some stuff to the original rendered image in GIMP.

Everytime I turn around your out doing yourself. That is one snazzy looking dish you\u0027ve got going there! Can\u0027t wait to see it all textured and such.\n\nYeah, those cycles settings can get ya every time. You can try killing the Reflective Caustics under the render/light paths settings. Might clean it up some and slightly improve render times. Also setting the Multiple Importance switch on your light source will help get rid of noise, usually anyway. The option is hiding under the lamp drop down for your light source. Really helps when you add any sort of area lamps or sharp glossy objects. Another multiple importance settings is in your global world settings. Not specifically sure how they relate to one another but I\u0027ve seen them both used concurrently."},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T15:36:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sheesh Sma!

I do find that the studio backdrop renders tend to produce the more realistic looks. Even when you use 3 or more light sources in an actual scene. I\u0027ve seen the multiple importance switch, but never messed around with it much I\u0027ll give it a try with my next render. \n\nOn an unrelated note, I had just been uploading my images go imgur thinking I was logged in, which apparently I wasn\u0027t, so now they don\u0027t show up in my uploaded images. Not that it\u0027s really a problem, I can upload them when I\u0027m logged in if I want to keep track of them I guess. I was just wondering if anyone more familiar with imgur knows if there is a way to move them to my account, which I\u0027m guessing is no lol. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I posted this one on the addon page to show that I have it working with the updated version of the addon.
