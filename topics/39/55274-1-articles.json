And I won\u0027t use candles, but LEDs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I wanted so somewhat document the process here, in case anyone would like to follow the Idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Parts that actually get cut out are not explicitly classified, but basically the background will get cut out, and internal lines will translate into sort of highlights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started this first sketch to get some general Ides of the layout and the used designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that I did transfer and rescale the pencil sketch with some changes on the Plywood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I was also able to saw out all of with with an electric jigsaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I need 2 sides, I used screws to stick them together. Albeit that arose some other issues in regards to the working table of the electric jigsaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut any ways, I\u0027m quite happy with the result. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I managed to get the missing part - assembly and lighting done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELighting took it\u0027s time due to too short cables from the string lights. I had to prolong them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe warned though, IO know what I\u0027m doing in terms of that electric stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I learned, how cheap those string lights were made... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyways, I added those drilled separator pieces in, after I glues the LEDs into some of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI placed them pretty much everywhere where I wanted some support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I glued the front onto it, and it was finished.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/bDvxP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
