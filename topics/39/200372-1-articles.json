This will not be recreated with full realism because I will be adding a Kerbal touch to the mission. Part 1: Building Perseverance has been released, with Parts 2 and 3 being released the weekend after Perseverance\u0027s landing.

I am deeply sorry for the long delays, but my laptop\u0027s fan whirred extremely loudly, so I had no choice but to give it a rest for a day or two.
