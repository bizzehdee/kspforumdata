Its surprising, isn\u0027t it, how much a species can advance in so little time? But, of course, with every advancement, there are two setbacks. Life expectancy is 20% lower then it used to be back in those days, even with their dodgy rockets. Why? Technology, quite ironically, considering it\u0027s purpose is to increase our quality of life. Chaos ensues the Cosmos, all for the sake of a chunk to call \u0027home\u0027 The main reason people want a chunk to call home is because we had to abandon Kerbin 100 years ago because the entire planet had become extremly radioactive.Corporations that were there to earn money capitalised on this, and build large space cruises to send millions into space. We have never returned. Corporations nowadays have as much power as they have money, and are full of hollow, conceited kerbals. They often endorn black suits, probably to reflect their evil. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir?\u0022 a Kerbal says, standing in the doorway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes Gene?\u0022 I reply\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sorry for interupting you, but you are needed in the bridge. It\u0027s important\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I will be there immediately. Could you Debrief me on the situation?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe walk through the bleak, industrial hallways. I\u0027ve noticed that Gene is walking stiffly. Must be because he isn\u0027t used to the magneto-boot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Two ships have been detected fighting 200 Kilometres away, and from how big they are on our sensors, they must be dreadnoughts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ok. I still don\u0027t see how this is an emergency.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Most dreadnoughts do not have scavenger drones, so this could be an opportunity to get extremely valuable goods for our next route next quarter.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rusted door slides to reveal yet another bleak, industrial room. Computers bleep and the pitter-patter of magneto-boots is clearly audible. In the centre of the room stand two chairs, one has a throttle gauge, computers, a fuel gauge, a display and a respirator. The other has computers displaying schematics of unapproved designs, another respirator and a microphone. I sit at the latter of the chairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Captain\u0022 Said the kerbal in the other chair \u0022 What should we do about the detected ships.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Monitor them for now pilot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, sir. Yes, sir. Bloody YES, SIR! Oh how much I hate that phase. Its robotic, shows absolutely no personality and just depresses me. Are they scared to voice their own opinion because I am their captain? Whatever the reality it, we have business to attend to. A bright flash rises over the horizon of Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Explosion detected sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Indeed. Maudin, have you determined the cause of the explosion?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It appears to have been caused by a mixing of two fuel times. These fuel times are extremely volatile and when mixed create an endothermic reaction.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So there\u0027s been a serious hull breach. Any idea on who owns the ship?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Judging by the fact that It\u0027s a Octagonal Prism, It is most likely that it is an X-plore Co dreadnought.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir! The Second dreadnought has initiated it\u0027s primary thrusters, the projected trajectory is Duna!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Move in to the first dreadnought. The ship is either destroyed or is having life support issues.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, if it is destroyed, then we are risking damaging the Exodus!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Move in, that\u0027s an order!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we approach closer, the green giant, Jool, rears it\u0027s magnificent head. She sparkles like a gem, lost in the void of space. I wonder, is this what Kerbin used to look like? It would have been a splendid sight to behold, but alas, Kerbin is a dead husk of herself. Soon, the beauty of jool is obstructed with chunks of steel. Seems to be quite the metaphor for what kerbals are doing to our home. Soon, the Ugly octagonal wreckage is revealed, embalmed with the word \u0027Prometheus\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The XCF Prometheus, the flagship of the X-plore co, destroyed. the thing that made me become a pilot... gone.\u0022 The pilot remarks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good riddance to bad rubbish, in all honesty Dean\u0022 I say in reply \u0022C\u0027mon, we have a dreadnought to salvage.

Gene say, strapping on his jumpsuit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Computers, the Server, Engines, Data, Weapons, anything that\u0027s worth salvaging.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are you sure about this, sir?\u0022 Karla asks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022About what?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022About scavenging the flagship of the largest corporation in the solar system?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s no use to them, is it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I guess not, but it seems a bad idea, after all, the X-plore Co have never liked their ship\u0027s \u0027grave\u0027 being looted.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, It\u0027s first come first serve in this world, Karla, you\u0027ll understand when your my age.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haul a heavy square backpack that has a mask crudely attached. This EVA pack is about all we could afford. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is everyone ready?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022 they replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe clamber in a small, sleek craft, the door shuts behind us. a lifting sensation is felt. the ship suddenly jerks forward, eager to go to it\u0027s destination. As soon as the ship jerked forward, we arrived at a intangible mess of steel. the doors opened as the air spurt out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What have I told you about conserving oxygen, Gene?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022put the oxygen into the holding ballasts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe clamber out of our seats weightlessly and start to explore the wreckage. for some time, nothing interesting was found. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir! I\u0027ve found an unusual warhead. Could you check it out?\u0022 Maudin said across the communicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I arrived, a unusual, round object was thrusted into my face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It appears to be a Multi-Missile. a concept that was abandoned after precision lasers were common use. Why would it be on a flagship?\u0022 Maudin said\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because, Maudin, a precision laser cannot hit many missiles at once. They are simply not designed to do so.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see, Perhaps we should analyse this at the Research lab?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Take it back to Exodus, you know what to do.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA monotonous few hours ensued, compared to the multi missile, all the rest of the worthwhile objects were lather lackluster. Some reactor schematics, engine schematics, Encrypted data and a substantial amount of drone parts. We took these back to the ship, and by the time we returned, we was all tired from the days work, We simply went back to our quarters, where I fell asleep soon after...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Captain!

Their worst fears were confirmed when a XCF satellite took these shocking images of the Prometheus in tatters. The other ship at the scene is believed to have destroyed the prometheus\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But thats-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It is believed to be an ex-XCF battleship called the Exodus, which is currently owned by a Captain Jebediah Rivea.

Here. Damn.\u0022 shout the crew, entering the bridge\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The facility has a weakness that only a special weapon can easily exploit. Maudin had it installed twelve hours ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, the plan is simple. gentlemen. We use the hyper focus beam to damage life support and reactor areas. it will take 3 hours for them to be repaired. Until then, the Plasma lasers cannot be fired. A ground team, including me and captain Jeb, will infiltrate the facility. The ground team will be split into three squads, Squad A go to the vault to steal the money and refined materials while Team B attempt to override the lasers. Squad C will control the personnel, with deadly force if necessary. I will command B team, Jebediah Team C and Gene will command team A. After the facillity is captured, Exodus will land and the materials and money will be transferred to the ship.
