They have a strong but light exoskeleton-like skin that protect them against extreme temperatures, winds and radiation. Apart from the whole floaty thing they look a lot like the Khvales of the Kerbin oceans. They are very rare, and make a beautiful serene song. They give birth to living cubs, who, even though they spend two years inside their mothers growing a strong hide, are very small when they get born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey can live for thousands of years, because they don\u0027t really age. All this time, they keep their slow growth going, and they can reach enormous sizes. They however rarely live that long, as the environment in the Joolian atmosphere is dangerous. They feed of plankton-like organic materials floating around in the skies. They may very well be at least semi-sentient, as they have very big brains, and as they seem to respond to each others songs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T14:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPretty sure the devs have said on several occasions that there won\u0027t be any lifeforms alien to Kerbin in KSP...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Know, but they don\u0027t have to have life forms.
