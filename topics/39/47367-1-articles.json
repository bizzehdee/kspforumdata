To be able to go toward interstellar space, this theoretical ship must have a lot of delta V and optionally 1G thrust. To get out from Kerbol SOI, we need approximately 12 km/s delta V. However, to get out from our solar system at reasonable time, we need to get our speed at least 2% the speed of light. However, this needs a lot of fuel. And there still a problem with the Kraken...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Everyone are talking about interstellar, lets go to that religion channel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Bill changes his channel again*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonk: To achieve kerbalkind highest enlightenment, we need to get out from our Kerbol SOI and go interstellar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Bill changes his channel again*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstrobiologist: What is our probable planet for our first interstellar trip? I say we probably go toward this solar system with a medium brightness star. Our telescope has detected a planet with a lot of water, and some land. They also have a primitive space program.

First we need to build ALL of the ship on the ground. Then we detonate a series of nukes below it and we ride out the wave.The engine with enough nukes and right type of nukes will have obscenely high dV to take off the ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer 2: I think that design is too wasteful. You m-still even doesn\u0027t say how they will refuel their ship at their destination. My design uses the Valkrie design, the engines are configured at the front, pulling the ship. I\u0027m using fission fragment rocket with xenon afterburn fueled by kethane converter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer 3: Well all of your solutions are too slow. I\u0027m proposing to use one of our cool looking warship and retrofit them with plasma drive and warp drive, powered by antimatter reactor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer 1: FTL drive is only in science fiction! It doesn\u0027t even exist here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer 3:\u003Cem\u003EIt is\u003C/em\u003E. Our eggheads at Exotic Propulsion Research Center finished a working prototype of a spacetime warping FTL drive. However, when they are trying to scale it up there is a problem: There isn\u0027t any electric generator with extremely high density. They think at a point to use antimatter, but they still doesn\u0027t know how to create enough antimatter to power up the warp drive. However, another group of scientists finally found the solution. They think Kerbol\u0027s extremely high magnetic field power trap a lot of antimatter collected by the core and the solar/cosmic wind interaction, and it have a lot of sunlight, so we could spam solar panels there, creating antimatter by normal means\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: So your suggestion is to build a huge space station dedicated for generating antimatter orbiting Kerbol, yes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer 3: Yes. And here is my plan: We launch a rocket toward Moho containing a kethane and ore scanner and a seed extraplanetary launchpad and ore digger and kethane miner. After we successfully land that, we launch our space station building supplies from there. It save a lot of delta V. Then if the station is finished and it have enough antimatter, we retrofit one of our warship with warp drive, use its plasma drive to dock with the antimatter refueling station, fill its antimatter storage, and start its FTL engine to warp 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: That is the best plan. Now we need to find out our destination solar system\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
