The capsule\u0027s batteries lasted less than he intended during the freefall and automatic deployment was not working. He tugged with all his might, while still keeping a watchful eye on the altimeter. Jeb did not fear danger, he lived in it.

He felt, rather than heard, the deployment right as the radar altimeter ticked past 2000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the ground, Thomfrid yelled, \u0022Good chute, good chute!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was an audible sigh from everyone in the room. Thomfid collapsed down, seating himself on the window sill and wiping the sweat from his forehead. Bob and Bill collectively shook their heads, not one bit surprised by the day\u0027s course of action yet still scared to bits by it. Chadory lowered his head and propped himself up against the control console, panting.

Bob took the time to pitch the craft down some for the orbital insertion burn they\u0027d do in a short while and then ejected the LES tower on a course to burn up in the atmosphere. Moments later, after drifting in space, they fired the upper stage again to establish an orbit.

Once again, Jeb questioned the engineers, cursing them for choosing efficiency and precision over raw unbridled power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter safely getting an orbit, they drifted around for nearly a half orbit to make some orbital corrections. They burned to reduce the eccentricity and to fix the inclination, which KSC seemed still unable to launch a rocket which did not achieve a good 1-2 degree inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all that, Bill held the craft in a nice northern orientation and decided now was a good time for a spacewalk. He closed the bottom half and finally gave control of the craft systems to Jeb, who passed up such an opportunity for his few precious moments in control of the spacecraft. Though he\u0027d never admit it, his biggest fear was not being strapped to a rocket and blasted to space, but being blasted to space with no control. He was utterly terrified of the idea of being aboard such a lethal machine with zero control over it. The fear was only eased by knowing his brothers were in control of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3697/12390927495_fd6f7393af_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212390927495_fd6f7393af_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill depressurized the upper cabin and opened the hatch, slipping out and drifting in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3763/12390919665_8e99a45cb7_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212390919665_8e99a45cb7_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob looked out his window and to his astonishment, there was his brother waving at him. \u0022I wanna come out there, hold up!\u0022 he called on headset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/12391070073_03bbe5868c_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212391070073_03bbe5868c_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob popped out the hatch and was hit with terror.

He was addicted to danger, but he wasn\u0027t dumb. He knew about reentry heating and that a surface dive doesn\u0027t work out well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe drew out the trajectory on his display, oriented the craft, and fired the engine. Under the pressure of golden hot plasma plumes of exhaust, the craft slowed itself, slowly falling back to Kerbin. The plotted trajectory would take them down just to the west of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/12391056713_c0600060a0_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212391056713_c0600060a0_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they hit the atmosphere, they jettisoned the service module and let it drift away, it\u0027s destruction imminent. The capsule fell, held in it\u0027s orientation by the air which began to scorch it. The heating was nothing intense, but it was enough to make the engineers later think twice about their decision to use basic thermal shielding rather than a dedicated heat shield. The parachute fired and the three were all mildly concerned. Jeb hated it when the things he counted on for when his crazy schemes went wrong didn\u0027t work. The chute was new, designed for the larger capsule, but that came with higher structural stresses and less strength against sudden inflation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/12391037823_bdda5fe53f_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002212391037823_bdda5fe53f_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAleviating the tension in the capsule air, the chute deployed safely and they drifted to the ground.
