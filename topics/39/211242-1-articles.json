I have played this game a lot since I got it around 2016, and it is due a 2023 sequel so I thought I would make a review on it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Starting with the gameplay, it is quite addicting, but does take about 30 minutes to get used to the mechnanics and controls, and about an hour to get to orbit, speaking about controls, I would try flying a plane, they have similar controls to the rockets, but are more easy to fly(mostly). The mode for making crafts is very easy to use and you just drag and drop parts. You have a whole solar system to explore aswell(if you make a craft with enough fuel, that is.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, the game has 3 gamemodes, career mode, science mode, and sandbox. To a beginner, I would recommend getting a hang of things in the unlimited funds sandox mode to focus on learning the controls, weight distribution(so your rocket doesn\u0027t tip over) and what engines to use to put your payload into orbit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0Moving on, lets look at the general experience, the game will run usually at around 10-30 frames per second \u00A0on a standard 2013-2016 laptop, around 20-30 on a standard 2017-2018 laptop, and usually 30\u002B on anything after then. The game is quite well polished and only has a few bugs(the only bug i have is just some minor shadow flickering). One thing I have noticed is that some of the collision is a bit janky on some of the landing gear, but that can usually be fixed by changing some tire traction settings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes it hold up about a year after its last major update in 2021? I think it does and I think it will get even better as more bug fixing and graphics mods are released. I think anyone interested in rockets, areodynamics, and just anyone in general should give it a try when its still on sale in the Steam Winter Sale.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTranslated 80 times:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRead the beautiful images of Karbala. I\u0027ve been playing since I bought it in 2016 and I\u0027m looking forward to 2023.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0You have 30 minutes to find the game and 1 hour to find the developers and drivers. It is very impariseAi tried to make the plane follow the missile but it didn\u0027t work. Easy to use, just rub the clay into your fingers (if you work in high salt conditions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, there are trher ways game mode: game mode, studio mode and box mode. First, it features an asymmetric design that helps distribute weighti and at tracking compression (for muscle maintenance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Tested 10-30 fps, 20-30 fps on 2017-2018 and earlier 2013-2016 cars. 30 fps (my only problem is rain). I have a very heavy pan... but it can be reused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big 2021 update hopefully fixes bugs and new settings. I think you should try snow and ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-30T18:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Fan Works.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-01T17:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHahaha\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1 rep ;)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abel Military Services","CreatedById":219257,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-18T05:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Royalswissarmyknife","CreatedById":216092,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-14T20:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have 30 minutes to find the game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-14T20:02:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2023 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Royalswissarmyknife\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebIsBestPilot","CreatedById":207984,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T15:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224232254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211242\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221676404925\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022216092\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Royalswissarmyknife\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/14/2023 at 2:02 PM, Royalswissarmyknife said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have 30 minutes to find the game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsounds like a horror movie plot-pint\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Royalswissarmyknife","CreatedById":216092,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T17:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224249882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211242\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677770716\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207984\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JebIsBestPilot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, JebIsBestPilot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsounds like a horror movie plot-pint\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EAnd 1 hour to find the developers and drivers\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalsaurus","CreatedById":222386,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T18:06:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224214155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022211242\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221672424011\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022222090\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RandomGrape\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/30/2022 at 1:13 PM, RandomGrape said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRead the beautiful images of Karbala.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a very heavy pan... but it can be reused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read the beautiful images of Karbala.
