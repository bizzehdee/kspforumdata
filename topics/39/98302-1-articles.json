I\u0027m not going to pretend I\u0027m happy about this, but I have had a perfectly civil discussion with Master Tao on the issue and I can\u0027t really argue with the reasoning behind the decision. I have also not been subjected to any official sanction for -let\u0027s face it- not so much bending board rules as tying them in knots, despite the fact they have ample grounds for slapping me with a lengthy ban according to a strict interpretation of forum policy, so \u003Cem\u003Eplease\u003C/em\u003E let\u0027s not have any board drama over this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t link to the thread directly, but if you want to re-read the story and follow the as-yet untitled sequel, please come find me at one of the following forums:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forums.spacebattles.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpacebattles\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESufficient Velocity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022bbs.stardestroyer.net%5B/url\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStardestroyer.net\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point there\u0027ll also be a PDF or other ebook edition, but that\u0027s a long-term project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone for their advice, support and encouragement throughout the writing process of this story; it means an awful lot to me.
