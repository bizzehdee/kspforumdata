I still think Water\u0027s Boiling Point and Freezing Point at 1 Kerbin Atmosphere would be the measure for temperature, much like Celsius. However, science will probably use Kelvin.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t understand the time stuff. What is it based on exactly? Additionally, I don\u0027t think the Electricity stuff makes sense. (Though neither does the Kerbal power system anyway.)"}]}
