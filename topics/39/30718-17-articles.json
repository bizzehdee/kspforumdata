After that, promulgating a new law that required the cutting down of a Kerm (even to prevent a greater tragedy) would have been culturally unlikely. Lots of reasons - in part it would be seen as a regression to the \u0027barbaric\u0027 past, in part it would be sheer weight of history (the kerbals have been Kerm symbionts for a very long time by now) and in part it I like to think it would have been natural repugnance at deliberately mutilating a conscious being that you can share emotions and experiences with. Not to mention that you can ask said conscious beings for bountiful harvests - and get them! If you can get miracles to order - you don\u0027t bother questioning them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T12:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Redmen","CreatedById":107613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T20:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFantastic!!!

Why don\u0027t we have a single enormous Grove on each continent made of thousands of Kerm linked together into one super-being?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Law of...\u0022,\u00A0began Gerselle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman nodded. \u201CIndeed - the Law of Thirty Seven. But laws are a kerbal creation, Gerselle. Why should the Kerm obey them too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey don\u0027t,\u0022 said Gerselle, \u201CGrove \u003Cem\u003Elaw\u003C/em\u003E is just a collection of instructions.\u0022\u00A0She laughed shortly. \u201CMore like a collection of warnings. Jonton and I found out the hard way the true reason for planting Groves a day\u0027s walk apart.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Law of Territory,\u0022 said Donman, \u201CThe second oldest law on Kerbin, after the Law of Thirty Seven.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell that certainly explains why we couldn\u0027t find either of them in the Archives,\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle tartly, \u201CAre you going to get to the point, Ambassador?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerm leaves rustled behind her. \u201CGerselle...\u0022,\u00A0said Jonton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman shook his head. \u201CIt\u0027s quite alright.\u0022\u00A0He looked at Gerselle. \u201CThirty seven Kerm have the beginnings of personality and the barest inkling of self. A thirty eighth Kerm is enough to tip the balance towards full self awareness but it all happens too fast to control. Awareness unlocks a storm of disorganised and disjointed memories and the new personality simply doesn\u0027t have time to make sense of them before it breaks under the strain and shatters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle blinked. \u201COh,\u0022\u00A0she said in a small voice. She thought for a moment. \u201CWhat happens to the old Kerm?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt dies,\u0022\u00A0said Donman bluntly. \u201CA long painful death I imagine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFar worse than that, Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton bitterly. \u201CIt endures a long painful life. Remove the thirty eighth tree and the broken fragments of mind will eventually heal, although the healing is rarely complete. We... \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E was one of the lucky ones that survived mostly unscarred. A lot of us weren\u0027t so lucky and for many many others it was kinder to burn them to the ground than to let them live.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe leaves around Jonton\u0027s head lashed back and forth in agitation. \u201CI think some of my kerbals must have tried to help the Shattered Groves. I can still remember the screaming as the broken Kerm pleaded for the fire.\u0022\u00A0His face twisted. \u201CAlthough perhaps those are just my own memories. Right now its hard to tell.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle gaped at him. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EYour\u003C/em\u003E kerbals, Jonton? And which shattered Groves?\u0022 She buried her head in her hands, grimacing as her fingernails dug painfully into her temples. \u201CI don\u0027t understand any of this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton and Donman looked at each other. Donman dipped his head in acknowledgement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy kerbals,\u0022 said Jonton at last. \u201COr our kerbals. Sometimes it seems like both at the same time.\u0022He closed his eyes. \u201CDo you remember the black spots on the leaves?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s face was still hidden but Jonton saw her nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI still don\u0027t know really what they meant but as soon as I saw them we feared the worst. Even then, I think my kerbal got here just in time.\u0022Jonton groaned. \u201Cwe... \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E went into communion just in time to witness us, me, our... \u003Cem\u003Ethe Kerm\u003C/em\u003E shattering. Somehow I absorbed the fragments.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s voice shook. \u201CA fragment. Such a poor word for a hundred years or more of somebody else\u0027s thoughts and dreams and memories smashing into your mind. I don\u0027t even know how many there were - I just remember everything going black and then a voice screaming \u003Cem\u003EBad tree! Bad tree!\u003C/em\u003E A precarious anchor to reality but just barely enough to stop me Shattering too. I managed to open my eyes and saw Joenie pummelling our trunk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton lifted a hand and peered at it curiously, watching the pull of tendons under the skin as the fingers flexed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe remember telling you to witness my right of Conclave,\u0022 he said \u201Cand then you vanished. Ever since then I\u0027ve been trying my best to... protect is a good word. Yes, protect the shards and try to make some sense of them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle lifted her head and stared at him. \u201CAnd have you made sense of them, Jonton?\u0022\u00A0she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton plucked at a leaf. \u201CA little bit,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThere\u0027s an awful lot to make sense \u003Cem\u003Eof,\u003C/em\u003E love.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you know how long it took for the Ambassador to get here, Jonton?\u0022 said Gerselle. \u201CNearly three days. I\u0027ve been worried sick, Joenie has been crying for her father every night. How much longer will it take, Jonton!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe colour drained from Jonton\u0027s face. \u201CThree days,\u0022 he whispered. \u201CNo... no it can\u0027t be that long.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m afraid it is,\u0022 said Donman quietly, \u201CBelieve me, I came as quickly as I could.\u0022\u00A0He paused. \u201CYou just said that a Shattered Kerm will heal in time. If the shards are safe, why can\u0027t you break communion now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked at them helplessly. \u201CI can\u0027t,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CNeither of you have any \u003Cem\u003Eidea\u003C/em\u003E what I\u0027d be condemning them too. Besides, it\u0027s not...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle rounded on him furiously. \u201CIt\u0027s not what, Jonton! Not as simple as a choice between some tree and your family? Between some tree and \u003Cem\u003EJoenie\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\u00A0She stopped as Jonton\u0027s face crumpled, tears welling up in his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C...that simple,\u0022\u00A0he said in a choked voice. \u201CThe shards are \u003Cem\u003Emelting\u003C/em\u003E Gerselle. Some of my memories are still \u003Cem\u003Emine\u003C/em\u003E, most of them are still Kerm but the edges are blurring. Believe me, I\u0027m trying to stop them but it\u0027s getting harder and harder to know whether I\u0027m remembering something as Jonton-the-kerbal or Jonton-the-Kerm.\u0022\u00A0He paused. \u201CMore often there doesn\u0027t seem to be any difference. It\u0027s all just Jonton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman\u0027s eyes widened in alarm. \u201CAll the more reason to break communion now!\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CBefore you lose yourself any further.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last tear trickled down Jonton\u0027s cheek. \u201CI think it\u0027s already too late, Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWe\u0027re a Kerm of thirty nine now. Thirty eight trees - and one kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman\u0027s eyes flicked from Jonton to Gerselle and back again whilst he struggled to find something, anything to say. \u003Cem\u003ENot that I have any real choice,\u003C/em\u003E he thought. \u003Cem\u003EKerm\u003C/em\u003E hah\u003Cem\u003E knows this won\u0027t be easy for them but for the sake of all Kerbin I think that poor kerbal needs to stay exactly where he is.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow are you going to eat,\u0022 he said at last, \u201CIf you can\u0027t break communion?\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EStupid question Donman\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, \u003Cem\u003EHe can still move his arms, so he\u0027ll eat just like any other bed-bound kerbal. \u003C/em\u003E He was surprised to hear Jonton laugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s the least of my problems, Ambassador. Look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton pulled aside the leaves from around his waist and Donman suddenly felt the acrid taste of bile in the back of his throat. The things that he\u0027d taken to be roots coiled around the Keeper\u0027s legs weren\u0027t roots at all but some kind of gnarled vine. The tip of each vine had split into a dozen or so tendrils and all of them had burrowed into Jonton\u0027s torso. Some of them grew straight inwards, whilst others tunnelled under his skin in hard, ridged weals before disappearing under the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWell now you know Donman but oh sweet Kerm I\u0027m going to be seeing\u003C/em\u003E that\u003Cem\u003E for far too many nights to come.\u003C/em\u003E He was dimly aware of a soft scream and Gerselle collapsing onto the bed beside him with a thump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt looks worse than it is really,\u0022\u00A0said Jonton. \u201CI don\u0027t even feel hungry any more. That was quite a distraction for a while you know. Obviously I couldn\u0027t really have been hungry with the Kerm looking after my needs but my empty belly refused to believe it at first.\u0022\u00A0His voice suddenly rose in alarm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGerselle! I\u0027m fine, truly I am!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman\u0027s head snapped round in time to see Gerselle\u0027s eyes roll forward in their sockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s no worse than going into communion; the connections are just a little thicker that\u0027s all!\u0022said Jonton urgently. He grabbed one of the vines and tugged it. \u0022They don\u0027t hurt - this doesn\u0027t hurt!\u0022\u00A0His voice softened. \u201CCome here, my love, come here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechanically, Gerselle picked herself off the bed and walked towards him. Jonton pushed the leaves to one side as best he could and held out his arms to catch her as she stumbled towards him. Deftly he caught her and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her into a tight embrace. The Kerm leaves rustled and twined protectively about the two kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman stood up. \u201CDo you have a telephone I could use?\u0022,\u00A0he asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded at him over Gerselle\u0027s shoulder. \u201COn the table in the kitchen,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThank you, Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal on the other end of the telephone sounded sleepy and more than a little put out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDesrigh - it\u0027s Donman. Sorry to wake you at such a ridiculous hour but is Corsen there please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA-ambassador? Of course. He\u0027ll be right with you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mumbled words coming down the line were too indistinct for Donman to make out but their tone was clear enough. He held the receiver away from his ear for a moment until he heard the distinctive click of somebody picking up a second handset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAmbassador? Where are you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStill at the Grove. It\u0027s been an...unusual night. Listen Corsen, I need an advisory meeting with the rest of the Council at their earliest convenience.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll traces of sleep vanished from Corsen\u0027s voice. \u201CDo you mean an emergency meeting, Ambassador?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo - an advisory meeting will be fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, sir. Should I give a reason?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m authorising the Right of Conclave for one of my constituents. Please advise the Council that due to unforeseen circumstances, my constituent will not be able to attend in person.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorsen\u0027s gulp was audible. \u201CI\u0027ll see to it immediately, Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Corsen. I\u0027ll be at Bar-Katon airport in two hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ll book you on the next flight, sir. Usual message at the executive desk.\u0022\u00A0Corsen paused, \u201CBar-katon, sir?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBarkton. Slip of the tongue, Corsen. Like I said, it\u0027s been an unusual night.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman tapped on the sleep room door before cautiously peering into the room. Gerselle and Jonton were deep in conversation and he was relieved to see that Gerselle\u0027s face had regained some of it\u0027s colour. \u003Cem\u003EShe\u0027s resilient. Thank the Kerm for that much.\u003C/em\u003E He coughed politely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJonton, Gerselle. I need to leave now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton bowed as best he could. \u201COf\u00A0course, Ambassador. Thank you for taking the time to see us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman smiled faintly. \u003Cem\u003EJust like that. A little social call to smooth out a minor problem or two.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy pleasure, Keeper. You\u0027ll be glad to know that your right of Conclave has been granted but I trust you\u0027ll have no objections if I petition the Twelve Pillars on your behalf?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt would be an honour, Ambassador. Please convey my apologies to the Council for my... indisposition.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman\u0027s voice was suddenly serious. \u201CI\u0027ve convened an immediate session of the Council, Jonton. I shall do my best to explain but I shall also formally recommend that each of the Pillars pay you a discreet visit. You may consider your unreserved cooperation to be a mandate from the Council.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle bowed. \u201CNaturally, Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded solemnly. \u201COf course, Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery well.\u0022\u00A0Donman paused. \u003Cem\u003EThe usual Kerm-related pleasantries seem woefully inappropriate tonight.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u201CGood luck,\u00A0Keeper.\u0022\u00A0He turned to Gerselle.\u201CAnd to you also - Keeper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe steaming grass swished underfoot as Donman made his way through the park. Curliques of mist eddied around the graceful arches of the Capital building and swirled around the feet of the statues decorating its twelve outbuildings. Kerbol had barely lifted above the horizon and the flag of all Kerbin fluttering from the topmost flagpole fluttered against a cerise streaked dawn sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA trail of rapidly drying footprints marked Donman\u0027s progress across the central plaza. He dipped his head politely to the two Capital Guards standing silently by entrance and strode into the main atrium. Hurrying through the outer gallery, he pulled up short by the Council chamber doors, braced himself and then nodded to the guards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thud of closing doors broke the muted buzz of conversation from the Council table and eleven pairs of eyes followed Donman\u0027s silent progress towards the podium. He took a firm grip on his lectern, took a deep breath and lifted his head to face them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMisters President, mesdames President, honoured chief Ambassadors. We are assembled here today to grant the ancient Right of Conclave.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have answered the petitioner and I deem his request worthy and to be made in sound mind. Let the record note that the petitioner is indisposed and that I, Donman Kermol, have elected to speak for him. This I shall now do and I beg that the Twelve Pillars give his petition all due consideration and support.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EHere goes nothing.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFive nights ago, I was summoned to a small Grove near Barkton...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman watched the phrases of his carefully prepared speech roll over the Council. The mood around the table swiftly built from stony disapproval to mild curiosity, astonishment and then outright shock, laced with no small amount of raw fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGood.They get it. No need to labour any of this any further.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell\u0027s voice broke the stunned silence. \u201CThank you, Ambassador Donman. We hear the petition of Jonton Kermol and beg you retake your place as a Pillar of the Council.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnomone spoke up next. \u201CLet\u0027s get the minor business out of the way first. I trust we all agree that by right, this Council should hold Jonton Kermol guilty of two violations of Grove law? However, on careful reflection it seems to me that the first violation was made inadvertently during the faithful and compassionate observance of his duties and the second has brought upon him a greater punishment than anything this Council is mandated to impose. I therefore respectfully vote that the violations be struck from the record and that this Council proceed to the next item of business.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSeconded,\u0022\u00A0said Aldwell. \u201CI further suggest that this vote be decided by show of hands rather than formal ballot. Let any who disagree with President Enemone raise their hand now or forever remain silent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery well. Let us strike Jonton Kermol\u0027s transgressions from the record and move on. Ambassador Burvis?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow much time do we have Ambassador Donman?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t know,\u0022 said Donman frankly. \u201CI did ask but as you\u0027ll appreciate, it was difficult to get a definite answer from Jonton in his current state of mind. If the Council concur, I shall return to his Grove on my way back to Barkton and see if I can find out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Ambassador Donman.\u0022\u00A0Burvis looked at the faces around her. \u201CIn the meantime, I suggest that we be pessimistic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Chadlin drummed his fingers on the table thoughtfully. \u201CDo we actually know how many Groves there are on Kerbin?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurvis frowned. \u201CYou know, I\u0027m not sure we do,\u0022\u00A0she said slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think that should be our next question,\u0022 said Chadlin, \u201CWe need to know the size of the problem we face before we can devise any reasonable answers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI agree,\u0022\u00A0said Burvis, \u201Cbut how do you propose to count them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresident Obrick smiled and tapped the table for attention. \u201CVery easily, Madame Ambassador. We live in a time in which kerbals have sent artificial satellites to photograph the far side of the M\u00FCn! I\u0027m sure the same ingenuity could be applied to counting Groves from space.\u0022 He glanced at Chadlin. \u201CI shall pay a visit to Director Lodan immediately after this meeting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadlin nodded. \u201CRockomax?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lodan will have his own views but Rockomax would be my preference.\u0022\u00A0Obrick looked at Burvis. \u201CYour pardon, Madame Ambassador. Rockomax Corporation are one of the few organisations capable of launching the required spacecraft. Under the circumstances I believe they would the best choice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmph,\u0022\u00A0said Burvis. \u201CWhat about that other lot? The Kerbin Interplanetary Society or whatever they call themselves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTechnically they\u0027re more than capable,\u0022 said Obrick, \u201Cbut I think Rockomax would be the more \u003Cem\u003Ediscreet\u003C/em\u003E option for the moment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnemone cleared her throat. \u201CPresident Chadlin\u0027s comment is eminently sensible but I\u0027m unsure where it leaves us. President Obrick\u0027s proposal sounds plausible but cameras in outer space can\u0027t help us conjure up extra space on Kerbin. What happens next? What do we do with our census of Groves?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt puts an upper limit on the problem,\u0022 said Aldwell. \u201CAssuming one seed per Grove, we know how much more space we need. I think we can safely assume that we don\u0027t have nearly enough but it\u0027s still better to know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think we can do better than that,\u0022 said Donman. \u201CIf we can count Groves from space, I presume we can also make a map of Kerbin from space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022 said Obrick. \u0022Unless Director Lodan has any new tricks hidden behind his ears, we would use the spacecraft to thoroughly photograph the whole of Kerbin, stitch the photographs together to make a map and then count the Groves on the map by hand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman nodded. \u201CIn which case, why not use the map to work out the best sites for planting new Groves, making the best use of the available space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe could even allow a certain amount of overlap,\u0022 said Burvis carefully. \u201CIf the ground between planting sites isn\u0027t much good anyway, then what harm in setting it aside for the Kerm to squabble over, if it lets us pack more Groves into the available space?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not sure I agree,\u0022\u00A0said Donman slowly. \u201CIt would be stressful for both Kerm and Keeper - and we would run the risk of Shattering. We\u0027d be taking an awfully big risk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnemone snorted. \u201CWe\u0027re not going to deal with this \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E taking some awfully big risks,\u0022\u00A0she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe discussion grew steadily more acrimonious until at last Chadlin banged on the table for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is pointless,\u0022 he snapped, \u201CWe can argue about the details all we like but we all know there simply won\u0027t be enough room for all the new Groves. So what then my esteemed colleagues? What do we do when there\u0027s no room left at all?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe find a new place to live,\u0022 said a quiet voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick\u0027s heart sank. \u003Cem\u003EI knew somebody would suggest this sooner or later.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s a bold plan, President Lanrick,\u0022 he said \u201Cand psychologically speaking it\u0027s an attractive one.\u0022\u00A0He scrubbed his eyes with the back of his hands. \u201CThe practicalities however, are daunting to put it kindly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh I\u0027m certain it wouldn\u0027t be easy,\u0022 said Lanrick,\u201Cbut surely if the whole of Kerbin were behind the proposal?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEven then it would require an extraordinary effort for no guarantee of success,\u0022\u00A0said Obrick. \u201CAnd we\u0027d better hope that Ambassador Burvis\u0027s comments regarding pessimism turn out to be unfounded too. Make no mistake, Mr President - your proposal could take decades, if not longer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI understand that,\u0022 said Lanrick, \u201Cbut surely we could find some way of preserving the Kerm seeds until we\u0027ve prepared the ground for them off-world? A cold store or some such facility.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick blinked. \u201CThat might work,\u0022he said cautiously. \u201CWould you agree, honoured\u00A0Ambassadors?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell shook his head vigorously. \u201CWould you put a kerblet into cold storage?\u0022\u00A0he asked. \u201CPutting a Kerm seed there would scarcely be better. These are intelligent beings, Mr President; we don\u0027t simply lock them away in the dark for inconveniencing us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRidiculous,\u0022\u00A0said Burvis.\u00A0\u201CA Kerm tree is intelligent certainly but a Kerm seed is no more intelligent than one of my eggs. Far better to preserve the seed than condemn the Kerm to a short, brutal life of insanity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou may believe that, Madame Ambassador,\u0022\u00A0said Aldwell \u201Cbut I fear that you would find your opinion in the minority.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I believe that you\u0027ll find that most kerbals have enough common sense to see that I\u0027m right!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick lifted his hands placatingly. \u201CPlease, dear colleagues. Cold storage is only an option if President Lanrick\u0027s audacious proposal becomes a reality - which is far from certain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldwell scowled. \u201CLet the record state that I am firmly against the notion, space programme or no space programme.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd let the record also state that \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E am firmly against an irrational prejudice threatening the future of our world,\u0022\u00A0said Burvis acidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is \u003Cem\u003Eenough,\u003C/em\u003E Madame Ambassador!\u0022\u00A0Donman thundered. \u201CYou will apologise to Ambassador Aldwell for that unseemly outburst!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurvis glared at him and then grudgingly dipped her head to Aldwell. Aldwell stared at her expressionlessly before dipping his own head in response.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery well,\u0022 said Donman, \u201CI suggest we adjourn this meeting for twenty minutes to let everyone cool off. President Chadlin - would you be so kind as to summarise the results of this first session.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadlin stared down at his notes. \u201CAmbassador Donman to arrange a further meeting with Jonton Kermol; reason, to establish timescale for Kerm seedings. President Obrick to meet with Director Lodan of the Kerbin Space Agency; reason, to order the launch of a mapping satellite into Kerbin orbit. If I may make one further comment, let the record state that I think each and every one of us should arrange a visit to Jonton\u0027s Grove. We have forgotten too much of our history good kerbals and it would behoove us to correct that grave mistake as soon as possible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman stood up. \u201CI second President Chadlin\u0027s comment and add my recommendation to his. In the meantime; we need ideas and we need them now. I declare this meeting adjourned and look forward to reconvening it in twenty minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-113-legacy/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1061716\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 31\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-113-legacy/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1167693\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 33\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);font-family:Roboto, \u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-25T19:36:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2020 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos and tags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lindemherz","CreatedById":18059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T17:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHoooly ****!
