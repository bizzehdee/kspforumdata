Fully accurate coloured. My model had a little bit of discolouring on the back of the helmet however they Emailed me about it before it was sent out and offered a free re-print. But I decided to just keep that one, it\u0027s hardly recognizable however. It weighs practically nothing and makes a perfect piece for a desk or a shelf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend getting one, It\u0027s done by 3D printers.
