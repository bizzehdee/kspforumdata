This is how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start it off by posting two pictures below to begin the story. As the subject of this topic suggests, the picture are drawn in MS Paint and YOU get to decide what happens next! Every \u0027episode\u0027 of pictures I post is followed by the suggestions of you guys of what Jebediah should do next. You could base your decision on what you see in the picture or think completely out of the box. Either way, we keep this lighthearted and funny, so comical suggestions are encouraged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027ve gathered a good suggestion I will begin drawing the next episode, and so on.
