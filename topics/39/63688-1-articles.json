I can read my Sim\u0027s story almost like a book from when he first moved into town to learning new skills to buying his new house to chasing after females to settling down in a relationship to travels abroad... I can pick up playing right where I left off after months of spending time with other games because I can easily get back into the head of my character - what he was doing and working for when I last left off. I wanted to be able to do the same for my time spent with (and away from) KSP and look back at some of my more memorable launches and missions and have them play out on a timeline. Plus, it\u0027s a lot easier for other people to follow along when the story is delivered to them bite-sized via a twitter feed rather than having to read a whole blog entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to tweet while I played, however, not only would it get in the way of me playing but also spam follower\u0027s feeds over the course of a play session and have a very sporadic continuity. To get around this I use tweet schedulers - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://hootsuite.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHootsuite\u003C/a\u003E lets me schedule an unlimited amount of tweets but only at 5-minute intervals. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.gremln.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGremln\u003C/a\u003E lets me schedule tweets for any minute of the day but only 5 per hour (for the free account). Still, these two services combined allow me to build a realistic tweet timeline so even though I might execute a mission time-warped so that it lasts 30 minutes instead of 4 hours, I can schedule the mission tweets to actually span 4 hours when posted to twitter (or days, weeks ahead for longer missions). Although I may build and launch two missions in a day\u0027s worth of playing, I can schedule those missions to occur over the period of a week on twitter (launch day, a few days for recovery and analysis, second launch day). Building up a large lead time allows me to keep up a continuous stream of events without having to play every day. Which is good cause... you know... life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, this isn\u0027t just some basic log of what I\u0027m doing. As I said, this is fictive writing so the KSA account will be tweeting as if the KSA were an actual agency. There will be updates on astronaut candidate programs, educational outreach, notes on astronomical events happening in the Kerbol system, some background operations of mission control - generally 2-5 tweets per day that are \u0022filler\u0022 between the launching of missions but all of which are aimed to further build the fictive universe in which the KSA resides. For example, the agency is located on the shores of the Kerblantic Ocean at Cape Kernaveral and the world is unified under The Presider who lives in Kerbalopolis and is newly elected every 6 years. Since the game runs in 24 hour day cycles but a Kerbin rotation is 6 hours, there will be references to things like \u0022second sunrise\u0022 (9am) or \u0022fourth sunset\u0022 (12am). Kerbin is occupied by kerbals - kerbs (men) kerbettes (women) and kerblings (children). And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe @KSA_MissionCtrl account is already in full-swing. Inaugural launch has been a success to test the rocket engine design expertise of the KSA engineering team, some astronaut antics have been reported, engine issues have compounded the second launch attempt and we are about to try again to launch late this morning and test our recovery system ahead of the first kerbed mission. Why not get caught up and follow along?

A few more joined on their own and then I got to meet Scott Manley at the community meetup during GDC and he retweeted one of my tweets to him to help push me over 100.

While good reading in relation to individual missions, they fail to fully convey the entire story that is happening day to day within the KSA universe. Bill, Jeb and Bob will all quickly evolve into their own characters over the next month (new non-astronaut characters will be introduced as well), the KSA as an agency will grow to handle larger missions, and things will be happening on Kerbin, like a new 10m ground-based telescope that will provide for some entertaining filler tweets and research for future missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs explained in my original post, missions are carried out over twitter in real time, with suitable delays between missions for various things like building new rockets, studying new data, dealing with the good/bad/tragic consequences of a previous mission, etc. This means that currently the story of the KSA already extends into the beginning of May - and I plan to put in a few months more of lead time before backing off my playing time so I can return attention to other things in my life while the story rambles on. I was at GDC this past week while the KSA launched two orbital missions. It was very cool to be off doing other things and \u0022watching\u0022 things unfold on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to quickly explain how the story is being written. First off, and most importantly, there is no preordained plot. I don\u0027t say to myself - \u0022this probe will develop a computer virus that sends it off course and threatens the lives of kerbals with an unplanned re-entry over populated areas\u0022. What I do is design a mission, execute the mission, and then create a story around the events that ended up transpiring in that mission. A quick example would be the last mission the KSA flew (dispatch not yet available, but you can read it in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etweet stream\u003C/a\u003E), which was their third attempt to get an orbital science craft back to the ground in one piece. I had installed \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54533-0-23-VOID-Vessel-Orbital-Informational-Display\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVOID\u003C/a\u003E and enabled the data-logging feature. To make the use of data-logging seem realistic, I also enabled the option that VOID consumes electrical power. However I forgot to really check how that would affect the amount of battery capacity I had on the rocket. Turns out - not enough. My mission was to launch, orbit, perform experiments and return. What happened was I launched, orbited, and the spacecraft ran out of power. If you read the tweet stream, you can see how I turned that into a story. I didn\u0027t outright say power was drained, but mission control instead seemed puzzled, had to ensure the craft was dead, and then take time to look into the problem to find the solution. In a future mission Bill will assume manual control of an unkerbed craft and send it way off course - that\u0027s me using the poor guy to cover for my own mistakes, but it makes for a good read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this has been very enjoyable so far and I plan to continue as long as it remains so. Please follow along if you\u0027re on twitter and help spread the word to any friends that like space stories.

I\u0027ve been at this for two months and the story has already grown out past 4 months, nearing the end of June at the time of this writing. There are two main reasons for the lead time. The most important of course is the fact that life can always get in the way at unwanted times, and having to put aside KSP when needed and still have events rolling on is a good thing. Second, this is very much a game still under development. When things break, sometimes you need a lot of time to fix them. If I decided to upgrade to a new release, I might need some time to get everything working again to continue the story. So yea, I\u0027m trying to maintain at least a two-month lead time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMore Thoughts on the Story Embellishments\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my first monthly update I mentioned how nothing was pre-ordained. Everything that happened happened and I needed to write about it. Well, fact is that\u0027s not really the best way to build a story. If you\u0027re failing mission after mission after mission - people are going to get bored and annoyed. So I\u0027ve started making some \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E high-level plot decisions in advance and tweaking events as necessary to make sure they happen. For example, I specifically know how I want a character to die. Don\u0027t freak out that\u0027s not really much of a spoiler - you don\u0027t know who, how, when or why. But the fact that I can specifically answer those questions later on and do so in a way that adds to the story is the goal of such a decision. It won\u0027t just be some random \u0022oops I forgot to check my staging and launched him backwards into the ground.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall though the story mainly continues to be guided based on how I perform in the missions I plan and execute. I said before how continued failures could lead to problems keeping the story interesting - fortunately I actually have not ran into that problem as of yet. I\u0027ve been through about 15 missions so far and I\u0027ve never had to fly any of them more than once. Okay, there have been a few game crashes and bugs that have caused me to reload the last quicksave every now and then, but never because I mistakenly pointed prograde for a burn instead of retrograde (that was an embarrassing event I pawned off on a computer glitch in the story \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). I own up to all my mistakes - except in the case where it results in the failure to reach one of the few high-level plot points I\u0027ve set so far. So if \u0022pre-ordained death character\u0022 were to die for some reason because I accidentally hit the stage button early, I would quickload but then \u003Cem\u003Epurposefully\u003C/em\u003E trigger the stage button and work out how to prevent his death.

Overall the activity from these other accounts has been sporadic and minimal, most likely due to tweeting things as they go and not having as much time as me to really build up a large lead time.

I spent an entire weekend thinking about this. Do I really want to build a website for the KSA? I\u0027m running 4 Wordpress sites on my server - building a new site isn\u0027t a problem. What is a problem is that I\u0027m pretty sure the gain will be minimal - to the audience, to the story and most of all to me. I\u0027m scrabbling to find enough time to play as it is - maintaining a website just for the sake of having an actual website for people to visit is not worth the extra effort. It was a tough decision - I actually had the register.com page open ready to buy a domain - but ultimately I\u0027m happy to keep things focused on twitter.

Again, easy to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll asteroids that are \u0022not found\u0022 are also tracked in the Tracking Center so that they have persistence in the game, but they go in a separate page on my spreadsheet. These are rocks that can have an impact on the story but are never mentioned until they are \u0022found\u0022 or end up impacting the planet. Each \u0022unfound\u0022 asteroid gets assigned a random number from 1-100 (if I get more than 100, it\u0027ll be 1-200 and so on). Every day I can find a new asteroid, instead of just going into the Tracking Center and tracking a new unknown object, first I have some random numbers spit out by the generator I linked to earlier. So if 5 new asteroids are found today, I get 5 random numbers. If any of those numbers match an \u0022unfound\u0022 asteroid already being tracked, that asteroid goes into the \u0022found\u0022 page and counts towards the 5 I\u0027m supposed to find today.

The whole idea is now I have a means of slowly building up my catalog of asteroids as the game progresses and also gives me a good source of \u0022unknown\u0022 objects that can impact Kerbin and cause some sort of upset in the story people won\u0027t see coming. Now, that being said I\u0027m still sticking to what I wrote last month in regards to high-level plot points. There is a 4th page in the spreadsheet for asteroids on impact trajectories with Kerbin I wish to ignore. So when I see them in the game I know they don\u0027t mean anything, I just let them impact and be removed from the save file. So no, there won\u0027t be a random Class D impact event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s the kicker - I just followed and was followed back and retweeted by the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/B612foundation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E@B612Foundation\u003C/a\u003E, which is our real-world program for detecting NEOs (Near-Earth Objects).

So I begin with pre-launch tweets up to the point of lift off. I may decide, while writing the tweets, that I want to throw in a delay or cancellation - something I can\u0027t really do if I\u0027ve already flown the mission and locked in the timeline. Once the tweets are in place and I have the launch time decided, then I load up the game and warp ahead as needed to launch at that time. I use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.fraps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFraps\u003C/a\u003E to record the entire launch sequence because things are too busy during that time to take any sort of notes. Because Fraps can produce a pretty huge uncompressed video file I stop recording either shortly after I reach main-engine cut off if there are several minutes to apoapsis or after establishing orbit if the time between MECO and apoapsis is under 2-3 minutes. From this point on I use the wonderful \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55625\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENotepad\u003C/a\u003E mod to make notes on things that happen during the mission. The new ship log feature is amazing, before that I was manually putting MET into my notes. Since the release of 0.23.5 I have also been using the Alt\u002BF5 feature for custom quicksaves at each major leg in the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the mission is over, I use the video, flight logs and quicksaves (mainly to go back for photos as needed) to construct the tweet timeline that follows the mission progress. Deciding what to tweet and when is a process all in itself - the only thing I can say is that less is always more and people can generally do a good job of \u0022filling in the blanks\u0022 with their own imaginations. Also, pictures are worth a thousand words but just dumping images into the stream doesn\u0027t always work - the images should be more than just random eye candy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of images, I use my own server to host them so I can schedule a tweet with links to them but not have that link be accessible anywhere until the tweet goes live. Even if I created a private album on Imgur, I would still need to remember to set pictures public as needed. With my own server I can just upload them, link them and they\u0027ll pop up when they need to - of course I then have to copy them over to Imgur but that is not something that is time-critical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Twitter Profile\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo twitter did their facebook-alike profile upgrade this past month and I hopped on the new wagon with the KSA account. It does look good and I do like the ability to pin a tweet, which is something I do for when launch details are announced. However I didn\u0027t realize until I went to compile my next mission report that I could no longer view the tweets in the nice concise format anymore. They were all \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E text boxes and it just made me cringe to have to post a stream of tweets that large. Thankfully I realized that you could still get the old tweet format when you\u0027re viewing tweets of people you follow, so I used my old @dsimkora account, unfollowed everyone but KSA and had the nice concise timeline format back to edit into my mission reports.

The best example is using an aircraft to drop science pods around Kerbin to perform ground experiments without having to land a whole craft there. Problem is, when you drop a probe off an aircraft the probe unloads after you fly 5km away. So I would have to fly and drop the pods and take a screenshot when I did so. Then, afterwards I would take the VESSEL structure of the probe, and insert it into my save file with the Lat/Lon and height data provided by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54533-0-23-VOID-Vessel-Orbital-Informational-Display\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVOID\u003C/a\u003E from the screenshot.

Or that a character I said was on leave for two weeks comes back in a week. I\u0027m always making little tweaks here and there in the timeline to make things flow better or tie-in better. Some events have been rewritten entirely when I stumble across some cool real-life space fact or event on the web I can reference somehow in the story.

So I\u0027ve been paying close attention to the cost-breakdown window that you can get from Mission Controller Extended to calculate how much of the cost of each launch is the craft and how much are the resources used on each flight. The craft is paid for once, the resources are paid for multiple times. These include fuel, monoprop, electric charge, etc. If my aircraft has solar panels on it, then I don\u0027t charge myself for the EC at launch, as I would have recharged the batteries off solar since the last time it was flown, even if it landed with a depleted charge. When it comes to charging for fuel, I only calculate the cost after flying a mission and seeing how much I use, since the rest would theoretically be recycled back into \u0022storage\u0022 anyways. Any new parts added to the craft since the initial purchase are of course additional one-time expenses.

Rovers in general in the game are a pain because they require a lot of maintenence. If you want to get somewhere, you have to drive there. That means sitting in front of your computer with the W key mashed (maybe held down by some object)... maybe for hours if you need to go far enough. Booooooorrring!

First is I added a multiplier to apply to each day\u0027s amount of asteroids to be discovered/missed. I\u0027ve started small with 1.5x and via the twitter announced that additional land-based scopes were added to the tracking network. I\u0027ll probably add more land scopes early next year for a 2.5x multiplier and eventually a space telescope will bump that up further, especially if I say it\u0027s dedicated to asteroid hunting (like the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=web\u0026amp;cd=1\u0026amp;cad=rja\u0026amp;uact=8\u0026amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA\u0026amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSentinel_%28space_telescope%29\u0026amp;ei=V7fFU738BImfyAS6yILICA\u0026amp;usg=AFQjCNFLZxqystytMz3LJAregglHmWS5ig\u0026amp;sig2=SHh8_6TlHoGSot2XaBQxXQ\u0026amp;bvm=bv.71126742,d.aWw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esentinel mission\u003C/a\u003E). Secondly, for every rock I need to pick from the numerous untracked objects in the system, when I select Kerbol to center my view on it I now generate random clock positions to place Kerbin. So at 6 o\u0027 clock Kerbin will be straight down. This changes up the order in which I pick through the unknown objects since it changes the orientation of the whole Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHunting for future asteroid encounters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using Kerbal Alarm Clock now instead of the save file hack to jump easily to asteroids and it\u0027s let me go through all the ones I\u0027m currently tracking and find out if they will ever re-encounter Kerbin within 50 years. I do this by placing a maneuver node on the orbit, right-clicking and using the \u002B1 orbit button to iterate through future orbits looking for an encounter. Some I\u0027ve found are coming back around in less than 5 years. One I found will actually hit Kerbin on its next encounter 9 years from now. Even if I don\u0027t play things out that far into the future, the fact that it will hit in 9 years means next year I could send out a mission to nudge it. However, despite doing all this I\u0027ve recently discovered that all these future encounters \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85919-Not-understanding-why-future-encounters-are-behaving-this-way\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emay not be accurate\u003C/a\u003E :/ So we\u0027ll see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther twitter space agencies failing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been a couple more accounts looking to tweet their space adventures, but none of them so far have been able to keep it up. I\u0027m hoping that the silence from some of them is because they are building up a lead-time to re-launch the account. To anyone interested in doing what I\u0027m doing - you need a lead-time. Despite the fact that my income-generating work takes up a minority of my time and I\u0027m single with no real obligations to anything but myself, I still have trouble maintaining my lead time. If you\u0027re working a lot to pay the bills, have a family or a girlfriend or any other responsibilities that will keep you from playing the game every single day, then take this into account and build up a sustainable lead time before you actually start tweeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPublic imgur gallery submission\u003C/strong\u003Es\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just started posting my KSA images to the public imgur gallery.

I\u0027ve been using the 64-bit version to load up all my mods at once for building new craft, but due to that version being so buggy still (and the fact that having almost 7GB of RAM being used creates a few performance issues of its own) I don\u0027t use it for regular gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENo More Budgets (for now)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was fun playing with money, for a time.

First off, I\u0027m happy to say the KSA is already operating through to the new year - current operational date is 1/4/15. I had hoped to extend my lead out to a full 4 months but still getting to 3.5 is pretty good. I\u0027m wary of the fact that at some point as things become more complicated I could drop close to a 1:1 ratio in terms of real days versus in-game days as the amount of tasks I need to perform per in-game day increases. Thankfully when needed I can introduce plots to momentarily slow things down to make it easier for me to catch up on in-game time. I have also slowed down operations in general - meaning that now after launching a new satellite into space while in the game it takes me a few minutes to deploy everything and stuff, I make it take a day or two. The time it takes to build rockets has also been gradually increased, which I feel is realistic given the increasingly complex tech being employed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESome new image techniques, giffys\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast month I mentioned how I\u0027m still sticking to still images mostly for my media, and that continues to hold true so far.

This gives me a ton of options for creating videos of planetary motion, asteroids, and interplanetary ship travel. In fact, I already created a test video of my Duna I mission using trajectory data from Mission Architect, and on the system-wide scale everything matches up perfectly. Obviously if you zoom way in you see the probe is nowhere near as close to Duna as it should be when it arrives, but zoomed out you can\u0027t tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it\u0027s a simulation program, when it came to putting asteroids into the system things became quite tedious. I first did a few tests with about 5-7 asteroids to make sure I could get them into the sim and their orbits would remain approximate. That proven, it was time to put them all in. \u003Cem\u003EAll 460 of them\u003C/em\u003E. Thankfully the orbital parameters from the SFS file are in the same order as they are presented in UBox, but the SFS file gives its LAN in degrees of 0-360 whereas UBox takes a normalized value between -180 and 180, and MNA is in radians in the SFS so I had to convert to degrees and then once again normalize to -180-180 for UBox. Since an asteroid\u0027s orbit data is only good at the exact time specified in the SFS (the EPH parameter) I had to walk the sim up to that point, input the asteroid orbit data, save, then walk up the sim to the next asteroid\u0027s EPH, and repeat. Then, once all the asteroids where in I had to simulate each one up to the same point in time. Then I had to manually copy each asteroid into the same UBox file. Once I got the hang of things, I could input an asteroid ~2.5 minutes on average.

Then I wanted to show different states in the craft\u0027s mission so I created an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/KSA/Flights/Lupek%20Test%20Drive%204/redirect.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EASP script to load a certain static ASP page\u003C/a\u003E depending on the UT elapsed since the start of the KSA. Finally I said screw it, threw myself all in and re-learned how to code in ASP/ADO with MS Access (stuff I did a lot back in like... 2001 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) to create a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/mk1-2-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esingle dynamic craft page\u003C/a\u003E that could load and display data from any craft via a database for that craft. That final task actually only took me 2 days earlier this month. All the time before that it was hand-coding (mostly copy/paste) a ton of ASP files for various craft states. The DB method will make things sooo much easier moving forward.

Every craft that required data to display \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E was actually created 2-3 months ago when I was playing it in the game. Luckily, I had recently enough gotten into the habit of saving SFS files from key points in missions, but even still for some data I had to recover a ton of files off my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.code42.com/crashplan/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrashPlan\u003C/a\u003E backup to find the one save file that contained the orbital information or craft resources, etc, that I needed to fill in for a certain state. CrashPlan doesn\u0027t just back up files, it backs up file \u003Cem\u003Erevisions\u003C/em\u003E - which means every time I save a new game, that version is backed up. Well, almost. I had the backups set for 15-minute revision intervals and only recently shortened it down to 1 minute. So I do have gaps, but luckily managed to uncover practically every mission state going back as far as July.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have $5 a month to spare, CrashPlan is the best way to spend that money. Period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywhoo, the Flight Tracker has, IMO, added a ton of depth to what I\u0027m doing. You can actually see the state of the craft now, down to things like resource amounts, signal delay, orbital data, etc. It\u0027s not and never will be a completely real-time thing, but I do plan to use the current architecture to allow something like 15s auto-refreshes during launch ascent so people can \u0022watch\u0022 the rocket fly into space. I\u0027m still looking into my options from both VOID CSV logging, KSPTOT real-time interface and straight up video recording info on the screen to getting the data I need for a semi-real-time ascent plot.

Not too big of a deal but with all this extra work to be done between missions (flight tracker, mission reports, plot summaries, orbital plotting, mission planning, etc, etc). I\u0027ll be making sure to place more time between launches so I don\u0027t get overwhelmed. The in-story explanation for this was actually quite simple to write thanks to the events that will unfold over the next two months.

This Tues, when my lead time cuts down to 2 months, Dragon Age 3 drops (already have it preloaded). Then around Xmas comes Homeworld Remastered, and 2015 will see Just Cause 3. Two of these are massive open-world time sinks. Hopefully I can at least \u003Cem\u003Emaintain\u003C/em\u003E a 1-2 months lead time while spending some quality time with these games as well.

The decision to do this, for me, was largely due to the fact that I had already written in some generic conflict happening on Kerbin simply as a prop to use as some filler material on slow days and also make things a bit more challenging for myself by declaring certain areas of Kerbin \u0022off limits\u0022 to my aircraft and capsule returns. The @KSP_CCCP account came on the scene (without any prior contact with me - not a bad thing just making a note of that) opposing the KSA and the \u0022Presider\u0022 I had set up as leader of a united Kerbin so since it fit the bill nicely I decided to take advantage of it - with someone else having their own fun with the whole conflict storyline I don\u0027t have to dedicate so much thought to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, I\u0027m in no way basing the actions and events in my story on everything @KSP_CCCP chooses to do. Nor should they in regards to me (we\u0027ve set up some major plot points, but that\u0027s as far as I\u0027m willing to go). First, let\u0027s keep in mind that while everyone else seems to be tweeting as they go, my current day of operations is 2/5/15 and the account is simply playing catch up. So I have events plotted well ahead and I\u0027m not going to be able to change a lot of it based on what other accounts are doing \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E. Second, I\u0027m not about to tie anything in my story to another account that could vanish at any time. In the case of the @KSP_CCCP well, it\u0027s not the first time a koviet union has collapsed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E It wouldn\u0027t be a problem to continue on the conflict storyline without them. It *would* be a problem if we were building a space station together and now I have to design the missing pieces on my own. So don\u0027t anyone get their hopes up for stuff like DarkMP interaction - at least not with me. Thirdly, and most importantly, it can be potentially detrimental to readers if they need to spend a lot of time following the actions of various accounts to get an entire story, worse when those accounts fail to plan properly and step on each other. And that planning also takes effort on the account authors. I have enough on my plate already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is that @KSA_MissionCtrl will always be its own storyline and things happening in it will not directly depend on or be influenced by the actions of other twitter accounts. As with @KSP_CCCP there may be opportunities in which a little bit of crossover can be beneficial to both accounts, and I\u0027m always open to such things. But please don\u0027t move out of the default KSC just because I\u0027m using it. And don\u0027t be offended if I don\u0027t directly engage in events that your putting on in your storyline.

On the plus side though, this really clears up the dilemma I was afraid I would have when I used Custom Biomes for after my Duna I arrival and then had to switch over to the \u0022official\u0022 Squad biomes. But as with 0.25, which I literally started getting into at the start of this month, it\u0027ll be a while before 0.90 is in any shape for me to upgrade and still retain everything currently in my game in some form or another. I\u0027ve had the same persistence file since 0.23 and I\u0027m not gonna break the streak if I can help it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a couple of things to help with my RAM usage since I would be more consistently loading up additional planet textures once I\u0027m around Duna and Minmus, also more parts as my ship count increased despite relying as much as possible on core parts. First obvious thing was to try the -force-opengl flag, which would only crash the game before it even showed a window. A Google search however brought me to a reddit post talking about \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2g2onw/launch_option_force_opengl_crashes_my_game_cant/cmeek11\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E--force-opengl\u003C/a\u003E with and additional hyphen at the start. Sonofagun but it worked, and not only did it decrease RAM usage as advertised I was still able to use SweetFX, which seems to rely on a DX DLL. Regardless, I\u0027m only saving this flag for emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond thing I did was to copy my persistence file and replace every orbiting vessel with communication analogs - in other words a probe core and however many dishes/antenna the real craft sports. So basically 3-5 different parts across all vessels, removing a ton of unique and even core parts from my install. This is mainly for atmospheric aircraft missions that only need to rely on orbiting satellites for communication purposes while flying around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also copied out all my ground debris I want to keep persistent into a separate file so they don\u0027t even exist in my main game anymore until I want them there, and for orbital debris I did the same thing, copying them out, but so that I can still see what\u0027s where in orbit I replaced them with flags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the 4-0 version of Active Texture Management (Basic) accidentally included a flag that compressed \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E in addition to converting to DDS and I have yet to notice a single graphical issue and saved around 400MB of RAM. So despite the release of 4-2 I\u0027m sticking with 4-0 for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd result is that a normal game with only ATM in 0.25 loads around 2.8-3GB on the VRAM side of things, which leaves me roughly 1GB of overhead. Sweet.

Anyways it quickly escalated into accounts, both new and existing, trying to carve their way into the fiction I started, and that was something I immediately saw as a problem (see the notice above this post). Although I was also rather surprised, as new accounts I expected to mostly want to do their own thing not really collaborate in any real way. Tl;dr we now have a private Google groups mailing list so anyone that wants to cooperate on storylines can do so without tripping over one another, and just for general support on doing the twitter thang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m keeping a tally on existing KSP twitter accounts \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/lists/other-agencies\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Evia this list\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a personal note, KSP community lead KasperVld took me to new heights in follower count and tweet impressions when he mentioned me in one of the KSP dev notes.

This will allow me to do something like animate the orbits of all the planets with their trails showing, and then in a separate video show a bunch of asteroids moving without trails (for performance and visual clutter reasons). I can\u0027t run both at the same time in Universe Sandbox because you can\u0027t selectively enable trails, but I can composite the two videos together to achieve the same effect. More cool stuff is possible too, but I will let that be seen at the end of February 2015.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew rosters DB\u0027fied\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile awaiting the first launch of the Orion capsule, there wasn\u0027t much for me to do as I didn\u0027t want to have to split my focus between the game and the launch commentary, but coding is something I can do better with a little distraction so I took the time to set up a generic ASP page for reading databases containing astronaut information such as ribbons, mission time, rank, past missions, etc - everything already displayed in their static roster windows on the KSA homepage. Not only do I no longer have to worry about manually updating them now at certain times (except to add mission reports I\u0027ve compiled, but that\u0027s not time-dependent) but I can also inter-link them between Flight Tracker windows, as exemplified in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/ksaMunI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMun I tracker\u003C/a\u003E (click the crew icons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next big thing for the Flight Tracker is using the auto-update refresh functionality to \u0022live stream\u0022 a launch by having new ascent data every 15-seconds.

I won\u0027t say how many I\u0027m tracking right now but I decided 500 was enough per save and I currently now have two. Logistically, once the initial tedious manual split was taken care of, not much extra in the way of upkeep and it does keep the framerate sane. I actually had more than 600 in the single save with no issues as long as the asteroid orbits themselves were not all rendered together on the screen, but with 0.25 something else was causing issues so that even with the asteroids all hidden by right-clicking another element icon like Ships, frames were still stuttering a lot. Anyways moving forwards once I hit 500 asteroids in save 2 it\u0027ll be easy to just copy over a blank slate to start save 3, all the heavy lifting is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETime.... it ain\u0027t on my side\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the current operation date of the KSA is 2/9/15 and it\u0027s been stuck there for the past two days as I work through a Minmus mission.
