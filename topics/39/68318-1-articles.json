My name is Truth-Teller Fredsey and, as custom for the first Mun-night of the year, I will be reading the beginning of the Book of Truths for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBefore anything, there was Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sky was blacker than a cave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbol was not satisfied with this blackness. He swirled around the sky, creating a giant milky-white circle, but it was not enough. He began to make specks of light in the black sky, until it was covered with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was still displeased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe bestowed life in some of the bright stars so that they moved of their own will. He created a companion, as big as He was, to accompany Him and make Him happy, and they travelled the sky next to one another. But He was still displeased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe realized his true purpose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe focused his beams upon a point directly below Him, and over a thousand Kerbal lifetimes, He created a giant plain of stone. He raised mountains and filled oceans. And yet, it still wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then He focused His entire energy upon the plain below him. Wherever a tiny sunbeam hit the earth, a shoot of grass reached towards Him, and soon the plains were covered green. He directed more energy towards the earth, and trees pushed their way out from the grass. The planet was lush and beautiful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was still not enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe redoubled his efforts and focused every one of his beams at the ground. And wherever his beams now touched, a Kerbal appeared on the grassy earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, at long last, Kerbol was satisfied with his work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe warmed each Kerbal with his rays, and then began to teach them about\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153\u003Cstrong\u003E [bEEP]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[bEEP]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUm\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I think that this \u003Cstrong\u003E[bEEP]\u003C/strong\u003E-cludes the first Stanza of the \u003Cstrong\u003E[bEEP]\u003C/strong\u003E of Truths.
