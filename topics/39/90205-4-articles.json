I\u0027m a big fan of T-shaped designs, with the solar panels and engines in the front. Here\u0027s my old Grand Tour ship, which was something like twelve modules docked in space. Last I used it, it was flying out to Kerbol orbit with over 2/3 of its fuel left. I don\u0027t like the aesthetics of the frontmost module, but the rest of it looks very much like a \u0027research station,\u0027 and would fit the bill well.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GSppHLO.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/GSppHLO.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrometheus was designed to be a lander, with engines capable of swiveling.
