Upon closer inspection of it and its surroundings, one would come to find that it is mind-blowingly small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe star is so small in fact, that it should by no means be a star at all- but rather an average-sized gas giant. The planets that surround it are also impossibly small, which has led many to regard the system as proof of the existence of Magratheans. It is speculated that Kerbol was a small-scale testing ground for Magrathea\u0027s planet creation technology. Though we have absolutely no solid proof in favor of this theory, it is not because there is no proof, but because nobody could be bothered to visit the place. It\u0027s much too small for anyone to be comfortable, the only sentient species- called Kerbals- are stupidly reckless, and it\u0027s so remote that nobody considers it worth going any further than glancing at the star and going about whatever business you had been occupied with at the time, which is almost certain to not involve anything in orbit around it. There isn\u0027t even an asteroid field to fly through. However, it has been visited at least twice- though both visits were by teasers, and both crashed on the poles of the Kerbals\u0027 planet and its moon, and so for all that a hitchhiker is to be concerned, Kerbol is completely harmless, if a bit odd.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Needles_10","CreatedById":59554,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T14:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been waiting.
