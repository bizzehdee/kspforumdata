I just wanted to get my feet wet in KSPFF, and get some quick reviews. I\\\u0027m more of a poetic writer who fills his space with description instead of content like dialogue. In the future, I will hope to have larger stories, either canon, headcanon, (Oxford Comma FTW!) or RP. Written in the perspective of Jeb, and I see him as a giddy, fast-talking thrillmaster (at least for now. I\\\u0027m pretty mad at some girls who talk this way, so expect lotsa \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Espaghetti\u003C/span\u003E gory deaths for the gossipy Jeb).

He\\\u0027s wrong, because on Kerbin, gravity and all that dumb stuff slows the moving thing down until it rolls to the epitome of boringness - standstill. I\\\u0027d like to give that super-smart/dumb guy a big slap in the face - that is, a rocket-powered slap. That\\\u0027s right, I\\\u0027m the rocketeer of legend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AWESOME! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman! Aww yeah, that\\\u0027s me! If you didn\\\u0027t know, I\\\u0027m immortal. If that mysterious force up there that likes to shake around the rocket and make it do stuff smashes me into the chilly-cold surface of Minmus or blows me up in a totally awesome fireball of fun they call an explosion, I always find my way back, ready to do it all again! Bob likes to scream and puke a lot and Bill hardly has a grip on the situation, so usually I have to be the muscles, brains \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E funny guy - good thing I\\\u0027m radical at all three! But still, life\\\u0027s rough out in space - the food isn\\\u0027t any good and you just get to sit there while you wait to go to the Mun or something. We can\\\u0027t even, like, hop outside and do stuff in space! It\\\u0027s just like living in a jail cell - \u003Cem\u003Ein space!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Well, that\\\u0027s all the time I have for you - the guy with the beard and the funny talk has told me I\\\u0027m going on a Kerbol escape mission without any life support.
