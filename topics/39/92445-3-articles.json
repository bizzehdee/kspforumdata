They have a standard 5mm LED housing, but embed a little WS2812 IC. That makes them great for applications like this. I just had to supply 5V to all of them in parallel, and daisychain the data lines together. They end up taking a single pin of your microcontroller to drive, and the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://fastled.io/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFastLED\u003C/a\u003E arduino library makes controlling them super easy. Here\u0027s what the back of the annunciator looks like after wiring everything together. It looks complicated but it\u0027s really not that bad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Each column of LEDs has the anode on the right hooked up with red wire, cathode on the left hooked up with black wire, and the data pins run through the middle with blue wire joining columns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IWgU4D3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IWgU4D3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the faceplate, I loaded up the original box outline in inkscape and used that as a template to draw up a top-down cross-section. Filled the gaps between compartments in black, and then added my labels. Deciding what to put on the annunciator and where was another one of those agonising things that I\u0027ll never be certain I got quite right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that was done, I just printed it out on a sheet of blank white paper and cut to shape. Then used a sheet of thin clear plastic salvaged from an old document holder, also cut to shape, as a protective cover. Taped the two together, cut a couple of mounting holes. And then finally bolted the box to a perspex top panel, with the faceplate sandwiched between. The end result:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dij5cMh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Dij5cMh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe paper blocks out a lot more light than I was expecting, this will end up completely washed out in sunlight.
