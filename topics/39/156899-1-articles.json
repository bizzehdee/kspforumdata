Decided to dust off my soldering iron and raid my spare parts drawer to throw together a controller!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far, the main display is nearly finished, the craft control section is just a mockup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IMG_3879.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a9/stillbornsinger/IMG_3879.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea was to have a display section with the numbers I usually needed most from the map and whatnot... The bottom panel is cut out of an old tape deck. Thought the recessed analog gauges were really cool, also some of the switches and knobs were cool. So going to mess with that some more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IMG_3940.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a9/stillbornsinger/IMG_3940.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarted a bit too low when cutting the slots for the 7 segment LED strips, so was only able to fit three. Also the slots were cut with a hand held grinder, so not very accurate. Ended up having a bit of a gap, especially below the third one. So, ended up gluing some foam down as a frame for the LED strips which came out well. Also, down the road, I plan to put some blue and red LEDs on the inside of the case and have the blue ones light when the vessel is in space and has power, extinguish when out of battery and then have the red ones glow when reentering. There are vent holes on the sides of the enclosure that would glow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IMG_4005.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a9/stillbornsinger/IMG_4005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the mockup of how I think the final product will look. Still have to do the bottom portion, have a few small joysticks for eva/docking control and also a motorized fader for throttle control. Space Pilot Pro over on the left will be for camera control. Joystick on the right for controlling the pointy end of the rockets/planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IMG_4168.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a9/stillbornsinger/IMG_4168.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the inside, mostly thrown together with random parts I had laying around in my junk drawer and some of the wiring that came out of the tape deck that was dissected for the face plate and switches. Kind of a rats nest. Considering doing a whole PCB fab for the craft control section to make it cleaner since I\u0027ll have less room to work with. In that case I\u0027ll end up with a couple spare PCB\u0027s, so I\u0027ll re-do the wiring in the top module correctly. Whole thing is powered by a Raspberry Pi. Was originially planning on using an Arduino Mega, but figured out getting serial out from my mac was going to be harder than doing it over IP with Telemachus, so switched to the PI for more processing power and to make the IP stuff easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is the op test video of the completed display module!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/kJGTtZ3JBSA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EConsole in action!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill post code and whatnot later on, this is probably the largest program I\u0027ve done in python, so need to refactor it quite a bit to make it more efficient. Thanks again all for the inspiration! Really enjoyed doing this project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah and as a by the way, the 3 LED strips display Apoapsis, Periapsis, and Altitude, when the switch just to the right of the bottom bar is switch down it changes to Target Apoapsis, Target Periapsis, and RADAR altitude. The three covered switches control drogue chutes, regular chutes and abort.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe group of 6 button switches in the top right cover antenna deployment, lights, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, solar panel deployment, landing gear and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill need to add labels =)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-24T07:10:25Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2017 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Marlowe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efix link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-24T08:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, thats awesome!
