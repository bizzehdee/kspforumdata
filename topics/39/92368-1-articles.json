So, I\u0027ve gone through the trouble to reformat and partition my hard drive so as to allow a dual boot configuration with Linux, since the 64-bit version of KSP is quite stable in Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Fraps, the vidcap software I\u0027ve tinkered with in Windows, doesn\u0027t work \u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E of Windows. So, to Linux-based YouTubers out there, what do you use for vidcap software? (Preferably software that generates .avi output files, though exact codec / format is negotiable. IDEAL is something free or low cost, though I\u0027ll consider paying, especially if a trial version works out on a few test runs. Better yet is something that can record multiple independent audio streams, so I can divorce live voiceover audio from in-game audio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts or suggestions? I\u0027ve googled the question and being peculiarly new to Linux, and my YouTube experience so far as been as a contributor to others\u0027 channels [meaning the actual recording has always been done either in Windows, or on someone else\u0027s machine entirely] I\u0027m not exactly sure what I\u0027m looking at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
