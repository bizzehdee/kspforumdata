Can\u0027t wait for 64-bit 1.1 to arrive and make things smoother. Does anyone know of any armor plating mod that works with BD armory or what the heat damage is for weapons? Migth try to make my own if I need to for things like this.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randomness5555","CreatedById":53367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E25 Miles an hour was the speed they wanted it to be capable of reaching, but IIRC they simply didn\u0027t have engines powerfull enough to push it past about 4mph. That\u0027s why they never built an actual ratte, though IMO it still would have been a force to be reckoned with as it would have been basically immune to anything smaller than cruiser (possible battleship) scale cannons\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snidemeister","CreatedById":150138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I did think it sounded optimistic of them when I read about it. Though at 4mph it would have been easy enough to run up to and attempt to climb (if you weren\u0027t shot before getting there). It becomes more of a castle than a tank at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
