AAA and SAM posts had wiped out some of the bombers, but others had managed to slug the city. Now, it was a massive cloud of fighters doing battle. It was Klathu, Kerthenia, and Agonarch against Kruola, Veloxia, and Dystrios. The fight was going in favor of the enemy. One of the pilots in a DE-01 Hurricane was hot on the tail of an enemy fighter, but the enemy was far more maneuverable. \u201CCome on\u2026\u201D Just then, the radio came to life, and sang a charge horn noise.

The enemy was fast, but not at all maneuverable. At least not compared to the -22. Val buzzed the enemy with guns, and the craft was shredded; falling to the ground in a massive explosion. Even from 500 meters up, and through a fairly well-insulated fighter jet cockpit, Val heard a massive cheer below them. Citizens were in the streets and on the rooftops watching the battle unfold. \u201CWhat\u2019s this?!\u201D Val exclaimed, picking up onto another fighter. In response, Paddy did a roll, popping off flares and giving the crowd below a show. They cheered even louder, and then Paddy finally went into the fight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThis is for Tarkin!\u201D Jim shouted, obliterating two fighters. The first one had its wing shredded, smoke and flame shooting out of the sides. Jim turned the plane, and fired on the second, which also shredded the wings. They both flipped over, and careened into each other slicing the two in half as they collided in a huge fireball. Jim grinned as the crowd screamed its approval. Then, as he formed up on the next enemy, he heard a beeping. \u201CLock!\u201D He shouted, diving down. He saw the missile in his mirrors. He bobbed and weaved, wowing the crowd below. Then, he yanked up on the stick as hard as he could. The plane shot up into the sky, and the missile followed him. Jim kept on climbing. And climbing. And climbing some more. Finally, when he was about to reach the critical stall speed, the missile flamed out. Hovering in the sky for a second, it floated up, and exploded in a huge explosion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJim. Jim, you okay?\u201D The radio was silent. \u201CJim!\u201D Gene feared the worst. Then, a roaring cheer thundered through the city as an F-22 dove down, the remnants of the missile\u2019s fire trailing off his stabilizers. \u201CThat is beautiful!\u201D Paddy exclaimed as he shot down another fighter. Val skillfully blasted a plane apart, grinning as her plane fit nicely through the hole the explosion and debris had caused.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val turned to engage the next one, but there was nothing. The rest of the planes were retreating! Cowards! Val shot off an AMRAAM, and it caused a monumental fireball as the carcass spun down to the bay below. The air was silent for a bit, and then a huge cheer louder than the jets themselves blasted out, the citizens celebrating the victory. A chant started, which was disorientated at first. Then, Val heard it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Cem\u003EOff we go, Into the wild blue yonder.\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D Val smiled and began singing along over the radio.

The first missile slammed into the center of the plane, ripping off the top half of the fuel tanks and lighting the entire plane on fire.

Meanwhile, off the coast, our entire navy, with Veloxian Naval Vessels waiting in the wings, is bunched up their coast, preparing to engage their navy. Marines are en route to the capital as well, and will land as soon as the air battle begins. As for us, the entire UK air force is going to depart from their bases, and overwhelm the enemy in the air. Once that occurs, we\u2019ll be able to deploy all of the CAS aircraft and the bombers, and that\u2019ll clear the way for our guys down on the ground to storm the capital building, and force a treaty. Any questions?\u201D No-one asked a question. \u201CGood. Now. I\u2019m going to be frank here. This is going to be the biggest battle of the war; maybe of our entire lives. It will be a test of mental strength, physical endurance, and all the skill we can possibly think to muster. Some of us might not make it. But we\u2019re the best pilots in the force, with the best planes and the best abilities. We know how to fight. We know how to work. We are the best in the world, and we know how to do this. Now.

We\u2019ll try, but it\u2019s day-to-day at this point. Some of us aren\u2019t even sure if the relief money\u2019s even going to get here.\u201D Buck kicked over a piece of concrete as he threw away a half-burned door. The radio was silent for a bit, but then Triop asked \u201CDo you think anything\u2019s going to be back to normal?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo chance,\u201D Bryson replied. \u201CMaybe,\u201D Haydi answered; tinkering around. \u201CProbably.\u201D Val leaned back. \u201CI mean, nothing\u2019s going to be exactly the same, but\u2026 I think the world\u2019s going to be a much better place in 5 or 6 years time. It just takes a while..\u201D The others murmured in agreement, and Haydi added \u201CYou know, I read somewhere \u2018There\u2019s always going to be something to knock us down, but all that matters is how we get back up,\u2019 or something like that.\u201D\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHeyoo guys,\u201D Thompberry\u2019s voice chimed in over the radio. \u201CHey Thompers! How\u2019s it going?\u201D Haydi asked. \u201CGood. The crew just got done shooting in Baikerbanur and they\u2019re heading home. Jim, Me, and a few other crew guys are back in Bahmuto working on the next scene.\u201D Thompberry sipped a smoothie. \u201CHow\u2019s the studio?\u201D Val asked. Just before the war had ended, a rogue car bomb had exploded just outside the studio and almost destroyed the place. \u201CGood. We got an estimate yesterday; gonna be in the 3000 fund range. The outer structural beams are shot, but somehow the roof\u2019s stable. We got most of the props and stuff out just in case she goes. We rented out another studio just down the road; a bit cramped but we can make due.\u201D Val shook her head. \u201CThat sucks,\u201D She said. \u201CAh well, what can ya do?\u201D Thompberry asked. Right then, Paddy popped in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTop O\u2019 the Mornin\u2019!\u201D He said; the sound of hammering, drills, and wrenches in the background. \u201CPaddy?\u201D Val asked, trying to hear. \u201CWh.. Where the heck are you?\u201D Paddy laughed. \u201CWe\u2019re in Celrepan right now working on the car. Pre-Season Testing\u2019s coming up soon and it\u2019s full speed ahead. Lisa and Hank are both doing some sims right now. Y\u2019all coming to watch?\u201D He asked. \u201CTesting\u2019s at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, right?\u201D Haydi asked. \u201CYup.

The sims make it look like a whole load of fun.\u201D Just as Val was about to answer, Gene\u2019s voice came over the intercom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHaydi and Valentina, please report to the Administration Building. Haydi and Val to the Admin Building.\u201D Val got up, and took the phone. \u201CHey, we\u2019ve got to go. Talk to you guys later?\u201D She walked out of her office and headed down the hallway to Gene\u2019s office. Before anyone could answer, Val had entered Gene\u2019s office, and saw Gene\u2019s laptop. She dropped her phone in shock, and it bounced on the carpet; forgotten. Val stared at the screen, which showed a rocket buried in Red Sand. There was a name on the cockpit..

A strong and cold ocean wind blasted in; seeming to cut through Val\u2019s jacket. She didn\u2019t mind though. Her hand absentmindedly tapped at the hatch door, which was wide open. A couple lights were on inside the Complex and the R\u0026amp;D Center as everyone crunched the numbers on \u003Cem\u003EDuna I\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val remembered back to her childhood; way back beyond her high schooling and back in Jesalia. The days in the snow.. That freezing, barren place where she had lived for 12 years. Then the \u003Cem\u003EAccident..\u003C/em\u003E Val felt a couple tears well up as she remembered. \u201CGah this is stupid,\u201D She muttered to no-one, wiping a tear away. \u201CHeck, I can\u2019t hardly even remember what the accident was..\u201D She strained herself to remember. Then, everything came back. Papa was going to be the first Kerbal into space. His rocket- \u003Cem\u003EMoskva I\u003C/em\u003E- was going up.. Then..\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val shut her eyes as she attempted to force out everything. The noises.. The explosions.. The Fire Crew attempting in vain to stop the furious flames that consumed everything\u2026 The fire.. The fire was horrible. A massive ball of flame that was so large the smoke could be seen in Imperial City\u2026 Val\u2019s mom had moved them across the world a week later; doing the same thing Val had when Jeb left. Escape the memories. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was her home now. Val still filled out the payments on her place in River City, but she never went there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val rubbed her thumb on the hatch; feeling the smooth paint as she remembered. She smiled as she remembered how Jeb had basically tripped all over himself when he had met her mom; trying to get her approval. Then, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Her first training flight in the ancient Ares. Her first flight in a rocket. And Valentina Kerman; the first female kerbal into space. Her mom was so proud.. Val heard someone coming up the scaffolding\u2019s steps; the footsteps making a faint clanking noise. Val wiped away the tears and sat up, trying to look natural. Haydi appeared; smirking a bit as she saw Val. \u201CHey,\u201D Val waved; flopping back down on the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CKnew I\u2019d find you here,\u201D Haydi replied, sitting down right next to Val. \u201CCan\u2019t sleep either?\u201D Val asked, looking over. \u201CYou kiddin\u2019?\u201D Haydi asked. \u201CHow in the name of Kerb would I be able to sleep on a night like this?\u201D Val let a tiny laugh escape. \u201CI know how you feel,\u201D She replied, remembering her first mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBut seriously, we\u2019ve got to get to bed.

Val gave off a quick Jesalian quip and Haydi smiled. \u201CHey, no fair! I don\u2019t know dual languages!\u201D The two laughed, and Val sighed. \u201CAre you ready?\u201D She asked. \u201CAre you kidding?\u201D Haydi laughed; laying down and staring up at the stars with Val. \u201CHeck no,\u201D She added.

She was just a bit shorter than the usual recruits, but even then Haydi towered about 5 or 6 inches above her.

As Val was checking the rovers in the cargo bay, her watch beeped. 5 minutes to Node. She ran up to the command pod, and strapped in. Haydi was checking all the switches and dials; making sure nothing important had blown up, damaged, or accidentally jolted and reset in the launch (During \u003Cem\u003EKerpollo 3\u003C/em\u003E, an altitude warning knob had been knocked back from 300m to 30; wrecking the landing gear on the craft and making the crew have to abort).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBack,\u201D Val said as she strapped in. \u201CJust in time to,\u201D Haydi replied, before Gene came over the radio. \u201CTee minus 90 seconds,\u201D He said.

I\u2019m just getting the final systems ready for the retro burns while Val stares off into blank space,\u201D Haydi answered, smirking a bit in Val\u2019s direction. \u201CHmm?\u201D Val snapped back to reality, making Haydi laugh. \u201CHow\u2019s it going back home?\u201D Haydi asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CRaining right now but I can see Kerbol poking through a bit through the clouds,\u201D Gene answered. \u201CY\u2019all ready for descent?\u201D Haydi looked around and checked every switch. \u201CControl, all presets and dials are set; this is \u003Cem\u003EDuna I\u003C/em\u003E, awaiting orders, over.\u201D There was some clapping in the background as everyone got set.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCopy that, One; your descent node is in the computer. Fire when ready.\u201D The radio clicked off, and Val checked the computer. 45 seconds until the burn. \u201CAfter all this time..\u201D Val muttered. \u201CHmm?\u201D Haydi turned as the red ground slowly rolled past. \u201COh, nothing,\u201D Val answered, checking the fuel. \u201CReady?\u201D Haydi smiled. \u201CReady.\u201D She flipped the switch, and Val slowly began getting pressed into her seat. \u003Cem\u003EI\u2019m coming, Jeb.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CDirectional to Prograde,\u201D Haydi commanded, carefully checking the altitude. \u201CPrograde,\u201D Val repeated; pushing the button. The Station rotated around, and finally settled. \u201CDirection to Radial,\u201D Haydi then said as the ground rushed up to meet them. \u201CRadial.\u201D Val pressed in the button and felt the craft shift; exposing the multitude of radiator panels protecting the craft on de-orbit. The craft began shaking, and flames began to appear outside the windows. Slowly, a dull, loud rumbling began intensifying.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CRadiator temps are reporting good. Speed 1.5km/s and dropping.\u201D The vibrations shook the entire cockpit so much Val was happy at the impossibly strong belts. The noise was at it\u2019s peak volume; so loud that Val felt her eardrums would burst even through the almost sound-proof helmet. \u201CAltitude is 15 kilometers and dropping at over 100 per second.\u201D Val fought against the force of near 7 G\u2019s and looked out the window. The red hills and rocks were blasting past as the station went almost horizontal to the ground. \u201C10 Kilometers. Speed dropping..\u201D The shaking slowed, and the flame slowly disappeared. The sound quieted almost immediately to a light whooshing; similar to the wind. Quickly, Val turned the craft to prograde before Haydi flipped the staging switch for the final time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCHUTES DEPLOYED!!\u201D Val felt the bite of 15 parachutes catching the air, and she smiled as the speed went from over 500 to under 30. \u201CControl, this is \u003Cem\u003EDuna I\u003C/em\u003E.

This was the final scouting flight to see where Jeb was. Val rushed out to the hangar, but the airlock door closed just before she could get out. Val watched through the window, and saw Haydi talking to the pilot. The pilot had his lips pursed, and looked upset and tired. Haydi and him were talking really fast; Val couldn\u2019t read their lips. Haydi turned and said something Val couldn\u2019t see. The pilot shook his head. Haydi looked up, and began walking back to the airlock. Haydi\u2019s face said it all as she took the helmet off inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo.. Nonono!\u201D Val stormed out of the hangar and ran into her room. Haydi chased after her. \u201CVal!\u201D Haydi shouted, keeping chase. Val slammed the door shut, but Haydi opened it up. \u201CHe\u2019s here,\u201D Val shouted at Haydi, who was sitting down in a chair. \u201CWe\u2019re close! We\u2019ve just got to-\u201C Haydi sighed. \u201CHoney,\u201D She said, putting a hand on Val\u2019s shoulder. \u201CThe quicker you accept it, the less pain you\u2019ll feel.\u201D Val\u2019s eyes pleaded with Haydi not to say more. \u201CHe\u2019s not here.\u201D Val\u2019s face crumpled like paper, and she began crying; terrible, horrible painful sobs that rocked her entire body. \u201CIt\u2019s alright, Val,\u201D Haydi cooed; rubbing Val\u2019s back. \u201CIt\u2019s alright.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-09T00:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2017 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DarkOwl57\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espeeling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
