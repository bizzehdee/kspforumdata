But importing these into CitySkylines is a little bit tricky and you may take more time than you thought to get these done.\n\nUsing KSPBlender Master can transform your .craft file into 3D file. (\u0027KSP Blender\u0027 is avaliable in forum)\n\nCitySkylines contains a tool to allow you import your 3D file into the game.\n\nAnd now you got the point.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
