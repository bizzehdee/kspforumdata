This system is very\n\ncheap and can replace the first stage of every rocket. Orbit missions can \n\nbe archived by just using one Booster and a small tank of fuel.\n\n**PLANS**\n\n **Media Type:** Image\n\n**Status:** Classified\n\n![vtollayouts.png](http://movies.online-arts.de/Files/vtollayouts.png)\n\n**VTOL ROCKET PLATFORM - ORBIT MISSION**\n\n**Media Type:** Video\n\n**Status:** Classified\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Qkch6r6EOY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**VTOL ROCKET PLATFORM - MOON MISSION**\n\n**Media Type:** Video\n\n**Status:** Classified\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kh8EUHtxkSg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**VTOL ROCKET PLATFORM - REDUX - HEAVY LOAD**\n\n**Media Type:** Video\n\n**Status:** Classified\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SAzF2x-oB8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**These material is for internal use only.

That are good ideas. I will upgrate the VTOL rocket platform with more air intakes and can add horizontal velocity by turning the craft to the side. I will create a new prototype and show it here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T15:53:20Z","Content":"Shouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t this thread be moved to the Spacecraft Exchange?
