The temptation to take advantage of the clear night sky and spend an hour or two adding to the M\u00FCn map decorating her study wall wasn\u0027t helping this endeavour. For that matter she thought, going out to the sandpit and trying out some of the new colour powders would be a useful way to spend the evening and she could even justify that as work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sighed and flicked the radio on. May as well find something decent to listen to if she had to spend the evening working. She turned the dial back and forth looking for a good station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnatches of music clattered out from the speaker, interspersed with what sounded like news bulletins. Ademone reluctantly picked up the first piece of paper from the pile and was skimming it half heartedly when a sudden loud beep from the radio made her jump. She scowled. Some ham\u0027s idea of a joke no doubt. Strange though - the dial was quite a way outside the normal frequency range for the local enthusiasts. It wadn\u0027t a very good transmission either, although there did appear to be a voice talking somewhere behind the static. Suddenly intrigued, she worked the fine tuning dial, trying to get a better signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBob, Geneney, Richlin... kerbals... Barkton!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brought her up short. Barkton was quite a way away. Not many amateur transmissions from there and whoever was sending this one definitely sounded amateur. The radio beeped again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is a message from the Kerbin Interplanetary Society. Broadcasting from orbit, around the world, around the clock! We are Jebediah, Bill, Bob, Geneney, Wernher, Lucan, Ornie, Richlin and too many other kerbals to mention from the great town of Barkton!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone burst out laughing. Definitely amateurs but with a sense of humour. Kerbin Interplanetary Society indeed! Chuckling, she turned the dial back to the nearest music station and picked up her pen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had been a good three months for the Speciality Fireworks Company and Ademone worked her way steadily through the stack of invoices. After deciphering one particularly illegible one, she decided it was time to take a break. She stared out of the window as the coffee pot burbled away. It really was a good night for M\u00FCn gazing -\u00A0surely ten minutes couldn\u0027t hurt? Then she grinned, remembering the message from Barkton. Maybe she could just ask Bill, Bob and the rest of them for a map instead. On a sudden impulse she reached out and switched the radio back to the Barkton frequency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radio hissed softly as Ademone drank her coffee. Then, much to her surprise, a burst of static echoed out of the grille, followed by an indistinct mumbling. Another burst of static almost drowned out another loud beep and then the recorded message played again getting clearer and clearer as it went on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone looked up at the clock on her wall. Just over an hour. She tore off a fresh piece of paper from her desk pad and wrote out some calculations, frowning as she underlined the final figure. The time between broadcasts was certainly consistent but an orbiting transmitter? Somebody just had to be playing an elaborate joke, although it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E an unusual frequency to choose. Then an idea struck her. Assume this thing really was in orbit. How long for it to travel another 500-600 kilometres further east? She scribbled away on the pad. Hmm, too late this time round but maybe not the next! She picked up the phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdo sounded sleepy and rather put out. \u201CWhat is it, Ademone - it\u0027s getting late.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know, Jerdo but this could be interesting. Can you stay awake for another hour or so?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI might be able to but why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s probably nothing but I picked up this odd little broadcast tonight and I was wondering if you could check it out for me. Doesn\u0027t sound like the usual crowd either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdo\u0027s voice was guarded.\u00A0\u201CI guess so - what frequency?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone read off the frequency. \u201CYou probably won\u0027t get much but static for another hour but if you could tune in in about 55 minutes that would be perfect. Oh - and call me back as well.\u00A0I want to listen to this too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the minutes dragged by, the pile of paperwork slowly decreased, although each invoice signed was almost invariably followed by Ademone staring out the window, fidgeting with her pen or pacing up and down the office. Finally the 55 minutes were up and she eagerly switched the radio back on and telephoned Jerdo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHave you got the radio on?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure but I\u0027m not getting anything but static,\u0022 Jerdo yawned.\u00A0\u201CWhat am I waiting for anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh you\u0027ll know it when you hear it, Jerdo - you\u0027ll know it when you hear it. You are at the right frequency aren\u0027t you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdo dutifully checked the dial and read off the frequency with another stifled yawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, there was a familiar beep. Ademone waited tensely. And then at last, she heard another voice down the telephone line. It was faint but perfectly synchronised with the one spilling out from her own radio. Ademone sank back into her chair as Jerdo\u0027s suddenly excited voice filled her ear. \u003Cem\u003EDear Kerm\u003C/em\u003E, she said quietly to herself, \u003Cem\u003EDear Kerm...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGenie! Genie!\u0022 Jeb poked his head around the door of Geneney\u0027s office. \u201CHey have you seen Genie anywhere?\u0022 He paused, \u201CHey wait a minute - have we met?\u0022 Then Jeb looked around the room. \u201CHang on - this is Geneney\u0027s office right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott looked up from the drafting board. \u201CHe\u0027s just out getting another filing cabinet. Should be back in a moment. Hey Camrie - how long did Geneney say he\u0027d be?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie slowly put down her wrench.\u00A0\u201CRoncott - you might want to try \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C/em\u003E those eyes of yours for a change. Being a little more polite to the boss wouldn\u0027t hurt either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott jumped to his feet flushing dark green in embarrassment. \u201COh my. Oh goodness I\u0027m sorry sir!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb waved dismissively, \u201CJust call me Jeb. But seriously, who are you guys?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch to Roncott\u0027s relief, there was a squeaking of rubber wheels as Geneney came into the room pushing a filing cabinet on a trolley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh hi, Jeb - you\u0027ve met Camrie and Roncott then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In a manner of speaking,\u0022\u00A0replied Jeb. \u201CI met Roncott anyway. Good to meet you too, Camrie!\u0022 He raised his eyebrows. \u0022Filing cabinets, Genie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded cheerfully. \u201CYep. Got to have somewhere to store all the plans! We\u0027re about halfway through cataloging your stock for useful parts - got some other volunteers still working on that.\u0022 He looked sheepishly at Jeb. \u201CYou might have noticed that the petty cash has taken a beating lately - I figured that the gang deserved a drink or two at the end of a hard day sorting junk. Anyway, Camrie and Roncott are helping with Phase 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb made a mental note to top up the petty cash. \u201CPhase 2?\u0022\u00A0he asked mildly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney gestured proudly around the room. Two large drafting boards were placed by the windows. A set of well equipped workbenches were lined up against one wall. Camrie was sitting at one of them, stripping down a piece of machinery and carefully setting the various components out in order. Two large filing cabinets stood in the corner and a selection of diagrams were pinned up around the walls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhase 2. We\u0027re taking the useful parts from stock, working out where they fit and then measuring them and drawing up plans so we can make more of them! We\u0027re doing the same for parts that we\u0027ve already prototyped - Camrie is working on the LV15 combustion chamber right now and I forget what Roncott is doing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CParachute ejector rails,\u0022 said Roncott happily,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yes,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney enthusiastically, \u201Cwe\u0027ll need to test this, Jeb but I think we\u0027ve got a much lighter design for the rails - and Roncott has figured out a way of using fewer parts too! I\u0027m working on the electrical system for the Kerbal 2. Bill had a great idea for making the electrics more modular. Not quite sure how it\u0027s going to work yet but we\u0027re hoping that the modular system will be need less cabling and be easier to build and install!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb beamed. \u201CNot bad at all guys - it\u0027s almost starting to look like we know what we\u0027re doing!\u0022\u00A0He moved to one side as Wernher pushed past him. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCamrie - do you have the plans for the LV-9 propellant manifold?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie pulled open a cabinet drawer and flicked through it. \u201CRight here, Wernher. Just leave it on the table here once you\u0027re done.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Camrie - Oh hi, Jeb - didn\u0027t see you there.\u0022 Wernher dashed out of the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his head. \u201CHaven\u0027t seen Wernher looking that excited for a while.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney chuckled. \u0022Me neither. I think he\u0027s quite enjoying working to proper plans for a change.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled. \u201CFinally having the money to buy in some materials is helping too I think. Our little museum is bringing in some cash now and we made quite a lot from ticket sales for the Kerbin 1 launch. I have to admit that all the free advertising is helping the junkyard business too.\u00A0Oh - that reminds me, Genie. There\u0027s a couple of drums outside in the yard that you may want to take a look at. Don\u0027t go too near them with a naked flame though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s eyes lit up. \u0027Trashcan propellant?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou got it. I tell you what though - I think we should look seriously at going to an all-liquid design. I had to call in a favour to get hold of those drums and even then they were pricey. Apparently they\u0027ve got a big new customer and they just can\u0027t make the stuff fast enough at the moment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CSomething to talk over with Ornie and Wernher,\u0022 he said, \u201CWernher never really liked using solid boosters anyway so he won\u0027t mind. And now they\u0027ve worked out a better turbopump for the LV-9, maybe they can squeeze a bit more power out of the LV-15 too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was early afternoon at the Spaceship Museum and Jeb was taking a turn at the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E, cheerfully posing for photographs and signing hats. Lucan trotted up and tapped him on the shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhone call for you Jeb,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI told them you\u0027d take it in your office.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb Kerman here - who\u0027s speaking please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is Thomplin Kerman at Stratus Ltd.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPleased to meet you, Thomplin - what can I do for you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell it\u0027s like this, Jeb. We\u0027re in the storage business. Gases and liquids mainly and I think we\u0027ve got one or two products that you might be interested in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb fished out a notepad from his desk drawer. \u201CGo on, Thomplin - what kind of products did you have in mind?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell as I said, we\u0027re in the gas storage business. Pressurised gas mainly - although we are starting to look at cold storage solutions too. Anyway, we\u0027ve come up with a design for a compact spherical tank. Very light, very strong and holds about 20 kg of fuel... I mean gas.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb drew a circle around \u002720 kg\u0027 on his pad. \u201CHow about pressure regulation?\u0022 he asked, \u201Cand how big is this thing?\u0022 He listened intently as Thomplin rattled off details. \u201CHmm. I think we could certainly use that. I hate to ask but how much do you sell these for?\u0022 He winced. \u201CUh - I presume you offer discounts if we buy them in bulk? Oh that is with the discount... OK\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sat back in his chair. \u201CI\u0027m sorry but we can\u0027t afford that,\u0022 he said, disappointment leaking into his voice. \u201CIt\u0027s a real pity - I\u0027ve got some ideas already about how we could use those tanks and I bet the team here will have even more. But we could get an awful lot of much needed material for that price.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlthough... hmm. Maybe we could work something else out. What would Stratus say to a sponsorship deal?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin\u0027s voice was cautious. \u201CWhat kind of sponsorship are we talking about Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought rapidly. \u201CWe got a couple of thousand people watching our last launch and we\u0027ve got some pretty big plans for the next few launches, so we expect that number to go up. No reason why we couldn\u0027t set some billboards up for you. Maybe even set aside some space where you can set up a display for your latest bits and pieces. There\u0027s a fair bit of room on the side of a rocket too - what would you say to painting a Stratus company logo on there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd in return for that, we supply you with the tanks at a reduced price?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m thinking free, Thomplin. Lots of exposure for you - and we make sure that everyone knows that Stratus tanks are helping get us to orbit. That sort of endorsement has got to be worth a couple of free tanks I reckon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin sounded thoughtful. \u201CWe might be able to work on that, Jeb. Tell you what - how about if we come over next week with some samples?\u00A0Your team get to have a look at them and we get to see the launch site and talk things over.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooking forward to it. Would M\u00FCnday afternoon at 2:00pm suit you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat would be perfect, Jeb. See you then.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat evening, Jeb called a meeting. The Kerbin\u00A0Interplanetary Society was growing rapidly and the original eight names had now grown to a respectable crowd of some twenty members, all sitting out in the back yard in time honoured fashion. Jeb got to his feet and waited patiently for the chatter to die down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK folks. I\u0027ve called this meeting after a very interesting phone call today with one Thomplin Kerman from Stratus Ltd. Apparently they sell some hardware that we could use - and I think we can do business with them. The question is - do we actually need their stuff?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy raised his hand. \u201CDepends what they\u0027re selling, Jeb,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Calthough I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s not complete junk if you bothered to give this Thomplin the time of day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh it\u0027s far from junk, Malmy, said Jeb, \u0022if I\u0027m understanding things right, it could be a nice compact propellant tank. Spherical, pressure controlled, holds 20 kg of whatever gas we put in there. Supposed to be lightweight too but I don\u0027t know how light.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt won\u0027t be cheap though,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie, \u201CMe and Richlin know Stratus pretty well. They do nice tanks but they charge a nice price too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb coughed. \u201CI think we can work around that,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CI\u0027m kinda hoping that some billboard space at Kerbin\u0027s first Space Centre, plus maybe their name on the side of a couple of rockets, will persuade them to part with a few little propellant tanks. But, as I said, the question is - what would we do with them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie got to her feet. \u201CCould we use one to power a small rocket? Something we could put on the back of a satellite and actually fly it around a bit once it gets to orbit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoncott jumped up excitedly, \u201CYeah - we could fly it to the M\u00FCn!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan laughed. \u201CDon\u0027t think we could get it to the M\u00FCn, Roncott. It would be great for moving a heavier satellite around in orbit though. Sounds perfect for the kind of rocket control system that me and Geneney were talking about too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a clamour of voices. \u201CRocket control system? What are you talking about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan raised his arms for silence. \u201CWell we\u0027re not going to need it any time soon - the Kerbal 2 won\u0027t be going that high. But one day we \u003Cem\u003E will \u003C/em\u003E be going a lot higher and we were just figuring out how we\u0027d set about steering a capsule at that height. We thought a set of small rockets around the capsule would do the trick but we couldn\u0027t quite work out how the fuel supply would work. A small pressurised tank sounds like just the thing, especially if it really does hold 20 kg of gas.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep - 20 kg of gas would let us do quite a bit of maneuvering,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney. He snapped his fingers. \u201CActually - forget the rockets. A lightweight gas tank would be just the thing for taking some extra air along for longer flights!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb listened happily as the ideas flew back and forth. Then he heard Bob\u0027s voice over the noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb - do they make a bigger tank than 20 kg?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI expect so, Bob - I\u0027ll certainly ask them when they drop by next week. They\u0027ll be bringing a couple of tanks along too, so everyone can get a look at them, maybe try them out. Why do you ask?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob looked thoughtful. \u201CIt was what you said about pressure control that got me thinking,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI was wondering if we could fill one with something non flammable and then stick it in the top of a fuel tank. Use the pressure of the escaping gas to push the fuel out of the other end of the tank. It probably wouldn\u0027t work so well for a big engine but something smaller like the LV-9s, we might be able to do away with the turbopump altogether.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher walked over to Bob and shook him by the hand. \u201CThat might just be the best idea that you\u0027ve come up with yet,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CNo reason at all why that wouldn\u0027t work and it should make the LV-9 series into a really simple and versatile engine for all kinds of things!\u0022\u00A0He looked Roncott in the eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing big you understand. Just little routine things like landing on the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=470625\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 4\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=494766\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 6\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-18T06:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2020 06:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPunctuation fail.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T19:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T21:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh boy...We all know Jeb The Pilot.

Which is fine but isn\u0027t necessarily easy when it comes to writing because at some point I need to use pronouns dammit! Some writers (for example Greg Egan) use genderless pronouns very well (viz, ver, ve) but I certainly aint no Greg Egan and didn\u0027t really fancy writing a whole story with them. Also I have a feeling they would turn anything Wernher says into bad comedy German. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E However, as the story developed and the cast of characters started expanding, I was getting uncomfortable using \u0027he, his, him\u0027 as generic pronouns.

Or flown \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E to the M\u00FCn\u00A0for that matter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked at him impatiently. \u201COf course not,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cand believe me, I know exactly how much we need to do before we can even think about it. Pressure fed engines are still going to be a major step forward though, especially if we use hypergolic propellants. Just open two valves and whoosh - propellants mix and engine fires. Believe me, I\u0027d much rather be depending on something like that to get me back to Kerbin rather than a collection of igniters and pumps!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb made a placating gesture. \u0022OK, OK. I see what you mean - I just hope the people at Stratus can come up with what we need. In the meantime, we need something a little smaller but something that will still be a useful test of the Stratus tanks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob cleared his throat. \u201CWe could launch another satellite,\u0022 he suggested, \u201CExcept this time we make it more like a mini capsule. We use the same LV-902 second stage that we used for the Kerbin 1 but we upgrade the LV-15 with the new turbopump. That should boost its performance enough that we can launch a heavier payload than last time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone\u0027s attention was fixed on Bob as he continued. \u201CWe build a propulsion module with one of those Stratus tanks - assuming they are all that Jeb seems to think they\u0027ll be. Then we have the satellite itself but this time it\u0027s a little bit more than a radio transmitter in a ball. It has a heat shield at one end, a parachute at the other and a couple of cameras in the middle. We lift both modules to orbit, fly them around a bit, take some pictures and then use the propulsion module to de-orbit. Satellite detaches from the propulsion module, re-enters the atmosphere and lands by parachute.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s jaw dropped. \u201CGood grief, Bob. I\u0027m not sure who\u0027s worse, you or Wernher.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher spoke up. \u201CActually that sounds doable, Jeb but I suggest we keep it simple. We use the propulsion module as a very small third stage if we need a bit more speed to get to orbit. Then we use it to put the satellite into a slow spin. We do a couple of orbits, fire the propulsion module again to stop the spin and then one last time to drop out of orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan raised a hand. \u201CI presume that we time things so that we do the de-orbit maneuver after an exact number of orbits?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher. \u201CFitting any sort of guidance system into something that small is going to be difficult. I\u0027m not saying that we can\u0027t do it but I don\u0027t think it should be a priority. So we don\u0027t bother. It does mean that we\u0027ll get a pretty odd collection of pictures though, since the satellite will be pointing in the same direction all the time, rather than tracking the horizon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmm, calculating the re-entry path is going to be fun. Might not be a bad idea to fire a couple of test flights out over the sea first to give us more idea about how much drag we\u0027ll get. Not with a full flight article though of course, just something the same size and mass...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027ve got an idea,\u0022\u00A0said Richlin, \u201COrnie and I have got a couple of friends out by the Eastern Wakira\u00A0coast. If we did put a radio in this thing, I\u0027m sure Sigbin and Doodlie would let us know as it passes overhead. That should give Lucan time to tweak the re-entry a bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHang on - where are we putting the heat shield and when do we lose the propulsion module?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWill we have room for a radio and the cameras?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb had to raise his voice as nineteen excited kerbals started discussing Bob\u0027s plan and arguing over the technical details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, OK folks! I think that\u0027s a big yes for Bob\u0027s satellite plan! But at the risk of bringing everyone back down to Kerbal for a moment, we\u0027ve got another ship to launch first!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe propulsion team surveyed their work with satisfaction. Four RT-5 boosters, complete with decoupler mounts, rested in the assembly jig, neatly arrayed around a mockup of the Kerbal 2 lower stage. Malmy\u0027s back made a popping noise as he stretched. \u201CI think that\u0027s got it, lads. We can finish the paintwork this afternoon and then take em out to the Tent tomorrow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie opened his lunch bag. \u201CSounds good to me, Malmy. The lower stage is about done apart from the arming circuits for the decouplers and Gene\u0027s people are out there working on this today. Hey, Wernher - put the radio on would you? It should be about time for the news.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFamiliar music drifted through the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThis is KBS News at 1:00pm. In our main story this lunchtime, space fever heats up in Foxham as the Rockomax Corporation announces a successful test of their new BA-A rocket booster. Our space correspondent Leland Kerman was there to watch the launch.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie dropped his bag. \u201CRockomax Corporation?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CGood afternoon. I am Leland Kerman and I\u0027m standing outside the main control room at the Rockomax test site. With me today is Ademone Kerman, owner and company manager of Rockomax, who has kindly agreed to speak to KBS before this important test flight.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAdemone, perhaps you could tell the listeners a little about this flight. Why is this such an important test?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CGood afternoon,\u00A0Leland and welcome to this test of our new BA-A booster. This is the first in what we hope will be a series of our next generation solid fuel rockets, so it\u0027s a pretty big day for us.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI can imagine, Ademone. So what height are you expecting the BA-A to reach? Will you be aiming for orbit?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAdemone laughed. \u201CI\u0027m afraid not. The BA-A is really a test bed for a number of new technologies, which we will be building into our planned orbital launcher in the coming months. It should still be quite a spectacular flight though - the rocket will reach a top speed of just over 1 kilometre per second and a height of just under 17 thousand metres.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThat\u0027s quite a way up - I hope it\u0027s not going to drop back on our heads!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COh no - by the time it falls safely into the sea, the BA-A will be over 25 kilometres away.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThat\u0027s extremely impressive, Ademone. But tell me - why Rockomax? What made you decide to become a rocket builder?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWell as you know, Leland, Rockomax used to be the Speciality Firework Company, so we\u0027ve always been a rocket company really - we\u0027re just building bigger ones now. But really, it was the Barkton Satellite that made the decision for me. The idea of launching a rocket all the way around Kerbin was just inspired!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CSo you\u0027re convinced about the Barkton Satellite? Many people have dismissed it as a hoax or a joke.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COh I thought so too at first, Leland. But it quickly became obvious that it was quite real. I do a little amateur radio myself and let me put it this way - it would have been easier to put a satellite into orbit than it would have been to coordinate a network of fake radio broadcasts so accurately across the whole of Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWell that sounds pretty conclusive to me and I hope our listeners will feel the same way. Ademone Kerman - thank you very much.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt\u0027s now just under five minutes to launch. In the distance I can just make out the last of the Rockomax engineers making their way back from the booster...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie clicked the radio off. \u201CSounds like we have a little competition,\u0022 he said quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher was still looking indignant. \u201CA hoax - why would we bother with a hoax?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy was looking a little wide eyed. \u201COne thousand metres a second - I wouldn\u0027t fancy sitting on top of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell you need to be going a lot faster than that to get to orbit,\u0022 said Wernher, \u201CBut I don\u0027t expect they\u0027re putting much on top of their booster if those altitude and range figures are at all accurate. A solid fuel motor with a very light payload will get very fast very quickly but there\u0027s no real way of controlling the thrust. I think they\u0027re being rather optimistic with their talk of an orbital launcher.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEven so,\u0022 said Ornie, \u201Cthey managed to get it off the ground without exploding - and they did it on a live news broadcast too. They might be optimistic but they\u0027re not exactly lacking in confidence either. We should tell Jeb about this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin was feeling somewhat dubious as he pulled up outside the old warehouse. This had to be the right place with a sign like that but it all looked a little bit run down. It was busy enough, although it wasn\u0027t really what he\u0027d expected from an organisation that had apparently launched a rocket into outer space. Someone had obviously noticed their arrival and passed a message inside, since a couple of minutes later a cheerful looking kerbal wearing a bright red hat popped his head around the warehouse door and bounded towards them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You must be Thomplin! Welcome to the Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Company. I\u0027m Jeb by the way\u0022. Jeb peered into the cab. \u0022Pleased to meet you um...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Halnie. Is there anywhere we can put the van?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Absolutely, Halnie\u0022, said Jeb enthusiastically, \u0022There\u0027s a couple of spaces in the yard, I\u0027ll just go and get them to open the gates for you! He rubbed his hands together. \u0022I tell you - you\u0027re going to love the test we\u0027ve got set up for your tanks!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb bounced away and disappeared back inside the warehouse. Moments later the main gates opened with a squeal of rusty hinges. Halnie glanced over at Thomplin, shrugged and started the van.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth kerbals looked around the yard with interest. This looked a bit more promising and if nothing else there certainly seemed to be a lot more going on. One kerbal was crawling out of a strange squat looking pod, which appeared to be surrounded by makeshift scaffolding. Another was perched on top of the scaffolding, carefully attaching what looked like a conical lid to the roof of the pod. In the centre of the yard a group of kerbals were gathered round some kind of metal framework peering intently at something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb ran over to them. \u0022This way!\u0022 he called, gesturing towards the framework. Their curiosity piqued, Halnie and Thomplin followed him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe device mounted on the framework was like nothing they\u0027d ever seen before. It appeared to consist of a small cube of metal struts stuffed with a dense tangle of plumbing. Four nozzles were attached to the outside of the cube, each one pointing in a different direction. A tube led out of the back and into a large cylindrical tank standing next to the main frame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pointed at the tank. \u201CYou see the problem?\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CWe can make the control thrusters pretty small but that\u0027s no good if we still need a big heavy tank for the propellant.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie and Thomplin stared at him blankly. Jeb looked momentarily puzzled. \u0022You did know that we build spacecraft right? Well this is a steering system for a spacecraft. You can\u0027t use wings in space - no air - so we use sets of small rocket thrusters to steer instead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie bent down to inspect the fuel line coupling. \u201CLooks like we\u0027ll need a 3c adaptor,\u0022 she called over her shoulder. \u201CThe tank looks standard enough, so the filler pump ought to handle it. Then she noticed the warning signs painted on the side of the cylinder. \u201CBest bring the protective gear too I think - whatever this stuff is it looks pretty nasty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn that case,\u0022\u00A0Thomplin said dryly, \u201Cwhy don\u0027t we just see if we\u0027ve brought the right sized tanks first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone gathered round eagerly and craned forward trying to see as Halnie opened the equipment cart and with some effort, lifted a white metal object onto the test stand. As promised, it was basically spherical, it\u0027s smooth walls broken only by a hose coupling on the top and a set of metal flanges which it was currently resting on. Malmy was skeptical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell it\u0027s small enough. Doesn\u0027t look like it hold 20 kilos of anything though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin gestured. \u201CI assure you it\u0027s heavier than it looks. Go ahead and pick it up if you like. Actually if you could put it on the ground that would be helpful.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy slipped his hands casually under the tank and lifted. His eyebrows shot up as he took a rather better grip on it and tlifted it carefully down off the stand. He looked at Thomplin with new respect. Thomplin nodded slightly and rather theatrically, took a heavy looking sledgehammer off the equipment cart. He raised the hammer over his head and before the horrified crowd of kerbals around him could do anything, let it drop squarely onto the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy stared in disbelief as the hammer bounced off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPressurised,\u0022\u00A0said Halnie casually, \u0022I wouldn\u0027t try that with an empty one but they\u0027re pretty sturdy once you fill them up. I would stand back for this part though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone moved a respectful distance from the test stand as Halnie donned her protective clothing and lifted a second tank off the cart and hooked it up to the propellant cylinder with practised ease. There was a collective drawing in of breath as the filler pump started up with a loud clatter and monpropellant flooded into the tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pump shut off automatically and Halnie carefully closed the cylinder valve and disconnected the tank. Working briskly she lifted it onto the test stand and attached it to the thruster block.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, Jeb - what was that test you wanted to show us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=481909\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 5\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0\u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=495693\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 7\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-09T17:48:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2019 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixing brackets and typs and adding italics.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T23:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHah!

A stubby handgrip protruded from the panel mounted on a complicated looking articulated arm. \u0022This is just for testing now of course,\u0022 he said, \u0022but eventually, we\u0027re hoping to develop this into a control system for the pilots.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb cupped his hands round his mouth. \u0022Clear the stand!\u0022 he shouted, \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E test about to start!\u0022 He waved towards the handgrip. \u0022Go ahead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie stepped forward eagerly. \u0022OK what do I do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust take hold of the handgrip and try moving it around\u0022, said Jeb. \u0022You\u0027ll soon get the hang of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie pushed the controller tentatively forward and jumped as a burst of flame shot out of the top of the thruster block. She hurriedly pulled it back, only to trigger a second jet of flame from the nozzle underneath. Frowning slightly she pushed the handgrip slowly forward, until the upper nozzle just fired and then drew it back again, triggering the a brief puff of flame from the lower nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Forward and back control pitch,\u0022 said Jeb, waggling his hand to demonstrate. \u0022Side to side will control roll eventually, although you won\u0027t see any difference now. Proper pitch and roll control will need a pair of thruster blocks.\u0022 Halnie pushed the controller to one side experimentally and sure enough the upper thruster fired again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Twisting the handle gives you yaw control,\u0022 Jeb continued \u0022but again, proper control needs a pair of blocks\u0022. Moving more confidently now, Halnie twisted the handgrip back and forth and grinned with delight as first one and then the other of the side nozzles burst into life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned too. \u0022We\u0027re running a calibration test on the controller later today, he said. \u0022You\u0027re welcome to help if you like - we need to test it with as many people as possible to get an idea of where best to put the trigger points. You\u0027d be welcome to have a go too, Thomplin!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin was still mulling over Jeb\u0027s first comment. \u201CYou mentioned something about pilots, Jeb.

You get a nice view from 35 kilometres up but you\u0027re not high enough to need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E control.

We\u0027ll be mating the Kerbal 2 with its launch vehicle too, so you can have a good look at the whole ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie\u0027s truck bumped over the grass as he drove out to the launch pad. Beside him, Thomplin\u0027s head was swivelling back and forth as he took everything in. Plenty of room to put up a Stratus billboard or two, just like Jeb had promised. Lots of people to look at them too, if the number of seats was anything to go by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie\u0027s eyes were fixed firmly on the approaching launch tower, although at the moment, it looked like nothing so much as a very large shower booth. She commented on this to Ornie, who chuckled. \u201CIt does a bit now that you mention it. We call it The Tent with all those drapes hanging around it. They do a decent enough job of keeping the vweather off during assembly although I\u0027m looking forward to the day that we can put up a proper building for the job!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the truck came closer, pairs of kerbals emerged from behind the drapes and started rolling them out of the way, exposing the tall central tank and stubby side boosters of the rocket. Both Thomplin and Halnie\u0027s eyes widened. Halnie was practically bouncing up and down in her seat in her eagerness to get out and inspect the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E at close quarters. For his part Thomplin wasn\u0027t any more convinced by the rocket than he had been by the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe truck rolled to a stop. A shadow fell over the cab as high up on the launch tower, the assembly crane swung around and lowered a cable down towards the waiting spacecraft. Halnie hopped out the cab and watched as the capsule was hoisted into the air and set delicately down on top of the rocket. Two kerbals, both securely tethered to the launch tower, set about attaching a set of what looked like clamps to the capsule, although Halnie couldn\u0027t help noticing that they were being handled rather gingerly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie followed her gaze. \u201CDecouplers,\u0022\u00A0he said briefly. \u201CBasically, small explosive bolts that we use to detach the booster once it\u0027s out of fuel.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven Halnie looked slightly taken aback at that and beside her, Thomplin just rolled his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know,\u0022\u00A0Ornie acknowledged, \u201Cthey do work though. On a different note, we were wondering - do Stratus make larger versions of those spherical tanks?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDepends what you mean by larger but yes we do another tank that has about twice the volume of the demo model we showed you.\u0022Halnie cocked her head. \u201CDifficult to say how heavy that would be - depends what you put in it and at what pressure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmmm,\u0022 said Ornie, \u201CI\u0027m not sure what Bob and Wernher had in mind but that sounds like it should work.\u0022\u00A0He pointed at the side boosters. \u201CAt the moment, those things are solid fueled but we\u0027re really hoping to stop using solids. We were thinking about a pressure fed liquid design but that would need us to store quite a lot of high pressure gas in a small space. Your larger tank sounds worth a try.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked at Thomplin. \u201CYou\u0027d be more than welcome to talk things over with them tonight and come and watch the launch tomorrow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin didn\u0027t need to see Halnie\u0027s face. \u201CThat would be most generous,\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney waited by the capsule, clutching the gantry rail and trying to ignore the beads of sweat running down the back of his neck. Lucan stood beside him, his bright orange pressure suit highlighted against the grey sky, one hand swinging his flight helmet casually back and forth. There was a knock from inside the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E and then Bob clambered carefully back out through the hatch. Geneney steeled himself and climbed inside, squeezing in past the control panel and settling himself into the centre seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob passed his helmet through the hatch and then climbed in himself. He set to work connecting Geneney\u0027s suit to the capsule systems whilst Geneneny shuffled around trying to make himself comfortable in the confines of his seat. Finally, Bob placed the helmet over his head and locked it carefully into place on the neck ring of his suit. He rapped on the transparent visor and gave Geneney a cheerful thumbs up before crawling back out of the capsule to let Lucan take his place in the third seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stared around the inside of the capsule listening to Lucan chattering away as Bob plugged him in. Then Lucan too got a good luck rap on the visor and a thumbs up. With a final \u201CGood Luck,\u0022\u00A0Bob climbed out onto the gantry, slamming the hatch shut behind him. Lucan reached over his head and twisted the locking wheel closed. A detached part of Geneney\u0027s mind nodded in satisfaction as the hatch bolts slid smoothly into place with a reassuring clunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney flicked a toggle switch on the control panel. \u201CControl, this is Kerbal 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie\u0027s voice came back over his headset. \u201CReading you loud and clear, Gene. Running final checks on the booster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney flicked off the external comms link. \u201CYou know\u00A0guys, this capsule looks a lot more sturdy from the outside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan turned his head awkwardly towards him. \u201CJust as long as you remembered to stick the parachute on top. Besides you \u003Cem\u003E built \u003C/em\u003E this thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know - that\u0027s what\u0027s worrying me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher cleared his throat. \u201CHow do you think I feel then,\u0022 he said wryly, \u201Cgiven that I built the engines. Better switch the external loop back on Gene - they shouldn\u0027t be too much longer with those checks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob\u0027s voice filled their ears. \u201CAll rocket systems check out. Guidance control and launch sequencing transferred to booster. Ready when you are, Ornie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK then. We all know what we\u0027re doing. LV-15 engine start on my mark, 3 second hold down at full power as a last check, then we release the clamps and light up the Trashcans. That last bit is probably...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney smiled and found himself relaxing at last. \u003Cem\u003EGoing to be a bit bouncy\u003C/em\u003E, he murmured to himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022... so you might want to hold on something. Ignition in five...four...three...two...one.. Mark!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney braced himself, as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E came to life around him. The capsule shook with the steadily increasing rumble from the LV-15 far below his back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Holding for three...two...one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RT-5s ignited right on schedule with a deafening roar, ramming Geneney back into his seat as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E hurtled skywards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie and Thomplin held their breath with the rest of the crowd as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E soared out over the sea trailing a thick plume of roiling grey smoke behind it. Despite his earlier misgivings, the sheer spectacle and controlled fury of a live rocket launch had touched even Thomplin\u0027s cautious soul and he had cheered himself hoarse with everyone else as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E lifted off. Halnie was simply starstruck as she watched the fiery dot disappear into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was noisy beyond belief, the shaking was terrifying and it was the most exhilarating thing he had ever done in his life! Geneney\u0027s face was pulled back into a broad grin as the acceleration built up to painful levels. How long had the Trashcans been burning? Lifting his head was out of the question, so there was no way to check the fuel gauge on the control panel. No way of checking the altimeter either. No matter \u003Cem\u003EGeneney\u003C/em\u003E, he told himself, \u003Cem\u003Ejust enjoy it while it lasts\u003C/em\u003E. Outside, the sky was gradually fading into a deep midnight blue as the capsule rose higher and higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RT-5s stuttered briefly, once, twice, before finally falling silent. All three kerbalnauts were flung forward in their straps as the thrust abruptly died away. Four loud bangs announced the departure of the Trashcans as the LV-15 pushed them gently onwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbal 2 this is Control. Come in Kerbal 2!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney forced himself to speak. \u201CThis is the Kerbal 2,\u0022 he whispered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSay again Kerbal 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher spoke up. \u201CWe\u0027re all good, Control. Clean separation on RT-5s. Gene got a little squashed but he\u0027s OK.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan\u0027s voice sounded a little strained. \u201CThere has \u003Cem\u003E got \u003C/em\u003E to be a better way of doing this,\u0022 he said, \u201CI mean - I didn\u0027t think Bob was exaggerating when he was talking about getting mashed but sheesh - he really really wasn\u0027t joking either!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie laughed. \u201CBob\u0027s just wondering if you\u0027re all going to join him in persuading Jeb to fit some extra padding to those seats. Thirty seconds to staging, guys!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the crushing acceleration of the Trashcans, the last moments of powered flight were almost soothing. Geneney leaned forward and watched the reading on the fuel gauge drop lazily downwards. There was a brief moment of quiet as the engine shut down, followed by a familiar bang as the booster dropped away, leaving the capsule to coast upwards under its own momentum. Geneney was delighted to find himself feeling unexpectedly light, so light in fact that he was floating off his seat and bobbing gently against his harness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLook guys - I\u0027m floating!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext to him, Lucan was looking happier than he had all flight. \u201CThis is \u003Cem\u003Eawesome\u003C/em\u003E! Hey, Control - how come nobody told us about this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo response from here,\u0022 said Ornie, \u201CI\u0027m guessing they were just wedged a bit more tightly into their seats. Looks like you\u0027re all getting a first on your flight too!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey that\u0027s a thought,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney, \u201CMove your head, Lucan - I want to see out of the window!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolute silence filled the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you guys OK up there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yes,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney softly, \u201COh we really are. I\u00A0don\u0027t how to describe this, Ornie. I know how Jeb felt now - there just aren\u0027t good words for this. Bill did a great job with his photos but... I guess it\u0027s like trying to photograph a sunset. Even the best pictures just don\u0027t compare.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShadows slowly drifted over the capsule walls as it coasted onwards, lit from beneath by the bright glow of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. It rocked slightly as it reached the top of its arc and started the long descent. The kerbalnauts could hear a gradually increasing thrumming noise from outside the capsule as it dropped back into thicker air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney kept one eye on the altimeter as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E plummeted back towards the ground, acutely aware that his life and Lucan and Wernher\u0027s too were entirely dependent on the folded pieces of fabric mounted on the capsule roof. He glanced at the control panel uneasily as the capsule continued to accelerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCRACK! Geneney jerked against his harness as the drogue chute deployed. The queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach told him that the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E was finally slowing down. Moments later, there was another sharp crack as the drogue departed, followed by a deeply reassuring thump as the main chute shot off its rails. The capsule was slowing down rapidly now as the parachute bit into the surrounding air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneneny watched the altimeter unwind. Three thousand metres, two thousand... one thousand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main parachute unfurled, lines going briefly slack as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E slowed to a virtual standstill and then floated sedately down towards the waiting sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie let out her breath in an explosive gasp as the orange disc unfurled and turned to Thomplin with shining eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have \u003Cem\u003E got \u003C/em\u003E to be part of this, Tom! This is the future and Stratus needs to be there with it. You\u0027ve seen what these people are planning - you know this is just the start!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThomplin embraced her wordlessly. In his heart of hearts he agreed. Selling the idea to Stratus management wasn\u0027t going to be hard either. If that fellow Ornie was correct, each rocket alone would need four of their large tanks each and then goodness knows what else the capsule would need to store. He gently let Halnie go and turned to Jeb with a wry smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think that last test just convinced us, Jeb. I can give you six of each type of tank in exchange for that sponsorship deal you mentioned. After that you\u0027ll need to start paying but I have a sneaking feeling that you\u0027ll be qualifying for a bulk discount!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb clasped his hand with gratitude. \u201CThank you,\u0022 he said softly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie watched the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E as it dropped towards the horizon. \u201CI do have one question,\u0022 she said.\u00A0\u201CHow do I learn to fly one of those ships?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=494766\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 6\u003C/a\u003E \u00A0 :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=510059\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 8\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-09T17:50:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2019 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T15:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUp, up and away! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Interplanetary Society is growing nicely.
