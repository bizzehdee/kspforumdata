The two veteran Kerbonauts couldn\u0027t resist the opportunity to share their passion with the next generation of explorers, so they agreed to teach the children how to make and fly bottle rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nJebediah and Valentina spent the next few weeks working with the children, teaching them about the principles of rocketry and guiding them through the process of building their own rockets. They showed them how to design fins and a nosecone, how to measure the right amount of fuel, and how to safely launch their rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nAt first, the children were hesitant and a bit clumsy, but with Jebediah and Valentina\u0027s patient guidance, they quickly became more confident and skilled. They spent hours tinkering with their rockets, testing different designs and tweaking their fuel ratios until they were satisfied with their creations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nFinally, the big day arrived, and the children gathered at a nearby field to launch their rockets. The Kerbal parents and other spectators watched as the children excitedly counted down from 10 and then released their rockets into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nSome of the rockets soared gracefully through the sky, while others spun out of control and crashed to the ground. But no matter the outcome, the children were thrilled with their creations and with the experience of launching them into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nJebediah and Valentina couldn\u0027t have been more proud of their students. They had shown them the magic of rocketry and instilled in them a love for exploration and discovery. As they packed up their equipment and said goodbye to the children, Jebediah and Valentina knew that they had made a difference in the lives of these young Kerbals and that they had inspired a new generation of explorers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nJebediah Kerman and Valentina Kerman were on a routine flight in their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spacecraft when something went wrong.

They started to walk in the direction they believed would lead them back to civilization, but after a few days, they had no luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nOne day, Jebediah stumbled upon a cactus plant. He remembered hearing stories about how the juice from these plants could quench thirst, so he decided to try it out. He cut off a piece of the cactus and sucked on it, but instead of quenching his thirst, it made him feel strange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nJebediah\u0027s vision started to blur, and he saw strange shapes and colors dancing in the air around him.

He started to run around in circles, flailing his arms and shouting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nValentina tried to calm him down and get him to drink some water, but he was too far gone. Eventually, he collapsed onto the sand, exhausted from his hallucinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nValentina knew that she had to act fast. She built a makeshift shelter out of some nearby rocks and used the remaining water to keep Jebediah hydrated. She stayed by his side, talking to him and trying to keep him calm until he finally started to come down from his hallucinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nAfter a few days, a rescue team from the Kerbal Space Center arrived and found the two stranded Kerbonauts. They were brought back to safety, and Jebediah recovered from his ordeal. He never forgot the strange and surreal experience of being lost in the desert and drinking cactus juice, and he always made sure to carry plenty of water on his flights from that day forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nBilly-Bobfred Kerman and Leelle Kerman were excited to catch a movie at the local cinema.

He headed to the kitchen, rummaging through the cupboards to gather all the necessary ingredients.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nHe grabbed two slices of whole wheat bread and spread a generous amount of creamy peanut butter on one slice, followed by a thick layer of grape jelly on the other. Bob smacked his lips in anticipation as he carefully placed the two slices of bread together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nAs he was about to take a bite, he realized that something was missing. He looked around the kitchen for inspiration and spotted a bunch of bananas on the counter. Aha! Bob thought, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich just wouldn\u0027t be complete without a slice of banana.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nBob quickly sliced a banana and placed it between the peanut butter and jelly layers of his sandwich. He took a bite and savored the delicious combination of flavors and textures - the creamy peanut butter, sweet jelly, and soft banana.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nFeeling satisfied, Bob took a seat at the kitchen table and enjoyed his snack. As he ate, he thought about all the other variations he could make on the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich - adding honey, switching to almond butter, or using different types of fruit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f7f7f8;border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nBut for now, Bob was content with his banana-peanut butter-jelly creation. He finished the last bite, feeling happy and satisfied. And who knows, maybe one day his snack creation would become a new classic!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-03T16:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Fanworks\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AstroWolfie","CreatedById":223932,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-03T20:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
