(Reversible stock engines let me keep up the speed until the last possible moment. YAY.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when the second challenge was announced, I was stoked. A race all the way to KSP2? Grueling! But totally worth the shot! And I had plans for getting around the mountains. Awesome, Jeb-approved plans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I tried a run, and... ran into technical issues. Then real life got weird and I had to drop out of the entire challenge series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT I GOT VIDEO--complete with color commentary from Jeb. Aside from the race we discuss Kerbalkind\u0027s greatest sailor, and a bit of Kraken lore.
