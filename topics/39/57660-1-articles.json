Let the reader enjoy deciding that for him/herself. I would focus on a funny word play of one or more of the situations your pilot gets into. Fore example, if your pilot crashes on landing alot you could call it \u0022Tanglefoot Terror, the travails of Tandy Kerbal!\u0022 Or if you are of a more serious bent then something like, \u0022Buck Kerbal, 100 Crashes in Kerban Experimental Flight\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"axton32","CreatedById":57224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T04:45:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eno i want to do a ripoff of the tv show canada worst driver because the season just ended and i though that it could be something good in the same style in ksp\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T04:52:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParody can be fun, but it also tends to be derided. There\u0027s an art to doing it in a way that gets people to laugh without making them roll their eyes and give up on you. And by that I mean it takes a certain amount of subtlety, which really isn\u0027t present if you just take the original work\u0027s title and alter it slightly to fit the new context. One of my favorite examples of how to do a good parody title is the parody of Top Gun, called Hot Shots. That\u0027s a more oblique reference to the original (people who are \u0022top gun\u0022 pilots are often seen to be hotshots too).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
