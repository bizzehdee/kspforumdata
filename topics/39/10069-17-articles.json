Using the method outlined earlier to handle duplicate entries, and joining all of our data together, this should allow us to create very high resolution maps. When I get a decent CSV file-size, I\u0027ll redistribute them.\n\n**What I need from you:**\n\nRaw CSV data files generated by ISA MapSat v3.3.0\u002B in KSP 0.17\u002B (older versions have different elevation values and will likely seriously damage the master file when they are merged; do NOT send old data files). Upload them and PM me with a link to the file (compressed as best you can, in whatever format you want).\n\n**What I\u0027ll be doing:**\n\nCollecting all of these files and then smushing them all together, deleting duplicates, and redistributing them as CSV files (comma-separated, not semi-colon-separated) compressed somehow (I\u0027ll do a bit of testing to see what the most efficient compression format is for the data and use that).\n\nI\u0027ll also use the data to create high-res raster maps with contour-lines and other stuff using [GRASS GIS](http://grass.fbk.eu/). Given that processing a single csv of 300MB takes about ten minutes, and also given resource limitations on my end (that is to say, I\u0027m running a powerful consumer desktop, not a super-computer or say, Mac Pro with all the trimmings), it\u0027ll probably take at least a few days to complete, say, a map of Kerbin.\n\nOnce we have raster maps in-hand, it should be relatively trivial to upload them somewhere for people to use. (The generated images will be **massive**, assuming we collect all possible data-points.)\n\nFor now I\u0027m going to say the initial target should be Kerbin (since we don\u0027t yet have a high-res data set for it). Just leave KSP running at 50x with your mapping satellite active, collecting raw data, and send it to me when it\u0027s reasonable (say, 300MB - 1GB? Ish?). If you \\*really\\* want to help me, then move the original out of the folder and send it to me, so that ISA MapSat creates a new file as it collects new data, then send me that second file later after it\u0027s grown. This will prevent me from having to reprocess the same data multiple times, and will save considerable effort on my end.\n\nThat said, I\u0027m certainly willing to accept whatever data anyone wants to throw my way that conforms to the aforementioned standard (ISA MapSat 3.3.0\u002B, KSP 0.17\u002B).\n\nEdit: Just to put things in perspective, the max-res file would be about 15GB. At a data collection rate of ~767KB/s (which is what I got by watching the csv file size over three minutes), it\u0027ll take 41 days of constant data collection to finish it. That\u0027s not accounting for the time lost generating duplicate data and, removing it, and hoping for non-duplicate data to be recorded (the rate at which new data can be collected is roughly asymptotic, approaching zero new points per time as the file size reaches the maximum possible; this means that the estimate of 41 days is very, very conservative).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-04T09:31:02Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2012 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix\\_ca**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grand Lander","CreatedById":31521,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T10:06:25Z","Content":"Ha i aint ready any of that.

You can upload updated versions later as you get more data. There\u0027s no restrictions, I just suggest larger amounts because small files (like say 60MB) are a little less efficient on time. Whatever you send me, whenever you send it (with multiple updates even), I\u0027ll figure-out the most efficient method of merging it with the master data file.\n\nSo really, it\u0027s up to you.

I\u0027d say the bottom cutoff is about 15MB for Kerbin elevation maps, at this time. With sizes that small, most are liable to be duplicates. I\u0027d still process and merge them, but it\u0027s not the best use of anyone\u0027s time. (If I wasn\u0027t clear, sending 400MB now and more data later would be awesome.\n\nAside: To reiterate for everyone\u0027s benefit, please compresses raw data before seeing it along. Raw csv data compresses really well, to even less that 1/5th the original size in some cases.
