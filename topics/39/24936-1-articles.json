Yea, I\u0027m that old and still playing games. Still have some lingering family (I think) in Chico. Nice video. Holding off on mods, gonna wait and see just what is added to this game. I may not need mods. I\u0027m sure the DEVS are looking at what modders are creating and the popularity of these mods and may incorporate similar into the game. So patience is a virtue. Just wait and see. Besides, if I start now with mods, I may have to waste time updating them with every KSP update, just find that KSP has added to the game what I wanted in a mod.
