Using the limited rocket technology they had, a course was set for the closest inhabitable planet, Kerbin. Prior to their arrival, the Canadian kerbal were not aware of any conscious life forms on Kerbin and were surprised to find others of their kind. The Canadian kerbals joined the lesser advanced kerbals they had found and created the Kerbal Space Program. The Canadians eventually became enraged over the lack of responsibility that the Kerbin government took in order to ensure the safety of their pilots, as it seemed that the daily losses were anywhere from 10-100. This is when the Canadian Space Ehgency was invented. A separate program who\u0027s founding goal was to fight off the \u0022Delagare\u0022 who had originally exiled them from their home on Duna. This mission goal was set aside and deemed less important as the leader of the CSEH saw the lack of power within the Kerbal Space Program and decided that there were other objectives that could be taken much easier. This led to the Selene program which was designed to help the CSEH colonize the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in an aggressive manor. To this date the CSEH has multiple M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn colonies, Probes, and Space Stations, including the production of an interplanetary one for the purpose of bringing a large force of Canadian Kerbals back to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T10:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKernadians.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
