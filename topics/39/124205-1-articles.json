I\u0027ve just recently finished and uploaded the latest video in my KSP YouTube series, inspired in part by Macey Dean. My series has been building up to the events in this video for some time now and I am very proud of my work, so I thought I\u0027d take this opportunity to share it with you. I tried to capture the style of cinematic video reminiscent of Macey Dean\u0027s prestigious video \u0027Far From Home\u0027. I hope you enjoy and feel free to leave a comment or any constructive criticism. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pCOeO7J4Lw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
