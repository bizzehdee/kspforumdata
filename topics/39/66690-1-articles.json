I\u0027ve made a semi successful video regarding how to get to the Mun - and have just released a video on how to get to Minmus and back - I\u0027m fairly new to the game myself - roughly 40 hours of gametime. ALOT for most other games but I think this still qualifies me as a KSP Noob. Please let me know what you think - and please show some support!
