Sorry, Bill - getting carried away with myself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo need to apologise,\u201D said Bill mildly. \u201CI did mean it when I said that Munar orbit is good enough for me.\u201D His eyes lost their focus. \u201CBesides, the science planning team finally approved the Quiet Time radio experiments. The chances against hearing anything are astronomical and I doubt we\u2019d pick up anything anyway with the antennas we have but we can\u2019t get all the way out to the M\u00FCn and not try.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COhh, congratulations - which stars did they choose?\u201D said Calley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCherint Prime and Proxima Cherint. No surprises there. Nearest stars to Kerbol and both reasonably Kerbol-like themselves? It\u2019s where I\u2019d start.\u201D Bill smiled. \u201CA couple of the keener members of the planning team wanted me to try listening to Zyrix too, as our next nearest neighbour, but that would take too much time out of the observation and photography schedule.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalley smiled back. \u201CAnd I don\u2019t see them ignoring Kerbin\u2019s first kerbonaut photographer when he tells them that. That\u2019s a thought though - how much training did you do for Kerbal 1?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill blinked. \u201CThere wasn\u2019t really anything to train for. I took my camera along in the first place because there wasn\u2019t going to be any piloting to speak of. The only controls in the entire capsule were the emergency hatch jettison and the manual backups for the decouplers and chutes. Bob taped the heights for drogue and main chute deployment next to the altimeter and the decoupler timings were just a matter of waiting for the engine noise to stop and pressing the right button if the automatic systems failed. No need to work from the flight clock even.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomcas clapped a hand over his suddenly rumbling stomach. \u201CAnd it seems that \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E flight clock is telling me its lunch time. You folks want to grab something before the debrief?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSounds good,\u201D said Calley, \u201CI find that performance reviews are always best done on a full stomach.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Pioneer 7 crew and Tomcas\u2019s simulation team arrived at the half-empty canteen just in time to find everyone standing up to leave amidst a great clattering of cutlery and scraping of chairs. Tomcas spotted Derny squeezing past and tapped the chef on the shoulder. \u201CHey, Derny - what\u2019s happening?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerny glanced over his shoulder. \u201COh - hi Tomcas. Jeb\u2019s called a general meeting. No idea what about.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EJeb\u2019s \u003C/em\u003Ecalled the meeting?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep. Surprised me too. Hardly seen him around the place for Kerm knows how long.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomcas waited for the canteen to empty before darting in and snagging a packet of ration cubes from their stand. He ripped the top off and stuffed one of the chewy, dark cubes into his mouth before hurrying after the others. They slipped inside \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E 1 behind the rest of the crowd, James closing the side door behind them. Tomcas saw Jeb standing on a makeshift podium with Geneney, Ademone, Nelton and, he was astonished to see, Director Lodan. A squawk of static stilled the room and Jeb hastily adjusted his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan everyone hear me at the back? Okay.\u201D Jeb cleared his throat. \u201CThanks for coming, folks. We\u2019ve got a bit of an announcement to make, so rather than hold you up listening to me, I\u2019m going to pass you straight across to Director Lodan and I\u2019d ask you all to give him your full attention.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLodan accepted the microphone from Jeb and surveyed the rows of faces staring back at him. \u003Cem\u003EHere goes nothing.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals - Kerbin has a problem.\u201D A stifled cough from the back of the crowd was the only sound to be heard in the vast assembly building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe all heard President Obrick\u2019s bold solution to that problem and we all know that solution has stalled in the face of worldwide events. I believe the time is right to get it back on track.\u201D Lodan paused. \u201CI am therefore cancelling the Endurance 2 space station and replacing it with one that is better suited to our immediate needs. The new station - and I am open to suggestions as to what to name it - will be constructed from modules designed for the Starseed colony ships. At present those modules exist on paper only and paper modules will not get us to Duna. We need flight ready hardware and we need the manufacturing and supply lines to produce it in quantity. The new station will be our test program for all of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded to himself as Lodan continued. \u201CMore importantly, construction of the new station will also be our test program for assembling the colony ships in space. As you\u2019ll be aware, on-orbit assembly on that scale is a challenge that the space program has barely begun to address thus far and represents an unacceptable failure potential for Starseed. Good kerbals - that failure is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an option. Now, before we get into the details, does anyone have any questions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA forest of hands shot up. Jeb jumped down from the podium and handed over his microphone to the nearest questioner. Lodan listened, smiling humourlessly at her tone of voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed. Cutting right to the point then, I chose to make this announcement in Barkton for a reason. \u00A0For the moment, Starseed will be critically dependent on volunteers. A vain hope one might say, were it not for the fact that we know it works.\u201D Lodan\u2019s gaze swept the crowd. \u201CThe Kerbin Interplanetary Society - all of you here today - are living testimony to that. Yes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone stepped forward amidst a growing rumble of voices. \u201CWith the Director\u2019s permission, I also have an announcement to make.\u201D She waited for Lodan to dip his head. \u201CAs of today, on behalf of my board of directors, I am hereby placing the entire facilities, assets and personnel of the Rockomax Corporation at Director Lodan\u2019s disposal. Moreover, as of today, the Rockomax board and senior management, myself included, wish to give notice of their volunteer status and will remain on that status until such time as the KSA sees fit to rescind it.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA faint smile crossed Ademone\u2019s face. \u201CA long time ago, a bold kerbal persuaded me to join him in building the first cooperative project between Rockomax and the Kerbin Interplanetary Society. That project was the CORDS program and it proved that two radically different organisational cultures could work together for their common good.\u201D \u00A0The light caught Ademone\u2019s face. \u201CThe CORDS program was the first step on the road to Pioneer 4. For as that same bold kerbal told me; what matters is that we\u003Cem\u003E tried\u003C/em\u003E. What matters is that future generations will be able to look back at a time when we were magnificent.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone bowed her head then looked up, steely eyes radiating determination. \u201CRockomax stands with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E again. Together we \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E make this work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tight look of approval crossed Bill\u2019s face at Ademone\u2019s words but, as the questions from the crowd continued and the scale of Lodan\u2019s plans became clear, his heart began to sink. Mentally, he began adding up the number of launches needed to build the new station, a cold certainty settling over him like a cloud. He looked at Calley and saw the same cold certainty and resignation in her expression. James\u2019s face was unreadable. Bill mimed pulling a ripcord and both his crewmates nodded slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026that\u2019s correct. Most of the volunteers won\u2019t ever get near the spacecraft they help to build. Theirs will be the hard, unglamorous work of reforging the necessary chains of trust between companies and kerbals around the world. We expect - and Kerbin requires - no less of them\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Not immediately. Restarting R7 development will happen but the immediate priority will be to accelerate Type 6 production to meet the demand for more boosters.\u201D Lodan saw a lone raised hand near the door and craned his neck trying to spot its owner. \u201CYes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can help with that, Director.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb froze. \u003Cem\u003EOh Kerm take us all.\u003C/em\u003E Surprised murmurs rippled through the crowd. From the podium, an astonished Lodan watched a parting wave flowing from the back of the assembly floor, row after row of figures stepping aside to let the \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 7\u003C/em\u003E crew through. Bill cleared his throat.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got two spare boosters here that you\u2019d be welcome to use.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cavernous assembly building fell utterly silent. On the podium, Geneney and Ademone exchanged startled glances and Lodan\u2019s normally imperturbable expression slipped a notch. He raised his eyebrows at Geneney and was answered by a slow nod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe offer is appreciated, Bill. Your crewmembers - may I ask\u2026?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re with Bill,\u201D Calley called out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBill speaks for us all, Director,\u201D James\u2019 quiet tones carried to the far corners of the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan opened his mouth, then closed it and shook his head. \u201CThen I accept your offer, Pioneer 7\u2026 I accept it with heartfelt thanks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton sighed to himself, flexed his leaves, and slipped his fibres through the invisible zones of toxins that marked the boundary between his territory and Jonelle\u2019s. Immediately they began to tingle, then burn with a prickling heat, the sparks marking Jonelle\u2019s defensive echelons of soil-borers making glittering beelines for him. His own sparks twitched in response, momentarily lured by a trickle of pheromones that he couldn\u2019t quite suppress. As always, his instincts flared, skeins of microscopic nodules along his fibres swelling, poised to unleash their own chemical arsenals on the intruders. Then Gerselle\u2019s face swam before him, pale and unmoving, and the nodules subsided.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton pressed on through the rapidly intensifying barrage, ignoring the scorching lines of fire cobwebbing across his outer roots and steering directly for the heaviest concentrations of effectors and counter-toxins that revealed Jonelle\u2019s own fibres. The ripping jolt as he brushed against them flattened every root hair for kilometres around, a boiling fury that clawed at his mind even as the second wave of beetles clawed at his own effectors. He held his ground, letting Jonelle rage at him, projecting calm reassurance in return.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, the assault grew too much to bear. Elton held out a last, lingering image before breaking the link and making an orderly, stepwise withdrawal. At each step he paused, nodules leaking out just enough of their contents to reveal a glimpse of his own potent weaponry. The thin trail left, or so he hoped, the unmistakeable message to Jonelle that this retreat was no sign of weakness but a deliberate decision not to fight. As his scarred and burning fibres pulled back into the cool, damp earth of his own territory, he hoped for both their sakes that his message would be heeded this time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely trudged across the yellowing and wilted village green, grocery bags swinging at his side, trying his best to ignore the angry comments following him. Transferring both bags to one hand, he waved at a huddle of suspicious-looking villagers, who watched him go by before turning their backs on him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he drew closer to Gerselle\u2019s hut, yellow grass turned to brown, dotted with sickly, mildew-dappled flowers. The gardens around the hut, once decked out in bold primary colours that only a kerblet could love, was in equally bad shape. Stringy knotweed mats ran riot, broken by clumps of hookwort that were slowly but surely gaining a foothold around the larger bushes. \u00A0Enely stopped to inspect one of them, noting the aphids crawling over the brown-tipped leaves. He glanced up at the pristine Kerm branches overhead and frowned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe door swung open with a squeal of un-oiled hinges, eliciting another sigh from Enely. \u003Cem\u003EOne more task to add to the list.\u003C/em\u003E Pulling off his boots, he walked over to the kitchen counter and began unpacking the groceries before the muffled voices from inside Gerselle\u2019s sleep room caught his attention. Frowning, he stepped lightly over to the door, threw it open and was confronted by a defiant Joenie and a guilty-looking Adbas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome on, Joenie. You know you\u2019re not meant to be in here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie scowled at him. \u201CCame to see Mummy.\u201D She scuffed her feet against the floorboards. \u201CI\u2019m bored. Everyone runs away from me outside.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease tell me you haven\u2019t been talking to Jonelle, Joenie. You know you promised Jont\u2026 daddy, that you wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201D He was answered by a long-suffering eye roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCourse not. I told you - we just came to see if Mummy had woken up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJoenie didn\u2019t do anything, Mr Enely,\u201D said Adbas earnestly. \u201CI\u2019d make sure she didn\u2019t.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be able to stop her, young one\u003C/em\u003E. Enely hid his amusement behind an approving expression, carefully ignoring Joenie\u2019s mutinous look. \u201CI know you would, Adbas - thank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdbas grabbed Joenie around the waist in a sudden, clumsy hug. \u201CMaybe your mum will wake up tomorrow, \u2018Nie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie blushed dark green and threw a mortified glance at Enely. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EI told you not to call me that in front of the grownups!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D she hissed at Adbas. \u201C\u003Cem\u003ECome on - let\u2019s go!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, Meleny emerged from the moss room, narrowly avoiding being bowled over by the fleeing kerblets. Enely kept his expression carefully neutral until they were out of sight before turning to Meleny with raised eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI heard them,\u201D she replied. \u201CShe\u2019s sensible enough not to try anything and Adbas would stop her if she did. Try to stop her,\u201D she amended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded. \u201CDid you know that Adbas has a special name for her?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny chuckled softly. \u201CNie you mean?\u201D She saw Enely\u2019s expression and rolled her eyes. \u201CThey\u2019re \u003Cem\u003Ekerblets\u003C/em\u003E, Enely. Did you never have a nickname when you were young?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, never.\u201D Enely looked slightly abashed. \u201CAmongst the Hazachim, such things are\u2026personal between newly-weds, or soon-to-be-weds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell they\u2019re both far too young for that, although I\u2019m pretty sure Adbas is soft on her.\u201D Meleny glanced at the clock. \u201CAnyway, it\u2019s time you were speaking to Jonelle - I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you.\u201D Enely waited for Meleny to leave the room before lying down on the spare bed. Shivering despite himself, he glanced at the floor around the bed, remembering the eruption of hideously transformed healing vines Then he lifted his head up to the waiting leaf cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHello, Jonelle.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;Enely\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E The young Kerm\u2019s voice was flat. \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I want to talk to Joenie, not you\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI\u2019m sorry, Jonelle.

And I think he\u2019s trying to send you a message too.\u201D He told Jonton about the silverlace tree and his conversation with Jonelle. \u201CWhich didn\u2019t go well. In fact its why I came to visit again so soon - I promised I\u2019d ask you\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTo let Joenie Commune with her?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D Enely hesitated. \u201CI don\u2019t think she\u2019d hurt her, Jonton. Not deliberately. \u00A0She wasn\u2019t at all concerned about frightening everyone else but she was protective of Joenie.\u201D He swallowed. \u201CIf she can\u2019t be with Gerselle then I think she wants to be with Gerselle\u2019s daughter instead.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u2019s expression turned stony then sagged in bitter resignation. \u201CNo choice,\u201D he muttered to himself. \u201CAnd the Pillars preserve me for it.\u201D He looked at Enely. \u201CDo it.

A splash of colour caught his eye as he approached the hut and he stopped to squat down by a lopsided square of newly planted star poppies, smiling at the sight of Joenie\u2019s little wheelbarrow and her trowel stuck in the soil beside the flowers. He leaned over and tugged at a straggle of browning knotweed, nodding in satisfaction as it pulled free of the ground, a long, rank root emerging behind it. He tossed the dead weed into the wheelbarrow and continued on his way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, he found Meleny watching over Joenie, Adbas on the floor by her feet working on a jigsaw puzzle.
