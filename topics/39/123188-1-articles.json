With their money, they had hired a few employees and purchased an old airfield which they had re-purposed into a space center. Granted, the science complex was just a motley collection of shacks, the launch pad just a layer of bricks on the dirt and the noticeable lack of a proper vehicle assembly building. But it was better than nothing, and it seemed perfect to Gene, as he put on his work boots to go to the hangar-turned-VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInside the hastily patched-up old hangar, the employees were performing final checks on their first rocket. After hearing the PR guy\u0027s recommendations, they decided not to put somebody on said rocket, but instead operate it with a remote control that they had procured from \u0027a mystery source\u0027. The simplistic craft was just a RT-3 solid fueled rocket, an improvised nosecone and some cardboard fins, controlled with the aforementioned remote control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus, the newly hired janitor/rocket engineer eyed the RT-3 engine. \u0022I\u0027m still not sure about the reliability of these tin can looking things.\u0022 To prove his point he hit it with his wrench, causing a decent amount of powder to fall out. But the engineers would not be swayed. \u0022I built this thing myself! It\u0027s gotta be good!\u0022 they replied, whenever he tried to bring up the subject with them. As Gus was timid by nature, he never pushed the point too far with them. Not that it would\u0027ve helped anyways, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA team of interns and engineers pushed the rocket trolley past him towards the brick launchpad, leaving a trail of nuts and bolts clattering off the rocket. \u003Cem\u003E\u0027That\u0027s not a good sign\u0027 \u003C/em\u003EGus thought, picking up as many nuts and bolts as possible and pushing them back into the appropriate holes while running alongside the trolley. As the other engineers attempted to calm him down, the trolley gathered speed and pulled away from the group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh oh\u0022 one of the smarter kerbals said, as the expensive prototype raced down the slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFredbart the technician was just minding his own business, eating a sandwich and reading a copy of the newspaper. He scarcely noticed the sound of wheels and yelling coming from behind him, until he turned around to tell them to be quiet. The following thud made Gene look up towards the launchpad. \u0022What\u0027s going on over there?\u0022 he yelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus replied: \u0022Nothing!

Gene sat at the front of the room, behind the large, complex-looking and rather monstrous computer console. Behind him, Mort, Walt and Jeb watched, as the last technicians (and the ambulance) escaped to the relative safety of the bunker to watch the pretty fires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Everyone OK?\u0022 Asked Gene. The different site supervisors radioed in. \u0022Affirmative, sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimultaneously, the operators flicked their switches. The projector flickered and flashed to a grainy camera feed of the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus\u0027s voice crackled over the intercom. \u0022You ready, boys?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene replied: \u0022Let\u0027s do it!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ten!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nine!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Eight!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seven!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene gripped the console.

A moment later, the sound of the blast slammed into them. Instinctively, they looked up.

Amidst the sound of metal hitting the ground, he launched into a tirade about how Jeb\u0027s company was unreliable and terrible, intermingled with a variety of curse words the likes of which the planet had never seen before.

It was 9:30 at night, and he was tired. But he was determined, and nothing got in the way of a determined Jeb. He sipped a cup of soup absentmindedly, as his eyes searched the street signs for the address written on his piece of paper. Jeb\u0027s eyes fell upon a small blue sign. \u003Cem\u003EAha! \u003C/em\u003Ehe thought, and made a sharp turn right. Steering through the narrow street, he watched the road signs pass by him. The soup was rather sour, and he was planning on having a drink, with Gene or without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe shut off the engine, and walked to Gene\u0027s house. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene usually lived on-site at the space center, but the small brick city house was his old home. From the look of the place, he didn\u0027t care much for redecorating or living standards. The roof was missing tiles, the windows cracked, the flowers in the small garden withered. Jeb took a deep breath, and walked up to the door. He hit the doorbell, as he thought about what he would say. After a brief pause, the door opened. Gene stood there, wearing a worn grey T-shirt with a picture of a duck on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hi, Jeb.\u0022 Gene greeted timidly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene, I\u0027m here to ask you to come back to the program.\u0022 Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m not going back there, Jeb.

As the owner of a very successful components company/recycling plant, he knew how to make people feel good, and how to convince them. This was part of being a CEO. And normally he would have done so: convinced Gene that he was important and get him back. But Jeb was in no mood for that. it was 10 at night, he was hungry and tired, and the one thing he hated the most were people who blamed themselves.

He had been reading an article about the idea of using liquid oxygen and altered aviation fuel, to be combined and burned, without needing outside air! His rig was a rudimentary engine, using a small flask of supercooled oxygen, a spray bottle filled with some aviation fuel he had found in the hangar and a blowtorch.

His head felt like it was about to explode, and he crammed his face even further into the mattress. After a half hour of trying to force out the pain by closing his eyes as hard as possible, he managed to get up and pull the curtains closed. Still dressed in his underwear, Jeb stumbled his way to the kitchen and grabbed himself a banana and a bottle of Splash-co Detox Fluid that he had no idea existed. He stumbled back into bed, downing the bottle of salty solution which he hoped wasn\u0027t motor oil and devouring the banana. After vomiting up some half-digested fried snacks and chunks of banana, he decided that it was for the best that he didn\u0027t go to work today.

Gus preferred to sleep in his RV, and Walt and Mort slept in their offices. The sun was just rising, and he felt great. The extra 6 hours of sleep had done him plenty of good, and he felt somewhat less tired than usual. Jeb made a left turn onto the cracked tarmac, and he cut the ignition. Stretching, he stepped out of the car, and stepped into the slightly brisk Middlelands sunrise carrying a box of stuff he found for Gus and the other engineers to tinker with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus was finishing up his breakfast of grain porridge, when Jeb walked into the cafeteria. After some hastily exchanged greetings, Jeb grabbed a baked bun and sat down. \u0022Gus, I have something you might like here.\u0022 Jeb opened his box. \u0022This here is something one of my employees found yesterday. It looks like a rocket engine or a jet motor.

It was hard work, and the pipes were corroded yet sharp. Jeb figured that there were probably some nasty germs on it. \u0022What do we need these pipes for?\u0022 he groaned. Gus winked at him, but said nothing. Another hour-and-a-half later, they finally finished loading the pipes. Only the thought of the cool 400 he was going to make off the pipes kept him going. He felt a fresh wave of nausea wash over him as he remembered that Gene had convinced him to give the pipes for free. \u0022\u003Cem\u003EWe\u0027d\u00A0better get into space soon\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at the space center, Gus told Jeb to go inside for a while, which he happily obliged to. Then, he examined the goods.\u00A0The pipes were light aluminum composite, and perfect for his experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHolding a paper cup filled with lukewarm water, he watched some old guy fish for a while. Eventually, though, he got bored and went outside again. As he turned the corner, he saw Gus pouring some white dust into the pipes. Then, he realised what Gus was doing. Squinting, he saw the label on the bags. \u0022Mergee and Luc\u0027s icing sugar\u0022. Gus had somehow got ahold of his foreign imported coffee sugar and was now mixing it with cornstarch. Jeb started to yell, but his cry was cut short as the last of the sugar poured out of the bag. Gus, seeing Jeb\u0027s expression, shoved the bag into his pocket. It was too late.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene, hearing the yells and loud noises,\u00A0came outside to a full-blown bar fight. Sighing, he tried to calm them down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn hour later, they were in the staff room again, talking over a cup of coffee. Jeb apologized profusely for his misconduct, while Gus thought about his experiment. The second Jeb finished, Gus grabbed his arm and pulled him outside. \u0027Where are you taking me?\u0022 \u00A0he asked worriedly. Gus shushed him, and went back to his experiment. He filled a metal pipe with a blend of pure oxygen, cornstarch, and fine sugar dust, while Jeb mourned his unborn cappuccino.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Done!\u0022 Gus looked proudly at his invention. A half-polished steel pipe, sitting in a pile of cornstarch looked back at him. \u0022Look here\u0022 he pointed at the pipe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s just a pipe\u0022 Jeb replied glumly. \u0022No, it isn\u0027t! Look!\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGus pressed a match against the bottom of the pipe. A few sparks emanated from it, filling the air with the acrid smell of burnt sugar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You used my 125-dollar package of milled sugar for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethat?\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Jeb asked, stepping closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EDon\u0027t come closer!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Gus warned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust then, the pipe-rocket sparked again, this time brighter. Gus held his breath. Suddenly, white smoke poured out of the bottom. The tube shook. Without warning, a jet of fire bloomed from the bottom. The tube quickly accelerated, until it was just a speck in the afternoon sun. Then, it started to get bigger again. Only Gene had the presence of mind to realize what was going on. Yelling at the others to get into cover, he dove underneath the overhang of the new administration building, courtesy of C7\u0027s sizable advance on their contract. Just as they dove underneath the roof, the metal pipe hit the ground nearby with a loud thunk. The dry grass nearby quickly burst into flames.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three were shocked. Gene because the rocket had worked, Jeb for the same reason, and Gus because the flaming wreckage had just set his shed on fire.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMortimer,\u00A0holding a camera, was thinking about the money they would get from breaking the country\u0027s rocket world record.
