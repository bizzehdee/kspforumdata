I just thought that I would share a little project I have been working on. Over the past few days I have designed a Kerbal papercraft. It\u0027s made out of card stock and glue, with some tape for the visor. Here is a link to the Google document with pics and details. Hope you guys like it! I\u0027ll try to post the plans once I refine them. This was designed by hand, like all my projects, since I don\u0027t have any software. There are a few components I need to adjust, then it will be ready.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/document/d/17d60FzyTSmLOF6EicC6zIVlPmeQUfQC_3VbEBRB9UdQ/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/17d60FzyTSmLOF6EicC6zIVlPmeQUfQC_3VbEBRB9UdQ/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know if there are any problems with this link, or if you have any questions about the design or the process.
