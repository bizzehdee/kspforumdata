Instead of sending 5 probes to their respective moons, I decided to send**\n\n**one probe to make multiple flybys of the moons. (I was short on funds)**\n\n**Here\u0027s the probe arriving at Jool.**\n\n![Roc1P7c.png](http://i.imgur.com/Roc1P7c.png)\n\nThr probe was designed to carry all the science instruments to record data, and had about 3000m/s of delta-v. It didn\u0027t have a heat shield so it had to perform a rocket\n\nburn to enter orbit around Jool.\n\nThe flyby\u0027s were happening in order as shown below:\n\n**Laythe [First Flyby]**\n\nThe first flyby was Laythe, but i lost the pictures by accident ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI entered Laythe SOI at around 6km/s, and peaked at 8km/s, just barely scraping the atmosphere.\n\n**Laythe [second Flyby]**\n\nI lost pictures on the second flyby, but i was just barely inside Laythe\u0027s SOI, so i couldn\u0027t get high quality pictures.\n\nThe main objective of the second flyby was to achieve a gravity assist from Laythe to put me on course with Vall.\n\n**Laythe [Third Flyby]**\n\nThe imaged from the third flyby of Laythe were lost as well. The third flyby helped to correct my inclination with respect to Vall.\n\n**Vall [First Flyby]**\n\nFinally, i had an encounter with Vall on the first flyby. I barely scraped the surface, avoiding tall mountains. Here are some shots i took while\n\nin Vall SOI.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The main objective of this flyby was to get a direct trajectory to Tylo using its gravity assist.\n\nHowever, i had some sweet shots as well.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/l1oFG)\n\n**Tylo [First Flyby]**\n\nAfter an hour of planning ahead, i finally got to see Tylo. However, i didn\u0027t get anywhere close to its surface,\n\nso i only had pixelated images. The gravity assist from Tylo swung me to the edge of Jool\u0027s SOI.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Here are some chance pictures of Tylo on the second flyby.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But i was able to fly within 4km of the surface before bidding goodbye to the mission.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
