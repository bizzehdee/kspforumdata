It would be a basically be a series of wars starting with WW1 or WW2 and working up until all out interplanetary conflict. \n\nany thoughts, feedback, and suggestions would be appreciated(Recording software would help a bunch)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kvantovy","CreatedById":142861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T06:22:29Z","Content":"As for the recording software, I recommed OBS. It\u0027s free, easy to use and can be used for both streaming and/or saving video to a file. I use it in all my yt projects. \n\nBahamutoD CameraTools mod is great for making nice shots in KSP. In his other mod, BahamutoD Armory, you will find weapons and for making oldstyle war machines KEX/Firespitter combo can be of help. There is also one mod with additional tank turrets (e.g. Challenger), but sadly I don\u0027t remember the name."},{"CreatedByName":"Ace_Of_Spades","CreatedById":63298,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T00:25:02Z","Content":"Does anyone have any ideas for the villain(s)\u0027 name?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T22:26:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Does anyone have any ideas for the villain(s)\u0027 name?\n\nMechJeb.

(Unnecessarily big, really expensive, and just about works)"}]}
