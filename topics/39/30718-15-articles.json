Keyboards clacked away, orchestrating shifting patterns of data that rippled over dozens of monitor screens and lit up constellations of tell-tale lamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the eye of a hurricane, the orbital tracking screen was the single point of calm at the centre of the data storm. The familiar map of Kerbin was empty apart from a single stylised rocket icon representing the \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E on its launch pad. For now, Hanbal\u0027s gaze was fixed firmly on the next screen, which was currently showing a view over that very same launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompared to previous generations of Rockomax boosters, \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E looked deceptively simple. A gently tapered capsule sat atop a single unbroken tube of metal, with an engine bell attached to its base. The whole assembly was capped by a latticed spire, which in turn was topped with a cluster of smaller rockets. Only the tubing wrapped around the upper end of the engine bell - and the thin plumes of vapour rolling down her flanks - suggested that \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E might be something different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal caught a familiar whiff of hair oil as the control room door swung open behind him. He flicked a look to his left as Danfen joined him at the rail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cutting things a bit fine weren\u0027t you?\u0022 he said quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen nodded. \u0022Took longer than we thought to clear that last hold. Turned out to be a faulty sensor on the hatch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal\u0027s reply was cut short by a squawk of feedback. Nelton adjusted a dial on her console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Bunker. That\u0027s a Go for terminal count.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the controllers got up from his seat, walked up the steps to the viewing balcony and locked the door. He nodded briefly to the two engineers and hurried back to his console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen glanced up at the monitor. The view over the launch pad flickered and was replaced by a close up image of the launch tower fuelling arm. Two thick hoses emerged from a port on the booster and disappeared off screen. The port itself was thickly rimed with frost and every so often a chunk broke away and dropped out of view. The image sputtered and dissolved into static before switching back to the view from the launch pad camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe doesn\u0027t look like much from this distance does she?\u0022\u00A0said Danfen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022\u00A0said Hanbal, \u201Cthe single booster makes it tricky to get a sense of scale, unless you know what you\u0027re looking at.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen chewed on his thumbnail for a moment. \u201CIt\u0027s a nice simple design though,\u0022\u00A0he said at last, \u201CTwo stages, two engines, two decouplers. No B1s strapped on the side to stress the airframe, less off-axis thrust to balance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal snorted. \u201CYou forgot the two tankfuls of liquid oxygen,\u0022\u00A0he said dryly. \u201CThat\u0027s quite enough stress on the airframe for my tastes. Not to mention a main engine that\u0027s about an order of magnitude more powerful than any liquid fuelled stage we\u0027ve ever flown before.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen\u0027s knuckles turned white on the rail. \u201CI know,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CWe learned a lot from the SK1-O though - version P is much more robust.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh the Skipper is a good engine,\u0022\u00A0said Hanbal. \u201CBest machine we ever put on the stand and the test flights went off without a hitch. It\u0027s just...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen completed his thought. \u201CYeah. It\u0027s a big engine to put a crew on top of. Incidentally - \u0027Skipper\u0027?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe propulsion team\u0027s nickname for the SK1-P,\u0022\u00A0said Hanbal. \u201CI don\u0027t recall who started it... but it stuck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen laughed. \u201CYou\u0027ll need to think of a better name for the upper stage,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CThe \u0027Skigger\u0027 doesn\u0027t have quite the same ring to it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow the balcony, the tempo was picking up. The keyboards rattled away and the various clicks and clacks from the other controls grew steadily more urgent. One by one, auxiliary monitors lit up around the main orbital tracking screen, displaying detailed readouts of the different spacecraft systems.The controllers remained focused on their consoles, silent except for crisp, clipped reports to Nelton as they each signed off the final items on their checklists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAPU disconnect Go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCapsule is on internal power.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTank pressures nominal.

The water jet sound suppression system started with four seconds to go, drenching the base of the launch pad and shrouding the bottom of the booster in a dense mist. At two seconds, a painfully bright light flared through the fog, faded briefly and then exploded into a torrent of golden fire blazing out of the SK1-P engine bell. Thousands of litres of water instantly blasted into clouds of superheated steam, lit from within by the incandescent glare of rocket fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a fraction of a second the rapidly building downdraft from the engine sucked the billowing mass back towards the rocket and out through the flame trench. Then, the sheer volume of exhaust pouring out of the Skipper overwhelmed the trench capacity and enveloped the launch pad in a roiling inferno of fire and smoke. Somewhere in the midst of the maelstrom, a set of launch clamps fell away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLift-off. We have lift-off!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal clenched his jaw as \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E clawed her way unsteadily off the pad. \u003Cem\u003ECome on, come on, come\u003C/em\u003Eon! The launch escape tower twitched from side to side as the booster fought it\u0027s way skyward, guidance systems struggling to keep the unwieldy machine upright. Then the noise hit them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven from Mission Control, the roar was terrifying, shaking windows and knocking cups off consoles. The overhead lights rattled in their mounts. sending shadows pitching and swaying over the display screens. The vibrations pounded through the Hanbal\u0027s chest, gripping it in a primal embrace until he felt his entire body shaking in sympathy with the booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTower is clear!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen let out his breath explosively and grinned fiercely at Hanfal. On the monitor screen, \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E engine lifted clear of the launch tower, lofted out of the chaos by a solid, brilliant white pillar of fire. Now the rocket was picking up speed, accelerating smoothly as it climbed its own length and then it\u0027s own length again past the top of the tower. Far below on the ground and completely obscured by the dense smoke, the last tongues of flame gambolled across the launch pad, twisting and swirling in the superheated air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CApproaching Max Q.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton pushed a switch on her console. The overhead speakers crackled and roared and then fell silent. Everyone suddenly heard Sherfel calmly working through her checklist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E is supersonic. Pitch and roll looking good. Skipper readouts are nominal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen chuckled as James\u0027 voice came over the loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe got ourselves a nice smooth ride here, Flight - once we managed to get off the ground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 said Nelton blandly. \u201CI\u0027ll be sure to let the engineering teams know that you approve of the anti-pogo systems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI just hope the second stage is as smooth,\u0022\u00A0muttered Hanbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen squeezed his shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027ll be fine. How many times did we run through the chill-down procedure in testing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe raised his hand before Hanbal could speak. \u201CYes, I know - not the same as doing it under flight conditions. Admit it though Han - we couldn\u0027t have asked for a better launch to try it for the first time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal scowled at him and turned back to the monitors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E sped through Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere. The brilliant yellow white flame from its main engine had long since fanned out into a dirty orange plume glowing dully in the the thin, frigid air. Then, with a final cough of sooty flame, the SK1-P shut down. A sudden sharp crack of explosive bolts split the rocket in two and the spent lower stage fell slowly away, beginning a slow end over end tumble as it dropped back to Kerbin. A second, smaller set of bolts fired with a popping noise, sliding the interstage ring free. It slipped easily over the second stage engine bell and began its own long descent to the ground whilst the rest of the rocket coasted serenely upwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSecond stage ignition confirmed, Flight!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Booster.

Just don\u0027t.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two engineers watched the telemetry whilst \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E climbed steadily to orbit. The atmosphere in Mission Control was still alert but the relaxed postures of the controllers and cheerful tones of the crew told their own story. Nelton however, was still sitting bolt upright at the flight directors console, head flicking from side to side as she shifted her attention from system to system. Occasionally she leaned forward and spoke quietly into her microphone, eyes still focused on the screens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, this is Booster.

Nelton gave her team a moment to celebrate before tapping her microphone. The room instantly fell silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood work, everyone. \u003Cem\u003EEndurance,\u003C/em\u003E do you read?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLoud and clear, Flight,\u0022\u00A0came the the prompt reply. \u201COur board is green and our view is... well our view is out of this world, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEndurance.\u003C/em\u003E Okay, I want both telemetry channels online for the next manoeuvre Suggest you take half an orbit to do some sight-seeing and then get set up for transposition and docking on the next pass over Foxham.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E drifted serenely in orbit, spinning slowly about one axis to keep her nose pointed in the direction of flight. Reflected light from Kerbin shimmered off the spacecraft hull, lighting up thruster mounts like miniature stars and turning the polished antenna dish a deep blue. Two of the thrusters spat fire in precise bursts bringing the slow rotation to a halt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPuffs of flame flared in the darkness and a dark crack raced around the tapered forward end of the booster. Four curved steel petals folded back revealing a stubby cylindrical module nestled atop the booster second stage and allowing \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E to float freely for the first time. A delicate choreography of thruster pulses pushed her clear of the booster, flipped her neatly over and then drove her back towards the booster with her nose aimed squarely at the centre of the docking port attached to the forward end of the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelicately, with the merest puffs of flame from the thrusters to correct her course, \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E brushed against the open port. There was a long pause as she seemingly gathered herself for the next effort. Then, with all four thruster blocks firing majestically against the starry blackness, she pulled away from the empty booster, hauling her prize from it\u0027s steel cradle into open space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe module resembled a giant polished thread reel, cylindrical but with a thick raised rim at each end. Equipment boxes girded the centreline and the hull was festooned with hand - and foot - holds for spacewalking kerbonauts. A pair of small portholes were set into each side, glinting in the raw sunlight. \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E was securely attached to one end, her heat shield pointing along the direction of flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, James let go of the the thruster controls and wiped his forehead with the back of his hand.

Sherfel tapped out an enquiry on her keyboard and the flight computer promptly flashed up three numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne nine seven by one nine three by twelve,\u0022\u00A0she reported.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood enough for now,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 replied Nelton. \u201CAccording to CapSys, air pressure in the hab module is good, so you\u0027re Go for ingress at your convenience.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel couldn\u0027t quite keep the excitement out of her voice. \u201CNo time like the present, Flight,\u00A0she said, unbuckling her harness and pulling herself free of her acceleration couch. She swung her legs slowly to one side, caught hold of the handgrips set into the edge of her control panel and pushed herself down under the two couches. She studied the hatch for a moment then braced herself and pulled the locking lever firmly down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch came free with a clunk of retracting bolts. The air pressure between the linked spacecraft equalised with a gust of air that rippled Sherfel\u0027s hair and wafted the scent of adhesives and fireproofed upholstery into \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMmmm,\u0022\u00A0said James from above her head, \u201Cthat new spacecraft smell! Air pressure is holding steady, Sherf.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel lifted the hatch out of its frame and stowed it carefully under the capsule couches. Then she wriggled through the narrow passageway into the habitation module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay - I\u0027m in!\u0022\u00A0she called out to James. \u201CBeginning inspection.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo gently curved shelves extended along the length of the cabin walls in front of her, dividing the main accommodation area into upper and lower sections. \u003Cem\u003EYeah, yeah, no up and down in space\u003C/em\u003E, Sherfel corrected herself automatically, \u003Cem\u003Ebut it doesn\u0027t make much sense to put the controls on the floor.\u003C/em\u003E Each shelf had a neatly stowed sleeping bag and set of restraints fastened to each end. She peered under one shelf and was surprised to see what looked like a set of thick rubber bands clipped under it. \u003Cem\u003EOh right - the exercise bungees.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cabin gangway was uncluttered but a pair of sack chairs - fitted with the seemingly ubiquitous restraints were stuck to the floor under each shelf. Grinning to herself, Sherfel pushed off from the wall behind her and drifted towards the centre of the room, languorously stretching out her limbs as she went. Compared to the cramped confines of \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E cockpit, this was luxury! She caught one of the sleep shelves with one hand and deftly spun herself about to face the passageway back to the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for the narrow passageway instantly became clear. A bulkhead sectioned off most of the aft end of the cabin and two familiar signs stencilled on the bulkhead door made it very clear what lay behind. Hand over hand, Sherfel worked her way along the shelf and nudged the door open. \u003Cem\u003EWonder how this is supposed to work in zero-G?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe was confronted with a seat perched atop a steel drum and surrounded by an improbable looking set of plumbing and attachments. \u003Cem\u003E Okaaay - that\u0027s... different to the training rig. Those bits over there must be for the guys I guess. Either that or the engineers on the ground have more of a sense of humour than I thought. You know what? I think James can be the first to boldly go on\u003C/em\u003E this \u003Cem\u003E particular mission.\u003C/em\u003E She edged her way out of the tiny chamber and closed the door firmly behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ERight, sanitation this way, so that way must be the galley.\u003C/em\u003E Sherfel drifted over to the forward bulkhead and cautiously pushed the door open. Sure enough the small room contained little else but two water spigots and shelf after shelf of ration packs. Clipped to the front of one shelf however, was a very welcome surprise. Her eyes widened in incredulous delight at the row of capsules, each half opaque and half transparent and each containing an incongruous splash of green foliage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe unscrewed the top of one capsule and gently bruised one of the thick fleshy leaves between her fingers, sniffing happily as they released a familiar aroma. \u003Cem\u003EPepper cactus! Well this place is certainly looking up. Plenty of space, a bit of greenery and a chance to do a little home cooking.\u003C/em\u003E She bent forward and read the labels on the other tubes. \u003Cem\u003EMarrowort, citrella, saltleaf, yellow clover and firewhisker. Oh this will do nicely!\u003C/em\u003E She screwed the lid back on the capsule and made her way back out to the main cabin, trailing the pleasantly astringent scent of pepper cactus through the open door behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEverything looks in order through here!\u0022\u00A0she called.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGotcha, Sherf,\u0022James called back. He paused, \u201Cand Mission Control are giving us a Go for power up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that. Deploying PV arrays.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel flipped back the locking bars over two prominently placed buttons and pushed the one marked PV-A . A green light began to blink on the control panel next to it and then, after an interminable wait, settled into a reassuringly steady, green glow. The needles on one set of dials swung smoothly over and other sections of the control panel began to light up. Sherfel scanned them, nodded to herself and pressed the second button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second green light blinked twice, then suddenly glowed orange. Sherfel jumped as a loud buzzer went off next to her ear and hastily pressed the button again. \u003Cem\u003ENot good. Five seconds to cycle the systems then lets try that again\u003C/em\u003E. The second attempt was no better. The buzzer sounded again and the orange caution light was replaced by a baleful red malfunction indicator. She jabbed the button again as James\u0027 startled voice echoed through the passageway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u0027s happening through there, Sherf? Bus A looks good but I keep getting warning lights on Bus B initialisation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot sure, Jim, I\u0027m going to take a look outside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel pushed off towards the nearest window, hitting it with a solid thud. She craned her neck, trying to get a view back down the hull that wasn\u0027t hidden in a glare of sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan\u0027t see much from here, Jim. Give me a plus ten roll.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel stared out of the window as \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E started a slow spin. Kerbol disappeared behind the hull and long shadows crept out from behind the hand holds and equipment boxes attached to the cabin exterior. Then she stiffened. \u003Cem\u003EOh sweet Kerm...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHold it there, Jim.
