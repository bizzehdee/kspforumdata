I decided I would make a thread where you would make up stories about your space program!

President MacBill O\u0027Kerman had cut funding for KSP. With little options, they considered shutting down, but then how would they return their three Kerbals in the Kerbal Space Station? Then, a new hope was seen. Bio Kerman, A particularly wealthy fan of KSP\u0027s Program who donated to KSP commonly had started his own space program, but hadn\u0027t been succesful. They signed a contract with his at-the-time unamed company to give 60% of their govermental fundings to his company, IF he would imeadietly work on a space craft to rendevous with the KSS and return their brave kerbals. Then, with a .9 billion dolar budget, they created the Humana III Space craft and returned KSP\u0027s kerbals. After their extreme sucess, the company named themselves BSMC (Bio Space Manufacturing Co.). Still a young buisness, they have just made it to the Mun. But, then, KSP got major funding when a new president was elected. They revised the contract, and BSMC took a major blow. Now, only 0.25% of KSP\u0027s fundings went to BSMC. BSMC took action and began a new space race with KSP, and with major consequences. There was a bet with BSMC. KSP said, that if BSMC made it to Duna before KSP did, KSP would give 30% of its fundings to BSMC. If KSP won, all fundings to BSMC would be cut. They agreed to the deal. But, fatefully, KSP made it first, and BSMC took it second major blow. Now, BSMC has done barely anything in space, and is a dying company. Thier biggest succes is making an interplanetary probe, whic has yet to fly through Eve\u0027s SOI. That is BSMC\u0027s story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun making stories, and I can\u0027t wait to see them!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-30T17:23:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2012 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mustwinfull","CreatedById":41681,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T13:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you haven\u0027t posted the story yet because the spoiler isn\u0027t working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, this will be a great thread and I will post my story soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T13:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDunno why the spoiler isn\u0027t working.
