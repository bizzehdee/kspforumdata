Feel free to watch my other channels as well...but for now, I am ready to get back to streaming...Kerbal Space Program...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will setup events over there as well as try to schedule them here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not decided which way to go - Sandbox, or Science, due to the MODS availability in Science; I would have to research it; however Roleplay wise; I may go both ways !!! We could use Science as the stages for the Kerbal Space Simulator and Kerbal Academy; where nothing is \u0027 REAL \u0027 and is only simulation; I will exemplify this in the streams; that way I can use Sandbox as the REAL DEAL !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s see how the new UStream home works; unfortunately streams there only last less than 30 days; I will have to try and keep streams under 15 minutes as well as Youtube only allow 15 minutes stream saves unless I have a channel over there that was grandfathered; honestly I dont feel like calling them and giving them my phone number; I may get a free cell tho; I may use that I dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe happy holidays are around the corner as well so for the next week or so there will be a few dampers put on everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am glad to say I am back...I also may try to get \u0022 Oribtal Simulator \u0022 working; that baby is TOUGH !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo wish me luck here...please...I need all the support I can get these days after what I feel was some harrassment on Twitch; but I am over it; and over Eve Online as well; I never should have gone back there nuff said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, look for me streaming every night; but I may not be on the above channel; I have 2 others there you can look them up if anyone\u0027s interested; I finally hope to play my guitar and some music now; I just dont know how my streams are gonna work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also pay $10 a month to keep them on UStream; this might work but I am lookin at a couple of game subs as well and I only have so much $$ to go around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also know that most of you all now are pretty verse in KPS; I am not but I am learning and I dont want any spoilers ! If I need any help I am sure I can find it on my own !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also try to stream such that it is always a learning process for me; so I do tend to talk about how I do things; it doesnt mean any of it is right or is the best way to go; but it is a way for others to see how I learn; I am 50\u002B as well and feel young enough to learn most anything; this game, or SIMULATOR, does very well for me in that respect, let alone provide creativity that is quite unmatched in any game out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWish me luck; give me a couple weeks for regular programming...!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit: I do plan on watching KSP streams tho; as long as Skype users and chatters talk about the KSP and not play other MMOS while the streamer is streaming; it is just annoying; if they do that that is fine but I dont have to listen to it; not picking on KSP streamers tho I have heard it going on; just be careful Twitch support isnt too supportive and they will ban instantly and not give anyone a chance to solve a stream video issue)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander Zeta \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-21T05:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2013 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr_Zeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eaddendum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T19:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta here, lost in Kerbin Space somewhere but able to have communications now relayed to the Kerbal Science Teams and Space Engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kerbin Academy well underway, I have decided to issue a restart and resend the main engineering teams back thru the courses to make sure everything is in order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have completed the new buildings and planning stages of the Science Simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Science and Academy SIMULATORS are now \u0027 OFF GRID \u0027 even with backup systems and redundant power capabilities to insure smooth operations; there is still some COMSEC work needing to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday marks a new beginning; we are not totally sure what will transpire, and our formats are not quite yet in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivities will begin now and run thru-out the day and night Earth Sunday Dec 22 EST time for several hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA review of Earth NASA launches will take place as well as Kerbin Space Station (KISS\u002B Kerbin International Space Station) re-assessment, development, and launch capabilities.
