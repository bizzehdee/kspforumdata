On their last flight SpaceX managed to soft-land the first stage on water, the idea being to use water landings as test flights for an eventual recovery on land. What I didn\u0027t appreciate until recently was that they did the water landing \u003Cem\u003Ein the middle of a storm\u003C/em\u003E. Yup - couldn\u0027t get a boat or a plane near the recovery site due to bad weather but they managed to land the booster in one piece! The bad weather is also why the footage from the landing is so bad - priority was given to transmitting telemetry from the booster rather than pretty pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patupi","CreatedById":71098,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T23:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd this isn\u0027t the grasshopper test-bed system any more is it?
