The animation depicts Kerbin alone, no Mun in sight, revolving on its axis. Using material nodes I was able to make Kerbin transition from the daytime texture to the night city-lights texture. Using the daytime texture I also managed to create a bump map and specular mask to ensure it looked as realistic as possible, then added a cloud map (it\u0027s actually Earth\u0027s cloud map, courtesy of NASA) and a sphere with transparency with fresnel to add the blue atmospheric hue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/VX1HlzDywbI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/VX1HlzDywbI\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stars flicker though, which is an issue, seeing as this is supposed to be a space-shot, but that\u0027s just one of the things Blender does (and I hadn\u0027t the time to go through some of the ridiculous workarounds).
