trajectory of the Opentop would have been set to dive much deeper into the atmosphere so reentry would have been completed on the first pass, but because of what happened to the Mk I when a reentry from Mun was attempted, and the fact nobody knew for certain if the Mk II would be able to survive what lay ahead with more success than its predecessor, it was decided to try a much shallower angle and send the little vessel around it\u0027s orbit three times before its final descent.\u00A0 Slamming into the thin upper layers of the atmosphere had no noticeable effect, the velocity continued to creep up as Natagee on her Opentop raced towards the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 However as the vessel dived deeper and the heat increased, the temperature started climbing sharply until flames started to envelope the spacecraft, testing fully Cheapskate\u0027s novel new\u00A0\u0022Atmospheric Heating System\u0022.\u00A0 Surprisingly the results were encouraging, and while Natagee would later claim\u00A0a noticeable increase in temperature, the shape of the heat shield pushed the vast majority of the scorching flames around and away from its precious payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VThn7n8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/VThn7n8.png\u0022

pass through the atmosphere went without a hitch, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E had dropped to approx 53000 meters, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E had dropped to just above 4000 Km.\u00A0 As the Opentop sped out and away from Kerbin Natagee could hardly believe she was still alive and fit to continue her scolding of those who had dreamt up this \u0022rescue\u0022.\u00A0 Indeed it would be true to say that all present at mission control were glad of the respite from her tirade during communications blackout as the vessel flew through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.\u00A0 It was later discovered when the cheap tape recorder attached to the Opentop was examined, that even then Natagee continued her verbal onslaught, apparently totally unaware nobody could hear her she was so consumed by her rage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second pass too went without a hitch, and saw the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E tumble to just under 1500 Km, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E finishing up at 49 Km, the next pass would be the big one.\u00A0 The little craft hurtled around it\u0027s orbit; even though the first two passes had reduced its velocity down to around 2,400 m/s, the tension at mission control was almost palpable.\u00A0 A silence engulfed the whole building, even Natagee finally went quiet, being fully aware that the next handful of minutes would decide if she would live or die.\u00A0 For the last time a slight but increasing vibration told her she was once again passing through the Karman line, once again she could feel the temperature increase, once again flames started whistling\u00A0dangerously close past\u00A0her...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is it\u00A0Natagee\u0022 Gene said into the radio, \u0022good luck we\u0027re all with

was just as well that whatever she said didn\u0027t make it into the radio waves, it probably wasn\u0027t something little children should ever be exposed to!.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll eyes now turned to the clock in mission control, reacquisition of signal was expected in two and a half minutes... would there be anything out there to answer the calls from Mission Control?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene couldn\u0027t help himself, professional though he was he couldn\u0027t wait any longer, and at two minutes he started speaking into the microphone.\u00A0 \u0022Natagee, can you hear me... Natagee we\u0027re awaiting your signal...\u0022.\u00A0 Only the fizzly crackle of static came over the speakers, Natagee remained silent.\u00A0 \u0022Natagee can you hear me, are you out there?\u0022\u00A0 Still only static answered Gene\u0027s broadcast.\u00A0 He was just about to press the transmit button a third time when over the speakers a loud popping sound could be heard, followed a second later by the (all too) familiar voice as Natagee said, \u0022By all the gods of Kerbol, I\u0027m still here.\u00A0 The parachutes have just deployed and I can see the Kerbin Space Centre way in the distance.\u00A0 I\u00A0think I\u0027m going too fast to land at it though, I suspect I\u0027m going for a splashdown in the Sea of Daz!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

impact point approx 27 Km east of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 The navy, already at sea in preparation for recovery,\u00A0was instantly informed of this and\u00A0immediately set a course for the splashdown area and cranked up to full speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe drogue chutes proved equal to the task of slowing the tiny vehicle to a safe speed, although Natagee did press the button that jettisoned the heat shield.\u00A0 When she reported this over the radio, poor Ebenezer Kerman instantly reached into his pocket for a hanky as tears burst from his eyes and flowed profusely down his cheeks.\u00A0 \u0022Oh no... she\u0027s threw away the heat shield... and I was so hoping to get some money back on that!\u0022\u00A0 Pulling a calculator from his pocket he quickly started punching at the keypad.\u00A0 Going pale and with horror spreading\u00A0across his face,\u00A0he looked around desperately for sympathy.\u00A0 \u0022Even allowing for the loss of ablator, I reckon she just cost me about\u00A0230 quid, what\u0027s wrong with her head?\u0022\u00A0 His uncontrolled sobbing only resulted in sniggers and scoffing by all present, for a few minutes all attention was focused away from Natagee and on the miserly Ebenezer, which was too bad because\u00A0Natagee\u0027s adventures weren\u0027t quite over just yet...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Opentop hit the water with sufficient force to shake\u00A0Natagee\u0027s teeth, but fortunately no bones were broken although she would later complain about pain and severe bruising on her rear end.\u00A0 The force was so great that she failed to notice the Opentop, rather than coming to rest on the surface of the water, was already completely submerged and descending all the time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022avnQ56S.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/avnQ56S.png\u0022

and deeper the vessel plummeted, and for a few seconds Natagee had considered hitting the quick release on the safety belts and returning to the surface.\u00A0 However the scientist in her then took over, and she quickly realised the opportunity presented to her if she just sat tight and waited to see what was down deep in Kerbin\u0027s oceans.\u00A0 Turning up the oxygen supply to compensate for the increasing pressure, she sat on her seat, marvelling as a few of the oceans secrets revealed themselves to her.\u00A0 In a very few minutes she had reached depths no Kerbal had ever reached before, setting new records in the process, and still her dive continued.\u00A0 Keeping up a rain of commentary she described in great detail everything she could see\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally the vessel hit the seabed at a depth of over 1000 meters.\u00A0 Not wanting to waste this opportunity, Natagee quickly made an\u00A0EVA report and grabbed a sample of the ocean floor for further scientific study.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JBzXVb0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

developed during her ordeals.\u00A0 However apart from a few bangs and bruises, she was in remarkably good shape and was released from hospital three days later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a footnote, poor old Ebenezer was destined to lose even more money as recovering the vessel proved to be too expensive and has been left on the bottom of the sea.\u00A0 He has since sought out counselling and is currently undergoing intense therapy to help him get through the ordeal of this financial loss.\u00A0 While it\u0027s still early days, the\u00A0prognosis is for a complete recovery, especially as he has recently realised that the dive to the bottom of Kerbin\u0027s Oceans opens a whole new avenue to make money, offering tourists the opportunity to follow Natagee to the
