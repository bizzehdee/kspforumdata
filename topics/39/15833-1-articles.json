Stability testing came next, followed shortly thereafter by a test run for the upper reaches of atmosphere. We came to the conclusion that more thrust must be added, and we regrettably lost lives in this endeavor at the first trial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur quest for the stars, and our thirst for thrust would not be slaked, however. Surely, safety would be a concern. Slimming down, bulking up, fortifying, fueling, and finding the correct trajectory and comfortable enough seats for our pilots came next. Booster packs, experimental decouplings and fiddling with thrust settings were all tested and implemented into our greatest rocket to date. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur latest, and most our successful launch to date came from a trio of experimental under-the-pilot boosters. Those against us said it was foolish, and looked slapped together, but they are only six and nine - what do they know of rocketry? We remained confident that the only thing we would slap were the stars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur new rocket featured a slimmed-down capsule, and that new shiny trio of boosters. We waited, anticipating the roar of the boosters as the computer systems worked out our trajectory. We held our breath as the countdown ensued, we smiled again as our engines fired. Here, we counted our previous successes as we mounted and surpassed them. Nearest us, where the atmosphere is thick - our first barrier - shattered. Glee took hold as sky blue became Prussian blue became black. We held our breath as our latest innovation neared, stage by stage, peeled away like layers of an onion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last of the fuel cells broke free, lost to burn behind the craft. Ground control\\\u0027s navigation instruments had the vessel nearing apex at our local satellite moon when the commander\\\u0027s finger came to that shiny red button and gently pressed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose last boosters came to life, unfettered by heavy layers of air, and carried our Kerbal cosmonauts further, faster. Our instruments watched as the expected return curve became a straight line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJubilation became horror instantaneously as the new course was charted before our eyes. How could we not have foreseen this? Surely, we had expected to break orbit at some point, but our lust for thrust had put us in this predicament. Frantically, we scoured our schematics for what we were sure we must have included - but alas, did not. Our success has come at a heavy price. We have no return plan for our Kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill, Jebediah, and Bob look down on us, from up there, as they orbit the sun waiting for us to join them. It would be a disservice and a dishonor to shame them by abandoning our endeavors. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-02T01:54:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was really good!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avatar98","CreatedById":40007,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-14T16:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou read my mind... this sort if thing happens to me all the time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crowchild","CreatedById":36203,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T05:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*Sniff*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are among the gods now, may they live on forever...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crowchild","CreatedById":36203,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T16:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*Tears form*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UndeadInside","CreatedById":35762,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T03:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank ya!
