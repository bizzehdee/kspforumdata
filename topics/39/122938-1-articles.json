Using North Kerbin Dynamics is amazing and after a little bit of tweaking I figured out how to make armor work better, deflect shells and generally last longer. Unfortunately it\u0027s not really shown too well here as the hover tank dodges EVERYTHING!! seriously, what couldn\u0027t they hit it?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIf anyone can tell me why the hover tank rolls around so much on hills please do. I have a feeling it\u0027s something to do with the meshes on the hills being rather irregular so the anti-grav parts aren\u0027t sure how far they really are away so they over compensate. Just my theory, hopefully someone knows the real reason.\n"}]}
