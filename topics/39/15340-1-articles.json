This confused them, as this challenged their long-held belief that waving is an intrinsic property of flags.

The High King quickly came up with a solution involving rockets. This doomed the explorers on Mun\\\u0027s surface, as their fuel reserves were exhausted during the 2 hour \u0027Flag Fest\u0027, but damn it, it was worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stogas","CreatedById":29017,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T20:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome story, awesome picture!
