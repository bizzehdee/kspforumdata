More to the point, I created a spreadsheet back then to ease the burden of designing new systems for Celestia, which I am making available (see below) so people can do this sort of thing themselves. Instructions for use are included, though they may be slightly out-of-date, in that there\u0027s a new tab to centralize the output which is not currently described. I\u0027ll warn you that the process is a bit fiddly, but I think it\u0027s better than doing it all by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also included a very preliminary rendition of the canonical Kerbal star system -- mostly it just has all of the named bodies at their proper sizes and orbital positions. It does not currently include textures, meshes, etc. to make the planets look like they do in-game, though I went to some effort to find stand-ins. I currently use a few textures I already had lying about from my TTA work (included) as well as some real solar system textures (which come with Celestia). For example, Mars is pretending to be Duna, and Earth is pretending to be Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.niflheim.net/tta/images/celestia-ksp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022celestia-ksp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual textures for some Kerbal planets and moons can be obtained from the KSP wiki, and of course potentially from KSP itself, but I haven\u0027t done this for you ...

A script is included that will cause Celestia to travel to this star and thence to Kerbin when you start the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the system into Celestia, backup your current start.cel file (if you care about it) and then unpack \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.niflheim.net/tta/files/celestia-ksp.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe archive\u003C/a\u003E into the main Celestia directory.

I\u0027ve started moving toward making it less fiddly when you have multiple tabs for planets and moons ... now for a moon (for example) you\u0027d just specify the name of the tab the planet data is on and which planet it is, and the sheet grabs the info it needs that way. There will also be a way to specify which planets/moons to include in the output so you don\u0027t have to manually remove the extra lines that aren\u0027t being used. It will take me awhile to fully switch the spreadsheet over to the new methods, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next version will also include Kerbol itself as an extra star (they aren\u0027t hard to add, I just needed to remind myself how to do it).
