Also, fleets as large as what I write about would simply melt my computer from having to think about them, or it would at least bring me down to about one frame every five weeks. Although now that I think about it, I might actually design a fighter for this simply because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m curious now. Maybe I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll even make a launch system for it and put it into space to see how it handles and if the missile(s) I make for it even work. Or I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll just put BDArmory weapons on it since I have that mod and because it takes a lot less skill and space to plop on a 30mm gatling or two and the weapon manager and ammo on a ship than it does to add mountings on it and decouplers and design a missile/torpedo and add it to an action group and everything and figure out how accurate it is and fix all the kinks and see how effective it is and everything. I did make a Landship though, and that inspired the landships part. It wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t as heavily armed as I imagine the battleships or even the destroyers in this to be, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll probably make another version of it, bigger, longer, wider, with more ammo and more abram\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s turrets. and better platforms so that the goalkeeper 30mm CIWS don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t inexplicably fall off. And more flak guns. And stuffs. But yeah. The landship I made is pretty good at defending itself against aircraft, although granted I did make a straight on attack run with no dodging and not really trying to hit it, though it did seem to only use its CIWS though it may have used others and I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t notice it. I imagine a determined attacker with air-to-ground missiles and/or rockets and guns attacking from above or at the very least trying to dodge would give it more trouble since it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any missiles for defense or offense. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ET-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

Troops pile into APCs, tanks start up, and the group leaves the camp. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe troops soon encounter a far superior Laythean force, and are annihilated.

They slowly lower down landships, and then lift off. The landships assemble, and move off in the direction of the base. There are smaller wheeled destroyers with main batteries of 30mm dual purpose flak cannons in superfiring positions, with triple A batteries of 30mm chain guns, 20mm gatlings, and dual 50. cals. Then there are the battleships, hulking half-tracked behemoths with massive 120mm single mount turrets in superfiring position, as well as broadsides of 105mm howitzers and cluster howitzer batteries on the nose., with massive batteries of 30mm chain guns, flak cannons, and CIWS, as well as more 20mms and 50.cals.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe arrival of the landships is announced by a loud rumbling and a cloud of dust.

Shells streak across the battlefield, and the clatter of automatic weapons fire is heard throughout. The ships come about and form a line of battle. Their main guns turn towards the enemy, and fire. The resounding booms of the 120mms and 105s echo through the plains, followed by the explosions of the shells. Planes begin attack runs on the ships, only to be met with a solid wall of hot lead. The destroyers leave the battle line and charge ahead, their 50. cals firing on the enemy ground forces instead of the planes. The battleships follow, their lighter guns firing at will.

More soldiers and vehicles were dropped in, as well as several howitzers for base defense.

Hours pass uneventfully, and night falls. They continue on, searchlights sweeping the darkness, looking for hostile forces, but none appear. As dawn arrives, the armada crests a large hill, and are greeted by the sight of a massive enemy force of AFVs. The enemy opens fire, and artillery shells scream in from concealed positions. Tanks and transports explode into balls of fire, and the air is filled with the deafening sound of large caliber combat. The flagship, its secondary armament preoccupied with the nearby enemies, turns its main battery in the direction of the artillery. It fires off a salvo, the entire ship rocking on its suspension from the recoil. The shells streak out, becoming explosions on the distant hills. The artillery fire persists, however. The cruise missiles are fired, streaking up with the aid of their boosters, they turn and track the artillery, and then do a steep dive directly onto them. The artillery stops. The landships roll onwards, literally crushing enemy vehicles under their tracks. The enemy begins to route, until a fleet of massive planes appears on the horizon. Cheering, the Laythean forces redouble their efforts to stop the oncoming force, knowing that they now have air support. The planes launch cruise missiles while still well out of range of the flak, and veer off just outside of the dome of anti aircraft fire generated by the ships. Many of the missiles are shot down by point defense systems, but those that remain streak in and explode. A battleship is hit in the tracks, and lists to one side as it starts to turn in circles. A destroyer is hit in the magazine, and the explosion rips it in two. The others desperately flare and perform evasive maneuvers, and remain undamaged. The bombers circle back around, and begin another attack run. They launch another volley of cruise missiles, and then begin launching dozens of Hellfire missiles and hydra rockets at them. The sky is filled with bullets and explosions as the point defense systems and even the main batteries try to knock as many missiles and rockets out of the air as possible. Explosions pepper the battlefield. The main guns aim up at the bombers, sending a hail of shells at them. A few hit home, sending bombers down in trails of smoke and fire. A rocket hits the flagship, nearly breaking through its armor plating, which starts to regenerate immediately. Suddenly, a massive roar is heard as an object streaks through the atmosphere, trailing fire.. The object slows, and is revealed to be an assault ship. It levels out, hovers, and heads towards the enemy bombers. They turn towards it, and are met with a hail of missiles and a wall of bullets. The bombers explode, the fragments falling down to earth in trails of fire. The assault ship signals down to the armada to continue on, and they do. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EEventually the enemy capital comes into sight, or at least its fortifications do. Massive walls loom before them, bristling with weaponry of all sorts. The battleships and flagship come about and prepare to fire. Meanwhile, the assault ship glides towards the walls, loosing clouds of cruise missiles on it. A wave of tracers come to meet them, destroying the missiles and deterring the assault ship from venturing any closer. The landships open up, sending shells towards the walls.

The roar of artillery fire is joined by the clatter and thump of lighter weaponry, and explosions begin to cover the wall. Tracers reach out, searching for the cruise missiles as the assault ship continues on into the cloud of AA, firing its hellfires and mavericks, along with its lighter weaponry. The flagship launches its missiles in streaks of flame and exhaust. Suddenly, a great, thundering rumble is heard, and the firing stops. as the assault ship reappears from the cloud of dust, its exhaust reveals the destruction. A massive hole in the wall has been made, revealing a city of tall spires and arcing railways. The ships roll in through the gap, as the assault ship glides overhead. A signal is picked up by the fleet, requesting parley. A peace treaty is reached, and the Laythean Conflict ends.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe End\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T03:37:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Generalstarwars333\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBecause the end.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astrokerb","CreatedById":151932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T03:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is great!

Despite being a frigate, its large armament for its size makes it very slow, and requires a jet engine to accelerate. It has a main battery of two superfiring 120mm turrets in the front, as well as a nose battery of ten 105mm howitzers, and a 15 howitzer broadside. For AA weaponry it is equipped with 11 dual fifty caliber turrets, two 20mm Vulcan Gatling turrets in the forward firing arc, 8 30mm chain guns, and two 30mm goalkeeper CIWS on platforms on either side that have an annoying tendency to fall off, as well as a pair of superfiring 30mm flak cannons on the stern. It uses a pair of mole tracks and two pairs of large wheels, as well as a turbojet on the stern to move, with an okay turning radius and an unknown top speed. For power it has a pair of fuel cell arrays, as well as the alternator in the jet engine. It has regenerating armor in the form of radiators and deployable thermal systems. Currently being overhauled with the chainguns being replaced by 20mm turrets, due to the chainguns inability to track aerial targets as they were meant to. Hull is a Mk3 cockpit, a large cargo bay or two with batteries and ammo inside, and then some tail sections for more weapons to be mounted on and for the jet engine. Known AA abilities include being capable of shooting down an aircraft coming straight on without evasive maneuvers fairly easily, though it is unknown how it fairs against an opponent performing evasive maneuvers and actively attempting to damage it. Missile defense is unknown. Crew is about 4 people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003ERetaliation\u003C/em\u003E class Medium Frigate is a large, surprisingly fast, yet un-maneuverable landship. It has a main armament of 2 fore mounted superfiring 120mm single mount cannons and one aft mounted turret of the same caliber. It has an AA armament of one 30mm flak cannon mounted in a superfiring position above the forwards turrets, as well as 4 30mm CIWS on two platforms on either side of the superstructure that fortunately don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to come off, along with 13-15 30mm chainguns, 8 of which are mounted broadside in front of the superstructure, with the remaining 6 on the superstructure. A final complement to its armament is 11 dual fifty cals. Its power plant is a single nuclear reactor under the flak cannon, plus an auxiliary 4 liquid fuel generators underneath the hull. Movement comes from two pairs of mole tracks that are placed fore and aft, capable of taking it to a whopping 13.1 m/s, a truly astounding speed for something of its size. Crew capacity is two Kerbals on the bridge. Known issues include a horrible turn radius and an inability to turn in place, likely due to the track placement, and the issue of the chainguns not firing on aircraft. Currently being overhauled for a replacement of the chainguns with 20mm Vulcans which should offset the decreased firing arc with the fact they actually fire. Current AA defenses from its four goalkeepers are still formidable however. Hull is made of the clipper bow, several clipper liquid fuel hulls, and a clipper helipad stern, and the superstructure and mountings for turrets are made of the stock metal plates. The clipper boat parts are from the maritime pack by forum user Fengist. Does not carry missiles, and its ability to destroy missiles is unknown. Notice: Unfortunately, due to the latest version of the Mk 2 Expansion pack either not having anything in it or me screwing something up when installing it, the \u003Cem\u003ERetaliation\u003C/em\u003E class is unavailable due to it having a nuclear reactor from that mod. When/If I get that problem fixed, I will asses said reactor against those of the Orion Nuclear Pulse pack to see which is superior. Until then, this ship is in limbo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003ESchiltron\u003C/em\u003E class AA Frigate is an as yet hypothetical design for a landship whose purpose is to basically be the thing you keep all planes, missiles, or anything that flies at least 5 km away from. It would have multiple SAMs and goalkeepers, and probably be pretty fast and not that good in a ship to ship fight. More info will be available once it has been developed and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve overhauled the existing two landship classes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EAmagi\u003C/em\u003E class Landcruiser is an in development version of the Space Battlecruiser \u003Cem\u003EAmagi\u003C/em\u003E that is in the process of being tested after several design flaws were revealed. However, since it will essentially be the same thing except without the RCS and some/most of the radiators mounted on the hull (which is all of them) and without the four Masamune Nuclear Atmospheric and Spaceborne engines, and with tracks and/or wheels, most of the design specs are known. Main battery will consist of Five superfiring Oerlikon Millennium 30mm Flak cannons, with three in the front and two in the back. These were decided on due to their high rate of fire, explosive shells, high damage, and small size, as well as the fact that they use the same 30mm ammunition as the heavy AA battery. The Heavy AA and Point Defense battery will consist of six 30mm Goalkeeper CIWS, mounted three to a side on platforms to either side of the main superstructure to unleash a withering hail of bullets on any missiles or aircraft coming at it from either side, and an only slightly less withering hail of bullets on anything coming at it from the front or back. These will be supported by the Secondary AA and Point Defense battery, which will consist of a total of 25 20mm Vulcan turrets, with 11 on each broadside, one on either side on the stern at an angle to provide better coverage, and one pointed completely to stern for rear coverage. It is as yet unknown whether these actually fire upon missiles and/or aircraft. Power generation will come from a pair of 1.25m nuclear reactors in the superstructure, and auxiliary power will likely come from generators on the underside of the hull. Crew will consist of either one or three people, depending on which version of the bridge is used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeaponry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETerrestrial Weaponry\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EArtillery\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Single mount 120mm naval gun, nicknamed the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Abrams Turret\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, is the mainstay of the Mianin Land Navy. It has an extremely long range, most likely exceeding 5km by a large amount. It shoots on a flat trajectory, with a high muzzle velocity, which is offset by a long reload period. It can turn in a 360 degree arc, but cannot aim very far up or down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 105mm Howitzer is a fixed gun generally mounted en masse on the broadsides of landships. It has a limited firing arc, although that is generally not needed. It has a long range, but a slower muzzle velocity than the 120mm, which is offset by a quick reload time, probably half or a third of that of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Abrams\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. It generally uses a higher trajectory, which is befitting since it is a howitzer. It can also be mounted on smaller land vehicles in greater quantities than the above naval turret.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAnti-Aircraft Guns\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Oerlikon Millennium 30mm Flak gun is a single mount turret with a 360 degree fire arc and the ability to point almost straight up. It fires high explosive 30mm flak shells at a fast rate that explode on contact or at a certain range. This makes it both an ideal flak gun as well as a main armament for smaller landships. It is unknown if it will attack aircraft due to a lack of testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Goalkeeper 30mm CIWS is a single mount Gatling turret that can shoot basically anywhere but straight down. It fires a massive amount of bullets at targets, making it a very effective anti-aircraft gun, as well as an excellent point defense weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T22:16:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Generalstarwars333\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
