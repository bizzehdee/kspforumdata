I can try to make fancy lens flares and all that, but, for me, doing that causes pictures to lose their meaning :/ Anyways, hope you like it! I will be doing more, so stay tuned!\n\n- Nintendo"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T04:03:39Z","Content":"Nice!
