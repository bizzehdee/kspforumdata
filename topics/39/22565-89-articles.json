This was it\u0027s final test flight before regular deployment. Cruising speed is a little low (34.6 without sas assist, 35.5 with) but it\u0027s functionally free to operate as it does not use any fuel... its \u0022reactor\u0022 is housed in the rear fuselage pieces and counts around 90 rtgs... seriously considering one of the upscaled rtg mod\u0027s just to cut part count a little. It runs fine on it\u0027s own but around ksp where I have other craft parked it suffers some lag, and if it\u0027s carrying a payload I suspect the same will be said. Total part count for this craft is just under 400 many of which are stylistic choices, and I overly strutted it for safeties sake due to it\u0027s expectation to be used to carry heavy items and many Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt handles fairly well for an airship with just existing torque and control surfaces, and the front engines can be abused for VERY fast turns if necessary but is generally unnecessary.

Skip\u0027s been with the IPEV project since day-one, so he was making the launch of Tailwind his final mission before retirement. He was going to catch a shuttle back to Exterra station before we left.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We can\u0027t just \u003Cem\u003Eleave \u003C/em\u003Ehim-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Tailwind\u0027s dying, Bill.

Must be from the passengers on the rover, a distant corner of Johnoly\u0027s mind mused. The violent orange glow of ionized air was whipping by his canopy; he could only guess at what the rest of his crew were experiencing of it. His eyes flickered to the rover status panel, where he could verify his passengers below were still okay. Terrified and white-knuckled on the braces for sure, but still okay nonetheless. He didn\u0027t need to bother with doing the same for the topseat.

Slowly and carefully he leveled the craft, gradually bleeding off lateral speed and curving into a vertical descent, the Mosquito\u0027s engines rumbling confidently. Johnoly heard Dongard issue a quiet sigh of relief, certain the worst was behind them. On the monitors, Bill\u0027s heartbeat slowed and his breathing relaxed, though he\u0027d otherwise fallen silent. Jeb was busy being Jeb, to everyone else\u0027s annoyance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey guys!

They were going to make it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, the Mosquito\u0027s engines coughed and sputtered. The fuel tanks were dry!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hold on!\u0022 Johnoly called as he cut the throttle as much as he dared, but the engines only gasped and cut out again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mosquito dropped sharply, and the rover rammed into the ground. Through his frantic attempts to recover, Johnoly heard one of the laser struts overload and explode, and the suspension underneath groan in protest. Through the chaos, Dongard issued a short yell and fell silent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines sputtered and the Mosquito began to lift again. Johnoly slammed the rover deploy button, cutting the rover loose from the ship. The Mosquito lurched and angled backward sharply, taking the rover out of view just as it appeared to be toppling. The engines sputtered one last time, seemingly bent on the ship\u0027s destruction, pushing the Mosquito further backward until it was now pointing back toward the sky. Finally the tanks ran dry, and the engines died out completely. The sudden silence was immediately broken by Jeb\u0027s angry voice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who the \u003Cem\u003Ehell \u003C/em\u003Ewas drunk enough to give you a pilot\u0027s license dude?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess than a second later, the ship toppled over and slammed into the ground, upside-down.

Though his vision was blurred, he struggled and finally found the canopy manual release. Climbing and coughing, he made his painful way out of the cockpit. When he stood, what greeted him stunned him cold. Very little remained of his ship but his cockpit module and the broken, battered remnants of the aft fuel and power core. The mid-section, the section to which the topseat had been mounted, was gone. An angry scorched patch of ground marked where it must have landed. Jebediah Kerman was no more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeside himself with anguish and pain, Johnoly looked around for any signs of life. Nothing moved.

Though it was definitely toppled, it was, for the most part, intact! His heart soared. He\u0027d been in countless simulated wrecks with that rover! After all, it was designed to protect the drivers if it ever went over! Running toward the rover as fast as his suit would allow, Johnoly called out breathlessly to Bill and Dongard. When no response came, he told himself that his suit comms must have been damaged in the crash. As he drew near to the rover, he knew he\u0027d been very wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UI6x0Au.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UI6x0Au.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the field a short distance from the rover was a single command chair, twisted and bent.
