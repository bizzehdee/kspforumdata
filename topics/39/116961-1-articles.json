While I have the basic plot and some ships figured out as well as the beginning and some backstory writen, I do not much to show as of yet. In the future I hope to add both images and videos to flesh out this story as well as finishing the story as well. Please keep this in mind while viewing, thank you.\n\nPrologue: The Beginning\n\n The first act of hostility in the MJ Wars was not immediately perceived as one, at least not by the kerbals. As far as they were concerned they had only lost contact with an unmanned mission, that was, at the time headed to Jule for a gravity assist to catapult it out of the kerbol system. It didn\u0027t surprise them unduly that they had lost contact. After all, the mission had been cobbled together in a few months in order to make use of the rare planetary alignment that would not reoccur for another couple of centuries. It could have been hit by a small piece of debris or perhaps the RTG had failed.\n\n This perception of matters quickly changed. Within three weeks the kerbals lost contact with all probes outside the Kerbin system. Two weeks later all kerbal satellites within the kerbal system were destroyed in a three day time span. Something was wrong, that much was clear, but the kerbals had no idea what. Apart from the times at which the satellites were destroyed and a blurred image from a damaged space telescope they had nothing. All they could glean from this few pieces of information was that whatever destroyed the satellites was capable of maneuvering and specifically targeting their hardware. The aggressor was not natural, the image confirmed this, and it was circling in, moving ever closer to kerbin. This caused panic in the kerbal civilization. They retreated to underground bunkers and started scanning the sky.\n\n Nothing happened. A month went by and the kerbal telescopes combed the sky. One picked up a strange glint near Minmus, but it disappeared and did not reappear even during continued observation. A sense of dread settled over kerbin. The kerbals felt like prey, unable to see the hunter. Then another half a month later to objects descended through the sky, landing softly in kerbins desert. A plane was sent to observe the landed craft, making a pass 60km away from them. The kerbals dread solidified. The images showed small, rover like craft leaving the larger craft. They were armed. The kerbals now realized what was happening. This was an invasion. They were at war, locked into a battle for survival against a foe they did not know and could not understand.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  At this point it is probably necessary to give some background information about this kerbal civilization that now quakes in fear of its impending doom. The kerbals, at the point of the MJ attack were demilitarized. A rather unfortunate turn of events for them. This was of course not always the case. In fact the kerbals were in somewhat of a recuperation phase after a war that lasted the better part of two centuries. This war, known as the Great Kerbal War (GKW), had left them diminished in numbers and set them back a good three quarters of a century as far as technology was concerned. They were in no mood for a new conflict. This then begs the question: what on (or off) kerbin was attacking them? Aliens? Rogue scientists? Power hungry companies?\n\u003E \n\u003E Well not quite as it turns out. As the kerbals would soon discover, the were in fact being attacked by an AI. And not just any AI. The programing language was a somewhat modified kerbal language. An old one from the war. And the technology was definitively related to the kerbals own, even if it was distinctly different. The next question that then most pressingly poses itself is: if the kerbals, as they were at the time of the attack, were just mastering space travel and were demilitarized, where does a heavily armed and space faring kerbal AI come from? Pressing as this question was, the kerbals couldn\u0027t answer it and wouldn\u0027t be able to for some time. They did however have a hunch. It was likely that this was a remnant of the GKW.\n\u003E \n\u003E To say the GKW left the kerbals crippled is an understatement. Their population was decimated, reduced from the nearly 5 billion before the war to merely tens of thousands. This should be an ample example of the magnitudes of destruction wrought during the war. Similarly, they lost a lot of knowledge and technology, though the shear amount of advancements during the war offset this quite a bit, meaning that they were actually more advanced than one might expect without the war.\n\u003E \n\u003E However, to understand why the kerbals suspected the MJ threat to be a GKW remnant, one must dive a little deeper into the workings of this terrible war.\n\u003E \n\u003E At its beginning the kerbals were split into five factions, each fighting for one world united under their own ideology. It quickly became apparent that it would be technology that would decide this war. And so the arms race started. Now the kerbals strong point as far as technology was concerned was information technology and computers. In fact they had invented a computer before they had achieved flight. So research progressed quickly: infantry and battleship were quickly occluded by armored vehicles and carriers. Cannons gave way to missiles and bombs to ICBMs. Thus, barely more than fifty years after the war had started with propeller plains and the first fuel driven trucks, the kerbals reached space. At this point the casualties already exceeded the hundred million mark. That, coupled with the advance into space made it obvious that unmanned craft were a necessity. So started the first experiments with AI. Now, this seems to be making sense. Kerbals going to space, AI experiments and so on. But how did this end in an AI attack on the kerbals without them knowing about it?\n\u003E \n\u003E Well they did know about it. Once. But as the war progressed so did the weapons technology. More so than any other. New vast underground bunkers were built as unimaginably powerful weapons annihilated the surface. Few kerbals made it to the bunkers and even less information. So the war ended. Three of the five factions completely wiped out, with nothing left of them but dust. And what remained of the other two factions? Well they had the bunkers. Bunkers for housing nearly three hundred million kerbals. Housing only fifty six thousand. The old leaders, the scientists, the generals, to few had made it. Everything had been done in secrecy. Naturally, because knowledge had been power in the war. But this meant that most of what had been done and discovered had been lost to indiscriminate nuclear fire. It would not be a surprise, then, if AI crafts had been sent to space and were now returning to complete their mission.\n\u003E \n\u003E This turn of events is quite unfortunate. The kerbals had done what they could to redeem themselves. After the war was over they immediately began to demilitarize. A monumental task considering they had to dismantle armies built by billions with only thousands remaining. They also united under one banner: the Kerbal Cultural Union (KCU) in order to prevent further conflict. As they rebuilt they decided to focus their civilization on peaceful research and space flight. But the heritage of war will not be denied and the kerbals must now face it. Face the cold hard logic of the AI they created with but one goal: to destroy them.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAbout\n\nThis is a story about a series of wars between a fictional kerbal civilization in a non-cannon kerbal history.\n\nWhile the main plot is predetirmined I do intend to actually simulate the combat (to some extent) in ksp with the help of mods.\n\nAs such I will be using video and images to aid in the telling of the story.\n\nI will also be making a list of ships used with images, descriptions and possibly craft file downloads.\n\nThe story will be told from changing perspectives depending on what part I\u0027m on and my mood (eg. combat report, history book, etc.).\n\nwhile not complete I\u0027m bringing this out now in its WIP state so:\n\na) I actually work on it\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) because this will take a long time to complete\n\nI also apologize for spelling and grammer mistakes, I\u0027m natively a german speaker and am doing my best to proof read and spell check.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Enter Elysiums\u0027 WWK 2 series\n\u003E - Ian M.
