This began with the idea of a rover being used to deploy small base components that would then need to be connected together using the Kerbal Attachment System. A kethane drill module that lacks power generating components (and can\u0027t do anything with the mined kethane). A converter that also has no power and very limited storage for converted resources (and no source for kethane) and a power generator that has no use for all the power it can produce. But plug them all together using the KAS and its a working mining operation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese modules arrive on an unmanned Cargo lander which also has a rover that unpacks the modules and positions them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/l2nkXoy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l2nkXoyl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l2nkXoyl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/XFglWDi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XFglWDil.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XFglWDil.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/l6A8Xb6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l6A8Xb6m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l6A8Xb6m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/A5yagmV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A5yagmVm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A5yagmVm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/IpLyfbq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IpLyfbqm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IpLyfbqm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/txQ8Lbj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/txQ8Lbjm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022txQ8Lbjm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the crew arrive later they are connected to each other and the cargo lander acts as a fuel store;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YCoL81n\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YCoL81nl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YCoL81nl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover really was the main design focus of the mission and took quite a while to come up with something that was reliable. Initially it used the magnets from the KAS to connect to the modules, but this would sometimes flip the rover around or rip bits off the modules. It wasn\u0027t reliable. I also tried using just docking ports, but that results in a problem with DamnedRobotics in that once it docks the hinges stop working and you need to quicksave/load to get them working again. So while reliable it was not nice to have to save/reload after picking up each module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution in the end was to use both KAS and a docking port. The advantage here is that the KAS winch can have its mode changed from \u0027docked\u0027 to \u0027undocked\u0027 and in the undocked mode the docking port is actually a separate \u0027craft\u0027, not part of the craft with the DR hinges. That got around the problem of docking mucking up the hinges and also brought other advantages like being able to change the docking port for a different attachments during the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the crew arrive they connect an attachment that has a command chair and a lazer (for science) which enables one of the crew to ride shotgun and shoot (I mean study) things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/TytQZAX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TytQZAXl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TytQZAXl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Wbtx8gU\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Wbtx8gUl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Wbtx8gUl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover also carries the two other KAS attachments, the magnet and the grappling hook.

The earlier versions had the ascent module just perched on top and it joined the hab module once in orbit. In this version it sits right inside the hab module and is launched as one craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne goal from the start was to be able to bring the ascent module back down and land it on/in the hab module and re-dock (@ 27:16 in the vid). I must have spent 4-5 days practicing that maneuver on Mun where it was easier to master. One thing I forgot about during my practice was that in the real mission I would be bringing it down without a crew and it has remote tech parts so there is a small signal delay. Even when the signal delay is 0 it behaves a bit differently so the landing on Duna was extra tricky and was the hardest landing I\u0027ve ever pulled off. My forehead was covered in perspiration after that landing and I had to go and sit outside with a beer! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hab lander also brings a very small unmanned rover that is basically a science box on wheels. It\u0027s able to potter about the base but being on such weeny wheels can\u0027t travel that far. So it can dock to the larger rover and piggy-back to other places to get the all important science data. When it\u0027s brought back to base it can re-dock with the hab lander (you know, to upload it\u0027s data of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout half way through building the hab lander I realised that this was getting more like the Constellation mission. So I made more changes, encased both the cargo and hab landers in fairings so they looked more like the constellation landers (err I mean so they were protected against re-entry) and changed the hab lander to be unmanned. The transfer stages were also re-designed to be more like those used in the constellation mission. I wanted to be able to send both modules at the same time so they used LV-t45 engines for a shorter burn time enabling both to depart at a similar time. The cargo module departs first and then the hab module departs by doing a burn against the relative V of the cargo module. That put them both on roughly the same course and then both made minor adjustments to get a better final Pe at Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth landers stay encased in fairings until the last moment (to protect them from the ravages of Duna\u0027s atmo).

As they approached Duna they made a couple minor course corrections so they would drop their transfer stages on a sub-orbital path. This was done with over a minute of signal delay as they were still in contact with Kerbin and not yet switched to Duna\u0027s orbital command station. Its the first time I\u0027ve really used remote techs flight computer properly and I\u0027ve got to say, it is awesome. Going to use that much more now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally the hab lander was launched as a manned craft and a 2nd small craft was then sent out to bring the crew home. Once I decided that this was a Constellation mimik that changed and so the final piece of this mission was the crew ship to take the brave explorers to Duna and bring them home again. Of course it had to be \u0022Kopernicus\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is Kopernicus in orbit around Duna, with its small orion craft docked to one side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/W4xjOnJ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W4xjOnJh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022W4xjOnJh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used two Orion craft to bring the crew up to Kopernicus and then one travels with it and is used to transfer the crew to the orbiting hab module. At one stage I used the Orion craft from the Bobcat mod, but I had issues with it and although the six man pod was a nice advantage it really felt like I was just using a prefabricated craft and I don\u0027t like doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the NASA videos about the constellation missions they show their crew ship (Copernicus) dropping \u0027contingency\u0027 equipment before it returns to earth, but I was not sure what exactly these \u0027contingencies\u0027 were. So Kopernicus has my take on contingency equipment. In case of total failure it has a 6 main pod that can be ejected and powers away from the wrecked ship on septrons and it can land on Duna (all be it a bit roughly) with parachutes. It also has another module that has engines which could be used to transport the 6main pod all the way back home if for some reason Kopernicus couldn\u0027t make the trip. This module can land on Duna too if it needed to take on more fuel (although that would require the crew also coming back down in the ascent module to plug it into the Duna base). It could then return to orbit and would have just enough fuel to re-dock with the escape pods and return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with all my craft I\u0027ve used a metric crap-ton of mods, with no particular process for tracking what I used so it\u0027s always a bit of a pain trying to produce a mod list.
