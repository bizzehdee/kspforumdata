On the first/second day of the operation I set up a flag that jebediah, bill and bob have landed and have no plans of returning. I will let those kerbals work on the north pole for a couple of years (4-8 or even 10 years) and because I have no idea how to land a cargo plane carefully I will land it a few miles away from the base and each kerbal will take turns retreating to the plane. So far So good!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
