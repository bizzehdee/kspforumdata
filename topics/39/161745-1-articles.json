This was not based on Star Wars VII, but the characters are similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver 14 years ago, the KSP was bought by the IKC, a huge asteroid mining company. Before this, Kerbals relied on either probe cores or them selves to fly ships. That has changed. The IKC lost 43% profit to vessel crashes, so they limited the rockets to be monitored by a robot named 0SiRiS MK4.7. It was hell. Free will was destroyed. Vessels couldn\u0027t do double missions. That was the first rule. They had a massive profit gain by what was referred to as \u0027a deal with the devil\u0027, eventually, the IKC bought Kerbin and M\u00FCn (Minmus was ejected from the system due to a warp drive accident. A rebellion formed called the Starlight Federation. A young man Shaz Kernius was the leader. His grandfather was the legendary Bill Kerman, who sacrificed himself to save Kerbin from the Laytin army (spin off coming soon...). The next person is Jenaur Kirlon, a lonely young woman whose family was killed when they tried to get to a Starlight Federation base. She was abandoned on the marauder planet of Hetoo, an exoplanet in the Kerbol Starsystem. Next there is PL-6793 a part of the IKC Clone Pilot Division 679. That\u0027s all I will tell you for now, as I am going to start writing season 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
