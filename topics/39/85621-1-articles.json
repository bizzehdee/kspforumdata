W. Awdry, as well as the classic Thomas and Friends show by Britt Alcroft. You know, the first three seasons narrated by Ringo Starr. (or if you are American and \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an Anglophile, George Carlin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had a silly idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m5G3Nkg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m5G3Nkg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETomoly and Gordard\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomoly is a Tank Spaceship, who lives at the big space station around the planet of Kerbin. He\u0027s a cheeky little spaceship with six small thrusters, a short stumpy funnel, a short stumpy fuel tank, and a short stumpy crewcab. He\u0027s a fussy little spaceship too. Always pulling Hitchhiker Storage Containers about for the big spaceships to take on loooong journeys. And when the spacetrains come in, he takes the empty Hitchhiker Storage Containers away so the big spaceships can go and rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomoly thinks no engine works as hard as he does. He loves playing tricks on them, including Gordard, the biggest spaceship of all. Tomoly loves sending high pitched radio signals rudely at him. \u0022Wake up Lazy-Squeedlyspooch, why don\u0027t you work hard, like me?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne week after carrying the Jool Express, Gordard arrived back at the station very tired. He was just going to sleep when Tomoly rendezvoused with him in his cheeky way. \u0022wake up Lazy-Squeedlyspooch, do some hard work for a change! You can\u0027t catch me!\u0022 and off Tomoly ran, laughing. Instead of going to sleep again, Gordard thought of how he could get back at Tomoly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne morning Tomoly wouldn\u0027t wake up! His Pilot and copilot couldn\u0027t make him start. His program went off and there was not enough fuel. It was nearly time for the Jool Express! Kerbals were waiting but the Hitchhiker Storage Containers weren\u0027t ready! At last, Tomoly started. \u0022Oh dear, oh dear!\u0022 He yawned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe fussed into the station where Gordard was waiting. \u0022Hurry up you!\u0022 Said Gordard. \u0022Hurry Yourself!\u0022 Replied Tomoly. Gordard began making his plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes.\u0022 said Gordard. \u0022I will.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd almost before the Hitchhiker Storage Containers zeroed out their velocity with the station, Gordard docked right into them. \u0022Get in quickly please!\u0022 He radioed to the Kerbals in the station. Tomoly usually helped push the big trains to help them start, but he was always decoupled just before the trajectory would bring him out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. This time Gordard was thrusting so fast they couldn\u0027t undock Tomoly until it was too late. To keep him from getting lost in deep space they coupled him right back to the spacetrain. Gordard\u0027s chance had come!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they arrived at Jool, Gordard made a course correction. \u0022Come along, come along!\u0022 He said to the Hitchhiker Storage Containers. The spacetrain accelerated faster and faster! Too fast for Tomoly! He wanted to fall but he couldn\u0027t! \u0022BEEP BEEP! Stop! Stop!\u0022 Tomoly radioed! \u0022Hurry Hurry Hurry!\u0022 Laughed Gordard! \u0022You can\u0027t get away! You can\u0027t get away!\u0022 The Hitchhiker Storage Containers laughed! As the Spacetrain fell into Jool, poor Tomoly was going faster than he had ever gone before! He was on fire, and his thrusters were ablating away but he had to go on! \u0022I shall never be the same again!\u0022 Tomoly cried. \u0022My Thrusters will be quite worn out!\u0022 Gordard was enjoying himself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt last they braked around Jool Station. Tomoly was feeling very silly and exhausted. Next he docked on to a gravity wheel, thinking of everyone laughing at him. And then he docked onto a station hub out of the way. \u0022Well, little Tomoly\u0022 Chuckled Gordard. \u0022Now you know what hard work means, don\u0027t you.\u0022 But Tomoly was too tired to answer. He just thrusted slowly away, and had a long drink of the finest Hydrazine available. He burned back to intercept Kerbin with very low acceleration, and was very careful never to be cheeky to Gordard again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-28T16:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2014 04:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENow with Picture!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T15:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh... that was my childhood.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T16:00:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it - have some virtual rep in lieu of the real thing, which it seems I can\u0027t give you any more of yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoooo - does the Hype Train come with two side mounted water tanks as standard? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T16:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like it - have some virtual rep in lieu of the real thing, which it seems I can\u0027t give you any more of yet!\u003Cp\u003ESoooo - does the Hype Train come with two side mounted water tanks as standard? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, the HypeTrain actually resembles more closely a black version of Henry Mk2.
