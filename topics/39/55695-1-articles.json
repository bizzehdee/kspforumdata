I am pretty happy with how it turned out, and I thought I\u0027d share it with you all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is entirely hand drawn, then digitized with a DSLR and combined into separate animated movies in Monkey Jam, then composited in Premiere Pro. It\u0027s 300\u002B drawings and took me probably more than 40 hours of work in all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for looking!
