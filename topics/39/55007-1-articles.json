I reach over to a storage compartment to grab a snack bar, as I take my first bight it has a sweet taste with a little bit of salt. I quickly finish it to suit up for an EVA and go check on the drills. The drills occasionally jam up if a pocket of hard rock is hit, if this happens a Kerbanaught must go and free the drill. As I open the hatch and climb down the ladder I switch on my head lamp and begin to descend to the green ground. I suddenly feel the vibrations of the drill stop, I look down only to see the drill no longer working.

Over\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI drop the probe down the hole and start feeding cable down with it as it slowly descends into the extremely radiant hole. I turn the camera on and begin watching threw the live feed from the probe, as it gets closer to the source I see a ball, a shimmering orange ball of fire. I lower it father and check the depth meter on the probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh...\u0022 I pause as I look again at the screen trying to figure out what I see, \u0022Mission control, it appears we have drilled into the center of Minmus. over\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What? Jeb are you sure? That is impossible, the core is molten rock and it would be spraying up like a volcano visible from Kerbin with the naked eye. Over\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes I\u0027m sure but something strange is going on, there is a massive gap between the crust and the core. I am not sure how the planet is being held together with this empty void between the two. Over\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger, pull the probe out and old tight, we are preparing a resupply mission and a special team of geologists to come to your location. Over\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cut the mic off and sigh, and begin complaining to myself as I pull the probe out, and pack it back up. Luckily though the electricity should last longer now that the drills are off, hopefully long enough until the resupply ship gets here. I climb up the ladder and open the heavy air tight hatch, and heave the heavy case of the probe inside and back under the seat where it belongs. Quickly I proceed to climb back into my seat and get this bulky suit off and get into so more comfortable clothing and try to finally get some sleep with those drills quiet! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI awake to the sound of my radio, \u0022Jeb get up! The geologists are about 15 minutes away from landing at your location! Over.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah yeah I hear ya!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rub the sand out of my eyes and yawn as I try to stretch in the cramped cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmm, wonder what the egg head geologists will think of that mess down below...\u0022 I wonder to myself as I begin putting my EVA suit back on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd of Chapter two, questions or comments?

I stand still as I watch the lander\u0027s engines shutting off, suddenly the hatch flies open and a Kerbal steps out onto the ladder, quickly sending me a wave I hear, \u0022Hey Jeb! Long time no see huh?\u0022 I become frozen, not able to wave back or say a word as I realize it was Bill, \u0022Jeb, you alright over there?\u0022 He asks while walking towards my lander, the sunlight gleaming off of his helmet visor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill? I thought you died back when we were still using the Buran?\u0022 I ask him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That old thing? Haha no UKKR (USSR reference) wanted to stage all that, spies and stuff like that. Of course none of that is important right now, take me to that hole you were talking about.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally climb off the lander and step onto the surface of Minmus as my feet leave light foot print marks in the dirt behind me. I kneel down at the hole, \u0022Bill, here it is, see that glow? I lowered the probe in and seen a massive empty space between the crust and the molten core, I don\u0027t know whats going on.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe walks over to his lander, I look towards it as the sun shimmers off the fuel tanks and blinds me temporarily. He returns very soon after I regain my sight with a small probe and begins to lower it into the hole. \u0022Well this is unusual...\u0022 He pauses as Bill continues to look through the camera of the probe, \u0022I\u0027ve never heard of anything like this. In theory this planet should collapse on its self and possibly what ever is left would crash into Kerbin!\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whoa, what? Why hasn\u0027t it?\u0022 I reply while also looking at the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m not sure.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill changes the camera to night vision and its glowing bright because of the bright glow of the enormous core, but traces of a gas that glowed black would pass infront of the camera from time to time. Suddenly the ground starts shaking and a massive explosion rocks the ground as I look up and see dust flying a couple miles away on the north face of Mt. Minmisia. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill go! Get to your lander and go!\u0022 I order Bill as he gets up and leaves the probe and runs as fast as his clunky suit will allow him. I take off but as soon as I stand up another enormous explosion rocks the ground and sends me back to my knees as rocks begin falling all around me I quickly get back up and run to my lander. I grab the metal ladder rungs and quickly feel a tremendous heat through my suit, almost unbearable. Once I\u0027m through open the hatch and climb in I don\u0027t worry about taking off my EVA suit, I fire the engines up and jam throttle to full while I see a cloud coming over me and Bill\u0027s lander taking off into the distance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChapter Four: The Krackalac\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look out the hatch window once I am above the planet and I see a long brown tentacle shooting out of the hole where the massive explosion came from. \u0022Bill, can you hear me?\u0022 I shout over the radio with adrenaline obvious in my voice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, what do you see?\u0022 He replies back in a much calmer tone then myself. \u0022I see the Kracken!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tentacle reaches out and grabs onto the ground around the hole and begins pulling chunks of the ground into the molten core, brights flashes ensue every time another chunk goes in. \u0022Jeb, I\u0027ve contacted mission control. They want one of us to send our ship into it.\u0022 I hear bill say over the radio, sounding a bit distressed over the order. \u0022I\u0027ll do it. You got more to live for once you get back then I do.\u0022 I hear his voice start to break as I reflect on all the things we\u0027ve done together before, all the missions we\u0027ve flown, all the times we almost died on reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill don\u0027t! You can climb into my craft and we can send yours in remotely!\u0022 I suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No Jeb, this is personal, don\u0027t you remember what happened to Bob? A routine mission and the Kracken got him. I will not let anymore of my brothers in flight die!\u0022 He replies in a overly dramatic tone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a little shimmer in the distance infront of my craft as the sun reflects off of the metal. The little craft quickly becomes bigger and bigger as it speeds towards and eventually past me towards the planet. I watch out the hatch window as the exhaust from the engine becomes smaller and dimmer until all I see is a small explosion. The tentacle flies back deep inside the planet as I try to reach Bill on the radio but all I hear is static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EChapter Five: Bill?

Answer me!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission control, Jeb here over.\u0022 I say over the radio as I look back at Minmus. \u0022Mission control, go ahead Jeb.\u0022 I hear come back into my ear piece. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We lost bill...\u0022 I pause as my eyes become watery. \u0022We saw this thing coming out of the planet and Bill said he had to finish it once and for all.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, what are you talking about?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Kracken was inside the planet and we pissed it off! It came after us with its tentacles and Bill flew his ship into the heart of the best!\u0022 Anger takes the place of grief. I look back and see a massive hold in the side of the planet as the core shines out, my admiring of the planet is cut short by a transmission from Mission Control. \u0022Jeb get back here! Get on a reentry path and get over here ASAP! Are we clear?\u0022 I hear mission control demand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah you\u0027re clear.\u0022 I burn progrode to escape Minmus\u0027s sphere of influence and quickly swing the craft around and begin the long boring burn to reenter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. I look out the hatch window and realize how lucky I am to be alive. My lander was sitting literally just meters away from the Kracken. It could have reached up and snatched me at any minute! I struggle to keep my eyes open and quickly there after fall asleep. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022JEB! Jeb can you hear me? Decouple the stage and activate the parachute!\u0022 I awaken to the sounds of mission control screaming. I look over at the hatch window and see red reentry trails, then to the altimeter reading 20km. My mind races as adrenaline starts pumping through my body like oil in an engine. I reach over the hit the parachute button, I feel a sudden jolt as the chute partially deploys as it should. I reach over and look for the red handle that drops the lander and leaves only the pod in case of an emergency. I look but I don\u0027t see it, altimeter says only 12km left! Finally I look up and see it and give it a pull, I hear the sound of sepatrons firing as they force the stage away from the pod and another jolt as the parachute slows the pod with less weight not pulling it down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, all systems are go, prepare for splashdown and recovery by USKS Red October.\u0022 (((Side story note: USKS Stands for United Soviet Kerbal States.)))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Copy that Mission Control!\u0022 I reply as I descend towards the ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pod shakes and I hear water rushing over hatch as I see water out the window, soon after I hear a Kerbal walking on the pod and then the hatch opens! Fresh air inters the pod and it smells amazing! I get out and stand on the rescue boat I look up and see the Mun, but I also see another planet that is only half the size of the Mun. I quickly realize its Minmus. (((Minmus being normaly barely visible from ground at Kebin.)))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey guys!
