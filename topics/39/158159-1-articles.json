He new what they were doing,\u00A0he picked up\u00A0the energy signatures, the comms chatter. What he didn\u0027t know was what was giving off the energy and why they needed it.

Finally here. No more bullies, no more inefficient school system, no more slow processing times. At only 14, he was truly a prodigy. He would have gone to prison for doing what he did, but the government saw promise in him and put him in charge of the whole worlds communication. Even though we was a stereotypical mad scientist, he would keep the information secret.. \u0022They made me do it,\u0022 he told\u00A0the police. \u0022I\u0027m sick of people believing strength matters anymore. I have created strength out of Science!.\u0022 He looked down at his hand, a perfect combination of metal and organics. as always his photo receptors analyzed everything around him. The floor was made of marble with a fibrous covering. His hand was comprised of simple organic tissue and a special alloy he designed himself. Again he asked himself\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Why would you not fully transform yourself, it would be logical.\u0022\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EHe replied\u00A0\u0022\u003Cem\u003EFear is a powerful\u00A0motivator, I\u00A0look like something out of a sci-fi movie.

Alex quickly activated his sub dermal comms device and said \u0022Call a\u00A0meeting.\u0022 we need everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery leader in the government sat around the table, in the center of the table there was a hunk of what looked like a shiny rock in a heavily insulated chamber. Werhner said \u0022I definitely see its potential for power generation.\u0022 Weapons expert Carol said, \u0022Krussia may have found a way to release all its energy at once, making a bomb.\u0022 Alex said \u0022Those would be the only concerning reasons i could think of with the information we have at the moment. Commander Reyes said \u0022 I suggest we get Karl back as soon as possible. He was a good soldier, but i think the Krussians and their unorthodox ways of torture may break him.\u0022 The Supreme Kerbal asked, \u0022is there any way his equipment could tie him to our country?.\u0022 \u0022No,\u0022 replied covert ops leader Blake. \u0022What about this.... rock. What is it?\u0022 the Supreme Kerbal asked, pointing to the box in the middle of the table. \u0022That,\u0022 Werhner said heroically, \u0022is a new element.\u0022 Gasps and wows could be heard from everyone else. \u0022The drone was captured in Blue Bay, so we have designated it Blutonium 238.

Some of his soldiers laughed. Jebediah, the pilot said, \u0022Werhner prides himself in achieving his goal with the absolute minimum.\u0022 Alex came over their earpieces, \u0022Alright get into your drop pods I have all the satellites and stealth drones primed. Us here at HQ wish you luck.\u0022 There were only 5\u00A0people directly helping with the mission. Blake and his 3 stealth troops, Val, George and Monty. And the soldier Jeanne. She insisted on coming even though she had no special stealth training. Reyes was confident in her abilities. Then there was the crew organizing return missions, Alex getting aerial views, and the scientists who would assess any new data. When everyone was in there pods Jeb gave the final 20 second countdown. 3.... 2.... 1.... WHOOSH. the pods shot out of the bottom of the ship. as the pods reentered the atmosphere, the extra scrap came off the sides, giving the appearance of a meteor to the enemies. once they were only 10 kilometers from the surface, small chutes opened up for a few seconds to get it to subsonic speeds. now the jet engines, simply Junos, activated and the chutes were detached. The pods maneuvered into a forest and landed. The crew stepped out, disoriented but wary. They began to prime their gear.

The Krussians had BD Armory on their side however, so the team was vastly outgunned, with only a few sepatrons as rockets. the particular base they were in was not heavily guarded, however, because the Krussians did not have space plane tech and probably expected an in-air drop. Alex had no problem locating the room where Karl was held. There were two guards guarding the door. Jeanne simply fired on the door and both guards poofed. the door blasted apart and Blake went in to get Karl. Karl was in bad shape and Alex scolded Jeanne for just blowing things up. Everyone else, however, praised her for her ingenious idea to blow everything up. Blake signaled his men, who he stationed outside to warn of danger to regroup with them at the entrance. but no return signal came. then they heard the telltale sound of jet engines and feared the worst.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHeroReborn","CreatedById":173981,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-25T16:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, i know it\u0027s been a long time, but my computer broke so i can\u0027t even play ksp, ill try to do another story soon (does it count as necroposting if its all my posts anyways?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
