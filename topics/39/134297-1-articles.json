Two\u00A0years since the death of many. And only one year since that fateful mission. I have been through the war, the mission, the pain. I have decided to write down my adventure, as I do not think that I will survive long enough before Perseverance 2 arrives. I sit next to the rock of my once lover. The rock him and I\u00A0will share.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe war was about solid fuel. Makedonicia wanted stockpiles and so did the Demomedian Socialsts. The arms race was cold as cold can be, The ice melted faster than fuel runs out on Eve. The two countries threw all the manpower possible at each other. When there was no men, they drafted women. I was drafted into the 20th Liquid Regiment, one that supplied coolant to the rocket machines. \u00A0It was at 4:50 during Month 5 when Makedonicia used the \u0022Mammoth\u0022 . The nerve killing gas quickly killed the Demomedians very fast, causing a short lived victory. It however, started killing us, too. Very few quickly fled underground to the MSC (Makedonician Space Center). We decided to settle our differences and renamed the KSC. We would observe the outside at times, to see if we could venture yet again. The gas had made clouds. We then knew that we had to leave. This planet had no way to help us anymore. We stockpiled all we had,and we had to leave. They chose kerbonauts. I was one of the four to be chosen. They had chosen men to come along with me. We had a vessel, Perseverance. We were to use this vessel to check 3 planets for \u0022interest\u0022 as we called it, or habitability. There were 3 sleeper agents that would be re-activated from pre-war space launches. The planets were 5_22_5, 4_18_5_19, and 12_1_25_20_8_5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese numbers are code for Eve, Dres, and Laythe if you haven\u0027t figured it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore will come.
