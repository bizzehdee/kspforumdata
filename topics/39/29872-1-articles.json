There is a chunk of the ksp community that has a disdain for the \u0022casual minecraft crowd\u0022 as they call it. Basically there is two definitions for this: People that like dumbed down and easy games and will latch on to a new indie-alpha game. When they find out it isn\u0027t as easy to get into like minecraft they will try to cry out and force their opinion on devs to make the game easier to accommodate them. Then there are the fans who will fanatically and blindly support the game and developers no matter what, and any kind of criticism or suggestions, whether constructive or not is shouted down and the poster of the criticism is attacked by the fanatical fanbase. On the latter, though a dedicated fanbase is a good thing, these kinds of fans will look over any game bug (and not report it), and basically see the dev team as people who can do no wrong and make no mistakes and anyone that might point out mistakes or bugs are either mistaken, trolls or haters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe community sees these people as mostly coming from the fanbase of minecraft and whenever someone that is well known in the minecraft fanbase makes a video or does a stream featuring KSP, the community becomes nervous that the KSP fanbase will slowly (or quickly) be overtaken by these more casual players and they will attempt to pressure the developers into changing the game to make it more easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-28T23:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2013 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by EleSigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vilsol","CreatedById":67513,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:17:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have 2 sides to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst one is that \u0022Yaay new people coming\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is that, as we all know yogscast likes to fool around things... so it possibly might make a bad image for others?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vilsol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vilsol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have 2 sides to this.\u003Cp\u003EFirst one is that \u0022Yaay new people coming\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is that, as we all know yogscast likes to fool around things... so it possibly might make a bad image for others?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou mean like that thing they \u0022accedently\u0022 made with the minecraft mod that allow for moving objects?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:25:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps I should add \u0022yogscast\u0022 or \u0022duncan\u0022 to my youtube video tags, that might spike my views. lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echostatic","CreatedById":59603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore publicity means more incoming players, good and bad.
