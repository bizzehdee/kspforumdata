Me being my geeky self, I decided to go looking around for any KSP crossover story\u0027s that anyone had made. Me being a fan of crossover story\u0027s, I quite like them because like I already said, I\u0027m quite a geek. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I spent around 10 or so minutes looking around the internet, and was able to only dig up ONE KSP crossover story on the internet, ONE. I mean, I\u0027m not complaining or anything, I\u0027m just curious as to why there are next to no KSP crossover story\u0027s out there on the internet. Would it be considered out of place on the fan-works section, would it be COPYRIGHT, or would it just be out of place in the KSP community? And for anyone that wanted to know what that one story was... well... if your not a Brony... then don\u0027t Google \u0022ksp crossover story\u0022. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ---GEEKINESS OVER---\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeGrey","CreatedById":61242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T00:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh.
