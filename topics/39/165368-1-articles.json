Bill and Bob were playing cards on top of the monolith, Valentina was doing flybys near the control\u00A0tower. Suddenly, there was a loud banging on the door to the admin building. Stormy clouds rolled in. \u00A0From inside the building, the secretary who went by the name of Elidon\u00A0came to the door to open it. \u00A0She did not know who the\u00A0mysterious kerbal\u00A0standing at the door was. \u00A0He said that he was looking for a job as a pilot. \u00A0Elidon was quite happy to hear this because one of their recent pilots had gone poof. His name was Neldon Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter Elidon had talked\u00A0to this strange kerbal for a little while, she learned that his name was Jebediah Kerman. \u00A0What a strange name thought Elidon. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20 years in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crew was working on a new mission to explore the bottom of the ocean near the 2nd island by the old airfield. \u00A0Rumor has it that there was a cave down there. But that\u0027s not why they were so eager to find this cave. \u00A0It was because there was a Kraken egg hidden in the cave. \u00A0What mysteries would this egg uphold? Nobody knew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
