Note: This story was originally posted by me during the 0.90 era on the Fanfiction website, but I am moving it here due to the flexibility and interest here. \u00A0Also, with the releases of 1.1-1.12 it makes more sense to completely redo things, at least as far as operations are concerned. \u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd just to set the record straight, my first name, Kavy, does not rhyme with \u0022Navy,\u0022 but is pronounced with the \u0022a\u0022 sound in \u0022father.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings just seem to come together a just the right time every so often...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And that was our number four hit this week, moving up the chart from seven and passing up \u0027Kresspian Melody\u0027 - which unfortunately appears to have gone into rating freefall. \u00A0While we were listening to that, I thought we might listen to some tunes from yesteryear, so I\u0027m going to play you \u0027Monotreym\u0027 by the Railers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d been a professional CJ for nearly two years by then and had come up with some clever shortcuts, positioning the sound cylinder to play the moment I flipped the switch - but before I did so, I hesitated. \u00A0There was something off about what I was hearing in my earphones. \u00A0An odd bit of static; coarser, less sibilant than what I was used to hearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Boley?\u0022 I called to my sound engineer. \u00A0\u0022Boley, are you picking that up?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You betcha, Kav.\u0022 \u00A0He looked me squarely in the eye. \u00A0\u0022That\u0027s not us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, I didn\u0027t think it was. \u00A0Go ahead an isolate it as well as you can. \u00A0Looks like someone is messing with our signal.\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran my fingers through my dark hair in exasperation knowing I\u0027d have to explain this and hope the listeners understood, \u0022Okay, sorry folks, as I\u0027m afraid you heard, we got some weird kind of interference there.\u0022 I then flicked the audio player to avoid irritating any more AKKP listeners. \u00A0I did have to handle a pair of annoyed callers and assured them that I\u0027d get it handled. \u00A0Boley, always helpful, had made a recording of the odd sound which I picked up after my shift. \u00A0I ran a couple of blocks to the studio of AKKP\u0027s main rival, AKKT, and demanded to see Heekoo Kersal, the director of programming.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It wasn\u0027t us, Lady Kavy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was just twenty-three years old, and not royalty or nobility, but it was a polite custom to address us female Kerbals as \u0027Lady.\u0027 \u00A0Lying in Kerbal societies was almost unheard of, so this declaration kind of surprised me. \u00A0He must have noticed the look I was giving him and raised his hand to acknowledge it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m quite serious, Kavy. \u00A0This was deliberately broadcast, but not from AKKT. \u00A0We picked up the same thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sighed. \u00A0Kerbals didn\u0027t lie much, but they were given to practical jokes. \u00A0 Still, Heekoo was just a competitor, not an enemy of mine and I never had any reason to mistrust him\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right. \u00A0Fine. \u00A0Any thoughts on what it was, Heekoo?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We ran it though our computers, I guess you did the same. \u00A0I think what we picked up used to be a lot stronger.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tilted my head. \u00A0\u0022I\u0027m thinking we bring this to the scientists.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat recommendation was readily accepted. \u00A0Heekoo and I brought the recordings to KSO, the Kerbal Science Institute. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You picked this up from the airwaves?\u0022 asked Dr. Kerberka, the scientist on duty. \u00A0 \u0022Were you able to get anything else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, Doc, we talked things over and came straight to you guys as soon as we got things sorted out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Very well, had you taken note of where the antennae were pointed when you picked up the signal?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kavy is using somewhat more primitive equipment than my station,\u0022 Heekoo interrupted. \u00A0\u0022Our own dishes were pointed at elevation eighty-eight degrees, forty-four seconds, twenty-one and a half seconds, the ascension was two hours, seven minutes, fifty-one point one seconds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And all you got was static?\u0022 \u00A0He shrugged. \u00A0\u0022Well, no matter. \u00A0Let us take a little listen and see what comes of it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only was the static still there, within two hours there were reports of it coming in on other stations. \u00A0All the signals were faint, some more than others, but they were there, and they all appeared to come from the same patch of sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked on as scientists seemed to go from mildly interested, to intrigued, to fascinated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What\u0027s going on?\u0022 I asked. \u00A0\u0022What\u0027s going on!?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good doctor looked at Heekoo and me, smiled, and shook his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not Kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kavy, the transmission\u0022 he emphasized the word \u0022transmission,\u0022 \u0022the transmission you intercepted was from outside the Kerbol System. \u00A0As far as we can tell, this is alien technology.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur mouths dropped wide open. \u00A0It\u0027s one of those situations where you can\u0027t disbelieve what you\u0027re hearing, but at the same time, believing it just feels bizarre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You mean we found alien life? \u00A0How far is it??\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoctor Kerberka held up his hands attempting to calm us down. \u00A0\u0022Now please, we believe that it is alien. \u00A0The signal is so degraded that it may be impossible to salvage, and therefore confirm. \u00A0On a positive note though, we\u0027ve been getting reports of similar signals coming in from several locations on Kerbin, and that makes it easier to triangulate the signal. \u00A0For now anyway, we\u0027re estimating the signal origin from about sixty-five to eighty light years away.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was depressing; I\u0027d never live long enough then to meet them. \u00A0\u0022So unless they were heading in our direction...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoctor Kerberka smiled compassionately. \u00A0\u0022We won\u0027t be expecting any visits from them in our immediate future, most likely in our lifetimes. \u00A0Not unless they figured out away around the light wall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But they really are out there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe doctor patted my shoulder appreciatively. \u00A0\u0022It looks like it Kavy. \u00A0You, me and several others, we\u0027ve just changed the way everyone looks at the world now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what happens now?\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoctor Kerberka shrugged. \u00A0\u0022We\u0027ll have to report this to the Governor. \u00A0This might be the kick needed to get the possibilities of spaceflight back on the agenda.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals are not the only form of life on the planet Kerbin, I could tell you a lot of stories on that front, but we are certainly the most intelligent. \u00A0We\u0027re ambivalent about cities, but being as gregarious as we are, we tend to congregate around them just the same. \u00A0The wealthier Kerbals enjoy living in single family homes that incorporate seamlessly into the landscape. \u00A0The poorer ones...they tend to occupy cities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypically Kerbals have a surname beginning with \u0022Ker\u0022 and nobody is sure where this tradition got started. \u00A0In order to avoid confusion, most Kerbal families have adopted at least one middle name, some, with the intention of standing out, have adopted four or five of them. \u00A0I was not among them; my full name is \u0022Kavy Ann Bethany Kerlem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite having more than the rudimentary technology for it, full-scale organized space exploration had taken a back seat to more mundane research and projects for the past fifty years. \u00A0There had been pioneers in that field just the same. \u00A0Being a junk dealer isn\u0027t usually considered a lucrative profession, but for Rufus Kerman it had resulted in him becoming one of the wealthiest Kerbals on the continent. \u00A0After he died, his fortune was distributed to and all but squandered by his three sons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerman brothers, Jebediah, Robert, and William, all in their thirties, seemed to be the only contemporary practitioners of \u0022spaceflight\u0022 and even that was now severely constrained after one too many incidents led to Jeb being effectively grounded by local authorities. \u00A0Kerbal City was expanding, the largest urban area on Kerbin, and people were enjoying the prosperity it brought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t have nations as such on Kerbin; it would be more accurate to say that we grouped themselves into city-states; of course some city-states are more willing to cooperate with others. \u00A0People gravitated towards Kerbal City and its environs because of all the city-states, KC was indubitably the freest. \u00A0That was not, unfortunately, the norm. \u00A0There was little outright tyranny to be found, but while a few of the twenty-eight major city-states were happy to accept guests, they not so happy about seeing them depart. \u00A0There were ways to \u0022discourage\u0022 Kerbals from leaving, especially those who were more learned or talented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of days had passed since our discovery. \u00A0I was more than a little dismayed to come back to work and find myself the center of attention. \u00A0For someone who enjoyed working on the radio, I was a fairly shy and inarticulate young woman. \u00A0I have to credit my survival on job as being a result of intense preparation prior to my shift and being able to use the time during songs and musical pieces to come up with something meaningful to say in-between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Before we go on to our next song, I\u0027ve just been handed a news report by Stephen, our intern. \u00A0Let\u0027s see...oh apparently the governor is going to be speaking on an urgent matter in the next ten minutes regarding a recent scientific discovery...\u0022 \u00A0I nearly laughed out loud at this, I\u0027d been told to keep a lid on the recent scientific discovery until it could be \u0022officially verified.\u0022 \u00A0\u0022Of course we prefer playing music for you,\u0022 I said wryly, \u0022but in this case I think you will all wanna stay tuned.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter three of those tunes, I cut my microphone and listened to the Governor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My Dear Kerbals...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few days ago, a young lady by the name of Kavy Kerlem was performing her usual duties as a cylinder jammer...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh no! \u00A0I buried my face in my hands. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She and her sound engineer Boley noticed a strange kind of static in their headphones...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoley, in contrast, seemed thrilled to hear the Governor calling him by name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Consulting with their friendly rival station, and then with the Kerbal Science Institute, it was determined that this static was in fact a significantly deteriorated radio signal from outside the Kerbol System. \u00A0This would indicate one of two things. \u00A0The first possibility is that it was one of our older broadcasts returning to us after being warped and redirected by a neighboring star some thirty-five to forty light-years away. \u00A0Now, my friends, this possibility seems exceedingly unlikely, though not entirely impossible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s an interesting idea, I thought. \u00A0We send out a radio signal, it hits a star and is warped back around and right back to us. \u00A0What amount of mass would that have to use??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The other possibility, the more likely and infinitely more compelling one is that we picked up a signal from an alien intelligence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoley and I shared an amused look as we heard gasps and shouts from the adjoining rooms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wouldn\u0027t be doing my job if I didn\u0027t take into account the worst possibilities. \u00A0Like you, I\u0027m sure, the hope is that we are going to eventually be opening up a channel to intelligent life elsewhere in our Ehcel galaxy - and of course that will be a major part of our focus. \u00A0But we have to consider the possibility of hostility. \u00A0Fortunately, we can concentrate our efforts on both simultaneously.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat efforts are those, I wondered. \u00A0We\u0027d all seen movies about hostile aliens invading Kerbin and brave Kerbals fighting them off, but that the government would actually consider that as a real possibility surprised me - at first. \u00A0Then I realized that it made a certain sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have always looked towards the stars, but our technology towards reaching them has been, shall we say, somewhat lacking. \u00A0But we know that we can go into space, to the Mun, to the outer reaches of our system and beyond should we so desire. \u00A0That being the case, and knowing what we do now, the objective of Kerbal City will be to colonize the terrestrial planets outside of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, with the far objective of reaching for the stars.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow....\u0022 I breathed aloud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Governor chuckled. \u00A0\u0022Of course we\u0027re not gonna be doing this tomorrow. \u00A0My office will be contacting some key people over the next two weeks, and we will flesh out some tentative plans. \u00A0For now, my friends, let\u0027s keep looking up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy eyes rolled at that signoff. \u00A0\u0027Keep looking up,\u0027 how trite!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree days later I was enjoying a day off from work and was reading one of the books I had picked up from the library last night. \u00A0I have a widely eclectic taste in literature as well as music, but for tonight I was content to enjoy a light romance. \u00A0We Kerbals are quite an affectionate and high spirited people; good writing can move the most callous - though callousness is an exceedingly rare trait among us - to tears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe phone rang. \u00A0I sighed in annoyance, undoubtedly another marketing call. \u00A0I supposed it served me right to make my first job with a radio station that would take any advertising that would pay well enough - one of the first campaigns my station had been involved with had \u0027strongly urged\u0027 me to give them my phone and speedywyre address.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You reached the Kavy Kerlem residence, listen, I know you...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lady Kavy Kerlem?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yesss -\u0022 I stopped suddenly, I knew the voice, somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is Jax Kermynn, science advisor to the Governor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh. \u00A0That made...sense??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uhm....right...whatcanIdoforyou...Sir Jax?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe chuckled. \u00A0\u0022If I may call you Kavy, by all means call me Jax. \u00A0 Look, I\u0027ll be brief about this. \u00A0I trust you saw or heard the Gov\u0027s speech from a few days ago?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He wanted to get you involved in \u0027fleshing out the plans,\u0027 as it were. \u00A0Can you be ready to come to the City the day after tomorrow? \u00A0We\u0027ll pick you up in the morning, give you three square meals, and listen to your input on what we might do over the next few years.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...\u0022 \u00A0I hadn\u0027t expected this. \u00A0\u0022Um...Sir J....Jax. \u00A0I...you realize that you are talking to a girl who\u0027s a really, really, good CJ - but who knows next to nothing about space or planetary defense.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course, Kavy. \u00A0 I\u0027m fully aware of this, and I know that you graduated fourth in your class from the KC School of Broadcasting three years ago, that you have a four centimeter scar under your left arm - I won\u0027t embarrass you by mentioning the details about that, and that you excelled in math and science when you did concentrate on those subjects. \u00A0The Governor is aware of this as well, but he wants the input from a layperson. \u00A0Since you played no small role in bringing the original signal to our attention, it seems fair that it be you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was curious to know how they found out what they knew about me, and since I was never one to turn down a free meal, especially three offered by the Governor, I readily agreed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe day after the next I was chauffeured to the Governor\u0027s mansion as promised, given a security badge, and was escorted into a small conference room where Heekoo and five others were chatting among themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re waiting on just a few others,\u0022 said my escort, \u0022the Governor will be along shortly.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI shyly eased up to the group and greeted Heekoo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kavy! \u00A0I didn\u0027t know they invited you too!\u0022 \u00A0He chucked at this. \u00A0\u0022Oh but they would, of course they would have to.\u0022 \u00A0He turned to the others. \u00A0\u0022Boys, this young lady is Kavy Kerlem as you might have guessed. \u00A0Kavy, I\u0027d like to introduce you to Bob and Bill Kerman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi!\u0022 I said eagerly, shaking their hands with both of mine. \u00A0Of course I\u0027d known of the three brothers, but I never thought I would get the chance to meet them. \u00A0\u0022How\u0027s business and where\u0027s Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb is...well, Jeb is away pouting\u0022 answered Bob. \u00A0\u0022He was invited but thought he\u0027d sit this meeting out as a protest of some sort.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s probably working on our newest engine\u0022 said Bill. \u00A0\u0022Business is slow, so we need this contract.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI nodded and was then introduced to Johnnie Kerplen of Rockomax and Sean Kerstin of C7 Aerospace. \u00A0Both of their companies were doing well, except that they had expressed frustration that they were unable to find a market for their most intriguing projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The company we really need to watch is Kerbodyne,\u0022 said Johnnie, \u0022and I\u0027m frankly amazed that they haven\u0027t been invited.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They were,\u0022 said the Governor, Smedlee Kervrum, as he entered the room with three other men and another woman. \u00A0\u0022Couldn\u0027t make it, and apparently they have been having some issues with leaks...in more ways than one.\u0022 \u00A0He stood behind the chair at the head of the table. \u0022Good of you, all of you, to come. \u00A0Shall we begin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sat between Bob and one of the new men I didn\u0027t recognize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m assuming that you all know why you\u0027re here, but just to state the general theme: \u00A0we are operating on the assumption that we are about thirty years from an alien invasion - and that at this moment there would be absolutely nothing that we can do about it. \u00A0My friends, I want that reality changed as soon as possible. \u00A0Each of you has something up here,\u0022 he tapped his head, \u0022that you can contribute to that objective. \u00A0I want at minimum a basic integrated plan to defend Kerbin while reaping the benefits of planetary exploration.\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sighed, thinking deeply. \u00A0\u0022I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll have the chance to worry about interstellar spaceflight any time in our lifetimes. \u00A0The possible exception of course being Lady Kerlem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI blushed a deep green. \u00A0Oh brother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the chuckles had died down, the Governor continued. \u00A0\u0022Oh, and before you get too enthusiastic with your planning, the council - in its wisdom - is only allocating five hundred thousand in funds for our little endeavor.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob Kerman shook his head. \u00A0\u0022It will be a little endeavor indeed if all we get is 500K. \u00A0You saw what we were able to do with fifteen million of our papa\u0027s fortune. \u00A0After we purchased Boxey Point, there really wasn\u0027t a whole lot left. \u00A0And with Jeb\u0027s pilot\u0027s license revoked, all we can do are launch ballistic rockets. \u00A0Notta lotta profit in that, even if Jeb thinks it\u0027s a lot of fun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJohnnie of Rockomax agreed. \u00A0\u0022We can test our fuel tanks under laboratory conditions, but we can\u0027t really put them to use - except to cut the tops off them and sell them as swimming pools and fuel storage containers. \u00A0Put a rocket engine on one though...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why can\u0027t they be used?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re still having problems with leaks when it comes to attaching the rockets. \u00A0To be perfectly candid, it might be a year before we can clear it up. \u00A0Funding problems, y\u0027see.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay,\u0022 said Kervrum. \u00A0\u0022Okay. \u00A0Let\u0027s take it one step at a time. \u00A0We have thirty years. \u00A0What. Should. Be. Our. Next. Goal!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If our ultimate goal is defending the planet,\u0022 said the Defense Chief, \u0022our first goal should be making sure that Kerbals can handle themselves in a space environment. \u00A0Let\u0027s face it; we don\u0027t even know the extent of our own system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you want to be picky,\u0022 offered Von Kerman, \u0022our little system shouldn\u0027t even exist. \u00A0Our star is too small, our planet too small. \u00A0But it exists just the same, here we are. \u00A0And I agree with our Chief. \u00A0We must find out what Kerbals can do up there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are currently designing a chamber or capsule that could help us with that,\u0022 said Eduard Kerlington. \u00A0\u0022We call it the MK-1, it will keep a Kerbal safe for as long as the supplies last.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you just lock him in, does he have any control?\u0022 asked Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspected that Kerlington knew perfectly well what was being asked. \u00A0\u0022There is no control during launch, but there is a reaction control system that the subject could use to control the capsule after separation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill and Bob shared a look. \u00A0Jeb wouldn\u0027t be happy with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s work with that then, at least for the time being,\u0022 said the Governor. \u00A0\u0022How many pilots do we have to work with, Bob?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0027Um\u0027 is not the answer I\u0027m looking for. \u00A0Am I right in assuming that your roster of test pilots is somewhat lacking?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With Jeb being grounded? \u00A0Yep!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, whatta \u0027bout you two?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob and Bill again exchanged glances. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Nope!\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing the governor glaring at them. \u00A0\u0022Lord Governor, we are a scientist and an engineer. \u00A0I determine if something is possible. \u00A0Bill makes sure it is practical, and helps Jeb build it. \u00A0Jeb flies them, or at least he did. \u00A0Couldn\u0027t the Defense Chief provide us with some pilots?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe governor turned to his Defense Chief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was unable to stifle a giggle. \u00A0The Governor noticed this immediately. \u00A0\u0022You have something to add to this, Lady Kerlem?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, Governor,\u0022 I offered as a nervous apology. \u00A0\u0022But why don\u0027t we try sending up rockets without Kerbals first? \u00A0I mean, the communication we got was through wadio...radio. \u00A0Shouldn\u0027t we send them a message that way before we start sending people up to risk their lives?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s not a bad idea on its own merits, Kavy,\u0022 said Bob. \u00A0\u0022Right now though, we don\u0027t have the communications needed for it.\u0022 \u00A0Bob thought a bit, scratching his cheek. \u00A0\u0022We\u0027re definitely gonna need a network like that though. \u00A0You can\u0027t fight an effective war without good communications - not that I think it\u0027ll come to that. \u00A0If we could get a proper communications network in place, that will open a lot of doors for us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And to put that network in place, Bob,\u0022 said the Governor, \u0022you\u0027ll need space pilots.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob nodded readily. \u00A0\u0022Space pilots, space engineers, space scientists. \u00A0But mostly pilots at first, preferably those trained in engineering.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right then,\u0022 said Kervrum. \u00A0\u0022We\u0027re getting somewhere. \u00A0So our first objective then is getting enough pilots and putting a communications network in place.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sign me on for that project...\u0022 muttered Heekoo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right!\u0022 said Bill. \u00A0\u0022And how many pilots do we have. \u00A0Oh...that\u0027s right...none!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe governor shook his head. \u00A0\u0022Jebediah-Kerman\u0027s-license-suspension-is-hereby-repealed-he-is-now-fully-returned-to-flying-status. \u00A0See? \u00A0Done.\u0022 \u00A0Bob and Bill exchanged a gleeful glance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Provided that your brother passes a full military physical. \u00A0We can\u0027t have him losing consciousness at 70K now can we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill and Bob shrugged. \u00A0A minor detail it seemed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I will need at least six other volunteers within...five days from now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob tilted his head at this. \u00A0\u0022Wait, Governor, what are you telling us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I am beginning a new quasi-governmental organization called the Kerbin City Space Agency, Bob. \u00A0And I want you...and Bill...and Jeb to run it. \u00A0You indicated, as I recall, that you were having some...fiscal issues?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not only that, we\u0027re goin\u0027 broke!\u0022 piped up Bill. \u00A0\u0022Oh...sorry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well I like dealing with companies that have fiscal issues. \u00A0It always seems to make them more...malleable. \u00A0I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m gonna do for you and your brothers, Bob...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, Lord Governor,\u0022 I asked. \u00A0\u0022Did you need me to stay for this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Governor thought for a few moments. \u00A0\u0022Actually...yes, Lady Kerlem. \u00A0Since you and Heekoo are the closest thing to press in here, I would like you both to stay.\u0022 \u00A0He addressed the other members present. \u00A0\u0022Gentlemen, I thank you all for coming, please help yourself to luncheon, I\u0027ll be getting in touch with all of you personally sometime over the week.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was no shortage of grumbling but they did as requested. \u00A0The Governor motioned for the four of us to come up front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right, Bob, Bill, here is my offer. \u00A0I\u0027m going to give you the grant for half a million. \u00A0Now you can spend that money in any way that you like -

I\u0027ll give you five years to do that. \u00A0Finally, and this is just an arbitrary standard, I want at least the beginnings of bases on both Mun and Minmus. \u00A0You have ten years, starting from the beginning of next year and ending on the last day of 1690. \u00A0Failure means that we send you a tax bill for 750K, five percent interest. \u00A0Is that understood?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Crystal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Waitasec, waitasec, waitasec!\u0022 shouted Heekoo. \u00A0You\u0027re saying that if they don\u0027t get to the Mun and Minmus, they gotta pay you back a grant? \u00A0That sure doesn\u0027t sound like any grant I ever heard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeekoo had a great point; \u0022That really doesn\u0027t sound fair,\u0022 I said. \u00A0\u0022After all, the people of Kerbin want to see this happening, they want to see what\u0027s out there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe governor considered. \u00A0\u0022The people also want to ensure that the government remains solvent,\u0022 he murmured. \u00A0\u0022All right,\u0022 he said, \u0022if you don\u0027t get the bases started in ten years, I\u0027ll give you a five year extension - but I\u0027m going to need a Kerbal on Duna by the end of the fifteen years. \u00A0If you do get those bases started within ten years and get us to Duna within...fourteen, I\u0027ll give you boys a grant -

reducing the power. \u00A0Rather than flattening out and turning to the east, the rocket drifted over my position, but Jeb corrected the drift and increased the power before reducing it. \u00A0The craft rotated again, and Jeb cut the power entirely. \u00A0The Korvette cruised out of the atmosphere on its own momentum, and Jeb reignited the engine just before reaching eighty-three kilometers.

meters, the air was bitterly cold, and I was thankful that we had the oxygen - but the plain was blasted by stiff winds. \u00A0After talking it over, Bill and I decided to go for it. \u00A0Bill had the foresight to bring ropes to tie us together just in case it might do us some good. \u00A0The walking was stiff and we got pushed over more than once, but we did manage to get to the southern edge of the glacier - where even stronger winds flowed down from the summit ridge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe were running out of daylight and electricity and decided that our best bet was to go near vertical and ascend the northeastern wall. \u00A0In our EVA suits, the only way to do this was to take the two ladders we had brought, bolt them in, ascend, remove the bottom ladder, bring it to the top, bolt that one in, ascend. \u00A0It was a tedious process and by the time we got to the top, twilight was upon us. \u00A0But, the winds had died down, and from there it was a simple process of

the best mission I possibly could. \u00A0In the twenty day interval between K1 and MP-7, I flew the simulator four hours every day. \u00A0Because of the configuration, we decided on a conventional

two LV-T45 engines with a larger WildCat engine between them, with two smaller Falcon radial fuel tanks connected to a Vega fuel tank. \u00A0A second LV-T45 and Vega tank made up the second stage, with a round blue, white, and red KSA logo emblazoned on the sides. \u00A0The third and final stage consisted of an LV-909 engine connected to a slightly larger fuel tank than the preceding rockets,

raw power pushing against me from all sides, I twisted the stick right into a roll to get her properly oriented, then pushed it gently to the left to pitch over to north once the airspeed indicator showed a hundred meters a second. \u00A0Not too much force now, I was controlling it with two fingers and a thumb, holding the stick as if it were an

89.4 kilometers, it was time to jettison the second stage, but I was going over seventy-two hundred kilometers per hour, and the projected periapsis was looking better and better. \u00A0I was nearly horizontal now at 90 km, heading almost exactly north, both apoapsis and periapsis increasing and I\u0027m sailing along at 8300 kmh. \u00A0Within seconds, my apoapsis was projected at 113

burning for 74,000!\u0022 I announced. \u00A0I burned for thirty-five seconds and finally used all the fuel in the third stage with the periapsis showing 160 km. \u00A0Now down to the last tank and requiring a burn to come down any further, mission rules stated that the mission was effectively over. \u00A0I separated the stages, ignited the last engine, and burned down to 74,000 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, Moho Seven requests circularization burn for 70K. \u00A0Let\u0027s see how close we can get to the speed record.\u0022 \u00A0We still hadn\u0027t broken the 2500 m/s speed record, and the closer we get to the atmosphere, the faster we go. \u00A0After about a minute, Gene came on the line\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Kavy, you know

just over 70 km. \u00A0Despite that, I couldn\u0027t get any faster than 2302 m/s, so that was a disappointment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, this is Moho Seven. \u00A0I guess 2500 isn\u0027t going to be broken on this flight, so I\u0027m coming home.\u0022 \u00A0I readied the final reentry burn with 25,366 meters as the initial reentry

ahead for the final reentry burn. \u00A0When it was over, I was down to the last third of my fuel in the last remaining tank. \u00A0I separated the engine, and reentered the upper layer of the atmosphere just coming over the southern ice cap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, this is Moho Seven.

Training.\u0022 \u00A0Upgrades were completed on Mission Control, and research into advanced forms of flight control began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first mission was undesignated, a satellite to examines Kerbin\u0027s magnetic fields, this was tucked in between a pair of research flights. \u00A0To accomodate the new astronauts we anticipated, work was begun on the astronaut complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor several months, communication satellites were both launched and deorbited, the newer models being much more efficient. \u00A0Upgrades were made to the launch pad to accomodate the larger rockets we expected to use to the Twinkie missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Day 320 of Year 1651, we met our newest seven astronauts. \u00A0As a pilot myself, it was a bit of a pill to swallow, but the fact remains that it was easier to train a top engineer to be a pilot than it was to train a pilot to be a top engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever mind that as a test pilot is essentially an engineer with a pilot\u0027s certificate, we were now looking at engineering and scientific specialists - the ones that have contributed original knowledge to their fields, and that weren\u0027t nearly as infatuated with flying as the seven of us had been. \u00A0Only one new test pilot would be brought on, the other six would be engineers and scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob and Bill had seen the writing on the wall, shrugged, and volunteered themselves for flight duty. \u00A0They had already participated in several flights with Jeb when the three of them were \u0022just those wild kids that were going to get themselves killed one of these days,\u0022 but now they were getting more serious with the flight training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, the new astronauts were Dr. Bartory Kermin - Electrical Engineering, Dr. Jenny Kemen - Aerospace Engineering, Dr. Chadzor Kerpitt - Computer Engineering, \u00A0Dr. Neal Kernaal - Aerospace Engineering, Camorin Kerlong - Aerospace and Bioengineering, \u00A0Dr. Andi Kermol - Astrophysics and Kerbophysics, and our lone test

of us would have to be responsible for \u00A0monitoring the coordination, scheduling, and control of the astronauts training. \u00A0Tom was the unanimous choice, which he reluctantly agreed to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027ll be a while before we actually do anything, so I\u0027m not going to do anything with regards to the flight schedules. \u00A0But I will promise you that I\u0027ll be selecting the crews for the Mun flights - whenever that is - by how you perform while we\u0027re getting through NBTPT and Project Twinkie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the fifteen of us were running and flying around, training, and working our butts off trying to impress Thomas for the first Twinkie flight, the engineering and operations departments were continuing the unkerballed project that was moving from simple communications satellites to exploration probes. \u00A0 PPP-1 (Planetary Probe Project) would a communications satellite launch of a Tipan III rocket. \u00A0It was scheduled for Day 323 and we all got up early to see it rise majestically into the air...and die powerless and without

Space Center was also changing. \u00A0Improvements were completed on the Astronaut Complex, the aircraft hangar, and the administration building. \u00A0By the time they were finished, the Astronaut Complex had been made into a four-story training complex complete with living accommodations for forty astronauts, a full physical training center, medical facilities and enough educational activities to serve as a small university. \u00A0In fact, we now offered a distance education degree in space and aeronautical studies. \u00A0I was now working on getting my masters degree in the subject - on the six year plan, while also creating physics lessons plans and grading papers. \u00A0I also spend a good portion of my time training the new scientists and engineers how to fly planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the year nearly over, I flew one research flight out to the far north, out to the Goldstone mountains and ran some laser surface scan tests. \u00A0Bob and Bertoly followed with flights of their own. \u00A0We ran a test of a potential munar landing \u0022capsule,\u0022 really just a very basic cylinder with a window and the capacity to be pressurized. \u00A0Thomas wound up with a bad case of the bends as a result of that. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of that episode, the flight rotation was altered. \u00A0Thomas would fly the fourth Twinkie flight not the third. \u00A0Though we hadn\u0027t gotten a decision on what we\u0027d be doing exactly, we did get the flight rotation. \u00A0 Jeb and Bill would fly the first flight, Able and Bertory would fly next. \u00A0Rik and Chadzor would step out of their backup role to fly the third flight. \u00A0Thomas and Jenny would fly fourth flight, with Camorin and I backing them up. \u00A0Valentina and Neal would take the fifth flight. \u00A0My flight would be sixth, with Camorin along as my engineer. \u00A0Elliot and Andi would be seventh, and Dan and Bob would fly the final

project.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And we did make a decision on how we will get to the Mun,\u0022 said Gene, who had overheard and dropped in. \u00A0\u0022Or at least we narrowed it down. \u00A0You\u0027ll either be flying there directly or by Munar Orbit rendezvous, and we\u0027ll be sending you up in groups of three. \u00A0It\u0027s going to depend on how well Project Twinkie goes. \u00A0If we are still bumbling around up there by Twinkie Eight, well, it will be some time before we are ready to send you into deep space. \u00A0If the administration likes what it sees, we

Minmus,\u0027 since we\u0027re going to be doing both, one right after the other. \u00A0Administration thought it would be wise to \u0027secure\u0027 our sphere of influence. \u00A0But if we mirror everything we do on Minmus with what we have planned for the Mun, I\u0027d say at least fourteen flights altogether.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was excited at this, but only a little. \u00A0There was so much that could happen in the meantime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe training of the new seven astronauts was going well, and we found that we actually had more and more leisure time. \u00A0The trade off is that we also found ourselves in the public eye more often. \u00A0With our celebrity growing by the day, we would often find ourselves the subject of curious stares and being greeted by name by people we had never seen. \u00A0It\u0027s not a bad experience if you\u0027re used to it, but it was pretty unsettling for the rookies. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne day, just before they did a couple of research flights. \u00A0Val and I went to Kerbin City with Camorin and Neal to catch a stickball game. \u00A0Val was curious about, but unfamiliar with the game; my last job involved familiarizing myself with several sport in order to not look like a complete nitwit to anyone who might call in. \u00A0Camorin had actually played some in the university, so to have him along made things even better. \u00A0We made a point to grab upper grandstand seats along the third bag line, hoping to be somewhat anonymous...and we heard the whispers shortly after entering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is that who I think it is?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think that girl with the

settling in, Cam proved to be an outstanding teacher of the game. \u00A0\u0022Now you see how the outfielders have shifted to the left, towards us. \u00A0They are expecting the batsman to hit the ball to the left side of the field.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But couldn\u0027t he hit it straight between first and second along the

probes to launch and we would be getting on with Project Twinkie. \u00A0The launch pad had been upgraded to a massive launch complex, ready to handle the most massive rockets, and further research brought technological advancements in propulsion and construction. \u00A0As the year 1651 ended, we were more than ready to start going again. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

still discussion over what capsule we should use. \u00A0Two companies had come forward with capsules designed for two Kerbals. \u00A0One being tested was the Corvus by Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products. \u00A0They seemed to be staking the reputation of the company on the capsule they were offering, since as you can surely guess by their name, this project was just a bit outside their comfort zone. \u00A0The other one was the K2 Command Pod by Castor-Pollux Industries. \u00A0Castor-Pollux had more experience, but I have to admit that I liked the sleek lines of what the Corvus offered. \u00A0Both would have the astronauts sitting side by side, and there was a little room to move around - but only just. \u00A0We did eventually settle on Corvus - and I have to think
