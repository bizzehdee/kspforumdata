Yep, it\u0027s completely hands off. Just run the program from the pad and the rocket flys and comes back by itself. The colored lines are one of the newer features of kOS and are vectors that it\u0027s using and I wanted to see.\n\nAnd I think the mod you\u0027re talking about is [Flight Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80292). You\u0027re right, that looks really interesting and I\u0027ll try it out to see if it works well with kOS ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:44:38Z","Content":"Yup, that would be it.
