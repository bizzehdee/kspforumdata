It\u0027s not going to be terribly image intensive because I was too busy biting my nails to take a lot of screenshots, but I had to share. Edit: Maybe I should have put this in Mission Reports? I didn\u0027t see that before I posted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter making one final run to the Mun to drop off a solar array for the new outpost, the Storm MK II returned to the SSS Orbital Tanker Station for a minor refit for its most important mission yet, and assumed the name KSS Maverick. It was time to rescue Bill from Duna after him being stranded there for over a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Jeb, how\u0027s she looking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Looking great. All systems nominal. The tanks are topped off and Geneton is all settled in the lander. You should really think about upgrading that station so they don\u0027t have to send you a refill every time I come by. It wasn\u0027t so bad before that empty fuel tank knocked out Section 3, I tried to tell those guys to drop them before circularizing. We are a bit nervous but Bill is our priority and I think Gen\u0027s got enough parachutes on that rig to land on the Mun dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Um, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d try that -- You know what, nevermind.

Starting circularization. The ascending node is pretty far off from the SSS Station, I don\u0027t know if we will have enough fuel to correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Home never looked so good! I don\u0027t care how you take us in, just put me on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Circularization complete. 365 units of fuel left. ...Settle in for a minute, I think I can rendezvous with the SSS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-01-1022-06-09-64.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-01-1022-06-09-64.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Intercept established, but the tanks are almost dry.

I think the Maverick itself was the only part of that mission I can be proud of, and only because it\u0027s been extensively tested. That was its first interplanetary mission though. MechJeb helped out a bit for plotting \u0022efficient\u0022 courses in Kerbol SOI which had to be manually corrected anyway, the longer burns, and for the Smart A.S.S. feature. Autoland/ascent/rendezvous/dock were NOT used, what fun would that have been? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Only other mod of note was the Docking Alignment Indicator by Navyfish which has proved to be invaluable. No quickloads were used that I recall. Hope someone was amused by it, I know it was fun for me.
