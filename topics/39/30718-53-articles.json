The ground rippled and for a fleeting instant Enely sensed the dry chasms beneath, dark and impenetrable.

You\u2019d need to talk to one of the high-ups at the Kerbin Space Agency. Or somebody from the old Interplanetary Society maybe.

To hear Enely talk, Jonton knows everyone from President Obrick on down. Although - maybe Enely could help us himself. He knows one of the senior people at the Berelgan and they\u2019ve been doing quite a bit of work for the KSA. I\u2019ll ask him to speak to Professor Erlin for you.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe new clover strains are good - much hardier than the standard soil improver types that most Groves use - but they\u2019re still plants. So we\u2019re experimenting with tougher organisms: algae, cyanobacteria, lichens, things that\u2019ll grow almost anywhere. We\u2019re hoping they\u2019ll grow on the surface, fix nitrogen for us and break down the regolith into useful compounds whilst they\u2019re at it.\u201D Erlin twisted his fingers together. \u201CAnyway, we\u2019re not here to talk about Dunan botany.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan regarded him over the rim of his coffee mug. \u201CNo indeed. Nothing so commonplace. Frankly, Professor, even knowing something of the background to this matter, it seems\u2026 less than plausible and were it not for a remarkably testy communique from President Obrick\u2019s office, I would not be sitting here this afternoon. I don\u2019t suppose you can tell us why this\u2026Elton is so keen to speak to Jebediah?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause Elton knows about Starseed. And for what it\u2019s worth he supports it. But according to Enely Kermol - one of the group responsible for his Awakening,\u201D Erlin added, seeing Lodan\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201CAccording to Enely, he doesn\u2019t know anything about spaceflight and that concerns him. Why he was so keen to speak to Jebediah and not any other kerbonaut, I couldn\u2019t say.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded and glanced at the clock on his mantelpiece. Right on time there was a knock at the door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb walked into the room, followed by Geneney. The kerbonaut and the flight director both stared at Erlin curiously. Lodan stood up to greet them, his eyes meeting Geneney\u2019s for a second. \u201CAh, Jebediah and Geneney. Take a seat and join us please. Allow me to introduce Professor Erlin from the Berelgan Institute. Professor, allow me to introduce Jebediah and Geneney Kerman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho need no further introduction,\u201D said Erlin with a smile. \u201CIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you both.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd likewise to meet you, Professor,\u201D said Geneney, accepting a mug of coffee from Lodan. \u201CWhat can we do for the Berelgan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin steepled his fingers and looked at them thoughtfully. \u201CI need you to talk to a friend for me,\u201D he replied at last. \u201CA friend who\u2019s very keen to learn about spaceflight and has requested a meeting with Jebediah. Although I\u2019m sure he would be more than happy to speak to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s chief flight director too,\u201D he added politely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney exchanged looks with Jeb before his gaze settled on Lodan. The other nodded minutely, a hint of steel in his expression. \u201CI can\u2019t speak for Jeb,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut your friend would be very welcome to take a tour of the Space Centre and I\u2019m sure I could find some time for a meeting. However, I think there\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling us, Professor.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere is,\u201D Erlin agreed. \u201CAnd I\u2019m afraid my friend would find it quite impossible to accept your kind offer of a tour, although I might be tempted to take it for him. You see - my friend is a Kerm.\u201D He watched Geneney\u2019s face, trying to ignore Jeb\u2019s incredulous snort. \u201CPerhaps I\u2019d better start from the beginning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney took a seat. \u201CI think,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat would be a good idea.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA suitably abridged version if you please, Professor,\u201D said Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNaturally,\u201D said Erlin. \u201CQuite apart from anything else, much of it I only have at second hand from various associates of my friend, although I\u2019ve come to trust them implicitly.\u201D He took a sip of coffee. \u201CYou will of course have heard of Jonton Kermol, the so-called Sage of Barkton.\u201D He sketched out Jonton\u2019s background: the discovery of the Kerm seed in his Grove, the events leading up to his an-Kerm transformation and his realisation that the an-Kerm could hold the key to resolving the Kerm crisis. Jeb listened to the unfolding story in mounting disbelief at the description of Elton\u2019s Awakening and rise to sapience, followed by Jonelle\u2019s disastrous Awakening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Erlin finished his summary and leaned back in his chair, Jeb stared at him. \u201CSo let me get this straight. There was a plan for saving the world. All it needed was a mass lawbreaking and thousands of volunteers willing to spend the rest of their lives as part of a Kerm tree. Then I suppose we kept our fingers crossed that enough of those volunteers survived the process without dying or going insane. And now you want me to get involved with this madness?\u201D He stood up. \u201CNo thank you. I may be crazy but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease sit down, Jebediah,\u201D Lodan said quietly. \u201CI think we can safely assume that that plan has been put on hold until we better understand the Awakening process. Since Guardian Elton now wishes to learn more about Project Starseed, I can only assume that he\u2019s come to the same conclusion. In which case it would be prudent to grant his request on behalf of the KSA.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb laughed derisively. \u201CBetter pick a KSA employee then instead of a pensioned-off former kerbonaut. What happens if this Kerm mistakes me for a soldier and decides to run me through with its stingers. No thank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EHis\u003C/em\u003E healing vines,\u201D said Erlin patiently. \u201CI\u2019ve spoken to Elton myself and believe me\u2026\u201D Erlin paused. \u201CLet me put it another way. Elton has lived on this planet since before our ancestors mastered fire. I have seen this because I\u2019ve Communed with him and shared his memories. There is nothing you could say or do that would either surprise him or compel him to such an action. Please, Jebediah. I don\u2019t know why he wants to speak to you but I beg you to go to him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe came in peace for Kerm and kerbal,\u201D Geneney said softly. Jeb\u2019s head whipped round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s unfair, Gene!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes it is,\u201D said Geneney, \u201CWe\u2019re in an unfair business, Jeb and we\u2019ve always known that. Everything we do has to be done right first time or someone pays the price - and Kerm knows we\u2019ve found \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E out the hard way.\u201D He stood up and gripped Jeb\u2019s shoulders. \u201CI\u2019m coming with you old friend. We\u2019ll take a trip out to that Grove, maybe talk things over on the way - and if you\u2019re still worried about talking to this Guardian Elton?\u201D Geneney shrugged. \u201CWell he\u2019ll just have to make do with a flight director and one-time sub-orbital joyrider instead of a M\u00FCnwalker.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney let go of Jeb\u2019s shoulders. \u201COr if you\u2019re really set against this, I\u2019ll go by myself. Because somebody needs to, Jeb. I\u2019ve watched the news too - and as far as I can see it mostly boils down to people fighting over what they think the Kerm want.\u201D He stepped back, silhouetted against the late afternoon sun pouring through Lodan\u2019s office window. \u201CMaybe one of us needs to ask one them what they \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E want.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lines of headlights stretched for kilometres, cars and goods vehicles alike queueing up to join the main highway out of Barkton. The occasional horn blared in the dark, protesting, Jeb presumed, a driver taking unduly long to move forward another metre. He popped the top on a can of sapwood and handed it to Geneney. \u201CWe\u2019d have been quicker walking to this Grove.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded glumly. \u201CI didn\u2019t think it would be so bad at night. Hope they have a phone at the checkpoint so I can give this Patbro fellow a call.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re taking all this seriously then?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a lot to swallow,\u0022 Geneney agreed, \u0022but Professor Erlin was about this far from dropping to his knees in front of you and I\u0027ve never known Lodan to have much tolerance for storytelling on that scale.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother horn blared nearby, followed by a sullen crump and the tinkle of metal on asphalt. The sound of slamming doors and angry voices escalated to the noise of breaking glass and the thudding clang of metal against metal. Geneney reached for his door handle but looked at Jeb\u2019s withdrawn expression and thought better of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden glare filled the inside of the car followed by a protracted horn blast. Muttering under his breath, Geneney lifted his foot from the brake, letting them roll forward another car length. \u0022For the love of the first Grove!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked up. \u0022Why me, Gene. What does it want with me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney raised his eyebrows. \u0022Apart from the obvious you mean? I can\u0027t imagine why anyone wanting to learn about spaceflight would want to talk to the first kerbal in space or the first one to walk on the Mun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stared out of the window. \u0022That was a long time ago.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shook his head. \u0022Not that long ago, Jeb. Which reminds me - did you ever have any more thoughts about rejoining the roster?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not really,\u0022 said Jeb. \u0022Doesn\u0027t seem much point any more. Crewed program is dead after Pioneer 8 and that\u0027s not launching any time soon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney couldn\u0027t argue with that. \u0022At least Bill will get his flight,\u0022 he said. \u0022Kerm knows he\u0027s been waiting long enough. And you never know - maybe Elton can jab a few vines up some bureaucratic backsides and get things moving.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gave him a morose look. \u0022Well now I know its all over,\u0022 he said. \u0022Flight director Geneney Kerman hoping for a tree to save the mission. A tree talking to a washed-up kerbonaut whilst the world burns. Yeah - just what we need.\u0022 He closed his eyes. \u0022You got any tunes in this wagon?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tapes are in the side tray,\u0022 said Geneney evenly. \u0022but you won\u0027t find much unless you\u0027re in the mood for light opera or Spierkan marching bands. Winding Road is pretty easy listening for Spierkan pipe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ve been spending too much time with the tracking crews,\u0022 said Jeb, rummaging through Geneney\u0027s stack of cassettes. He squinted at one cassette box which depicted a trio of implausibly coloured kerbals posing in front of an equally implausibly coloured desert scene. \u00A0\u0022What in the Blight is a rainbow steelsnare?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney coughed. \u0022They\u0027re... a bit experimental,\u0022 he said. \u0022Not really your standard pipe band.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d call that a plus then,\u0022 said Jeb, flipping open the box and slotting the cassette into the tape player, which promptly emitted a warbling electronic tone followed by a blare of truck horns. For a second Jeb assumed this was due to another angry driver but then the horns segued into a syncopated drumbeat overlaid with some remarkably up-tempo piping. The mournful drone that Jeb associated with Spierkan pipes was still very much present but seemed to want to wander off into a panoply of other sound effects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb glanced at Geneney\u0027s set jaw. \u0022They\u0027re different,\u0022 he conceded. \u0022Winding Road it is then.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFloodlights lit the roadside in a harsh white glare. A steel girder on a chain loomed out of the night, the rest of the crane hidden by the dazzle. The harsh clatter of pneumatic drills drowned out the noise from a road roller as it crawled past behind a line of temporary bollards. Following the emphatic gestures from a uniformed kerbal, Geneney changed lane and pulled up in front of a heavy steel barrier. Overhead, translucent sheeting diffused the worst of the floodlight glare into a stark uniform whiteness that bleached the colour out of everything around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney wound down his window. A flicker of recognition crossed the guard\u0027s face as he caught sight of Jeb but was quickly hidden behind a professionally impassive stare. \u0022Good evening, sirs. Please unlock your motor and luggage compartments then step out of your vehicle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Certainly.\u0022 Geneney reached under his dashboard and pulled a toggle. A second guard stepped forward, lifted the bonnet and poked a long handled tool inside. \u00A0No sooner were Jeb and Geneney out of the car than the first guard had beckoned an inspection team forward. One kerbal slid a flatbed trolley underneath it, her partner peering intently into an angled mirror mounted on one end. Another opened the rear motor compartment and began poking around inside. Others began removing the interior panels from the passenger door.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a brief consultation with the first guard, Geneney set off in search of a telephone booth, leaving Jeb to oversee the systematic dismantling of his car. Their travel bags were removed, upended over a tarpaulin and repacked. Geneney\u0027s tape collection was spread out over a nearby bench, one of the inspectors shaking his head at the Rainbow Steelsnare box, much to Jeb\u0027s inward amusement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Geneney returned, the inspection team were busy refitting upholstery panels to his car doors. He frowned at Jeb. \u0022Being a bit thorough aren\u0027t they?\u0022 He watched his car being put back together for a moment. \u0022Managed to reach Patbro. Sounds like plenty of folks from the Grove have been caught up in the inspections too, so he wasn\u0027t surprised that we\u0027re running late. He sounded like a nice old guy actually; gave me directions for when we get to the Grove and asked if we\u0027d eaten or if we\u0027d need anything when we arrived.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shrugged. \u0022Depends how long that lot take.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inspection wore on and Geneney was starting to consider pulling out his KSA pass and having a quiet word with one of the guards, when there was a sudden flurry of activity around his car. The camera trolley was towed out from under the front motor compartment, the bonnet slammed shut and one of the guards approached them, clipboard in hand. \u0022Your vehicle is clean, sir. Destination and nature of your business please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Visiting a friend in one of the outer Groves,\u0022 Geneney replied. \u0022We don\u0027t expect to be out of town for more than a couple of days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, sir. Please be aware that you will be required to submit to further seed checks before re-entering Barkton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood,\u0022 said Geneney, slipping into the driver\u0027s seat and sliding it forward. \u0022All set, Jeb?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For the last thirty minutes. Let\u0027s go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from a slow trickle of traffic leaving the checkpoint, the highway out of town was almost empty and the Barkton suburbs soon gave way to open fields speckled with lights from nearby Groves. Away from the highway, the roads became much narrower, trees looming out of the shadows on either side, lit only sparingly by the car headlights. After a brief detour and a stop on the verge to consult their map, Geneney was thankful to find a turning he recognised. Presently the forest began to thin out and streetlights began to appear again by the side of the road. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemembering Patbro\u0027s advice, Geneney took a turn to the right, skirting around the village proper before parking at the foot of a shallow hill that led up to the biggest tree he\u0027d seen in his life. The full M\u00FCn shone through it\u2019s branches, catching the elaborate, multi-story kermol hut wrapped around its trunk, with a flat, pale glow. Jeb stared into the shadows wreathing the hut\u0027s lower tier and shivered. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sensed his disquiet. \u201CEverything alright, Jeb?\u201D he murmured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his head. \u201CNever did like Kerm much as a kerblet. The way their branches rustle without any wind always gave me the creeps. Our Keeper too. Looking back he was just a harmless old kerb who\u0027d been living on his own too long, but when I was young\u2026\u201D Jeb shivered again. \u201CYeah.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s a big spooky Kerm,\u201D Geneney agreed, \u201CEspecially in the m\u00FCnlight. Come on - lets get inside.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah Kerman?\u0022 Patbro couldn\u0027t quite keep the awe out of his voice. \u0022And you must be Geneney Kerman. Preserve me but...\u0022 He shook his head. \u0022Look at me, standing here like a starstruck kerblet. Please - come inside.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s nose wrinkled as he walked into the spotless kitchen. Patbro looked puzzled and then his brow cleared. \u0022The cinnamon? Stronger than a normal Kerm I know but you get used to it. Can I get you anything before we go through?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney smiled. \u0022We\u0027re fine but thank you. The traffic out of Barkton was slow so we had plenty of time to eat on the way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro scowled. \u0022Those ridiculous border searches! It\u0027s bad enough getting out of Barkton but getting anything into Barkton is a blighted sight worse. White bean harvest from my Grove was held at the border for nearly a day. If one of the drivers hadn\u0027t told them to try using a roll of fencing wire as a sieve, they\u0027d probably be there now picking through the blighted beans for Kerm seeds!\u0022 He sighed. \u0022Anyhow, you\u0027re not here to listen to my problems. We\u0027d better go through and introduce Jebediah to Elton - begging your pardon but I don\u0027t think he was expecting two of you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think your problems are going to be everyone\u0027s problems,\u0022 Geneney said quietly. \u0022But yes, Professor Erlin was very clear that Guardian Elton wanted to speak to Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro nodded and led them through to Jonton\u0027s sleep room. Geneney looked around in surprise at the rows of bunk beds secured to the walls. Jeb just stared at the empty room and the massive Kerm trunk that made up one wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Any bed will do,\u0022 said Patbro. \u0022Elton won\u0027t mind which leaves you use.\u0022 He gestured at a pair of kitchen chairs beside a crisply made bed. \u0022Geneney and I will wait here for you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022Those sack chairs look fine after being cooped up in the car for so long. I\u0027ll just park myself beside Jeb\u0027s bunk. That Twelve Riders duvet looks just right for you, Jeb,\u0022 he added.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA stricken look crossed Patbro\u0027s face. \u0022Not that one if you don\u0027t mind,\u0022 he said, summoning up a wan smile. \u0022Although maybe Joenie wouldn\u0027t mind lending her favourite bedspread to Jebediah Kerman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb started towards one bunk before stopping and looking at the one beside it. \u0022I\u0027m not so sure about this, Gene,\u0022 he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney saw the astonishment on Patbro\u0027s face and shot him a warning look. \u0022It\u0027ll be fine, Jeb,\u0022 he said gently. \u0022C\u0027mon - kerbals have been Communing with Kerm for centuries.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They were Keepers though,\u0022 muttered Jeb. \u0022That\u0027s different.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro cleared his throat. \u0022Not all of them,\u0022 he said. \u0022Not by a long way. A lot of people came to speak to Jonton back when he was the Sage of Barkton and almost none of them were Keepers. Besides, as Elton could tell you, Keepers haven\u0027t been around forever - far from it.\u0022 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb glanced at Geneney, who did his best to look reassuring. Squaring his shoulders he strode towards the nearest bunk and lay down on it. \u0022Now what?\u0022 he demanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You need to lift your head into the leaf cluster and keep it there,\u0022 said Patbro. \u0022Propping a spare pillow under your neck helps a lot. The leaves make the mental contact with you. You haven\u0027t Communed before so they\u0027ll probably need to be quite insistent and may be rather uncomfortable to begin with. After that, it\u0027s all up to Elton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb picked up a pillow and held it against his chest, staring fixedly at the leaf cluster suspended above him. Then he jerked his head up and whipped the pillow under his neck, clenching his toes against the prickling, squirming sensation crawling across his scalp. He sensed a sudden vastness yawning all around him and then all was light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETwo grieving minds touch. One, with a friend lost to the space programme, fearful of the Kerm. One, with a friend lost to the Kerm, fearful for the space programme. Images appear: a kerbal in a wingless, skeletal flying machine, a motionless kerbal on a bed, her head swathed in Kerm leaves.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETwo grieving minds touch in a boiling foam of memory, a torrent of unleashed emotion.

It is right to want\u003C/em\u003E permission \u003Cem\u003Eto feel sadness. And with affirmation comes understanding. This will be no instant cure. There will be many more steps to take.

We shouldn\u0027t keep Genie and Patbro awake for too long, so the details can wait for tomorrow, but I can give you a summary now?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;that would be acceptable\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb began by outlining the earliest days of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society: Wernher\u0027s LV-1 prototype rocket engine, his own final year project and acrimonious departure from the Institute, culminating in the launch of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s first proper sounding rocket powered by their new LV-5 engine. Through Jeb\u0027s memories, Elton witnessed the LV-10 disaster, the struggle and ultimate failure to develop clustered engines for a crewed rocket, and a steadily dwindling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, even as their plans for the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E reached fruition. He watched a succession of test flights flicker past, all ending in one catastrophic failure after another, all etched bright in Jeb\u0027s memory. Finally, he saw a pair of bright orange parachutes unfurling in the skies and felt the, still undiminished, exultation of a successful test flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney watched Jeb stiffen, back arching as the Kerm leaves touched his head. Then, to his great relief, Jeb relaxed, one arm drooping over the side of his bed. Patbro levered himself out of his sack chair and placed Jeb\u0027s hands gently atop his chest. \u0022Stops them going numb,\u0022 he explained. \u0022Happened to me once - wasn\u0027t much fun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a long wait. Patbro went through to the kitchen and presently the smell of fresh coffee drifted through to the sleep chamber. Geneney yawned and then clapped a hand over his mouth in surprise. For the first time in far, far too long, a familiar grin was lighting up Jebediah Kerman\u0027s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun rose over a most unlikely rocket ship standing on its launch pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton sensed Jeb\u0027s hidden trepidation atop a rickety launch tower, heard his banter with Bill and Bob, shared the brief claustrophobia of three fledgling kerbonauts wedged into an impossibly small capsule. With new understanding he listened to the conversation with \u0027Control\u0027 and felt the rocket come alive around him, before surrendering to the primal release of energies and raw emotions as the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E blasted into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then Elton found himself looking over another kerbonaut\u0027s shoulder through a tiny round window.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u003Cem\u003Ewhat is\u003C/em\u003E that?\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then he \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u2019s memories tumbled around him and the mindscape reeled, scoured by blazing rocket fire that blew apart grey thoughts and lit the caverns beneath. Patches of char exploded skyward and were instantly incinerated. Kerm sparks gambolled around the brilliant motes, swooping and diving, soaring over the transfigured fields of thought below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro\u2019s jaw dropped. All around him, Elton\u2019s leaf clusters splayed wide open. Along his branches twigs flexed and rustled, leaves standing on end, springing away from one another as if charged by some inner electricity. Geneney looked up in alarm at the suddenly creaking ceiling, its supporting branches flexing and groaning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh you\u0027ve not seen\u003C/em\u003E anything \u003Cem\u003Eyet!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view from an open door, winding queues of figures stretching down the road. The bustle and clamour of kerbals in their dozens and then their hundreds, putting up new buildings, making more rocket parts and other strange new machines. A car on a dusty hilltop, a ball growing vines and making a strange beeping sound. Crowds of kerbals in a field watching the new rockets fly. An oddly shaped capsule - too small for any kerbal - on the end of a single parachute. Elton saw them all, felt the growing excitement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen came the pictures. Mere memories of images, rippled as if seen through thick glass, although Elton could still perceive the curved edge of a blurry blue and white ball set against utter blackness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThose were from our Kerbin 2 satellite\u003C/em\u003E, said Jeb. \u003Cem\u003EThe satellite was spinning so they\u0027re not very good but they were enough.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;enough for what?\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEnough to make us think we could send kerbals into space and bring them safely home.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;and Patbro said that you were the first kerbal to make such a journey\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI was,\u003C/em\u003E said Jeb. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s a long story but...\u003C/em\u003E He stopped at the wave of amusement rolling through his link to Elton.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I am sorry, Jebediah.

Finally, there was blackness. With a twist of perspective, Elton found himself racing the very edge of the night, soaring over a landscape of greens and blues and whites that glowed with its own numinous light. Some of that light he knew, was imparted by Jebediah\u0027s lasting memory of his journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut most of it was not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuffeted and spun by the waves of emotion pouring down the link, Jeb clung desperately to his mental image of Kerbin seen from space. \u003Cem\u003EKerm... knows what...he\u0027s going to do...about the next ones.\u003C/em\u003E The waves receded, diminished by a rising surge of excitement and curiosity, lifting Jeb high above the mindscape.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;there is\u003C/em\u003E more, \u003Cem\u003EJebediah?\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYep.

Four gleaming petals swung open to reveal an ungainly looking machine, its spindly legs folded up its sides. Thrusters fired with a clatter of solenoids, pulling the lander free.

That turnaround point, that spark of hope that the good guys might be getting themselves back in the game. The chapter was originally going to be more focused on Lodan (essentially picking up the closing section of the chapter and running with it) but, as I said, I\u0027ve had that \u0027Two Jebediahs\u0027 idea kicking around in my head for quite a while and the more I thought about, the more I figured\u00A0that now was the time to get it out of my head and into the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, the two Jebediahs idea also started off as a bit of\u00A0a throwaway -\u00A0I just\u00A0thought it would be interesting to give Jeb an illustrious namesake.\u00A0Then, later in the story, when Jeb\u0027s life went the way it did, I figured that getting him to \u003Cem\u003Emeet\u003C/em\u003E his namesake and learning that this great historical figure\u00A0also suffered from depression, would be the turnaround point in\u00A0his own inner battle. Then, when I actually got to writing that scene, it occurred to me that Jeb\u0027s current issues were very similar to Elton\u0027s, which in turn gave me\u00A0a nice lead into that part of the chapter and also saved a lot of dialogue. In many ways, Jeb and Elton were kindred spirits and Communion allowed them to \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E that very quickly. Finally, the meeting between Jeb and Elton was an opportune moment for\u00A0Elton to really see what\u0027s at stake with the Kerm crisis\u00A0- and\u00A0to learn some pretty important lessons about kerbals\u00A0 that may have a bearing on his future story arc.... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that gave me the outline of the chapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EHoary old clich\u00E9 number 2 - write what you know.

That\u0027s coloured a lot of my telling of Jeb\u0027s story and especially Geneney\u0027s part in it, and also Lodan\u0027s. They\u0027ve both given Jeb a lot of leeway and support and most importantly, have been wise enough to know that \u0027snap out of it!\u0027 isn\u0027t a helpful or appropriate way of dealing with his troubles. All of which helped me figure out the interactions between Jeb and Geneney on their mini road trip out to Elton\u0027s Grove and make that journey a real part of the chapter.

This can be incredibly helpful. In the last chapter as originally planned, Lodan was going to stand up and be counted, just because \u003Cem\u003Esomebody\u003C/em\u003E needed to do it. Then (much to my surprise) I realized that I\u0027d given myself a decent hook for this plot turn many, many chapters ago, in the form of a couple of Special Orders as granted by the Council of Twelve Pillars.
