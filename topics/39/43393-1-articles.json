It is about 150 km wide, and extends all the way to up to where the Continent Begins. It has an archipelago near it\u0027s SouthEast coast. Split thru the middle of the country is the C7 Mountain Range, which is where The Highest point in the USK makes it\u0027s home, AKA The Harvester Mountain where legend has it that the first rocket was launched from making an unmanned sub-orbital flight. The Climate is realitivaly warm. It\u0027s position near the equator makes it perfect for space flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe USK was originally a colony state controlled by the United Kerbal Kingdom. It gained it\u0027s independence during the Revolutionary War Of 1776 where Kerbals in the colony state were outraged by the UKK\u0027s Government, taking resources from the colonists, making stuff in the UKK from the resources, then Selling the Products to the colonists for high prices. The young nation then expanded itself to the far west coast. But as all was well States from the west succeeded from the USK sparking a Civil War, in which PresidentKaberaham Lincoln passed the Emancipation Prclaimation, abolishing slavery. The East States won the war, but the President was assinated by a Western Rebel in Kord Theater. What followed was a huge intake of Immigrents from other countrys. Then the world was consumed by war. World War One raveged the world, and after the war the The Spainish Klu killed 3% of the worlds Population. After The Pandemic The Stock Markets crashed, and it seemed that world was doomed. But a new President, Franklin K. Roosivelt stepped into office and helped the nation get back on it\u0027s feet. But evil in the world persisted and a new war, World War K, Saw the Axis Powers consisting of The Kazis, Kapenisse and other countrys fighting against the Allied Powers consisting of The USK, The UKK, And The Koviet Union. The war brought out rocket scientist Werhner Von Kerman, working for The Kazis, making the worlds first missiles the K2. The Kazi Rocket Program was not effective enough and the Allies won once again. Then The USK had a great idea. Recruit the Kazi Rocket Scientists to work in a Space Program. And thus, in 1958, The Kerbal Space Program was Formed. Although the KSP was losing in the space race against the Koviet Union, who had the first Man-Made Object In space and the First Kerbal in space, the KSP continued to aspire to put the first Kerbal On The Mun. But as the space race was heating up, so was the fight to stop the spread of Kommunism. A war was started in Vietkam over the spread of Kommunism, and the USK tryed to help the Nation of South Vietkam Beat The Kommunist Nation Of North Vietkam. The Kerbmerican public hated the war because Kerbals were being drafted in to the Army, Being Sent to Vietkam, and being Injured or even Killed. But in the summer of 1969, the world took it\u0027s eyes off of the war, and turned to the Mun, as KSP landed a Kerbal On The Mun, Jebidaih Kerman become first kerbal to walk on the Mun. The world watched in awe as he spoke after getting off of the ladder \u0022That\u0027s one tiny step for a kerbal, one Giant Leap for Kerbal Kind.\u0022 5 More Times Kerbals landed on the Mun leaving behind footsteps, and storys of one epic adventure. Rocket Scientist Ej_Sa proposed the idea of a reusable rocket design called The Baikal Project. The Craft could fly into space like a rocket, and land on a runway like plane. The Project continued for 30 years before ending. It made numerous satellite deployals, was the key factor in building The Kerbonational Space Station. A new Reuseable design called Project Collins, based off of Baikal, is now in the process of being built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m done, I\u0027ve written to much.

Able to deliver food stuffs, quickly rebuild infrastructure, and move the nation forward, they swept aside the old and replaced them. The launch of a Mun orbiting Kerbal cemented their power in the hearts of the people. Now firmly in the lead of it\u0027s people sweeping changes were made to the electoral process. Education became mandatory and heavily enforced. All members of the government were required before candidacy to prove knowledge and skills in nation leadership and skills in the job they are seeking. want to be in UKEMA (UshraKerbal Emergency Management Agency) you have to have education in emergency response and field experience. You Ciriculum Vitae in that area of experience will be posted right along you name and compared to the CV\u0027s of other candidates.

The new working class, made up of Engineers and workers, faced an ever growing problem in a leadership of thinkers that spent so much time trying to invent new better things without building anything. With almost heretical maneuvering they succeeded in getting a mission to Duna designed, tested and built in a time scale that denied the technocracy to stop it\u0027s launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the span of two years the engineers had managed to get a permanent settlement started. 10 years saw a survivable basis and the first Dunarian births. 10 more years marked the 3 year anniversary of the last resupply mission from ushraKerbal.

The problems were already seeded but this marked the full turning point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna colony, led and populated by the engineer contingent started to call for indepence. Starting with hollow threats of cutting off supply, and following with bribery the home world tried to keep the Duna group under control.

All of it with the strings of continued off world control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Dunarian collective declared independence with the decidedly snarky act of establishing their own orbiting station of Kerbin called \u0027Escape Route\u0027. Now there is an openly hostile peace between the two worlds. immigration in both directions is rampant tho.
