Note that the language deliberately does not restrict it to KSP.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EJebediah realizes something is wrong. When you don\u0027t do the math, this sort of thing can happen. Jebediah\u0027s spaceship is on a one-way mission to a base on our planet\u0027s closest celestial neighbor and now, 1km below him, the dusty grey surface is approaching rapidly.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EWhat Jebediah has just belatedly realized is that his ship lacks adequate fuel to make the descent. In fact, there is nowhere near enough.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EThere is no time to lose. Jebediah powers up his SAS system, and the whir of the capsule\u0027s three reaction wheels ascends to an anxious drone. Once they reach full speed, Jeb twists the attitude control stick and the craft rotates against their angular momentum, lining up the ship\u0027s rocket nozzle against its decent vector. There\u0027s nothing for it now. He punches the gas.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EHydrazine monopropellant hits an Iridium catalyst, and the resulting 800 C fireball blasts tailward. As the ship decelerates, the flame inverts, engulfing the capsule in fire. Jeb holds down the throttle, face distorting under three Gs. The surface is alarmingly close now, and the altimeter is still clicking downward. A loud bang signals the end of the reserves. Jeb floats from his seat in free fall.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EJebediah engages the autostabilizer and opens the hatch. The stars glisten overhead, unobstructed. Lights from the base are visible to the naked eye below. He crawls outside, takes one last look at the ground, and jumps into the void.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003EThe capsule falls away below him, and Jebediah engages his RCS MMU, firing the microthrusters upward. It\u0027s going to be close. Below him, the capsule impacts the surface at 50m/s, throwing debris high in the low gravity. 20m/s, 15m/s, 10m/s, 5m/s, then Jeb lands hard, rolling backwards to soften the blow. After a moment of silence, Jeb stands up. The lights of the base twinkle perhaps 2km distant, but for the moment at least Jeb stands amid the wreckage, still alive.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bengsch85","CreatedById":75728,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T16:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou paint a picture very well with your words!
