Always plan to start the shot a little before you start recording, it helps prevent the split-second normal view problem. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOh, and nice video.

What I loved about this was its simplicity. To me, and im not an arty farty person, was that it felt like a dance, especially when you started to burn up and your solar panels went boom......after that your \u0022arms\u0022 kept dancing to the music which isnt my sort of thing but none the less perfect for this experience.\n\nConstructive criticism though, after the impact the cockpit scene did nothing for me, plus at times the camera was a little shakey.\n\nDO NOT take that to heart......I enjoed watching it and will watch again for sure.\n\nIn a nutshell, a brilliant watch.....have some rep from me for your efforts\n\nEDIT: My apologies friend......RIP Stacy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T18:23:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:03:52Z","Content":"This thread has been relocated to the subforum for player-made vids."}]}
