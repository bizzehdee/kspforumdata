You see, I\u0027ve had this idea for a long time now on what would the KSP community be like if it was an actual building. I can just imagine the guys in \u0022Science Labs\u0022 wearing labcoats working and having discussions underground (something akin to Umbrella corp), the \u0022Engineering\u0022 guys wearing hardhats tinkering with rockets at topside, various \u0022Companies\u0022 having their own booths in a large hall trying to attract prospective clients(Whackjob has his own dedicated wing, Institute of Whackjobian Engineering)...with Vanamonde roaming around in a banana colored suit...etc\n\nMy drawing however, is PATHETIC. So I\u0027m looking forward to your concepts, how you visualize the community through drawing!
