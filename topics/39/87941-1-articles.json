Then, after that, put tissue paper or the like to keep the parachute from burning. The, FIRMLY attach a rubber band, using hot glue or another way that can easily hold 5 times the weight of the rocket, to the inside of the rocket. Finally, attach your parachute WITH strings to the other side of the band. Neatly pack the chute and delicately insert the entire nose assembly into the tube. Make sure to attach the nosecone by rubber band too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is your sag real?

Tissue paper will burn! You might be confusing it with \u0022recovery wadding\u0022, which is chemically treated to resist burning. That\u0027s what you want to use for little rockets.
