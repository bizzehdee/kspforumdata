It doesn\u0027t have real action, it is all about movement, and going nowhere.\n\nI recorded with VLC, which makes smooth capture even on low-end computers. Although mine is more than decent.\n\nedit (for precision):\n\nI did not make a *cinematic* but a *movie*. There is a reason why I choose this particular piece of music, there is a reason the music is synchronized with space apparition and Jool rise, there is a reason why I choose a rotating ship and why the rotation is slowing down all along the movie, there is a reason the ship is slightly misaligned, etc.\n\nI did not just put music on a long scene and call it a day, I took *a lot* of shots before I was satisfied with it, just because the whole thing is supposed to say something.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T06:37:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by H2O.**\n  \nprecision"}]}
