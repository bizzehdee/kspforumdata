It\u0027s Kerbin-War Two, west islands from the base (Where KSC is on present-day Kerbin.). I drag myself onto the beach, rifle ready. \u0022Where the ****\u0027s your squad?\u0022 A sergeant asks me. I can barely hear him over my ears ringing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Dead.\u0022 I say, panting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well come with us! We\u0027re assaulting the harbor to secure it and use it for the capture of the rest of the island!\u0022 He says. \u0022Name, private?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Racker.\u0022 I pant, making sure I\u0027m caught up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There-\u0022 A private stops there, being shot in the chest, his face looking like this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E. I drop to the ground, his scream still in my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Where the **** did they come from?\u0022 A private shouts. \u0022There wasn\u0027t supposed to be any resistance until the harbor!\u0022 The firefight was on, with air suppourt unable to help because of the enemy AA. We\u0027re on our own until the tanks arrive, twenty minutes from now. Wait, when was now? I have no idea. I can only hope. A enemy tank drives RIGHT over my head. I\u0027m lucky to not be crushed. Kerbeneese aircraft fly overhead, trying to keep more boats from launching infantry. I fire at a moving object instinctively. I\u0027m trapped away from the rest of the group because of the gap of cover in between us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Racker! We need to get you across the cover!\u0022 Rar, the sergeant shouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Tanks shoring in two minutes!\u0022 Shouts one of the privates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Covering fire for Racker!\u0022 Shouts the support gunner. He fires his browning at the enemy line, giving me enough time to run crouched to the other side. We ran towards the harbor, another squad on the beach runs to the cover with the same objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks.\u0022 I pant to the support gunner, as we run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0027Welcome.\u0022 he says as we run forwards to the next set of cover while the enemy reloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Tanks beached!\u0022 Shouts the same private. I thought ten minutes had passed. We got close enough to the harbor to see the tangos rushing to their positions, alarms blazing. This area was JUST outside of the AA range. It still wasn\u0027t safe because of the maneuvering range. I was one of the fifty or so lucky ones that reached the wall, and out of the range of the guns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETO BE CONTINUED.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T23:27:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 11:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sesni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding stuff\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T23:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it. Very fast-paced as a battle should be, and mostly easy to follow. It plunks us right into the action, which is just fine for creating the confusion that would be present in your average green (lol) combatant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that I prefer the past tense to the vivid present, however. War stories are typically told after the fact rather than as they\u0027re happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what it really needs is some backstory. Why are Kerbals fighting a battle? What is their equipment like? Do the grunts even know what taking their objective will get them? Almost anybody can write a \u0022storming the beaches\u0022 scene. But to write a unique Kerbalized KWII story can add a lot of richness to the current era of KSP, explaining part of Kerbin\u0027s history and why Kerbal society is dominated by a lust for space (and boosters). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing: Is cursing allowed on these boards?
