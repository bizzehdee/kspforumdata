Let me introduce you the...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVendela System\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/selm39.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022selm39.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVendela\u003C/strong\u003E is the neighbor Star of Kerbol. Is a Star with a noticeable Cyan color. Much more energetic and hot than our home Star. With a diameter of three times Kerbol, is not that big, is just that Kerbol is by definition a Brown Dwarf Star. Vendela is an intermediate A-F type in the HR-Diagram, class I Orion subtype. With a surface temperature of 13.000k. By real life standards, is as big as our sun but 60 times less massive. Since Vendela is so big and brillant in comparison to Kerbin, solar panels and solar salis excels as propulsion method here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVendela System as today:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/f3w8w5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f3w8w5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVendela presents somewhat unique challenges. Upon arrival to Vendela, the first planet closest to it is \u003Cstrong\u003EOrgol\u003C/strong\u003E, who is quite far away from it, orbiting a distance similar to Dres (36.000.000kms). Of course a Star so big is VERY difficult to get close to, and a visit to a local gas giant is somewhat mandatory when fooling around here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was saying, the first planet in the Vendela System is \u003Cstrong\u003EOrgol\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi44.tinypic.com/jjpkjp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jjpkjp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrgol is an oceanic planet with somewhat unique feats. Similar in size to Eve and Kerbin, the gravity here is similar to Kerbin\u0027s as well. The most noticeable feature is that Orgol is deeply black. Is so dark and non-reflective that even under the incredible light of Vendela, is totally black. Orgol is the only known place in the universe where you can harvest the \u003Cem\u003Emystery goo\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrgol uniqueness do not end there. Orgol atmosphere is reddish in color, and a density half of Kerbin\u0027s, but with a subtle difference. His Atmosphere is composed of two very different gases, with two very different densities, so In fact, we can get away saying that Orgol have two atmospheres. The Main one goes from the surface all the way to 40kms height, theres a gap of 20kms of vacuum, and then another 10kms of atmosphere, as dense as Kerbins\u0027 sea level. So There\u0027s a number of posible results depending on your intentions. It is possible to aerobrake and land, aerobrake and orbit normally, aerobrake \u003Cem\u003Eand orbit inside his atmosphere\u003C/em\u003E. Etc. This fact makes leaving Orgol almost as expensive as leaving Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrgol is not alone. Orbiting him, his moon \u003Cstrong\u003Eida\u003C/strong\u003E (lowercase), contrast a lot with the dark richness of Orgol. ida is a pure white moon (in this case I used the stock Eeloo, rry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E). Orbiting Orgol with 100km in diameter, and a very soft elevations. His thin atmosphere and thin gravity are nothing to care about really. ida is tidaly locked to Orgol, so there\u0027s only one side on the planet from where ida can be seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this moon is in fact, a very important object. The thing that makes ida probably \u003Cem\u003Ethe most\u003C/em\u003E important object here, is that the surface composition, is the only known thing that can illuminte the dark, dark surface of Orgol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/n5iq8i.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022n5iq8i.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA brave Kerbin managed to land here using his IVA altimeter radar, but ida is not present in the sky at the moment, so the result is somewhat disturbing. If you look carefully, you can see the double atmosphere layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/2jeoego.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222jeoego.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome hours later, our Kerman is now in the dark side of the planet, but because ida is present, the surface shows some detail. Notice how the headlights doesn\u0027t give any light to the surface \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E. This dim detail in the surface is really close to the maximum brightness the surface will ever show. Notice also how the goo sea level is noticeable at the left of the picture. Since ida is the spotlight of Orgol, the Star is really irrelevant as main light source. Since ida is the only light, an eyes must be kept on this moon at all times, so eclipses and the current luna phase at ida are of great importance also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etrivial:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eida is tidaly locked, observations ensured that there\u0027s one island in the ida-facing part of Orgol. Is speculated that another island is located exactly 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA around the planet. Since that side of the planet is perpetually black, the island can\u0027t be visually detected at the moment, so its existence is unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eida is a somewhat boring place to be, but famous Kerbal minds suggest that some samples from ida, could open new research possibilites to a new type of lights that in theory, could illuminate effectively Orgol\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E============\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore will come.
