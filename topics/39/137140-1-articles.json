Ok, ok...technically it\u0027s still just 4 business days but come ON!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhem...anyway, I\u0027ve been having to invent new things to do in the demo, and recently I\u0027ve decided to go looking for all the easter eggs on the two available moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGod\u0027s Ringbolts (er...the arches...) were easy to find; a Stayputnik probe in low (REALLY low - 10K) polar orbit found the flying saucer right on the nighttime terminator...that was nice (and a little creepy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made it on a direct flight to Minimus with a horribly overbuilt ship and spent a few hours cruising over the surface, looking for other features, finding nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was about the time I posted my introductory post here; in it I mentioned I was about to give up since there clearly wasn\u0027t anything there. I was quickly informed that yes, there \u003Cem\u003Ewas \u003C/em\u003Esomething there...so I kept looking. Whatever it was \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E to be a monolith; anything larger I\u0027d have seen. So the past week or so I\u0027ve been orbiting Minimus looking for something...anything. I\u0027ve landed and explored all the dry lakes on foot (well, on MMU), looked up and down valleys. Nada.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve recently been able to make much smaller vessels to the little moon by slingshotting around the Mun and have found some pretty neat RV solutions which involves an exciting\u00A0ground-skimming periapsis of 5000m; very fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I STILL haven\u0027t found the bloody munolith.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil yesterday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d come up with a launch vehicle which I\u0027m convinced has to be the smallest vessel possible for such a journey and sent Val back out to the outer moon on yet another survey. (Remember, this is the demo - no science equipment; it\u0027s all eyeballs. Given the size of Kerbal eyeballs, this is a good thing.) I orbited for a while, then, wanting to take a break and having a ton of fuel left over in my descent stage, I decided to put her down on a handy highland - looked flat, no dry lakes nearby. I thought I\u0027d explore the plateau in the morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I wanted to eat dinner, bathe etc. And let Val sleep for a while.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I landed just at dusk, but forgot about the moon\u0027s rotation and wound up putting down just after night fell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInspired by other pics here, I decided to take a couple of shots of Val\u0027s landing site:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022I2rd8zT.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I2rd8zT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite nice.
