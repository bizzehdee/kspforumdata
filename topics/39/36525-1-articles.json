May need to find someone else to do the narration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This pilot episode is not funny. A proper series (including a new first episode) would be based on suggestions and would portray the KSP as completely ridiculous. This episode is just to show the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I didn\u0027t want to write music for a series that may not happen if nobody is interested so instead I\u0027ve used music I wrote for my band that really doesn\u0027t suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAAAAnyway.... here\u0027s the pilot/concept episode. Let me know your thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/EQGyZvgMYuI\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/EQGyZvgMYuI\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
