This is my first time on the forum, so I don\u0027t know if I have chosen the right section. In general, I decided to write a program for calculating the orbit of a flight to the moon, and chose the JS language, because it is easier to view in a browser. Now there are two problems: no time acceleration and poor calculation of perigee and apogee. The first may not be a problem if you use the program on the onboard computer of a real rocket). The second can be solved by equalizing the steps for calculating the movement of the ship, and calculating the trajectory. In this case, the trajectory is calculated perfectly, but the program slows down. I would like to know what you think about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TXkmiHZHXIBxAO94LvrmWAHD1xEHnOi/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17TXkmiHZHXIBxAO94LvrmWAHD1xEHnOi/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-03T19:26:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2021 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Temart\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
