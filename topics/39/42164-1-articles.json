A lets play series of Kerbal Space Program, had a few set backs in the series such as the .21 update which forced me to restart but no big deal right? Right! I have based my space program around nothing special but being able to visit all the planets, with a relativly small craft because we will have Kethane mining operations set up all over the solar system. As my pc isn\u0027t a super computer a interplanetary craft needs to be under 250 parts, which makes it going to need to refuel at some point!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s enough talking, I\u0027m going to leave you with the first episode I ever made which is far from the best, as the more video\u0027s I made the more I realized what I needed to do. Also, At the bottom I will post a link to the entire playlist! All I ask is to get some sort of feed back and see if I should really continue to do this or not! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLShmYHz1t9eTMesO__OG9AzyHAR0FliwU\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe play list link:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLShmYHz1t9eTMesO__OG9AzyHAR0FliwU\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
