Early early days. And a love story worse than twilight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EPrologue\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer was feeling particularly stressed today. Sweat over his wrinkled old brow, he called in a meeting at the Administration Building. They all arrived to meet him. Linus, the administrative science chief and intern of Wernher von Braun; Gus, the head of Operations; Walt, the PR manager; and of course Mortimer himself, head of finances; all sat down in the foldable chairs at the central table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer slapped a piece of paper down on the table, his eye twitching at this disorganization. \u0022Linus.\u0022 Mortimer snapped. \u0022You\u0027re the cause of this?\u0022 Linus startled awake. \u0022Cause of... cause of what\u0022? Linus queried. \u0022We \u003Cem\u003EFIRED\u003C/em\u003E Jeb, Bill, and Bob?\u0022 Mortimer confronted. \u0022Well... you see...\u0022 \u0022Woah woah woah, when did this happen?\u0022 Walt gasped. Gus, food in his mouth, merely gulped. \u0022WHY DID WE FIRE JEB, BILL, AND BOB??\u0022 Walt, Gus, and Mortimer all yelled at Linus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, here\u0027s the problem.\u0022 Linus started. \u0022Our launch vehicle is barely able to get off the launch pad, let alone get into orbit around the planet. Von Kerman says we\u0027ve got all the useful data we can get from Kerbin, and we don\u0027t have a launchpad that can support more than 18 tonnes of rocket. Our shuttle, which we need to attach because Gus accidentally burned off all the parachutes and we need a way to land a reusable craft, takes up almost half of that to store the three Astronauts-\u0022 Walt cut in. \u0022WHICH WE DON\u0027T HAVE!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus continued. \u0022I\u0027m getting to that. We can\u0027t build a better launch pad, because as you keep informing us Mortimer, we have essentially NO budget. So we have to cut off weight somewhere, and Wernher says the launch vehicle can\u0027t have any more fuel taken out of it or it won\u0027t be able to reach orbit at all. The space shuttle can\u0027t be changed because it\u0027s wing shapes have been very finely tuned for the past year of R\u0026amp;D, and that means the only weight we can cut off are the crew itself. And since we can\u0027t chop Jeb, Bill, and Bob in half, we had to fire them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt and Mortimer thought a moment, Gus just continued to stealthily eat his sandwich. \u0022But then...\u0022 Started Walt. \u0022Who\u0027s going to crew the shuttle, Hmm?\u0022 Linus hesitated. \u0022We\u0027ll have to go to...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 1: ...School.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer, Gus, Linus, and Walt all stood in front of the massive complex known as \u0022School of Greater Metaphorical Altitude\u0022 or \u0022High School.\u0022 This is the school Linus used to go to before he dropped out to become part of the space program. The schools on Kerbin are 8 (Kerbin) years long each, and there are four levels of school. Once you are in grade 20, you can drop out if you wish. School is a big place. \u0022Here we are.\u0022 Linus squeaked. He had very much been dreading this day. Then he remembered he was not actually supposed to be \u003Cem\u003Ein\u003C/em\u003E school. The Administrators all went into The Central Office of Educational Bureaucracy to get their visitor\u0027s licenses. They then all stepped into the main hallway chamber.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer was horrified. There were many crowds of people all around them, all of them disorganized, non-right-angled Schoolagers. Linus put down his backpack and got out his posters. He placed them on the wall using spare tacks from an LV-T30 engine assembly. Someone approached him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Linus.\u0022 It was Mr. Fredenly. His old literature teacher. \u0022Creeping around the ladies\u0027 bathroom?\u0022 Fredenly produced a megaphone, aimed it right at Linus, and yelled. \u0022DETENTION!!!\u0022 Linus looked up, noticing that he was indeed placing a poster on the door of the ladies\u0027 restroom. \u0022Mr. Fredenly, I don\u0027t actually go to school anymore.\u0022 Fredenly scrunched up his face and walked away, mumbling about how overworked he is. Linus continued to place posters. Eventually Mortimer, Linus, and Walt met up again in a central point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Linus, you\u0027ve used up your posters?\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EThe phrase DETENTION! could be heard in the background.\u003C/em\u003E \u0022Yes, and you all?\u0022 \u0022Yes.\u0022 Mortimer and Walt both agreed. \u0022Say, where\u0027s Gus?\u0022 Walt asked. \u0022He said he was hanging posters in the cafeteria.\u0022 Linus answered, then seemed to suddenly realize something, no doubt the fact that Gus was probably just eating a bunch of food. \u0022Well, I think we\u0027re done here, let\u0027s go get some coffee while we\u0027re in town.\u0022 Walt suggested. Despite the fact that they don\u0027t always get a long in the business side of things, the Administrators are all very good friends. \u0022Leave Gus a note at the front door.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChapter 2: A Recognition of Lost Friends and Foes.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a week later, and The Administrators came back to School. It was earlier this time, as an important meeting with Gene and the CEO of several rocket companies was to happen later. They checked all of the posters, which only Linus really knew what was on them, and the contact information given ranged from scribbling to lolnope to curse words. For the first time, Walt actually \u003Cem\u003Elooked\u003C/em\u003E at the posters. \u0022Wait, you wrote that you\u0027re only accepting female Schoolagers. What?\u0022 Linus\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E stared blankly\u003C/span\u003E Bad Poker-Face\u0027d at Walt. \u0022Well, women are almost always lighter than men, and schoolagers are almost always lighter than adults.\u0022 \u0022Damnit Linus.\u0022 Gus said. \u0022But you\u0027re right. The Launch Vehicle needs a light payload, and girls are the lightest form of potential piloting skill we could ever find. That is...\u0022 He looked at Walt. \u0022If anyone is actually interested in the Space Program.\u0022 Walt looked back at Gus, then at Mortimer and Linus. \u0022Our program is just not reputable. After the loss of our one \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eexpendable\u003C/span\u003E extra Kerbanaut, the public just doesn\u0027t care about the KSP. If we had the money for a charity or something, then that might be different. But as Mortimer is always keen to tell us, \u0027We Don\u0027t.\u0027\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus frowned. Then, the bell rang. Kerbals started pouring out of the various classrooms, all running to get to their classes within the 30 second time limit. One of them in particular collided with Linus. \u0022Linus?\u0022 The figure asked. \u0022Wot.\u0022 It was Nedely Kerman, Linus\u0027 old friend\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ezone\u003C/span\u003E from back when he went to school. Linus recognized her. \u0022I missed you!\u0022 She said, running backwards, falling over some books, then expertly headbouncing back into proper orientation. \u0022Huh.\u0022 Linus sighed. Mortimer smirked slightly. \u0022We might get out of the way.\u0022 Walt cautioned. The Administrators backed out of the hallway, and into the cafeteria, where Gus was already waiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: \u0022You know Linus, seeing your admiration for that one Kerbelle there gave me an idea.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus blushed. \u0022Whaaaat? Pfft. Anyway, what\u0027s your idea.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: \u0022Did you see how cool that accidental stunt was there?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Yeah.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: \u0022It was almost like a barrellrolling zig-zag-whirlyloop manuever that Jebediah invented when test flying the shuttle. And yet she managed to recover from that, where Jeb had to eject.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus: \u0022Mmhff, I thenk whe have a piwot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer: \u0022Gus, please swallow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus gulped. \u0022That is, I mean, if you can convince her.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022She was never really into space though. Moving quickly? Sure. Moving through a medium of nothingless though? Those ideas merely bored her.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: \u0022THAT\u0027S IT!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGus: \u0022What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalt: \u0022Selective Advertisement Campaign. New strategy I just thought of. We\u0027ll find the best crew for the missions we need and we\u0027ll make posters near specifically their classrooms.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMortimer: \u0022That\u0027s genious! And it won\u0027t cost us a penny, so long as we can steal some paper from the school!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, the lunchroom crowds filled in. Walt whispered to Linus. \u0022You should go and try to resocialize with your fellow schoolage kerbals. Try and make space appealing to all of them. I know you. You\u0027re not awkward around girls, you\u0027re just awkward.\u0022 Linus pushed himself out of his seat and tried to find Nedely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022H... hey Nedely.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022Where have you been?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022I\u0027ve been working with some of the smartest minds on the PLANET! Wernher von Kerman, Eugene Kerman, etc.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022Oh. Interesting. Who are those people.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022The head rocket scientist and mission planner at Kerbal Space Center.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022Is that important?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Pfft, it\u0027s only the most prestigious program in the world!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022Is that a fact?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Yeah!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022I\u0027m guessing when you say Space, you\u0027re not talking about the volume inside our lockers.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Well, no, I mean... SPACE! You know, the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Evast amount of nothingness.\u003C/span\u003E place where you can fly really really fast without stopping or burning up!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022Alright.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more people sat down at the table. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Who\u0027s this loser?\u0022 One of them asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Who?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrander Kerman: \u0022YOU! Hahahahaha!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely chucked a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022If by \u0027loser\u0027 you mean \u0027person who loses a bunch of stupidity\u0027, then I\u0027m that person.\u0022 Of course, Linus did feel a bit sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrander: \u0022Hey wait, I remember you, you were that nerd who tried to fly using fireworks in 16th grade. Idiot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Not.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrander: \u0022Are.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus growled slightly, then left the table. Approaching the other Administrators, he merely said. \u0022That was a pointless endeavor.\u0022 And they all went back to KSC in time for the meeting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChapter 3: Finding a Crew\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus, being by far the youngest of the KSC senior staff, is debatable as to whether he should really be an administrator. Doubtless if there were two Wernher von Kermans, one would be the administrator instead of his intern. But nevertheless, the Administration team have gotten used to him, and, would likely miss him if he had to leave. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus, having stolen his baby sister\u0027s crayons, was trying to create a good poster to appeal to the scientist crew members. Beautiful pictures from a new satellite? Not possible under the new budget. Best they had is a low quality SSTV image from a suborbital rocket missile, which serves a good enough base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, after having put up enough of the new posters, three kerbelles were found that were willing to fly up into space for varying reasons. Nedeley Kerman because of the moving fast; Eerberri Kerman because of the wonder of floating around in space; Earbles Kerman because of the complicated and very interesting machining. They had a proper crew to rival Jebediah, Bill, and Bob; except for the fact that they were lightweight, though still mentally developing. The Therapist at the Astronaut Complex had to do a fair bit of thinking before he was okay with letting young minds have such responsibility. He felt fine with giving Linus the simple job of thinking about the Space Program\u0027s science, but piloting a spacecraft? That may go too far. A physcological evaluation was neccessary. They all checked out, just barely. The Pink-Suited Three Kerbals were ready for a test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022Alright: Nedely, Eerberri, and Earbles, this flight is simple. You\u0027ve all done the simulations well enough. Now all that needs to be done is get a C7 Aerospace Bomber plane to haul up the Shuttle to a height, then you all fly it down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely: \u0022We know! You\u0027ve been saying that over and over again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinus: \u0022I need to make sure the recording system picks it up at least once. Into the shuttle now.\u0022 Linus shut the hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene Kerman: \u0022Flight systems go, This is KSC to Bomber 1, you are go for launch.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: \u0022Alrighty then, this is Bomber 1 ready for takeoff.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: \u0022Jeb is that you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah: \u0022Yep.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: \u0022Glad you are still working in aerospace.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bomber flew up beautifully. Unfortunately, Jebediah was jealous. He had no idea who was in that cockpit, all he knew was that he was mad at them for stealing his job. He maxed out the propellers, and aeileronrolled waaaay too fast. Nedely was having the time of her life, even without having taken the controls! Eerberri and Earbles meanwhile, were very much not having fun. Jeb stalled out the bomber, launched the Shuttle from the Bomb Bay, and recovered himself. This was something that the Pink-Suited Three has not been trained for. Nedely tried to steer, but could not. \u0022What the hell!?\u0022 She exclaimed. They were being tossed around the cabin like there was no end, and even though Nedely was trying to control the craft, she didn\u0027t know what \u0022stalling out\u0022 was, or how to avoid it. Earbles took the controls in realization. \u0022It\u0027s like a paper glider! The Angle of Attack is too high, so we\u0027ve stalled out! I think I know how to fix this.\u0022 Jebediah watched in satisfaction as the vehicle tumbled out of control. He hadn\u0027t remembered an old adage from flight school. \u0027Altitude is Life Insurance.\u0027 \u0022Whoever that pilot is\u0022 Jeb thought. \u0022He\u0027s gonna have a tough time getting out of that.\u0022 Earbles, still being tossed around during the stall, wired the joystick through the rocket controls, and was able to throttle the rocket engine of the shuttle from the rear cockpit. \u0022Try and point prograde!\u0022 She yelled to Nedely. Eerberri could do nothing but observe the turmoil, writing down what was happening to the rarified air. Nedely finally regained control, and turned the ship right back down to the Space Center. Gene was watching the whole thing horrified. \u0022JEBEDIAH!? WHAT THE HELL?\u0022 He screamed over the com. \u0022I... Lost Control.\u0022 Jeb scrunched some crew report papers over the microphone. \u0022You\u0027re breaking up...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedely put the shuttle down perfectly on the bumpy runway. Linus, Mortimer, and Walt were watching through the Admin Building\u0027s television, but Gus was nowhere to be seen. Though the mysterious and unsolved mystery of the lunch thief still remains. Everyone\u0027s mouths were gaping open at the unbelievable turn of events that just occurred. After minutes of silence, Nedely spoke up. \u0022Are we ready to go to space yet?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EUp next: Chapter 4: Lost In Spaaaaaace.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T06:37:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 06:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T15:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh...
