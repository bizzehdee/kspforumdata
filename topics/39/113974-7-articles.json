Slowly, the sun clawed its way into the morning sky, shifting the colors from crimson, to red, to brilliant scarlet, before fading away to unblemished, sparkling white. Snow. Perhaps a shy meter of it had fallen in the night. Little more than a dusting, really, and not a flake of it had been plowed yet. \n\nValentina sat watching, perched high on the roof of the VAB. The light morning breeze pulled long clouds of breath from her lips and numbed her face against the loose lock of hair blowing across it, but she didn\u0027t mind, the cold never bothered her anyway. This... this was her favorite time of all, the morning after the first snowfall. It always seemed like the world had been soothed and refreshed: stains covered over, harsh edges softened, all bathed in muted silence. Before her, all was pure, flowing white as far as she could see, like creation born anew. She knew it wouldn\u0027t last, it never did, but it was here, now. And it was beautiful. \n\nNot even footprints broke smooth white sheet below. She thought everyone on the facility must still be sleeping off the consequences of last night\u0027s festivities. Or were simply buried under the snow. Either way, it gave her a welcome moment of peace on this perfect morning to think. \n\nLast night\u0027s events had yet to fully sink in. It still didn\u0027t seem real. After the ceremony, there was, of course, the bureaucracy. Forms had to be signed, documents initialed, photographs taken, and new docket of paper to be checked, please. Then the interviews, the photographs, the hand-shaking. It had all seemed distant and dream-like. Her parents had been pardoned of all wrongdoing, but she still hadn\u0027t the slightest idea what they\u0027d actually *done*, and no one could... or would, tell her. There had been a thinly veiled tension in the air. The Empress\u0027s decree seemed to have surprised everyone. *More* politics. \n\nBah, she *hated* politics!\n\nAnd, Valentina suspected, the politics of the Ussari Union were the least of her worries. The voice had continued to twitter and hiss in her mind all night long, but distantly, as if afraid to come near. It had quieted down to nothing in the last few minutes, too. She let out a long breath of cloud, and leaned back against... well, whatever it was she was sitting on up here. \n\nThoughts came random and disjointed, and Valentina let her mind meander through them. She\u0027d been to space for the last time again, she realized that. She was lucky to have the gained the short time she did. She also realized with a wince, that was a horrid way to think about it, yet there it was. Up there, despite the gravity of the situation, everything seemed to make sense. Of course, it was easy to look back on it now and think that. They would never let her go near a rocket again, she suspected. But some part of her wanted to stay up there forever. \n\nValentina gazed out over the perfect, white, unbroken snow. Somewhere under all that, was a shadow. It moved, unseen and unnoticed, like  subterranean beetles that gnawed on tree roots, and in doing so toppled even the mightiest of them. It was scheming, stalking, corrupting to its own pattern, but... Staring at nothing, her eyes widened just slightly, then narrowed. If it has to work by schemes and shadows, if it cannot simply *take* what it wants, then somehow, it is still weak. It *can* be fought. \n\nBut how? Blood oaths by M\u00FCnlight were all well and good, but she needed answers, some place to begin. It wouldn\u0027t simply fall into her lap--\n\nSomething fell into her lap. \n\n\u0022I thought I might find you up here,\u0022 Dibella said, pulling herself up onto the equipment box and plopping down next to Valentina in a flurry of snowflakes. \n\nValentina lifted the small, white box, \u0022what is this?\u0022\n\nDibella looked at her, a touch of color rising in her cheeks, \u0022with all that happened, I never got a chance to thank you properly... for saving my life...\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh no,\u0022 Valentina tried to hand the box back, \u0022you do not have to do that.\u0022\n\nDibella didn\u0027t take it, \u0022yes. Yes, I do. Go on, open it.\u0022\n\nValentina did so reluctantly, then gasped. She lifted the object reverently from the box and turned it over in her bare hands. It a brilliant red disc-like jewel, with a clasp and chain of thick, iridescent metal. \n\n\u0022It is beautiful...\u0022\n\n\u0022The setting is new, I had it made. It\u0027s pure titanium, even *you* can\u0027t break it,\u0022 Dibella said with a wry grin. Valentina shot her a look. \n\n\u0022...but the stone has been in my family for generations. The original setting is lost to time, but according to family legend, there used to be an inscription, too. It always changed depending on which uncle I asked and how pickled he was that evening, but usually something about \u0027courage\u0027 and \u0027heart\u0027 and \u0027rare.\u0027 I thought it fit you.\u0022\n\nValentina stared into the deep crimson disc, mesmerized. In the low morning sunlight, it seemed to be glowing from within.\n\n\u0022What on Kerbin is it?\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s a M\u00FCnstone. No, not from the *actual* M\u00FCn, of course, but they are quite rare. They often pop up in old fairy tales and mythology as sources of great mystical power. Quite understandable, given how they sparkle in the light like that.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thank you,\u0022 Valentina said, slipping the chain over neck and feeling just a bit awkward, \u0022I will treasure it always.\u0022\n\nDibella smiled at her, \u0022you left the party early last night. That\u0027s not easy to do in Ussari, it often comes looking for you.\u0022\n\nValentina smirked and rolled her bulging eyes, \u0022I needed some time to think.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Dibella nodded, \u0022not much thinking going on by that point. But you missed all the announcements.\u0022\n\nValentina raised an eye... bulge. \n\n\u0022Everything is changing again. The entire space program is being restructured after all the... anomalies. Restructured, and expanded.\u0022\n\nWith the question plain on Valentina\u0027s face, Dibella continued, \u0022everything is being centralized under a single national space agency. Flight planning, production, mission direction, more like the Foreigners. They\u0027re calling it USKOSMOS. And Sergei Kermanev is to be the new director.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei?!\u0022 Valentina shook her head in confusion, \u0022but what about the Academy? The Kommissar?\u0022\n\n\u0022The everyone will report to the Kommissar, even the Academy. They\u0027re going to build two new launchpads and train nine new Kerbonauts. There was talk of long-term space flights, and probes to Eve and Jool. Launches every couple of weeks even.\u0022\n\nValentina put her head back. *A new nine. So that was it, then.* But wait, how...\n\n\u0022How are they going to maintain such a high launch rate? The factory in Kernobyl is already straining to keep up.\u0022\n\n\u0022That\u0027s where it gets interesting. There was a representative from this \u0027Layland Heavy Industries\u0027 there. Some Gytepi technology firm as well. They gave a rather *thrilling* speech,\u0022 Dibella rolled her eyes, \u0022lots of nonsense words like \u0027synergy\u0027 and \u0027actualize\u0027 and \u0027authoritatively reintermediate premier initiatives.\u0027 They\u0027re going to build a new factory near the Cosmodrome.\u0022\n\nValentina opened her mouth, then closed it again, and clicked her tongue, \u0022I suppose I should not be surprised. Foreigners running a factory in the Union. They have their hand in everything these days.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed. Some sort of partnership with this \u0027USKOSMOS.\u0027\n\nShe sighed, shaking her head, \u0022I do not understand politics.\u0022\n\n\u0022They seemed to have worked in your favor this time, Comrade *Kermanova*,\u0022 said Dibella with a wink. \n\n\u0022I do not really understand that either. It seemed quite... \u0022 she shrugged, \u0022sudden.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sudden, yes. I cannot see the motive beyond the obvious, but it was a very shrewd maneuver on her part.\u0022\n\nValentina looked over at the other Kerbal, \u0022how do you mean?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, obviously, you are a hero deserving of honors for your great service to the State, but...\u0022 Dibella stared thoughtfully out over the world clad in white, \u0022she is very cunning. She has so little power beyond mere ceremony. Only the Imperium can bestow the Medal, but it is a loose tradition for the Throne to grant an honorific at the same time, in remarkable cases.\u0022\n\nValentina nodded her on.\n\n\u0022Now, when an honorific is granted for a great act of service, it\u0027s also traditional for the Throne to grant indulgences, only usually they\u0027re not binding since it\u0027s not by Imperious decree, but with your sudden celebrity,\u0022 she raised an eye... bulge at Valentina, \u0022*everyone* was there. The Imperium, the Kommissariat heads, regional governors, council leads. Anyone who has any sort of influence used it to get a seat in the Winter Palace.\u0022\n\n\u0022I still do not follow you.\u0022\n\nA wry grin crossed Dibella\u0027s face, \u0022it may not have been official, but it still qualifies as \u0027in Union assembled\u0027 under the Fifth Revision of the Agreement. And under Article 19, a proclamation from the Throne delivered in Union assembled is legally binding.\u0022\n\nValentina crinkled her brow more, her eyes darting back and forth in thought, \u0022but... it is the Imperium. Can they not simply undo it if they choose?\u0022\n\n\u0022They\u0027re the Imperium, they can do whatever they want. Revoking honors granted so publicly to a national hero, by such a well-liked Empress, though... they would lose face. And that might be worse for them. The significance of the Empress\u0027s ploy may  have been symbolic, but nevertheless, as the Foreigners say, she put one over on them,\u0022 she gave a little wink, \u0022their grip on power is perhaps not quite so strong as they would like us to think, yes?\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s eyes darted about, lingering on the squat grey rectangle across the roof that marked the Kommissar\u0027s office, \u0022you should not say such things.\u0022\n\n\u0022What are they going to do, arrest me? Days after giving me the Order of Kermin? They are not such fools. Loosing face, remember?\u0022 Dibella did, however, rub her heavily-mittened hands together nervously. \n\n\u0022Bah, I will never understand politics,\u0022 said Valentina, trying futility to blow the errant lock of hair out of her face. \n\n\u0022I pray you never do,\u0022 Dibella said, not unkindly. \n\nThe two friends sat in silence for a few moments, gazing out by dawn\u0027s early light at the brilliant, frosted landscape. They both went to speak at once, then shared an awkward giggle. \n\n\u0022Valentina,\u0022 Dibella avoided the other\u0027s eyes, \u0022do you ever feel like something is... wrong?\u0022\n\n\u0022How... do you mean?\u0022 The response was cautious, Valentina\u0027s ears piqued by the use of her full name.\n\n\u0022With everything. Something is... not right.\u0022\n\nValentina kept her face blank. Could Dibella know about... well, *it?*\n\nShe continued, finding a particularly interesting spot on her mitten to examine as she spoke, \u0022when I was at university, political doctrine was a required path, of course. I read everything Vladimir Kermin ever wrote, even beyond the requirements. I always considered myself a good and loyal Comrade of the Imperium. But, in the old histories, I found things that were... troubling. The professors always had a rationale, of course, made it sound quite reasonable. Yet...\u0022\n\nDibella slowly shook her head, \u0022everything is changing so quickly now. I sometimes wonder if the Imperium really is controlling it all, or if they\u0027re just being dragged along like the rest of us. I wonder if, perhaps, there\u0027s a better way.\u0022\n\nValentina stared at her, aghast, \u0022you *really* should not say such things. Those are dangerous thoughts!\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Dibella agreed, rubbing her hands again, \u0022perhaps, *that* is the problem.\u0022\n\nConfused, and scrambling for a response, Valentina\u0027s mind groped at distraction, \u0022your hands... do they still hurt?\u0022\n\n\u0022What? Oh, no. Not anymore, really,\u0022 she held her mittens up before her, \u0022the doctors all say my fingertips will grow back eventually. We\u0027re a resilient kind, like that.\u0022\n\nThen she turned, with a fragile smile, \u0022besides, I\u0027m Ussari. It takes more than a little frostbite to cow me!\u0022\n\nFor a moment, Valentina returned the smile, then Dibella\u0027s eyes slowly dropped. \n\n\u0022There\u0027s another reason I came up here...\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022I wanted you to be the first to know. I\u0027m leaving the Kerbonaut Corps.\u0022\n\n\u0022What?! No, no you cannot! You said yourself, your hands will heal--\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s not because of that, in spite of it, really,\u0022 Dibella gave a reassuring smile, \u0022I\u0027m not leaving the Program, just the Corps.I was never really cut out for spaceflight. With all the changes, they wanted a permanent flight director. I guess they figured actual experience might be beneficial to that.\u0022\n\nValentina had come up here to clear her thoughts, but now her head was practically swimming, \u0022but... I do not... are you sure?\u0022\n\n\u0022My education is more appropriate to administration anyway. This way, I can help make sure we have the best space program we can. And maybe, keep anyone else from having to go through, well, what we went through.\u0022\n\nValentina put a hand to her temples. She could feel a nasty empty-belly headache lurking in there too. At least the P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI voice had finally shut up for a while. \n\nDibella put a comforting hand on her shoulder, gingerly, \u0022it will all work out for the best. It will be all right, you\u0027ll see.\u0022\n\nFurther discussion was interrupted by a cracking, discordant voice that drifted up from far away. What it lacked in any sort of talent, it more than made up for in sheer volume. And a chilling resemblance to a dentist\u0027s drill.\n\n\u0022...shakeable faith in **our** heroic cause! **OOOOOOOOh**, SIIIIIIING to our glo-ri-ous **YOUUUU**-NION! MaAAAaaay she ever pro**OOOOOOO**sper!\u0022\n\nClapping their hands to their heads, the two moved the edge of the roof and looked down. Far below, a small figure stumbled through the snow, spinning around occasionally and waving a tiny red flag in an upraised hand. And of course, making that hideous noise. \n\n\u0022Built on the shoulders of our workers stronK!\u0022\n\nPart of Valentina was genuinely impressed with the figure\u0027s ability to project its voice with such power at a distance. The other part was urgently looking around for something sharp to stick in her ears. \n\n\u0022Ooooohhhhh, **HAaaaAAAaaaaaaAAAaaAAaaaaaAaAIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiL---!**\u0022 The figure flopped forward in a snowbank, its tiny red flag still sticking up defiantly. \n\nValentina slapped the side of her head, trying to equalize the pressure, \u0022wow. They must have been running high test last night.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 agreed Dibella, moving her jaw around, \u0022ethanol-75. Quite the surplus now that all the *Stolitsa* rockets have all been retired.\u0022\n\nFar below, the figure gave the flag a little wave. \n\n\u0022Is... is that poor Vladimir?\u0022 Valentina mused as she looked closer. \n\nDibella squinted, then sighed, \u0022yes, I believe it is. I suppose we\u0027d best go dig him out. I think a nice, hot breakfast will be in order, after that.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 said Valentina, still rubbing at the sides of her head and extremely glad she had no external ears. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSome time later, with Comrade Vladimir safely tucked away in a warm and easily hosed down corner of the VAB, Valentina and Dibella made their way back through the empty, snow-covered paths of the Cosmodrome to the Kerbonaut dormitory. They passed through rows of empty tables and stacks of empty chairs in the darkened, unused cafeteria toward their little kitchen.  Valentina mused, as she opened the door and reached for the light switches, it would no longer hold all of them. Nine new Kerbonauts. Likely more to follow. They will have to--\n\n\u0022P\u0426TI\u0418S \u042C\u0417\u0414\u042FD turn the *G\u0424\u042F\u042C\u0414CH\u0417VI\u0418G* light off!\u0022\n\nDibella screamed at the pungent, misshapen form occupying one of the chairs at the humble table. \n\nValentina quickly flicked one of the switches off, \u0022Tercella? What happened to you?\u0022\n\nTercella could only groan in response, her narrow, bloodshot eyes straining to focus, a dried rivulet of drool caking one cheek, then finally managed, \u0022and stop yelling. My head...\u0022\n\nShe was wearing a set of dirty coveralls. Valentina noted that the name tag said \u0027Dmitri.\u0027 Wherever poor Dmitri was, he must be waking up with a splitting headache himself, for an entirely different reason. Any hopes for a nice hot breakfast had quickly evaporated, too. Valentina wrinkled her... face. Having an open flame around Tercella might not be wise right now.\n\n\u0022Oh, dear. Dear, dear, dear,\u0022 Dibella said, wiping the drool from Tercella\u0027s face with a rag, \u0022let\u0027s get you some coffee.\u0022\n\nTercella moaned assent, then moved to drop her face in her hands, but missed and hit the table instead, with a solid *thud*, \u0022ow.\u0022\n\nThe other two concerned Kerbals stepped to the... thing on the wall where the imported coffee pot had once been. A gleaming maze of pipes, tubes, precisely soldered fittings and assorted greebles stood before them. \n\n\u0022Hmm,\u0022 Dibella put a hand to her chin, \u0022she\u0027s changed it again.\u0022 Valentina could make no sense of the mass of plumbing. There was something vaguely familiar about it...\n\n\u0022Push the button,\u0022 Tercella croaked without looking up, \u0022push the red button.\u0022\n\nValentina scanned over the chaos until she found it. She looked at Dibella, who shrugged. Valentina shrugged herself, then pressed the button. And immediately wished she hadn\u0027t. \n\nThe entire room began to rumble with the thunder of a rocket engine. The machine rattled and shook, ominous jets of vapor spewing out of unseen places. Great rushing sounds filled the air, something deep inside the nest of lines glowed red, metal creaked and groaned, something fell of a shelf and shattered on the floor, and then, just as Valentina was certain the monstrosity really *would* lift off and punch right through the ceiling, it stopped. \n\nWith a loud *fwooooosh*, a cloud of steam rose above the machine and three streams of inky black liquid flowed into three waiting cups near the base. A moment later, with a softer *whooosh*, three streams of steaming white liquid followed. Finally, with a simple *pfft*, three dollops of fluffy white foam followed that. \n\nDibella and Valentina each hesitantly took a cup, looked at each other, shrugged again, and raised them to their lips. \n\n\u0022Hey... this is... *good*,\u0022 Valentina exclaimed. \n\n\u0022It *is*,\u0022 agreed Dibella, \u0022no more burnt smell or industrial aftertaste, or crunchy bits. I do believe she\u0027s done it!\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, but...\u0022 Valentina trailed off. The perfectly warm beverage *was* quite good, but there was something subtle... \u0022...how?\u0022\n\n\u0022Steam,\u0022 Tercella still didn\u0027t look up, \u0022force the water through the grounds under high pressure with steam. That is the secret.\u0022\n\n\u0022Interesting,\u0022 Dibella opined, \u0022how did you manage that?\u0022 The two took long sips...\n\n\u0022Steam generator from an old HTP engine I found.\u0022\n\n...And promptly spayed them all over each other. \n\nChoking and gagging, Valentina coughed, \u0022*peroxide?!*\u0022\n\nTercella finally looked up, with a wounded expression, \u0022I cleaned it first!\u0022\n\nValentina put a hand to her face, then took a cold pastry from the plate on the counter and sat down with her cup of steaming peroxide. Dibella set the other cup before Tercella. \n\n\u0022Here, drink. It would not do to have the Kommissar see you like this.\u0022\n\nTercella took a bite of  Valentina\u0027s pastry, \u0022the KommisSAR, the KommisSAR...\u0022 she rolled her head this way and that. \n\n\u0022The same Kommissar who is always conveniently absent, even during important launches and moments of crisis? *That* Kommissar?\u0022 She said around a mouthful of pastry. \n\n\u0022Hush, you should not say such things,\u0022 Dibella snapped. \n\n\u0022Bah,\u0022 a dismissive wave of the pastry, \u0022I am beginning to wonder if he even exists.\u0022\n\nRight on cue, the opposite door swung open, and Igor entered, eyes wide, skin ashen. \n\n\u0022Valentina,\u0022 he boomed, raising a finger, \u0022you...\u0022\n\nTercella nearly choked on her mouthful, \u0022he looks like he has seen a ghost.\u0022 Valentina stopped glaring at her and looked at Igor.\n\nHe paused to run a tongue like sandpaper over his dry lips.\n\n\u0022You... must see Kommissar.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-14T06:32:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2016 06:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T06:23:45Z","Content":".........."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T06:22:36Z","Content":"**Chapter 39: Der Kommissar**\n\n**Boris Kermanskiovitch  Kommissar**\n\nShoulders still heaving, Valentina stared at the stenciled writing on the drab metal door. It looked not unlike many other doors in the VAB, except that this one was at the top of a long, steep staircase that came up from the third sub basement. No one seemed to know if there was an elevator, even Igor. She was already regretting changing into her heavy winter uniform, but this sounded official. She stared at the door a moment longer, letting her breathing settle, then tucked her hat under her arm and knocked. It made a tinny, thin sound. \n\nNothing. \n\nShe frowned. Maybe no one was there and she could go back? No, no getting away that easy. Valentina sighed, and rapped again. \n\nStill nothing. \n\nThe knob, perhaps? She tried it, and found that it turned, but the door opened only a fraction of a centimeter, then stuck. \n\nCould... something be wrong? An accident?\n\nFeeling anxiety rise in her throat, Valentina gave the door a shove. It didn\u0027t move. She tried a little harder. Solid. Bumped her shoulder against it. No good. Bumped a little harder, and the door budged perhaps a millimeter. She bumped it just a *bit* harder...\n\n...the door flew open, Valentina went with it and nearly went sprawling onto the floor. She stumbled three or four loud, clopping steps into the room, blinded by the glare of the buzzing fluorescent lights overhead. \n\nShe hung there for a moment, arms waving, legs apart, just trying to keep her balance, and noting she must look completely ridiculous. After a moment, her eyes began to adjust and balance gradually returned. She was in a long, concrete block room, the walls painted industrial gray, the floor bare concrete. Large portraits of the Imperium hung from the otherwise featureless walls. At the far end was a Kerbal seated at a metal desk, slowly pecking away at a typewriter with a single finger. Behind... him? Her? ...was another door. \n\nGathering herself, Valentina took three confident strides, her heels echoing loudly in the enclosed space, then stopped dead. Color rose in her cheeks. She turned, clopped to the far corner where her hat had landed, sheepishly bent over to pick it up, and tucked it under her arm. Now feeling very out of sorts, she strode up to the desk and saluted. \n\n\u0022Maj--\u0022\n\nA single finger shot up, at the end of a long arm. The other one kept picking away at the typewriter, their owner not looking up. Or otherwise moving at all. With a twist and a flourish, the finger pointed to a chair against the wall, the arm held unmoving in space. Letting out just a bit of a huff, Valentina clopped to the chair and sat. \n\nShe shifted. \n\nNo, that was--\n\nShe shifted the other way. \n\nUgh, that was even--\n\nShe shifted again. \n\nP\u0426TI\u0419!\n\nIt... it had looked like just an ordinary, institutional, hard plastic chair but... no matter how she... lumps in the seat homed in on her bones, pressure points bit at her nerves making her squirm back and forth seeking relief. Stuffy in here too. The chair was just *slightly* too short. She couldn\u0027t tuck her feet under it, a metal bar was in the way. She shifted again. Lounging with her feet sticking out in front, well, that just was not a dignified way for an officer to sit!\n\nHuffing, Valentina tried leaning back. Augh! The seatback was, well it was just *bizarre!* The angle pushed her forward, the top edge catching her right across the shoulder blades. She had to stifle a yelp as a nerve was pinched between bone and chair. The Kerbal at the desk didn\u0027t seem to notice, just kept clacking away with that it irritating arhythmic typing. So stuffy in here. And those buzzing lights! She squeezed her eyes shut, a tear mingling with a drop of sweat making its way down from her temple. \n\n*Shifting. Shifting and blinking.* \n\nA clock on the wall loudly ticked away the time with a steady, slow percussion. Had... had it been there a minute ago? Valentina looked around the room, trying to distract herself from this awful *shifting and blinking and ticking* seat. The paintings on the walls, they looked so real... and she had the distinct impression they were *staring* at her. Were... were the eyes looking this way when she came in?\n\n*Shifting and blinking and ticking and staring.*\n\n*\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417* it was stuffy in here! Valentina ran a finger around her collar, thought of loosening her tie. Were there even any air vents? She looked up at the ceiling and felt a wave of vertigo wash over her. Those lights... the glare... that incessant *buzzing*. It was starting to blend with the ticking clock and clacking typewriter. She could feel a storm of headache building behind her eyes. Her left foot had gone numb, too. \n\n*Buzzing and clacking and sweating and glaring.* \n\n*I should stand up*, Valentina thought, *that would be better. Anything would be better than this!* But no sooner had the thought formed than the finger shot up and pointed emphatically to the seat. She pursed her lips and felt a split open up. Mouth so dry. She could feel a knot growing in her lower back. If she moved just *so* it would burst into a cramp.\n\n*Shifting and blinking and ticking and staring.*\n\n*Buzzing and clacking and sweating and glaring.* \n\nA drop of sweat rolled into her left eye, burning like fire. She squirmed, and bone and chair found nerve again, electric tendrils of pain shooting down her right leg until it, too, went numb. \n\n*Shifting and blinking and ticking and staring. Buzzing and clacking and sweating and glaring.*\n\nValentina gasped for air, her lungs filled but felt like all the oxium was gone. The knot in her back became a thrumming proto-spasm. The clock ticked, the typewriter clacked, the lights buzzed. \n\n*Shifting and blinking and ticking and staring and buzzing and clacking and sweating and glaring and stinging and squirming and shooting and aching and gasping and squinting and pinching and breaking and knotting and thrumming and hurting and brawling and stabbing and falling and punching and crawling!*\n\nThen, at the moment, and the very moment Valentina was certain she was about to scream and go mad, the finger shot up. It pointed at her, then twisted around at an eye-watering angle towards the door. She flew from the curs\u00E9d seat, cried out, and nearly went sprawling again. Her legs felt like they didn\u0027t exist, it was only every muscle in her body cramping at once that kept her from collapsing. She stumbled stiffly to the wall by the door, fell hard against it. The knot in her back exploded into a wrenching, vibrating flurry of spasms. Sensation returned to her legs, only to be supplanted by thousands of red-hot needles jabbing to her nerve endings. \n\nShe forced her way to the door by sheer will, and glanced back toward the fool at the desk. The sweat coating her instantly turned cold as she saw the paper in the noisy machine. It was completely blank. \n\nFighting against her rebelling body, she found the door knob, turned it, and disappeared into darkness. \n\nAgain she staggered to a halt, arms and legs outstretched, just trying to remain upright. And probably looking ridiculous. After the brightness of the other room, it was dark as midnight in here, but mercifully cool. There was no sense trying to bumble about blind, she sensed she was not alone, nothing to do for it but stand here and let her eyes adjust. \n\nThis room could not be more different than the other. She felt thick carpet under her feet, smelled the acrid stink of rattail smoke. Slowly, details began to resolve themselves. Walls appeared, covered in warm wood paneling. It was old and weathered, obviously much older than the building its self. There was a single shelf on one wall, it held a glass display case. Inside was a rather common-looking knife that seemed to be missing its point. A pair of brass floor lamps gave off a pleasing glow, placed beside a massive wooden desk in the middle of the room. Comfortable-looking chairs faced it from either side. Ledgers and folders covered the scarred desktop, all meticulously placed and aligned just so. A wide-brimmed hat sat atop one stack, also carefully placed, the emblem of a Kommissar gleaming in the muted lamplight. An ashtray sat near it, a still-smoldering rattail set in the notch. It had burned down, unsmoked, to nearly a nub, leaving a trail of ash and tiny blackened bones. Along the far wall above a large tinted picture window were the expected portraits of the Imperium, and below those...\n\nHe was enormous. Valentina thought he must be bigger than Igor, even. A dense mat of deep black hair covered his head above his uniform collar. He stood, unmoving, hands folded behind him, staring out the window, blocking the morning light. Valentina gathered herself once more, and strode smartly up to the desk. \n\nShe snapped to attention and saluted, \u0022maj--!\u0022\n\n\u0022I know who you are.\u0022 Though soft, the Kommissar\u0027s voice cut through her own like a knife. She could only stand there, holding her salute. Time dragged out for a moment, then he turned and...\n\nHis eyes.\n\nValentina staggered back a step in spite of herself. \n\nHis *eyes*.\n\nThey bored into her like drills, she could *feel* them digging, searching, dissecting her. In an instant, Valentina felt like every fiber of her being had been deconstructed, cataloged, and filed, and then again and again. Those eyes... the Imperium had been cold but this... this was like looking into some distant edge of the universe where warmth had never reached at all. She thought, *they made him a Kommissar for a reason.* \n\nHis arms remained folded behind him, \u0022sit.\u0022\n\nValentina swiftly obeyed, the breach of protocol dissipating like breath in the wind. With one hand, the Kommissar opened the ledger in the center of the desk and followed the lines with a finger, never looking down. \n\n\u0022Valentina Kermanova, offspring of Vladimir Kerman, Captain, Imperial Army, penal registration number 24601; and Elena Kerman, professor, Kermangrad Imperial University, penal registration number 24897, both sentenced for counterrevolutionary activities and other crimes against the State, records since... expunged.\u0022\n\nHer breath caught. If she hadn\u0027t already been sitting she surely *would* have collapsed. \n\n\u0022Remanded to care of Pyotr Kerman, no profession recorded. Residence transfer to Kerberia Oblast. Found living in squalor by truancy inspector some time after Pyotr Kerman\u0027s death.\u0022\n\nSqualor. Valentina was still so deep in shock the lie didn\u0027t register. \n\n\u0022Remanded to care of the State, transferred between half a dozen different State homes due to... behavioral difficulties. Upon reaching working age, tested into Crimson Air Force, then tested... impressively... into officer candidate school and flight school. Volunteered for test pilot corps where you enjoyed a career of... some note.\u0022\n\nStill those warmthless eyes dug into her. She held their gaze, shock working to dull her fear. Sense slowly began to return, too. The Kommissar spoke Ussari with a heavy accent, his diction perfect but with an odd cadence, his mouth hidden behind a large mustache as thick and dark as his hair. \n\n\u0022Chosen for preliminary Kerbonaut selection. Due to your inherited... political situation, assigned *nablyudatel* Igor, no last name recorded, registry number 451-101. Chosen for primary Kerbonaut selection. Chosen for final Kerbonaut selection. Chosen for First Kebonaut Corps where you have also enjoyed a career of... some note.\u0022\n\nHe placed his other hand on the desk and leaned on them, looming over Valentina like a mountain. \n\n\u0022Yes, Major Kermanova. I know, who you are.\u0022\n\nDespite herself, she swallowed hard. \n\nThe Kommissar sat slowly, retrieved a half-finished pack of rattails from a desk drawer, and offered it.\n\n\u0022Smoke.\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh, no, uh, thank you. Sir. I do not smoke. Sir.\u0022\n\n\u0022Good,\u0022 he thundered, taking one from the pack and lighting it from the burning one, \u0022it is a filthy habit, gives you an abnormal brain.\u0022 He blew a cloud of oily black smoke towards the ceiling.\n\nHe sat back, rested his elbows on the chair\u0027s arms, and stared into her over steepled fingers, the foul thing still dangling from his mouth, \u0022tell me, what do you think of our recent... openness, with the Foreigners?\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. That was an odd question. She opened her mouth to speak.\n\n\u0022I warn you,\u0022 the intensity in the Kommissar\u0027s frigid eyes flared higher, \u0022it is a rare thing that I *ask*... for someone\u0027s opinion. Do choose your words... carefully.\u0022\n\nShe closed her mouth. His accent, it sounded almost like... no, but that was impossible, not a Kommissar, certainly. She thought for a moment, then pulled her own eyes away. \n\n\u0022When I saw Sir Kerman rocket into space, I thought, how dare they. How dare they outshine our Star,\u0022 Valentina paused for a breath, \u0022and then I saw Edmund Kerman fall out of the sky. I thought, perhaps... they are not so different from us, then. We are all so focused on being the *first*, when perhaps, we should be focused on being the *best*.\n\n\u0022If we must always be first, then...\u0022 she stared very hard at nothing on his desk, \u0022sooner or later, mistakes will be made. And they will be all the more bitter, because they were made in haste.\n\n\u0022I think... they are very strange people. I do not know if we can really work together. I have no understanding of such politics, but... perhaps, some sort of...\u0022 Valentina\u0027s distant eyes searched the desktop for an answer, and finding none, returned to the Kommissar\u0027s with difficulty, \u0022...understanding... with this KSA might be beneficial.\u0022\n\nThose eyes delved into her even deeper, measuring, seeking. Probably had not been a wise thing to say, but she thought lying to this Kerb was probably impossible. And dangerous. \n\nAt length, he spoke, \u0022I am pleased to hear you say that, because you are going there.\u0022\n\n\u0022I-- *WHAT?*\u0022 Valentina nearly screamed, then clapped a hand to her mouth. The Kommissar\u0027s stony face never changed. \n\n\u0022If you had spouted some overly patriotic \u0423\u0414\u041AP\u0426TI\u0419 about duty and honor I might have had you shot. I have no tolerance for such nonsense. The Grand Imperium has decreed that the Kerbonaut Exchange Program is to be reinstated. Your application has been approved. Congratulations.\u0022\n\n\u0022But, I did not--\u0022 \n\nHis face didn\u0027t change, but the room suddenly grew colder. Valentina held her tongue. \n\n\u0022You will fly to the Kerbal Space Center in Kleptogart, and remain there for not less than one month, as ambassador and observer. You are particularly to observe anything that involves details of a new KSA spacecraft.\u0022\n\nValentina felt her skin tighten, \u0022you want me to... spy on them.\u0022\n\nThe Kommissar leaned forward and seemed to swell in size. Valentina thought for a moment she could see her own breath. There must be frost on her eyelashes by now. She tried to disappear into her chair. \n\n\u0022You are to be a gracious and respectful *guest*, and you will do absolutely *nothing* that might compromise the integrity of the Ussari Union. But you will see. And you will hear. And you will remember what it is you have seen and heard. You will keep no written record,\u0022 he sat back, and steepled his fingers again, \u0022then you will report back here to me... and *only* me... at the conclusion of your stay. *When* this has been done satisfactorily, you will be returned to the active flight roster and given priority on the next available mission.\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s mouth fell open. Her body was still screaming at her, and now her head was, too. The Kommissar took one last long drag on his rattail, then crushed it out in the ashtray, a thin tendril of vaguely organic-smelling smoke rising and contorting.\n\n\u0022Due to your continued political... situation, your *nablyudatel* will accompany you on your flight, but no further. Our laws have no meaning in that place.\u0022\n\nThe room began to shift and wobble. Valentina gripped the arms of the chair with weak fingers, afraid she might fall out. \n\nThe Kommissar leaned in, continuing to twist the snubbed rattail with an awful crunching sound, \u0022but do not think for a moment that he is no longer watching.\u0022\n\nValentina tried desperately to rally and gather her thoughts. So, so many questions. Why...? How...? Still those eyes pierced into her, like they were reading her soul. \n\n\u0022You have questions?\u0022 He crushed the butt in his fingers until it disintegrated into powder and bones falling into the ashtray. \n\n\u0022I... Well...\u0022\n\n\u0022Do not think on such things too hard. You may not like what it is you find.\u0022\n\nThe Kommissar rose, and again loomed over her, \u0022am I understood?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes...sir...\u0022 Valentina squeaked, still reeling.\n\n\u0022Good,\u0022 he thundered, then slowly turned back towards the window, blocking the light again and folding his hands.\n\n\u0022I suggest you begin brushing up on your Kerblish,\u0022 he turned his head slightly back, \u0022it is a silly language.\u0022\n\nHe turned away, \u0022you are dismissed.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-21T06:31:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2016 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T08:46:51Z","Content":"Whew!\n\nI\u0027m not sure that the Ussari state really goes for the \u0027iron fist in a velvet glove\u0027 metaphor but if it does, that chapter removed the glove, used it to stub out a rattail and then unceremoniously discarded it leaving nothing but bare steel behind.

Yes, yes, good, good, ah, your cholesterol is down I see, excellent! As expected, all is in order. Now here is your authorization to travel, exit visa, entry visa, crew visa, transit visa, courtesy visa, diplomatic visa, and Visa gold.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked at him.\n\n\u0022Do keep the receipts.\u0022\n\nShe stuffed the overflowing folder of papers into her travel bag, and turned back to the Political Officer. \n\nHe clapped her warmly on the shoulders, \u0022it is a Glorious, Glorious journey you begin! You bring our noble ideas to those poor backward Foreigners! Gird yourself, for the experience will no doubt be trying. They are strange people, with stranger ideas! I hear--\u0022\n\nHe leaned in close, raising a conspiratorial hand to his mouth, \u0022I hear they eat their young. It is also said, there are many Parties there, and they...\u0022\n\nThe affable Kerbal paled, his eyes widening a touch more, \u0022...they always find *you*.\u0022\n\nIn an instant, it was gone, and he was upright and saluting again, \u0022but, I am sure you will do fine! And remember...\u0022\n\nValentina returned the salute. \n\n\u0022...Glory to Arstotzka!\u0022\n\nAnd with that, once more, he was gone, leaving Valentina feeling quite bewildered. The day had dawned bright and sunny, if frigid, after more than a week of constant, light snow. Great white piles of it could be found on the lee of most buildings, and today the plows were taking advantage of the clear morning to try to get ahead of it. \n\nIn a cleared spot, some distance away from the aircraft hanger, sat a Converter. It had been freshly painted in vivid reds and golds and whites, the paint shining brilliantly in the sunlight. For the umpteenth time, Valentina looked at it and frowned. They could have chosen something just a *little* more... diplomatic... as a diplomatic transport, really. This old thing would surely send the Foreigners running with their ears covered. \n\nBefore she got that far, however, there was a veritable gauntlet of well-wishers patiently waiting. A long line of handshakes and salutes, *udachi Comrade*\u0027s and *the drivers are crazy*\u0027s, and the ever popular *bring me back something foreign!* Through it all, Valentina kept a polite smile, and somehow resisted the urge to walk down the line with a palm to her face. *As if there weren\u0027t half a dozen stores just in Kermangrad that sold nothing \u003Cu\u003Ebut\u003C/u\u003E something foreign now.* \n\nBut this was the new normal now, she supposed. Probably best not to think on it too much, such is just life in the Great Ussari Union... right? And besides, she thought, releasing the hand of a particularly well-built young Kerb with an intoxicating smile, this new-found attention wasn\u0027t *all* bad.\n\nFinally she made her way through the crowd, finding Dibella and Tercella near the waiting aircraft. \n\nTercella quickly wrapped her in a bear hug, \u0022be careful over there. Do not do anything I would not do.\u0022\n\nValentina smirked back, \u0022that would surely get me arrested either way. But I will miss you.\u0022\n\n\u0022I will miss you too.\u0022\n\n\u0022You will not miss me,\u0022 Valentina waved her hand dismissively, still smirking, \u0022you will be too busy with training.\u0022\n\n\u0022Who would have thought, yes? Assigned to Flight Engineer on Zarya 2 so soon.\u0022\n\n\u0022Who better to put into practice the idea of training for EVA underwater than the one who came up with it?\u0022\n\nTercella shrugged, \u0022I still say we should use gelatin instead. Combine EVA training with muscle training. Make us all strong like bool, no?\u0022\n\nValentina laughed, and clapped the other Kerbal on the shoulders, \u0022never change.\u0022\n\n\u0022I had to, the coffee machine exploded on me. It still needs some adjustments.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked for a moment, then just hugged her. \n\n\u0022Do take care of yourself,\u0022 Tercella said more soberly, \u0022and watch what you eat. I hear they have something called a \u0027hot dog\u0027 that is even more horrid than it sounds.\u0022\n\n\u0022You will do fine. And it\u0027s no worse than a snail,\u0022 Dibella broke in. \n\nShe gave Valentina a comforting look, \u0022they are just people. Not so different. But watch out for the mosquitoes, I hear they eat you alive.\u0022\n\nValentina laughed again, \u0022I think I can handle a few mosquitoes!\u0022\n\n\u0022See? Now that\u0027s the spirit!\u0022 \n\nBut... was that a flash of worry on Dibella\u0027s face? Bah! Just more nerves. \n\nDibella then wrapped her in a hug that would make any bear proud, \u0022I will miss you as well, Tia. But you are doing a great thing. It *will* be worth it.\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0424 SVID\u0414\u0419I\u0423\u0414, Dibella. Tercella. I will miss you both. And everyone. But I think it will all be.. all right.\u0022\n\nValentina gave her friends one last hug, then a wave and salute to the small crowd. A quick sigh, then she slung her travel bag over her shoulder, and turned towards the plane. She ran her fingers along the flank as she did, feeling the smooth, slightly soft paint beneath them. It would feel good to fly again. It must have been months ago, now, the last time had climbed into a seat of something only *moderately* likely to explode. \n\nIgor was waiting by the open hull door. He looked... he looked...\n\nValentina dropped her bag, \u0022*\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417,* \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E are afraid to fly?!\u0022\n\nIgor studied the stained concrete pavement, it seemed to retreat from his gaze. \n\n\u0022Language,\u0022 he said weakly. \n\nShe put a finger to his chin, lifted his face and looked into his massive, slightly bloodshot eyes. He *had* been looking rather out-of-sorts ever since the announcement, but over *this?* She sighed, and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Which wasn\u0027t easy. \n\n\u0022Get on the airplane,\u0022 she said, perhaps a bit sharper than she intended. Igor, looking crestfallen, did as she said. The large craft listed sideways and its structure creaked as he pulled himself up into the doorway. Then, from inside, Valentina heard a yelp.\n\nShe deftly swung her small frame through the opening, what could that--?\n\nIgor had regained his composure, and was staring broadswords at a wide-eyed young Kerbal in a flight suit trying very hard to hide behind the pilot\u0027s seat.  \n\n\u0022Who are you, now?\u0022 She asked, confused. \n\n\u0022J-J-J-Junior Lieutenant Kerman, ma\u0027am,\u0022 he gave her a trembling salute, \u0022I\u0027ll... I\u0027ll be your pilot today please don\u0027t eat me.\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s mouth fell open, and her own glare quickly out-bladed Igor\u0027s, \u0022*pilot?!* Since when?\u0022\n\nThe terrified Kerbal\u0027s eyes darted back and forth between Valentina and Igor, still holding his salute, \u0022j-j-just got my orders this morning! I promise I don\u0027t taste very good...\u0022\n\n\u0022Orders?! They did not tell me... ugh!\u0022 She put a hand to her face, then turned it into a sloppy salute, \u0022as you were, I suppose.\u0022 Valentina folded down a jump seat from the wall and plopped into it roughly, crossing her arms. \n\n\u0022If it\u0027s any consolation, Major, I don\u0027t even *want* to go to the Foreign lands! They\u0027re all a bunch of mindless automatons! I hear...\u0022 he glanced around and lowered his voice, \u0022I hear their leader thinks he\u0027s a jelly donut.\u0022 He nodded solemnly. \n\nValentina just rolled her eyes. \n\nIgor then approached and glowered over him, \u0022you can fly this?\u0022\n\nTrying even harder to disappear into the floor, a squeak came out, \u0022I-I-I\u0027m fully type-rated and have a whole five hundred hours--\u0022\n\n\u0022You crash, I squish head like grape.\u0022\n\n\u0022L...like grape?\u0022\n\nIgor bared his teeth, then made a squishing sound deep in the back of his throat. \n\nJunior Lieutenant Kerman swallowed hard.  \n\n\u0022Igor,\u0022 he swung his huge head toward Valentina, \u0022do not eat him, please.\u0022 Igor grunted, then stalked over to the wall opposite her and sank into a pair of jump seats, his glare never leaving the trembling pilot. \n\nValentina leaned her head back against the hull with a thump, trying in vain to blow away the errant lock of hair that had worked its way loose again. Wonderful, several hours in the *back* of a noisy aircraft with a kerbling-faced rookie and grumpy behemoth afraid of flying. At least scowling at the newcomer seemed to have distracted Igor for the moment. \n\nShe let her eyes wander around the inside of the hull while the pilot hesitantly went through his checks. The Ki-24 Converter was a spartan, basic utility craft. Its stubby rectangular hull and enormous tandem wings allowed it carry an impressive load a very long way, as long that load didn\u0027t care much about comfort. Or could be ordered not to. A bizarre design even by Ussari standards, perhaps its most notable feature was the strange setup of its nose. It looked more like the hull of a boat than aircraft, with only a handful of windows and port holes looking up. Looking *down*, however, was a huge expanse of braced plexiglass. The single pilot\u0027s seat was suspended in the center of this, giving him a nearly unimpeded view of the ground. Which, as it turns out, was an eminently practical thing to have on an aircraft that took off and landed vertically. It was said, however, that the Converter couldn\u0027t actually *fly*, it was just so loud and obnoxious that the ground repelled it. \n\nSomething overhead suddenly began making a loud ticking noise. \n\n\u0022What that?\u0022 Igor\u0027s head snapped around to it. \n\n\u0022It is just the secondary fuel pump,\u0022 Valentina said flatly. \n\nAn alarm began blaring loudly. \n\n\u0022What that?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Master alarm test, perfectly normal.\u0022\n\nThe entire aircraft then shuddered, swaying back and forth. \n\n\u0022What *that?!*\u0022 Igor nearly squealed. Which, coming from him, was a truly disturbing sound. \n\n\u0022Just the landing struts unkneeling!\u0022\n\n*ST\u0414LI\u0419S ST\u0414CH\u0417*, this was going to be a nightmare! Valentina squeezed her eyes shut. There\u0027d been no mention of a pilot in her briefings, although, she supposed, someone *did* need to fly the Converter back. And Igor. But still, she\u0027d been greatly looking forward to flying again. Nothing to do for it now, after all orders were orders and--\n\nHer left eye snapped open. \n\nHer right eye followed suit, then her face cracked open into a truly wicked grin as her eyelids came down again. \n\n\u0022Oh, looooootennant....\u0022 she sang. \n\nHe squirmed around, \u0022ma\u0027am?\u0022\n\nWith effort, the grin became her best winning smile. \n\n\u0022Out of the seat, please,\u0022 Valentina said brightly.\n\n\u0022M-Major?\u0022\n\nThe smile devolved into a wry smirk. \n\n\u0022That is right,\u0022 she said, fingering the golden leaf insignia on her collar, \u0022*Major*.\u0022\n\nAfter all, orders *were* orders. \n\nThe Lieutenant\u0027s mouth fell open. Igor rose and frowned at him again.  His eyes darted rapidly back and forth between the smirk and frown for a moment, then he wisely decided this was one pair he was not about to bet against, and quickly extricated himself from the pilot\u0027s seat. \n\nValentina leapt into it like a beggar at a banquet. Her liquid hands flowed over the myriad knobs, buttons, and switches. In only moments, the engines rumbled, then began their slow, shrill spool from \u0027piercing\u0027 to \u0027obnoxious\u0027 to \u0027painful\u0027 to \u0027*for the love of all that\u0027s decent please make it stop!*\u0027 before finally settling in to their infamous, nearly ultrasonic whine. With a look, and a gesture, Valentina relieved the good Junior Lieutenant of his kneeboard and paperwork and quickly scanned over the relevant clearances and course.  She put her flight helmet on, plugged in the audio cord, then motioned Igor to do the same until she realized the silliness of the idea. The way he was gripping the fuselage longerons behind him, and bending them, he seemed fairly secure, anyway. \n\n\u0022Cosmodrome tower, *avtomat* four-seven at pad 1-D, requesting take off,\u0022 she radioed, adjusting the mic boom just so.\n\n\u0022*Avtomat* four-seven,\u0022 the controller responded, stifling a yawn, \u0022you are cleared for take off, fly heading one-nine-five.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy, cleared for take off.\u0022\n\nShe laid a hand on the throttles, flexed it, then advanced them a touch, the engines responding in kind. She slid down her tinted sun visor, a pilot\u0027s grin of pure joy now spreading across her face as she nudged the engines slowly on. The ungainly craft wobbled for only a moment as its tires left the concrete. A kiss to the left rudder pedal, and it slowly swung about on its axis. The gathered crowd now came into view through the expansive nose glazing, hands pressed firmly to ears. The look on the Political Officer\u0027s face was really quite priceless. She didn\u0027t let the view linger, but kicked the left rudder pedal again, then just a touch on the right as the nose came to the proper heading. Throttles to full, engine nozzles forward 25 degrees, then the ground began drifting away. She pulled back on the flight yoke that looked more like the wheel of a ship, held it for just a moment, slid the engine nozzles full ahead. \n\nAs lightly loaded as it was, the Converter was soon speeding over the landscape, speckled with white and brown, light and darkness, barreling into the brilliant blue sky. Valentina\u0027s course would take her south toward Kermangrad and its navigational beacon, then east across the Arm of Nusad, southeast through the Bylian gap, out across the Yaltik sea, then beyond, into *kerba incognita*.\n\nBelow her, a train cut through the slumbering, snow-covered fields, black smoke oozing away like blood from the gash of the track. Car after car of shrink wrapped rocket cores followed along behind it, seeming to stretch for kilometers. \n\n*How much things have changed*, she thought, *has it really only been a few months?* Not even a year, since those pungent yak pastures ringed by towering mountains. Everything has been so secretive then, so protected, and now, here she was, flying over a train of Foreign rocket parts while bound for the KSC herself.  She continued to watch it, as it wound through through the harlequined landscape like a worm. Worms destroyed, they undermined the roots of even the mightiest trees and sent them toppling to the ground. And yet, worms also renewed, consuming and recycling that which was *already* dead, often preserving the living. \n\nAs the aircraft climbed higher and the air thinned, thoughts flowed and patterns teased. Someone, or some*thing*, killed poor Director Kermanev, Valentina was sure of that now. It killed Sergei Kermanski. It tried to kill Dibella. It moved in the shadows, always hiding, always scheming. And it wanted Valentina, spent so much effort trying to gain her, but why? Was she really that remarkable?\n\nBeneath her flightsuit, Dibella\u0027s M\u00FCnstone suddenly went cold against her skin, caught by an errant breeze in the drafty cabin. It did that often, she noticed. The titanium must be a wonderful heat conductor.\n\nShe turned to find Igor looking at her intently, slightly panicky. She nodded, and gestured to the oxygen mask hanging overhead. He secured it with little difficulty, Junior Lieutenant Kerman doing the same. She turned back and fastened her own, feeling the familiar cool, dry breath. There were no luxuries like pressurization on a Converter. \n\nThe voice had been silent for some time now, at least that was something. If... it had ever been there at all. Voices in her head, shadowy conspiracies, even the Dead Girl who still occasionally haunted her dreams... it all seemed so distant now, here among the fluffy scattered clouds. \n\n*The mind is an incredible thing... it can show you what you cannot see, and hide what you can*.\n\nBut... which was this? Was she seeing what was really there? Or was what was really there far, far *worse?*\n\nValentina shuddered, a chill rolling down her spine as the M\u00FCnstone caught a draft again. \n\nQuestions, so many questions.\n\n*You have questions?* The Kommissar thudded in her mind, *do not think on such things too hard. You may not like what it is you find*.\n\nAnother chill raced down her spine, having nothing to do with the cold. \n\nDo what is expected of you, do *not* ask questions, accept what you are told. That was the Imperious way, was it not? Do not question, or what you find will *surely* be much, *much* worse. Papers, please. Glory to the Union. \n\nHer *deda* had told her to see what was *really* there, but even he... never spoke of her parents. Barely acknowledged they existed. Such things, we do not speak of. Counterrevolutionary activities. Valentina knew that could mean anything. Or... nothing. But it still didn\u0027t tell her *why*. \n\n*You have questions?*\n\nAnd the Kommissar himself. His accent, his face, his hair. He looked like a... but no, that was *impossible*. Not a *Kommissar*, surely! And besides, *they* were all--\n\nShe shivered yet again. It was such an ugly word to apply to *people*, but her teachers were always specific. \n\nThey were all... extinct. \n\nYes, she had questions, reaching out from the dark recesses of her mind like desperate prisoners. But was asking them worth the price?\n\n*The price must be paid*.\n\nA sudden metallic rattling drew Valentina\u0027s attention. Her eyes flew over her instruments, wondering if a fuel pump has gone out. Then she looked around, and saw that Igor\u0027s longeron had torn loose and was now vibrating against the airframe. His wide eyes stared at her from over his mask. The good Junior Lieutenant had resigned himself to cowering under his seat in a ball. \n\nValentina sighed. It was going to be a long flight. Off to the right, Kermangrad was now passing by, that ridiculous dome easily visible even at this distance. She pushed the questions out of her mind, at least for now. That was for another time, she would have enough troubles in the land of Parties and presidential pastries as it was. \n\nThe needle on her directional gyro twitched, then began swinging towards its center. Dipping her left wing, turning away from the Old City and its silly dome, Valentina Kermanova headed east, and onward into the new day. \n\n*End of Act I*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-30T09:42:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2016 09:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T17:40:12Z","Content":"Act 1?!

It is not a creation of the Cosmos, which has no need of such frivolity, but rather of certain sapient beings, who have no more than but a handful of senses with which to contemplate the Infinite. Time ebbs and flows, pulling its creators along, dominating their existence, and, like creatures born in a cave who have no comprehension of darkness because they have never known light, ultimately blinds them. They are bound by it, unable to the relate to the reality around them without its crutch, and because *they* cannot see past it, assume there is nothing past it to see. Thus they wallow in a prison of their own creation, chained to walls that exist only of their own will, all the while proclaiming their own enlightenment; and while they sit blind and dumb and do not see the reality around them, it, most certainly, sees them. \n\nThere are *other things*, out there in the wilderness beyond Time, free of such shackles. They do not know physical need, but nevertheless, are very, *very* hungry. \n\nIn an unremarkable corner of Time, a pale blue dot sat suspended in a sunbeam. It was called Kerbin by some. It had been called many other things. It might be called many others yet. In the northern hemisphere, now clad in white, a nation dominated the vast continent. It was called Ussari by some. It had been called many other things. It might be called many others yet. Perched on the southern border, next to a river, was a sprawling city. It was called Kermangrad by some. It had been called many other things. It might be called many others yet. In the middle of this city, stood a fortress. It was simply called *the* Fortress. It had never been called much else. It might be called other things yet, but *other things* yet watched it from the wilderness.\n\nAnd they were, indeed, very, very hungry. \n\nThere was a palace, within the towering, crenelated walls of this fortress, and for all its grandeur, it still cowered in the shadow of an enormous concrete dome. In a wide tower rising from that palace was a window, and in that window, staring out past the walls at the bustling city beyond, stood a Lady. Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra II, Regent of the Union, First of Ussari and Nihacima, Lady High Vizier of the City of Kerman, and Doge of Erakonia. She, too, had been called many other things, some of them quite impolite, especially of late. There were no bars on the window. *There was no need*, the Empress thought, raising a hand to crimson M\u00FCnstone on the golden choker around her neck. Everyone in this... peculiar arrangement knew their place. \n\nThe shadow of a smile crept across her serene face. Still... she had certainly put one over on those old goats this time. The punishment had been severe, of course, yet through it all she had just laughed. The damage had already been done. Besides, what were they going to do, kill her? They had surely learned from history by now. The first time, it had quite literally blown up in their faces. They had turned it to their advantage in the end, or so they thought, squeezing their grip into an iron fist. They never knew what had slipped through their fingers. The second time, well... They still had not rebuilt the West Tower. She could just see its charred, crumbling skeleton from her own window. \n\nNo, she thought, turning away, her family was not so easily disposed of. The old goats would not make the same mistake thrice. Her eyes then fell on the long-empty bassinet in the corner of her bedchamber. No, they would not.   \n\nThe Empress sighed, very unimperially, once more silently cursing what her beloved country had become. Then again... she ran her fingers up one of the solid gold bedposts holding up a silken canopy... the fate of the Empire had not been undeserved. \n\nA century ago, the old Ussari Empire had finally mined the last fleck of gold from the Duchy of Erakonia, leaving the once-prosperous nation a devastated husk, its vassals destitute, its people starving. What had finally happened *there* while the Troubles raged across the rest of the nascent Union had been inevitable. The rebels had fought like wolverines. It was easy to fight like that, when you had nothing left to loose. They raged with such ferocity that to this day no one would go within ten kilometers of the border that emerged, winning themselves a fragile but lasting peace, and their own little spit of land. \n\nShe walked on, her eyes passing over the extravagant trappings of just this room. Rich hardwood paneling that had once been an old-growth forest in Nusad, jade mined from beneath a village in Bylia, a marble statue from a sacred temple in Kerbistan, a tapestry that was all that remained of a country now beneath a lake in Athiland. Trespasses repeated time and time again, going back a thousand years. \n\nBy the time of her Grandfather\u0027s reign, these things were all just memories, their perpetrators and observers long departed, but they were *powerful* memories, they fused with and fed the grievances of the day. The fate of the Empire had been an inevitability, then. She knew her Grandfather had been a good Kerb, but what the Empire needed then was a *great* one. \n\nThere had been... other concerns, as well.\n\nFeeling the familiar tingle in the back of her head, the Empress smoothed her face, and stepped out into her sitting room. She took her place before the immense door to her apartments, folded her hands, and waited. A moment later there were three loud knocks, and the heavy door swung open. A guard appeared and ran his suspicious eyes over every surface of the room, looking for any sign of attack... or escape. They lingered on the Empress for a moment, then he stepped aside, and a wizened old Kerbal waddled in. \n\nThe grizzled fellow had no hair on his scalp, but the wild mop on his chin gave the impression that it had all simply migrated south. He stepped smartly up to her, or as smartly as he could at his age, and bowed. The guard\u0027s eyes narrowed. \n\n\u0022Majesty, I am told, she is away.\u0022\n\nThe Empress nodded in acknowledgement, \u0022very well.\u0022\n\n\u0022Will there be anything else, Majesty?\u0022\n\n\u0022That will be all, Roland. Thank you.\u0022\n\nHe bowed more deeply this time, the guard\u0027s glare now drawing out into a sneer, then pushed past the hapless ward as he waddled out, mumbling something under his breath. \n\nShe thought it sounded something like \u0022step aside, you feckless, beef-witted giglet,\u0022 but wasn\u0027t quite sure. \n\nThe guard turned his glare back to her, her face passive and serene as ever, before running his eyes over the room once more and slamming the door. There was a loud *thunk*, as the locking bolt slid home. The Empress raised a hand to her face in a futile attempt to hide the smile that blossomed across it. She did not think there was a Force or Power in this \u0027Verse or any other that could stop Roland from being Roland. \n\nStill... \n\nHer hand remained, but her smile faded. It seemed wrong to send that remarkable young girl off into the whumper\u0027s den like this, blind and dumb. It had taken every last bit of her finesse to arrange, but in the end... the smile returned... those old goats had thought it was *their* idea. Her hand dropped down to the golden links around her neck. After all, the chain pulled both ways. The hand fell away, and she turned, her slippered feet moving silently on the thick rugs. \n\nThat girl... there was still a chance. \n\nFutile though it might be, maybe... just maybe... she could find the other. They would have an affinity for each other, she was sure of it. Well, nearly. If they could find each other... maybe it wasn\u0027t too late. Maybe... *it* could be stopped. \n\n*But you know*, a voice whispered in her head, *there is another way...*\n\nThe Empress now stopped, standing before an immense case that looked like glass but wasn\u0027t. Towering above it, larger than life, was the Imperial Portrait from her coronation years ago. Herself, the Orb and Scepter gleaming in gold paint, Alexei, the Imperial Consort, looking so strong, and in the same bassinet, little Tatiana. But what was ensconced in the case below far outshone the grand painting. Not merely a king\u0027s ransom, but the ransom of several kings, demanded over the centuries. Gold, jewels, priceless antiquities, and before all of them, the Crown Jewels themselves. The same regalia as the massive painting above. Like so many times before, her eyes fell on the gleaming Scepter. \n\nShe raised a hand that still trembled, the M\u00FCnstone around her neck turning to ice against her skin as her fingers touched glass that wasn\u0027t glass. Not the Scepter its self, that was only a few kilos of gold, worthless in comparison. But within it...\n\n*With that,* she thought, *I could change everything. \u003Cu\u003EFix\u003C/u\u003E everything*.\n\nEven after all these years, the old goats still had no idea what was hiding right under their... beards. Yes, yes she *could* fix everything... but for how long? A decade? A generation? A century? It wouldn\u0027t matter, she knew what using it would *awaken*. \n\nA chill ran through her, despite the roaring fire in the hearth. \n\nAlexei had known. He had known all too well. In the end, the knowledge... the temptation... the perverse dilemma, it had driven him mad. What she had done then had been a mercy. \n\nThat\u0027s what she still told herself. \n\nAnother chill crawled up her spine. She took an old shawl from the rack and wrapped it around her shoulders against the imagined cold. She had lost her husband and companion, and her infant daughter. But there was always... a price. \n\n*Even that can be undone*, the voice pleaded, *you know it to be true...*\n\nFor an instant, the tear she had never let fall threatened once more, but the old familiar defiance welled up. \n\n*No...*\n\nShe set her jaw. \n\n**NO**.\n\nShe turned from the power, and walked back towards her window. Her face once again a mask of placid serenity, hands folded demurely before her, she regarded the thriving city outside. \n\nNo. Let these people continue their blissful ignorance a few moments longer. \n\nThis girl, this Valentina, *she* is this world\u0027s last hope. If she fails, and *it* rises from its prison, this world, this *reality*, will die. But the Empress knew, there were things *beyond* this reality, that were far, far, *far* worse, than even *it*.\n\nShe pulled the shawl tighter around herself. No matter what happens in Ussari, or the world beyond... \n\n...wherever it slumbers, the Crown of Worms must never be disturbed. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-07T15:26:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2016 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T17:24:55Z","Content":"Oh wow.

In places on its surface where the paint had finally flecked away, fragile, tree-like deep sea sponges had begun to grow, feeding on the macabre mana of decay that drifted down from the waters above. Inside, beyond the ragged, gaping hole in the capsule\u0027s flank, blind, spindly-legged crabs, white as porcelain, took shelter, feeding on the morsels too big for the sponges, thriving in this alien place of eternal darkness ever since their ancestors first wandered into it ten thousand eons ago. \n\nAs one of the mindless denizens scuttled along its path, it dislodged an air bubble, that by some twist of fate had remained trapped all these many months. The bubble rose from the Plutonian abyss, passing trough a nightmare realm of bioluminescent creatures with freakish proportions and more teeth than any sane thing should have. Upwards it went, past the first weak tendrils of inky violet, ignored by the viperfish, frill sharks, and colossal squid that lurked these depths. The bubble expanded as it rose and the pressure decreased, such that when it entered the deep blue domain of towering shoals of gamefish and cruising manta rays, it roiled and churned and flailed like its self a thing alive. Upward, ever upward, rending its self apart into a thousand smaller bubbles, past bluefish and leatherbacks and great sea beasts until at last the bubbles burst through the foamy crest of a wave on the azure sea and became part of the air. \n\nWarmed by the burning equatorial sun overhead, tempered by the cool ocean currents below, the air began to swirl and move. It went west, toward an angular cape jutting out into the sea. Here it came on shore as a gentle tropical breeze, caressing a motley collection of buildings where there had once been only a swamp. It swirled and eddied between them, around sleek aircraft and over bulging metallic spheres, enticing more than one worker to pause in their duties and delight for a moment in its cool kiss upon their sweat-drenched faces. \n\nThe breeze blew on, now gathering into a wind, pushed ever inland by the new breeze moving in off the sea. It blew over towering sand dunes, around sparse forests and over thriving fields of vegetables toward the foothills of the central mountains. The wind did not stop here, but was carried ever onward by the pressing mass of air behind it, racing over the verdant foothills then blasting up the rugged flanks of the mountains. Momentum carried it over the peaks, where it churned onward to the west, leaving long rows of lenticular clouds in its wake that mirrored the furrowed farmlands below. Here the wind slowed again, and calmed, playing high above the ocean, so that when it crossed paths with the odd little aircraft making the incredible racket, it was no more than a gentle breeze again. \n\nIt passed by a small, terrified face staring out a round port hole, then found a tiny gap in the metal hull and was drawn inside. It blustered back and forth, rushing over an enormous lump snoring loudly in the thin air, until at last it brushed the cheek of Valentina Kermanova, who was nervously going over her entry clearances and radio procedures. \n\nDeciding she had absorbed as much as she was going to, Valentina keyed the mic, and spoke in the professional, calm, dignified tones of pilots. \n\n\u0022Whiskey tango foxtrot, Yankee Doodle dandy, *avtomat* four-seven inbound at the marker with upchuck uniform.\u0022\n\nShe cringed. She thought she must be mistranslating something, it sounded like nonsense.\n\n\u0022Rubber knuckle underwear, jolly good *avtomat* four-seven, this is Omork Approach control at foxtrot zulu milkshake, you are cleared to enter UFPDKO airspace. Squawk sphincter niner ringworm and fly heading one-five-zero, vectors for KSC runway zero-niner.\u0022\n\nSilently, Valentina put a hand to her face, then turned to the directed course. These people *were* strange.\n\nThe radio crackled in her ear again, \u0022additionally, four-seven, an escort has been arranged for your convenience to Kleptogart airspace.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Avtomat* four-seven copies,\u0022 an escort? So that\u0027s what the circling radar contact ahead of them was. \n\nJunior Lieutenant Kerman\u0027s trembling voice suddenly cut in, \u0022fuhhhh...fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh...\u0022\n\n\u0022Fighters, yes, I know!\u0022 She frowned, watching the unfamiliar aircraft pull even off her wing tips. *Whirlwinds*, she thought they were called. The Kerblish letters UFPROACG were stenciled prominently on the tails. She thought if they were going to bother with an acronym that long they might as well just write it out, really. \n\nThis was an unexpected development. Granted, she didn\u0027t really know much about such things, but this hardly seemed a proper greeting for a diplomatic mission. She looked again at the smooth, streamlined warplanes flying next to hers. They did not appear to be armed, but still... you could never tell what a fighter pilot might do if spooked. Their egos were more dangerous than any munition. The one to her left was staring at her intently, impassively. With his helmet and oxygen mask he looked like some sort of bug-eyed alien. \n\nAlthough, she supposed, *she* was the alien now. The thought still didn\u0027t keep the hackles on the back of her neck from rising. Fighter pilots. She *hated* fighter pilots. Almost as much as politics. And now she had both. \n\nThe flight continued on, turning east and paralleling the coast, then inland and more southerly, the other two jets sticking to Valentina\u0027s wings like parasites. The countryside below looked normal enough, she thought, except for the odd lack of snow. They did have winter in the tropics, right? The grasslands reminded her of the vast open plains of Nusad, and she could see huge herds of... somethings. They didn\u0027t have yaks here, she was fairly sure of that at least. \n\nThe plains eventually gave way to rolling hills that proceeded to mountains towering in the distance. Moderately sized, widely spaced cities followed the contours of the hills, connected by a web of wide concrete roads. That looked normal enough too, even if it was a *lot* of roads. She was relieved to see the occasional train chugging along too, but none of them seemed to produce any smoke. \n\nAt length the mountains were looming to her left. Jagged and sharp, they seemed to jut up at impossible angles, giving her the feeling they were somehow \u0027new.\u0027 The steep, rocky slopes were devoid of any hint of snow, which was *very* odd, and there looked to be no vegetation either. Finally the controller directed her eastward over a high pass. \n\n\u0022Gutrot noodle floppy-disk, *avtomat* four-seven you are now leaving UFPDKO airspace, cleared into Kleptogart airspace at one-zero-delicatessen, contact KSC tower at one-one-three-point-niner, cheerio.\u0022 \n\nNext to the Converter, off to Valentina\u0027s left, the fighter pilot stared at her a moment longer, then snapped a quick salute and banked away. \n\nShe checked over the paperwork once more, huffed, and switched frequencies, \u0022flapjack paddywhack trombone, *avtomat* four-seven inbound for runway zero-niner.\u0022\n\n\u0022Pyrex pickle blowfish, KSC tower has you on scope, *avtomat* four-seven, uh, confirm you want a *helicopter* approach?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414... yes... request helicopter approach for runway zero-niner,\u0022 *P\u0426TI\u0419*, this language was frustrating! \n\n\u0022If you say so, four-seven. You are cleared to land runway zero-niner at taxiway bravo.\u0022\n\n\u0022Four-seven, cleared to land, at bravo. Um... rinky-dink chipshot potato.\u0022\n\nNever mind strange, these people were clearly mad.\n\nPassing the mountains, she reduced the throttles and let the nose drop, beginning a long, gradual descent. She could just see the space center now, sprawled out on a wide cape jutting out into the ocean beyond. A quick glance behind her confirmed that Igor was still out for the moment. Good. Turning off the oxium to his mask had worked like a charm, they hadn\u0027t been flying *that* high after all. By the looks of it, the good Junior Lieutenant was panicked enough for the both of them. \n\nThe plane cruised down over more rolling hills, passing farms and odd little groves of trees. The cities seemed more sparse, here, but the roads! So many roads! Blackish-gray tracks winding every which way, without a single railroad to be seen. How did these people get around without trains? They surely didn\u0027t *drive* everywhere, that would just be silly. \n\nThe hills soon gave way to meandering sand dunes as the space center grew to fill Valentina\u0027s vision. It looked like quite an impressive facility, and familiar. Oddly familiar. Yet... every space that was not building or roadway seemed to be packed with lots full of... kars. Further consideration would have to wait, however. She began the delicate process of rotating the engine nozzles and gradually transferring the aircraft\u0027s weight from its wings to the four shrieking engines as it slowed. She crossed over the runway threshold exactly where she wanted to, the ungainly craft held rock steady in her hands. A nudge here, a prod there, and the Converter gently settled to a perfect four-point landing the moment the last of its forward speed bled away, just before the turnoff to the second taxiway of the long runway. \n\nA smirk curled Valentina\u0027s left lip. She was certain she was going to completely embarrass herself at *some* point on this bizarre excursion, but borking the landing would *not* be it! Of course, that had been the *easy* part, too. \n\nShe followed the further instructions from the tower and ground control, traveling along the taxiway through a layout that seemed ever more familiar. Behind an enormous hanger, a grimacing crewman directed her with a set of marshaling paddles in the *strangest* shade of yellow towards a fairly small group of Kerbals with their hands pressed firmly to their heads. He scurried away as soon as she was stopped, clutching his own head. \n\nValentina went mechanically through the shut down procedures, feeling the uncomfortable little ball of nerves begin to grow in the back of her head. They *were* just people after, all, right? Surely, they couldn\u0027t be *that* different. Memories of the concert in Crimson Square the past summer bubbled up from somewhere. \n\nYes, yes they could. \n\nValentina worked her way carefully past the drooling Igor and shivering Junior Lieutenant. With nothing else to do for it, she turned the latch, and slid the side door open.  \n\nSomething slammed into her like a fist and wrenched the breath from her lungs. She had a firm grip on the handrail, else she might have tumbled from the doorway. She had to fight for each breath with straining lungs, the sweat suddenly running down her face amplifying the feeling that she was trying to breathe liquid. The humidity! It was beyond words! It felt so thick she could cut it with a knife. And the heat! It must be forty degrees out here! How could these people *live* like this?!\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*, they\u0027re coming this way now. With sheer force of will against the onslaught, Valentina composed herself, and tried to smile. Another smiling Kerbal stepped up to her. He wore a headset, which was odd, and a very dapper white vest, which was not. \n\n\u0022Major Kermanova, I presume?\u0022 The fellow\u0027s smile widened, \u0022I\u0027m Gene Kerman, the Flight Director here.\u0022\n\nHe paused for just a moment to clear his throat, and took a slip of paper from his pocket, \u0022on behalf of the Kerbal Space Administration, its member states, and partners, in hopes of greater understanding and cooperation among all Kerbals, welcome, to... the.... Kerbal..... Space....... Cen........\u0022\n\nHis mouth dropped open. Valentina blinked at him for a moment, then realized he was looking *behind* her. And *above*. The rest of the small crowd, too. She turned to follow their collective gaze, and saw that Igor had appeared in the doorway, and was staring new and ever sharper stabbing implements back at them. \n\nShe raised her hands, hoping her smile didn\u0027t look as forced as it felt, \u0022is... uh... is just Igor... um... is not staying... he... he is.... ah....\u0022 *P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS* what was the word? A dozen of them raced through her head, none of them right.\n\n\u0022*Nablyudatel*,\u0022 a new voice said, in confident, if strongly accented Ussari. It then continued in Kerblish, also strongly accented, \u0022ah\u0027m afraid the word doesn\u0027t really translate all the well into Kerblish, Gene. This tall feller is is something of a body guard... and a monitor.\u0022\n\nIt took only a moment for Valentina to realize why Igor\u0027s glare had no effect on this newcomer. He was so slimy it just slid right off. He was quite tall himself, dressed in a crisp, black suit with thin pinstripes. She had little knowledge of fashion, but could tell it must be expensive. The enormous elliptical belt buckle clad in silver and gold reinforced that. He had what looked like *another* belt buckle around his neck, also gold and silver, with a big pale blue stone in the center and a pair of decorated leather strings hanging from it. On his head was a truly *enormous* black hat, in the same style that was now so popular in Kermangrad, which he now tipped towards her.\n\n\u0022Pleasure to make your acquaintance, ma\u0027am. Name\u0027s John Ross, John Ross Kerman, junior. But, uh, everyone \u0027round here just calls me J.R.\u0022 He replaced his hat, and offered his hand. Valentina took it gingerly. It was soft, smooth, gripped with *just* the right pressure. A hand that had shaken many others. She released it, and had to consciously resist the urge to count her fingers. Despite all the black in this *ST\u0414LI\u0419 SM\u0414C\u041AI\u0419G* heat, he wasn\u0027t even sweating. \n\n\u0022Is pleasure to, uh, meet you, Mr. Kerman,\u0022 Kerman? They didn\u0027t look like brothers...\n\n\u0022J.R., please, ma\u0027am, *Mister* Kerman was mah daddy, and a bit too fond of his own name, y\u0027see,\u0022 he smiled broadly, \u0022Ah am the corporate lie-ay-zon to the KSA from Layland Heavy Industies. Ah understand y\u0027all over yonder have been doing some *truly* incredible things with our products, and Ah *do* hope to discuss the matter with y\u0027all some more.\u0022\n\nValentina kept the smile plastered to her face, hoping he would go away, which he did, nudging Gene as he stepped back, who was still staring at Igor.\n\n\u0022Huh? Oh, right, I\u0027m terribly sorry for any confusion, Mizz Kermanova, we weren\u0027t expecting an, um, entourage, but we\u0027ll work with that. Where was I? Oh...\u0022 He offered his own hand. Behind him were perhaps a dozen bright, grinning, slightly sweaty faces, one group standing a bit apart from the others. \n\n\u0022Welcome, to the Kerbal Space Center.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-11T05:39:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2016 05:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T05:04:16Z","Content":"**Chapter 42: Diplomacy**\n\n\u0022This is a bit new for all of us, ma\u0027am,\u0022 Gene Kerman continued, smiling nervously, \u0022the Board of Directors didn\u0027t give us much notice once they officially restarted the exchange program. We\u0027re still scrambling a bit, you see. I thought a small welcoming party like this might be less intimidating than a big public affair.\u0022\n\n*They have many parties...*\n\nValentina hoped her smile didn\u0027t look as fragile as it felt. *Say* *something!* *Say \u003Cu\u003Esomething\u003C/u\u003E, you fool!* She\u0027d had a speech... Spent half the fight memorizing it, struggling with the unfamiliar language, but she\u0027d thought she\u0027d had it down. Now it seemed to have vanished like her breath in this heat. She stared at Gene, trying to will her uncooperative mouth into motion. Gene stared at her. Igor stared at everyone. They stared back at him. Then her. Then him again. Some of the faces were scowling now. She thought she heard a cricket somewhere. But she didn\u0027t see--\n\nGene sighed, \u0022ok... if our two agencies are going to work together, someone\u0027s going to have to start the ol\u0027 trust train, so let it be me. While you\u0027re here, you\u0027re going to have the same respect and privileges as *my* Kerbonauts here. You\u0027ll be staying with them in the Kerbonaut Center and have the full run of the facility. We\u0027ll get you a proper tour once you\u0027ve had some time to settle in after your trip. There\u0027s a few places that are off limits for safety reasons, even for them, but let me know and--\u0022\n\nSuddenly the ground was shaken by a distant explosion, and a faint cry of \u0022wooHOO!\u0022 Igor was instantly in front of Valentina. \n\n\u0022Heads up!\u0022 Someone in the bunch yelled. All heads did so.\n\n\u0022Incoming!\u0022 Shouted someone else.\n\n\u0022Drifting left!\u0022 Called a third. \n\nSomething metallic clanged to the ground and bounced for a moment. It looked like some sort of piping. \n\n\u0022All clear!\u0022 In unison, the heads snapped back to Valentina, who was gaping in horror from behind Igor. \n\nGene slapped a hand to his face, \u0022that would be our R\u0026D center. Best if you keep your distance. They can be a bit...\u0022\n\nA secondary explosion rumbled the concrete, followed by a soft, \u0022eureka!\u0022\n\n\u0022...boisterous.\u0022\n\nAnother Kerbal with a pencil-thin mustache and thick-rimmed glasses stepped up and put a placating hand on Gene\u0027s shoulder.\n\n\u0022I vill talk vith zem again, Gene,\u0022 then he turned to Valentina and offered a hand, \u0022*guten Tag*, I am Dr. Wernher von Kerman, ze head of research and development here at ze KSC, *willkommen*.\u0022\n\nValentina stepped from behind Igor with only slight resistance. This one\u0027s accent... might he...? This whole thing was quickly turning into a disaster, she was struggling to keep up with the all the Kerblish, time to take a risk. \n\n\u0022*Guten Tag, Herr Doktor*,\u0022 Valentina said hesitantly, \u0022*sprechen Sie Kr\u00FCnisch*?\u0022\n\nWernher blinked twice, then his entire face lit up, \u0022*ja voll! Du sprichst Kr\u00FCnisch auch?*\u0022\n\nValentina wavered her hand, \u0022*etwas, um, sehr schlecht*.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Wunderbar!*\u0022 he nearly squealed, then nodded to the others, \u0022*diese Dummk\u00F6pfe nur Kerblish sprechen. Ach, das wird so sch\u00F6n!*\u0022\n\nIgor rumbled up next to her, \u0022what he say? What *you* say?\u0022\n\n\u0022I asked if he spoke Kr\u00FCnish, he said yes. Apparently *they* do not,\u0022 she answered in Ussari.\n\nWernher glanced at him, then shrugged, \u0022*fahrvergn\u00FCgen?*\u0022\n\nShe smiled, \u0022*funkengr\u00FCven!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Now what he say?\u0022 Igor frowned.\n\n\u0022He invited me to lunch, I said yes.\u0022\n\n\u0022*Fantastisch!*,\u0022 Wernher beamed, \u0022*neunundneunzig Luftballons, du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt, Feuer frei*.\u0022\n\nValentina stopped and blinked for a moment. \n\nIgor\u0027s eyes flicked back and forth, \u0022*now* what he say?\u0022\n\n\u0022Er, he said he and the other engineers have a potluck every M\u00FCnday, and please come, but... stay away from the casserole it... causes indigestion? I think I am mistranslating something...\u0022\n\nIgor glowered until Wernher backed away.\n\n\u0022Uh, Wernher here is the one who got all this going, after the early false starts,\u0022 Gene waved an arm toward the Space Center, trying not to look at Igor, \u0022and these are the guys who *really* trust him. Meet our Kerbonaut corps!\u0022\n\nA face now approached that Valentina most certainly recognized. He offered his left hand somewhat awkwardly, the right one still hanging in a simple sling. \n\n\u0022Edmund Kerman, ma\u0027am, it\u0027s a true honor to finally meet you.\u0022\n\n\u0022Captain Kerman, *D\u0414*, yes, honor is all mine, surely,\u0022 she took his hand after just a bit of fumbling, smiling broadly.\n\n\u0022Just Edmund, ma\u0027am, there\u0027s no military affiliation here. We hold no rank outside of our missions.\u0022 He smiled beneath a mustache that had not grown quite enough to cover the red, puffy scar on his upper lip.\n\n\u0022Edmund, then. Uh, Valentina, please,\u0022 she realized she was still clutching his hand and quickly let it go, \u0022you have been inspiration.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... have?\u0022\n\n\u0022D\u0414, yes... You have, how you say? Got back on horse, after such awful injury... is very brave.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s very kind of you, ma\u0027--uh, Valentina,\u0022 Edmund said, abashedly scratching at the back of his neck, \u0022just too stubborn for my own good, I suppose.\u0022\n\nHe gestured to the Kerbal next to him, \u0022I believe you\u0027ve met my comrade, here, after a fashion.\u0022\n\nComrade?\n\nThe other fellow stepped forward and spoke in horribly broken Ussari, \u0022greetings! Am person Jorrigh Kerman. Am welcomings of yuo to Space Kerbal Middle.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. \n\nPerson Jorrigh Kerman\u0027s smile faltered, then his shoulders fell. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s that bad, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 He said in Kerblish. \n\n\u0022Is... is getting better,\u0022 Valentina offered cheerfully. \n\nBehind her, Igor boomed, \u0022why he talk like clich\u00E9? Sound like bad joke. Is insult to language!\u0022\n\nValentina tensed her face and smiled as hard as she could to keep from laughing. \n\n\u0022I\u0027m supposed to go to Ussari for the next phase of the exchange program,\u0022 Jorrigh said sullenly, \u0022but I just can\u0027t anywhere with the language!\u0022\n\nValentina held her smile while she mentally scrambled for a response. What would Dibella do? She was the diplomatic one! Why didn\u0027t they send *her?!* She grabbed the first thing that wandered into her head. \n\n\u0022Perhaps... we speak together over tea, yes? What is word, chitchat, yes?\u0022 Then winced. \n\nJorrigh\u0027s eyes brightened, \u0022really? Yeah that would be swell mizz Valentina! Thanks!\u0022 He grabbed her hand and shook it very thoroughly, along with the rest of her. \n\n*Well, that wasn\u0027t so bad, she thought between convulsions, this is looking up a bit.* Valentina finally extracted a rather sore hand from the bright-eyed Kerbal, and turned to the next face. Which was scowling at her. \n\n\u0022Hmm, so you\u0027re the bigshot Ooski, eh?\u0022 He leered over folded arms, \u0022bit short for a pilot, aren\u0027t you?\u0022\n\nBefore Valentina could fully register the slight, another faced popped in... which looked exactly like the scowling one, minus the scowl. \n\n\u0022You\u0027ll have to excuse my brother here, he can be a bit... abrasive, until he warms up to you,\u0022 the newcomer thrust a hand out, \u0022pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... what?\u0022\n\nThe friendlier face chuckled, \u0022sorry, that\u0027s a bad joke. I\u0027m Dr. Jerdous Kerman, the grumpy one here is Burdous, we\u0027re the token science concession to the initial Kerbonaut rotation.\u0022 He smiled broadly. \n\n\u0022Traitor,\u0022 grumbled the one called Burdous. \n\n\u0022Oh... you are Kerbonaut doctor?\u0022 Valentina asked. This one seemed decent, at least. He had a very honest face. \n\n\u0022Oops, no I\u0027m not a medical doctor. I\u0027m an anthropologist by trade.\u0022\n\nShe ran the long word over in her head, \u0022so you... you study dead people, yes?\u0022\n\nJerdous put a hand to his chin, \u0022well that\u0027s one way of putting it, I suppose. An odd specialty for a Kerbonaut, I know. Burdous here is a talented engineer, but they wanted an interdisciplinary scientist to round out the mission profiles, so I got picked.\u0022\n\nThen he lowered his voice conspiratorially, \u0022personally, I think they just wanted to study the effects of long duration spaceflight on twins.\u0022\n\n\u0022That is... fascinating. Is pleasure to meet you, Dr. Kerman.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, it\u0027s just Jerdous,\u0022 he waved it away, \u0022you\u0027ll find we\u0027re not much for formality around here.\u0022\n\n\u0022Valentina, please,\u0022 she smiled.\n\nHe gave a little bow, \u0022the pleasure is all mine, Valentina.\u0022\n\n\u0022The twins will round out our final two flights,\u0022 Gene broke in, \u0022as I\u0027m sure you can attest, ma\u0027am, a single-pilot craft with only solid retros limits the piloting experience one can get. We\u0027ll be on to bigger and better things ourselves, shortly.\u0022\n\n*New KSA spacecraft...*\n\n*Here we go!*\n\n\u0022Yes, what do--\u0022 a raised voice from the other group cut Valentina off.\n\n\u0022Now, you wanna be careful what you call *piloting*, Gene. Wouldn\u0027t want our new friend here to get mixed up with the wrong crowd.\u0022\n\nStanding dramatically lit by the late afternoon sun was a group of Kerbals all with matching flight suits, mirrored sunglasses, and smirks. The one who had spoken was also wearing a long white scarf, which was strange in this heat, and was even shorter than Valentina, which was strange anywhere. \n\nGene grumbled under his breath, and began, \u0022these fine fellows are--\u0022\n\n\u0022The future,\u0022 the scarfed one cut in, \u0022these rockets are just a fad, a pacifier for a teething baby. The future is in spaceplanes, and that\u0027s our specialty. After all, we are...\u0022\n\nAs if on cue, the breeze picked up to flutter his white scarf, the others took up a... pose, and he smiled a gorgeous dimpled smile with brilliantly white teeth.\n\n\u0022The right stuff.\u0022 Somehow, the sun picked that moment to glint off his perfect teeth. \n\nValentina raised an eye... bulge. Gene mumbled something *else* under his breath. \n\n\u0022We are the KSA Spaceplane Corps,\u0022 the flawless smile said, then gestured to the others, \u0022this is Tin Turkey, Yeti, Ivylog, Garter Snake, and Waterfowl.\u0022\n\n\u0022And *I*,\u0022 he tugged his collar up and flashed another glinty smile, \u0022am Captain D.N. Kerman., you\u0027ve probably heard of me. I\u0027m a bit of a maverick.\u0022\n\nBeside Valentina, Gene put a hand to his face and sighed, \u0022there\u0027s no rank here, Dean, we\u0027re not military.\u0022\n\nValentina stifled a groan. *Diplomatic, be diplomatic!* \n\nSmiling, she held out a hand, \u0022Dean, is it?\u0022 It hung awkwardly in the air. \n\n\u0022That\u0027s *D.N.* Kerman to you. *Captain* D.N. Kerman.\u0022\n\n*Another* Kerman? Was *everyone* here named Kerman? And these strange letter-names...\n\n*Diplomacy*...\n\nWith effort, Valentina held her smile, \u0022what does D.N. mean?\u0022\n\nBurdous cupped his hands to his mouth, \u0022it means d-*ouch my shin!*\u0022 \n\nHe suddenly dropped to a knee and rapidly rubbed his lower leg. A small rock went clicking away across the concrete, unnoticed. \n\n\u0022Well that\u0027s on a need-to-know basis,\u0022 D.N. smiled with that horrible, beautiful smile. \n\n\u0022Dean was the first Kerbal to fly into space!\u0022 Blurted one of the pack behind him. Tin Turkey, was it?\n\nWait, *what?*\n\n\u0022*Sixth* Kerbal in space,\u0022 Burdous spat, still rubbing his shin, \u0022he always leaves that part out.\u0022\n\nD.N.\u0027s dimples never faltered, \u0022I was the first Kerbal to *fly* into space. Fly, by my own hand, not riding along while some gizmo or mechanical jeb does it for me. And I\u0027ll be the first Kerbal to *fly* into orbit, too, followed by my crew here. Spaceplanes are the way forward, in a few years no one will even remember that bunch of... cargo over there.\u0022\n\nHe leaned around Valentina, \u0022hi, Edmund. How\u0027s the arm? They make you an honorary chicken yet? Buhgok!\u0022\n\n\u0022Doing just fine, Dean,\u0022 Edmund grinned, \u0022there\u0027s an open booster seat waiting when you want to take up that arm wrestling challenge.\u0022\n\nDean\u0027s smile only faded for a moment before he turned back to Valentina, \u0022look, I hear you\u0027ve got some skills, so I\u0027ll give you this one chance to hang with us and learn some more.\n\n\u0022I told you,\u0022 Burdous yelled, \u0022he\u0027s a colossal d-*ouch my other shin!*\u0022 Another rock went clicking down the pavement. \n\n\u0022Owwwwwwwwwowowowowowowowowowowowowow!\u0022 He squealed as he rolled back and forth on the ground, gripping below his knees. \n\nValentina stared at D.N. He smiled at her. That flawless, disarming, *dimpled* smile.\n\n*Diplomatic.... be diplomatic... remember what\u0027s at stake here...*\n\nThe corners of Valentina\u0027s mouth turned up, \u0022y... yes I believe I have heard you.\u0022\n\nD.N. Raised an eye... bulge, grinning furiously.\n\n\u0022Yes, you are... what is word?\u0022 She bared a hint of teeth, \u0022buckaroo?\u0022\n\nHis smile vanished.  \n\nHer eyes passed over the rest of them, \u0022you are all bunch of cowboys, yes? Yee-hah?\u0022\n\nD.N.\u0027s face twisted into a snarl, and he poked a finger at her, \u0022you just watch yourself, Ooski, we don\u0027t need your kind around here!\u0022\n\nHe spun around, popping his collar again, \u0022come on, boys, let\u0027s jet. I feel the need...\u0022\n\n\u0022The need for speed?\u0022 Waterfowl offered helpfully. \n\nD.N. stopped and looked at him, \u0022no, you twit, for a drink! Let\u0027s go.\u0022\n\nThe group turned and walked off into the sunset. Quite dramatically. \n\nGene sighed heavily, his face an intriguing mix of different shades of green, \u0022I\u0027m really sorry about that, Mizz Kermanova, I thought he\u0027d behave himself today. Dean\u0027s an excellent pilot but that\u0027s also the only thing he respects, or understands. I\u0027ll see about getting you some flight time with him, maybe bridge the gap.\u0022 \n\n\u0022Valentina, please, um, Gene,\u0022 she smiled, \u0022it would seem some things are quite... universal.\u0022\n\nThey were the same all over the globe, she imagined. Fighter pilots. She *hated* fighter pilots!\n\n\u0022Well, that\u0027s mighty decent of you, m-- Valentina.\u0022\n\n\u0022But... I have not seen Sir Kerman here, he is well, no?\u0022\n\n\u0022*Sir* Kerman?\u0022 Gene pinched his brow, \u0022oh, you mean Chadvey! Um, don\u0027t call him sir, he hates that. He, uh, sends his regrets that he couldn\u0027t be here to welcome you in person, he\u0027s a bit tied up at the moment. Should be back in a couple of days.\u0022\n\nPresently, a small bus clad in brilliantly polished aluminum and the emblem of the KSA pulled to a stop nearby. Gene gestured towards it. \n\n\u0022Here, I\u0027ll help you with your things. We\u0027ve got a room for you in the Kerbonaut center near everyone else. We\u0027ve just finished a major expansion so it\u0027s a bit empty at the moment. There\u0027s a very informal dinner waiting if you\u0027d like, um, I think the chef made something called \u0027borscht.\u0027 Tonight, you can get settled in and relax, no expectation. Bit of a busy day tomorrow, I\u0027m afraid, that\u0027s the official welcoming ceremony, and a public open house to showcase our expansions.\u0022\n\nHe seemed to catch something in Valentina\u0027s expression, \u0022I know, I\u0027m not much for politics either, but, bare with me and we\u0027ll make this work somehow. I\u0027ll give you the official tour after that, and there\u0027s Burdous\u0027s launch on M\u00FCnday, and if you\u0027d like...\u0022\n\nValentina allowed herself to be led back towards the Converter for her bag, suddenly realizing how tired she was. This was going to be an ordeal, all right. This \u0027Dean\u0027 person was a raging *ST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041AI\u0423*. Even if he did have dimples. *Incredible* dimples. The others seemed amicable enough, mostly, but she was disappointed about Sir Kerman, she\u0027d been looking forward to talking with him again. Edmund... he had a quick wit, there was more to him than on the surface, she suspected. Speaking with Jorrigh would help her practice her Kerblish without looking like a *complete* fool, and this Jerdous... His brother was a *P\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI,* but Jerdous had a very honest face.\n\nShe liked him right away.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-12T09:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2016 09:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**\n  \nItalics \u0026 spelling fix"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T11:36:14Z","Content":"![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Honest face huh?
