For the latter mode, a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.3 - 0.4 is more than sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRapiers are excellent in the supersonic regime and far outclass panthers and whiplashs at higher mach speeds. At a velocity near zero, they are suboptimal. 2 tons of Rapier engines give you 105kN of thrust (but 465.64 kN at Mach 3.75). A Panther gives you 85 kN of thrust for 1.2 tons, which is better per kilogramm than the rapier. And this is in dry mode. If you use the Panther in wet mode, you get 135 kN for 1.2 tons of engine. Toggling between wet and dry mode is almost instantly, which saves you the spool up and down time of jet engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, maybe replacing some of the Rapiers with Panthers will allow for better control at take-off and landing for less mass without losing much performance in the higher velocity ranges.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyways, cool video.
