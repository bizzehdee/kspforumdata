Because the powder \u0027melts\u0027 and then creates a slight \u0027relief\u0027. The reason this is useful (at least, within the craft world) is that you can create nice relief\u0027s without destroying the card / paper. \n\nAlso, it means that you can use a stamp, throw some of the powder on it, melt it, and you have an embossed image (from the stamp).\n\n[Talk about a detour in discussions ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ]"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaming Kraken","CreatedById":146059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:25:48Z","Content":"That is pretty awesome.

On that prototype, it looks like they mostly use sockets that would be 2 rows of either 14 or 16 pins, and those would stick through the board, and have tall posts for connections. A wire wrap tool is inserted on each post and twisted, tightly wrapping a thin wire on each post. No solder is needed (though you can solder each wire to the post for added durability, if you wish to keep your prototype).\n\nRather than what you assumed was no chips, you are looking at a massive collection of small scale integration chips, but they are on the other side of the board. small scale integration refers to chips with only a few logic gates per chip. They did not build a processor with a single chip... they built every logic gate inside the processor from scratch, from individual logic gates. Pretty hardcore! The bottom one MIGHT be a diode matrix, but I\u0027m not sure. That would make sense as a stand in for the cartridge ROM chip.\n\nI wired my custom keyboard that I built using wire wrap wiring, but rather than leave it messy, I laced down all the loose wires.  \n\nWire lacing...

On small stuff like this, I use unflavored waxed dental floss. My longest run starts in the top right and moves inward toward the Teensy 2.0, then it goes down the right side of the Teensy, hooks right, turns down again when it hits the LED driver board, follows the bottom edge all the way to the left hand side, turns upwards, makes a slight detour by the shift key, and then continues up, goes left a key, then back right toward the Teensy, and then binds the left side and bottom of the Teensy. All one piece of string. No cuts, just knotting.
