Not even the placid lake of a thirty-seven tree Kerm; wide but shallow, untroubled by wind or rain. Instead curtains of numinous fire ran from horizon to horizon, bathing the mindscape around him in the pure, unsullied joy of a being finally made whole and set at peace with itself. The sparks gambolled before him, familiar tools now, still to be respected but no longer to be feared or used as weapons of war.\u00A0 Centuries of stored memories stretched out before him, reaching back into prehistory; buttressed with the deep and comforting knowledge that they were there to be absorbed, studied and to bestow wisdom in that studying. Already flickers of lightning danced around him, illuminating and reshaping whatever they touched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENot a vessel to be filled but a fire to be lit\u003C/em\u003E, murmured Jonton in awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u003Cem\u003Eyes\u003C/em\u003E\u0026gt; said Elton. \u0026lt;\u003Cem\u003Estrange words but I\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\u0026gt; A fresh wave of joy lit up the mindscape. \u0026lt;\u003Cem\u003EI think I understand them!\u003C/em\u003E\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs everything alright, Keeper?\u201D\u00A0 With an effort, Jonton dragged his attention back to the blurry figure tugging at his hand. He blinked and the anxious face of the younger medic swam into view. \u201CKeeper?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled beatifically at him. \u201CEverything\u2019s just fine,\u201D he answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic swallowed hard. \u201CAnd\u2026 the Kerm?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that, Jonton laughed out loud. \u201CHe,\u201D he declared, \u201Cis much, much more than alright!\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree bewildered faces looked back at him. Then Erlin\u2019s jaw dropped open. \u201COh sweet\u2026 Are you saying\u2026?\u201D He stared wide-eyed at the great trunk behind Jonton\u2019s head. \u201CGusemy needs to know about this I think,\u201D he said faintly. \u201CPreserve me, the Council\u2026 everyone needs to know about this!\u201D He blinked. \u201CBut \u2018he\u2019, Jonton? Kerm are self-seeding plants for goodness sake. They don\u2019t even\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerm do have male or female Keepers though,\u201D said Gerselle.

That makes sense\u2026I think.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI wish I could say the same, \u201C said the older medic with asperity. \u201CWould somebody mind telling me just what on Kerbin is going on here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs I said to somebody else a long time ago,\u201D said Jonton, \u201CIt would be easier to show than tell.\u201D Hastily he cast his mind back to his communion with Gusemy, Obrett and Erlin and offered the memory of Erlin\u2019s mental voice to Elton. \u003Ci\u003EThis one has communed before but I\u2019m not sure if the other two have. \u003C/i\u003E\u201CTake a bunk, good kerbals,\u201D he said aloud. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter which one - they\u2019re all much the same.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic glanced sidelong at Erlin and raised his eyebrows. Erlin nodded, doing his best to look reassuring. \u201CI know,\u201D he said, \u201CThat\u2019s what I thought too the first time but it\u2019ll be fine, trust me.\u201D He studied the Kerm trunk again, the corners of his mouth turning up in an involuntary grin as his curiosity began to get the better of him. Confidently, he led the way over to the bunks and picked one nearest to Jonton. \u201CIn fact, I think \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s going to be fine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton\u2019s leaves uncoiled from the the scalps of three stunned kerbals. Erlin\u2019s eyes shone with unshed tears as he stared wordlessly at Jonton. The older medic rolled over on his bunk, opened his mouth to speak only to close it again. He reached above his head, brushing his fingertips over leaves that, until moments ago, had been lodged in his brain. \u003Ci\u003EDry\u003C/i\u003E, he thought.\u003Ci\u003E So impossibly dry. \u003C/i\u003EReverently, he pressed his fingers against the whorled bark around the base of the leaf cluster. \u201CCan we do this for all of them?\u201D he said plaintively\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe have to,\u201D his colleague said softly. \u201CWe can\u2019t just leave them\u2026 deny them their chance at that.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t think so either,\u201D said Erlin. \u201CHow could we?\u201D He buried his face in his hands for a second before smoothing his hair back and lacing his fingers together behind his head. \u201CWe\u2019ll need to find a better way though.\u201D He flicked a glance at Jonton then shook his head. \u201CGoing an-Kerm nearly killed you and if you\u2019d died, then who knows what would happened to Elton\u2019s mind.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s because Jonton went through it alone.\u201D Four heads snapped round to face Enely, now sitting upright on his bed. \u201CBut nobody else needs to.\u201D He looked Erlin in the eye. \u201CGerselle and I separated Jonton - the kerbal Jonton - from Elton by providing anchors for them to form around. What if we do that from the beginning?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo on,\u201D said Erlin intently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely held out his hands. \u201CPlant the thirty-eighth tree in a Grove,\u201D he said. \u201CKeep watch over it, make sure that when the black spots come, the Keeper and two Anchors are all communing. One Anchor supports the Keeper whilst he - or she - helps the Kerm. The other Anchor supports the Kerm. Perhaps that way there will be no shattering at all. But if there is, then we can learn from Jonton.\u201D\u00A0 Enely looked at the former an-Kerm apologetically. \u201CYou fought to keep the shards of Elton\u2019s mind intact,\u201D he said. \u201Cand to keep yourself apart from them. I am thinking that was a mistake. Perhaps if the shards had been allowed to melt faster, then they might have healed faster too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two medics gaped at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle frowned, scratching the bridge of her nose as she thought it through. \u201CThe two Anchors would need to practice communing first,\u201D said Jonton slowly. \u201Cand let the Kerm get used to them as well as its Keeper.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019d also need to be carefully chosen,\u201D said Gerselle. \u201COne of them would need to know the Keeper very well and the other\u2026\u201D Her voice trailed away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely offered her a small half-smile. \u201CYes,\u201D he said, \u201CBut I would be glad to. Perhaps a third Anchor to help me and to show others in turn? I do not think I could help every Kerm on Kerbin.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin looked at them. \u201CI think I need to make a call, \u201C he said at last. \u201CCould I borrow your phone, Gerselle?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course,\u201D said Gerselle. \u201CIt\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHead whirling, Erlin walked out of the sleep room, shutting the door behind him. He retrieved his jacket from its peg, reached into a small buttoned-down, pocket inside and took out a plain embossed card. Mentally he ran through the procedure that Donman had taught him, took a deep breath, picked up the phone and dialled the number on the card.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon, Chief Ambassador Donman\u2019s office. How may I help you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon. My name is Professor Erlin Kerman, from the Berelgan Institute. I\u2019d like to request an advisory call with the Chief Ambassador please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid the Ambassador is in a Council meeting, Professor but I shall arrange an emergency conference call at his earliest convenience. Do you have a number he can reach you on?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do,\u201D said Erlin politely, \u201Cbut I did request an \u003Cem\u003Eadvisory\u003C/em\u003E rather than an emergency call. Please could you inform the Chief Ambassador that this is a Bar-Katon matter, priority zero.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe voice in his ear sounded oddly strained. \u201CI understand, Professor but please be advised that the Ambassador is in a closed Council session and cannot be disturbed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cold lump dropped into the pit of Erlin\u2019s stomach. \u201CThen I await the Ambassador\u2019s pleasure,\u201D he replied. \u201CPlease could you let him know that I\u2019m with a pair of mutual friends. I believe he has their number but just in case.\u201D Erlin read off the number taped to the base of the phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Professor. I shall see that the Ambassador gets your message. Good afternoon.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd a good afternoon to you also.\u201D Erlin put the phone down and stared unseeingly at the wall, the cold lump twisting his insides into a savage knot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman hurried into the Council chamber, eyes flicking around the table as he nodded to Obrick and took his seat next to him. Behind a carefully impassive face, his heart sank at the sight of the two empty seats opposite Lanrick and Burvis. Then the great chamber doors thudded shut and any last flickering hope of good news was extinguished by the stony Firesvarn faces in front of him. President Enemone stalked up to the podium, stabbed a finger at the microphone button and, with no further preamble, began to speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals.\u201D Enemone\u2019s utterly flat delivery spoke more eloquently of her opinion of that greeting than any further words could. \u201CFiresvar has convened this closed session of the Council of Twelve Pillars to bring you a report\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Lapwing long range search and reconnaissance plane jettisoned its drop tanks and turned north for Firesvar. Descending to visual altitude it began a methodical search pattern, looping back and forth over it\u2019s allocated section of coast, its pilot scanning for any seagoing vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalfway through his sweep he found one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small ship tucked into a remote bay, a lack of wake marking it as riding at anchor. The Lapwing banked low, skimming over the waves, relying on speed and the low sun to protect it from any anti-aircraft fire. The pilot caught a glimpse of two dinghies pulled up on the beach, then he was past them, past the cliffs, over the nearby forest and banking sharply for a second pass. A flick of a switch and the centreline camera pod whirred into life, film clacking rapidly past the shutters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the ground, a squad of kerbals broke cover, sprinting for the treeline, slowed by the heavy packs on their backs. The aircraft roared overhead, turned and came back for a third pass, the long coastal grass snapping back and forth in the turbulence of its passing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPatrol craft two-zero-six reporting contact in designated sector delta-five. One vessel, two dinghies, crew sighted and confirmed making for treeline. Two-zero-six remaining on-sector till minimum safe fuel, recommend deploying pickup team asap.\u201D The pilot paused. \u201CContact looks fresh, Control, if they don\u2019t run first, pickup team may be able to repatriate.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnemone\u2019s gaze swept the Council chamber before settling on Lanrick and Burvis. \u201CFiresvar therefore regretfully informs Wakira of its\u00A0decision to invoke Article 24 of the Bill of Land, effective immediately.\u201D Her voice hardened. \u201CFiresvar also reserves the right to invoke Article 24 against any other Regionality found to be aiding or abetting the organisation calling itself the Children of Kerbin. Good day to you all.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two Firesvarn marched stiffly out of the Council chamber, leaving a stunned silence in their wake. Burvis turned a furious shade of mottled green and opened her mouth to speak before a minute gesture from a flinty-eyed Lanrick made her snap it shut again in a thin-lipped, humourless smile. Chadwick and Aldwell exchanged glances, impassive faces not quite hiding the sudden shadows behind their eyes. \u003Ci\u003EAnd no wonder\u003C/i\u003E, thought Donman, \u003Ci\u003Egiven their decidedly pro-Kerm stance\u003C/i\u003E. Aldwell mumbled a perfunctory farewell before leaving the chamber behind his President. Burvis and Lanrick followed closely behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Doreni leaders departed without saying a word. The openly worried Veiidan leaders nodded politely and left, leaving Donman and Obrick at an empty Council table staring at each other in disbelief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you think we can stay out of it?\u201D said Donman at last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201CI think so,\u201D he replied, \u201CIf anything, this should keep Wakira off our backs along the Northwest Border. I\u2019ll order Commander Valentina to step up the patrols but pull back to our side of the border and stay neutral. Then I\u2019ll need to call an emergency session of the Ruling Council - I trust you\u2019ll summon the Enclave?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman nodded. \u201CI will. In fact I think we should declare a joint session.\u201D He paused. \u201CWhat about Starseed?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFortunately,\u201D said Obrick, \u201CRockomax and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E are still shouldering most of the heavy lifting there. I think we have to assume that the Wakiran contributions are going on hold for the interim but I\u2019ll have to speak to Lanrick as soon as possible about securing Site D. The Skyhawk program is coming along well according to Lodan but still very much in the experimental phase\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI hate to say it,\u201D said Donman, \u201Cbut what about Doren?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick sighed. \u201CProbably what they always do - stay neutral and extract as much political capital as they can for doing nothing. We need them to hold up their end of Starseed but Kerm knows what they\u2019ll demand for it after Humilisia. He rubbed his forehead tiredly. \u201CI need a drink.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy office is closer if you\u2019ll settle for a coffee,\u201D replied Donman.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMay as well start as we mean to go on,\u201D said Obrick. \u201CLead on, Ambassador.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorsen looked up from his monitor as Donman and Obrick strode into the office. \u201CA short meeting, sir,\u201D he noted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShort and to the point,\u201D said Donman heavily. \u201CAny messages?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust one, sir.\u201D Corsen walked over to the coffee percolator on its table and began scooping ground beans into the filter basket. \u201CA priority zero call from Professor Erlin at the Berelgan regarding the Bar-Katon matter.\u201D He looked at Donman apologetically. \u201CI would have sent word immediately, sir, but under the circumstances\u2026?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman waved it away. \u201CIndeed. Did Erlin leave a number?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn your desk sir.\u201D Corsen saw the expression on Obrick\u2019s face and added an extra scoopful to the basket. \u201CI\u2019ll bring the coffee through once it\u2019s done.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDonman nodded his thanks and held his office door open for Obrick. It closed behind the two kerbals with a quiet but definite sounding click. Swiftly, he crossed the room and picked up the phone. \u00A0\u201CGood afternoon. Could I speak to Professor Erlin.\u201D A pause. \u201CYes, he said. With respect, Professor, this had better be good. Yes, I thought it would be.\u201D Donman sat bolt upright. \u201CHe did what? A medical team first? Well we can thank the Kerm for small mercies I suppose. So was the procedure successful?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick\u2019s eyes widened at the sudden expression on Donman\u2019s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery much so, Professor and more than you can imagine.

If Jeb had two busted legs he\u2019d get someone to wheel him in behind that console.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u2019s reply was muted. \u201CWish I knew, Bob and it\u2019s the note that worries me most\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob completed his thought. \u201CYep - definitely not Jeb\u2019s style.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo. I think I\u2019ll go and find him tomorrow morning, see if anything\u2019s up.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob fell silent for a moment. \u201CThat\u2019d make me feel better too, Gene - thanks. Tell him the crew were asking after him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah\u2026 yeah I will do.\u201D Geneney pressed a button and waited for the console light to come back on before adjusting his headset. \u201CCommand loop checks out, Bob. Telemetry links look good - Lucan can run you through the formal tests on his next shift.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure thing, Flight. If Luco could wait till after breakfast that\u2019d be nominal. How\u2019re things over on your side of the M\u00FCn anyway?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney chuckled softly. \u201CRibory\u2019s sound asleep. Chad was too excited to get his head down so the science teams at Alpha and Foxham set up an extra session for him to run through the day\u2019s results. They\u2019re just finishing up now. A good day all in all, even if most of it\u2019s geology to me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know that feeling, Flight - on both counts. Not quite what I meant though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Geneney said resignedly, \u201CI thought it wasn\u2019t.\u201D He fidgeted with the lead on his headset. \u201CNo news on that front, Bob, probably because any news team with a gram of sense is getting out of the war zone as fast as they can. Lodan\u2019s been in meetings with the President and Chief Ambassador all day, so at least Starseed still seems to be on the priority list.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWar zone,\u201D Bob repeated. \u201CWe should send the Firesvarn Pillars out here, Gene - give them the view from four hundred thousand kilometres and let them see what they\u2019re really fighting over.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s a tempting thought,\u201D Geneney agreed. \u201CAnyhow, that\u2019s Chad finished and according to my flight schedule, it\u2019s time you were heading under the couches yourself. We\u2019ve got the ship, Bob - sleep tight and don\u2019t let the kraken bite.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSee you in the morning, Dad.\u201D Bob said dryly. \u201CSix, signing off for the night.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe warehouse stairs creaked underfoot, the aroma of old take-out food hanging in the air as Geneney climbed the stairs to Jeb\u2019s room. He put his ear against the closed door, listening hard for a moment before reluctantly knocking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you in there, Jeb?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long minute there was silence and then, much to his relief, he heard a muffled grunt from inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay if I come in?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second grunt percolated through the door, which Geneney chose to interpret as a yes. He turned the handle and gingerly opened the door, only for the\u00A0smell of stale food to hit him in the face, mingled with a changing room miasma of rancid sweat and old socks. Hastily he closed the door, the click of the latch eliciting a third grunt from the shapeless heap stirring on the bed. Geneney surveyed the unwashed dishes stacked up in the sink and the pile of discarded clothes in one corner of the room.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLong night, Jeb? \u201D he said conversationally, \u201CI don\u2019t reckon I\u2019ve seen your room like this since the good old Institute days.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u2019s head emerged from under the bedcovers. Geneney kept his expression carefully neutral at the sight of his friends unkempt, greasy hair and the dark green bags under his eyes. \u201CDo you want to talk about it?\u201D he added gently, sitting down on the edge of the bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his head. \u201CNothing to talk about,\u201D he said. \u201CJust another long week at the office, that\u2019s all. Haven\u2019t had time for much else.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CGloomy in here,\u201D he said. \u201CMind if I open the drapes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shrugged. \u201CSure.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney crossed the room, pulled back the blinds and opened the window a notch. The warm air from outside wafted in, cutting cleanly through the fug and stirring up ripples on the fetid grey water lurking around the dishes in the sink. He eyed the collection of beer bottles leaning against the draining board. \u003Cem\u003EOkay, forget about going to Jorfurts.\u003C/em\u003E \u201CWell that settles it,\u201D he said briskly, \u201CI need a coffee, you look like you could use one too and I\u2019d hate to disrupt whatever experiment you\u2019ve got growing in here. No point heading over to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, Derny\u2019ll be run off his feet.\u201D Geneney turned to look at Jeb. \u201CMy place will be a bit quieter and I\u2019ve even got some anise in the back of the cupboard somewhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite himself, Jeb smiled. \u201CIt\u2019s good of you Genie but there\u2019s no need. I\u2019m fine - it\u2019s been a long week is all.\u201D He gestured around at the cluttered room. \u201CI should get up, clear some of this junk away, get back to work. Prospector 1 isn\u2019t gonna launch itself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd all of that,\u201D said Geneney firmly, \u201Cwill look a whole lot easier after a walk to clear your head, lunch that doesn\u2019t come in a kebab box, and a hot coffee to wash the last of the cobwebs out of that skull of yours.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb held up his hands in mock surrender. \u201COkay, okay. But you\u2019d better be right about that anise.\u201D He climbed out of bed, revealing a pair of creased and travel worn undershorts and went through to his moss room, closing the door behind him. Geneney waited for a second then retrieved a bin bag from under the sink and began gathering up the worst of the detritus. He rinsed out the empty bottles, dumped them into a recycling bag and was about to start on the washing up when he heard the moss room door opening behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m\u003Cem\u003E fine\u003C/em\u003E, Gene. I told you I\u2019d clear this up myself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney turned around to face a damp and considerably fresher Jeb. \u201CI know you did,\u201D he said equably. \u201CJust thought I\u2019d make myself useful whilst I was waiting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb eyed him suspiciously for a moment, then began rummaging around in his wardrobe. \u201CWell in that case, if you could leave them outside the door. I\u2019ll dump them when I get back.\u201D He emerged, pulling a clean shirt over his head. \u201CYou know?\u201D he said in a muffled voice, \u201CI think you\u2019re right about that coffee.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2776921\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 69\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2875158\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 71\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T14:39:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwinKerbal","CreatedById":161536,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T14:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was not disappointed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plecy75","CreatedById":158708,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T15:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew file is up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zado0da6tfjyr1e/First%20Flight.docx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zado0da6tfjyr1e/First Flight.docx?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike for continued updates!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T04:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222793207\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002230718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475934287\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand reached out, snapped a switch, and a little more light went out of the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIll bodings indeed, if it can shut \u003Cem\u003EJeb\u003C/em\u003E down.
