There are a number of rules that can be broken in creative or informal writing, but you have to know the rules \u003Cem\u003Efirst!!!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Sentence fragments. Multiple exclamation points. Exclamation points at all! Comma splicing, commas themselves.\u00A0You need to know the rules of usage so that you can better understand what \u0027mistakes\u0027 to make, and which ones you shouldn\u0027t and when you\u0027ve made a number of mistakes in rapid succession like I just did (in order to make an example). And better use of grammar promotes, longer, clearer, and more varied sentences. Subject/verb sentences are excellent, but it\u0027s inexcusable to use them because you can\u0027t find another way of phrasing action because your knowledge of commas and clauses is limited (I\u0027m referring to myself). If you want to write formally, too, you shouldn\u0027t have to completely change your mode of thinking; grammar should be natural; you\u0027re going to have to edit someday.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd beyond that, it\u0027d be a real shame if your ideas were discarded because you put an apostrophe in the wrong place and came off as an amatur as a result.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEhco\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick disclaimer: My grammer\u0027s not spectacular, nor do I claim to be an expert, but I think proper form is important for no other reason than to wilfully misuse the english language; you can\u0027t deliberately break the rules without knowing what rules there are.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T17:16:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 05:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ehco Corrallo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESeriously, don\u0026#039;t look too closely; I probably made some unforgivable mistakes considering I was playing grammar off as a righteous necessity.
