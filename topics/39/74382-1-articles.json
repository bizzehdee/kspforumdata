I had just unlocked the BACC SRB and I decided to use it for my launch state. I stuck a command pod with a heat shield on the bottom and a parachute on the top above a nice big SRB, stuck some winglets and goo on it, and went to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday\u0027s pilot was Captain Jack \u0022Harkness\u0022 Kerman, a fairly courageous and intelligent pilot, who could always tell when something was about to go a bit explodey. He had previously been my very first test pilot for a series of suborbital launches on my sandbox save. I trusted Jack, and he trusted me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched the rocket and things went okay for a while. I got an apoapsis of around 240 kilometers by the time I finished my burn. I got up to that height, measured out my mystery goop and did an EVA/Crew report, and got back in to prepare for reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deployed the parachute and turned myself for the atmospheric reentry process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was at around 20 kilometers when the unthinkable happened. Despite all my precautions, the parachute exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no chutes to protect it from the harshness of gravity, doom was envitable.
