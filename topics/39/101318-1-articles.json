Kerman\n\nHead Counsel of the Confederation\n\nSubject:\n\nSurvival of the Space Program\n\nMy fellow citizens,\n\nAs you all know, over five hundred years ago our forefathers, many diehard environmentalists, decided that the best thing for the planet was to live underground. Vast underground cities were dug out, super-fast underground transportation systems were developed, thermoelectric generators were created which used the very warmth of the planet to keep our civilization going. Our meat animals, pets, domesticated flora were brought into underground barns and farms.\n\nWe learned to live, work, and love deep under the surface believing that by doing so we were helping our dear planet, Kerbin, and while away from Kerbol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s loving sunshine we thought we were doing the right thing.\n\nOver 30 years ago it was decided to send a surface team to check out how lovely and rich the new biosphere of the planet had become.\n\nAnd they found a waste.\n\nWithout us much of the animal life on the surface had died out. The wild creatures had lived off our trash, they had sheltered in our buildings during the coldest of months and the hottest of seasons, and millions lived off our very bodies. When we buried ourselves we doomed them all to die out.\n\nThe soil had been destroyed by our chemicals and farming methods even while we retreated to the caverns. Only a few plants were found to have survived here and there.\n\nThe oceans were lifeless. Our waste, which we had dumped into the waters, had fed many of the bottom feeders and one-cell animals. They were the roots of the food chain. When we cut off their food we cut down the tree of life within the oceans.\n\nThe very air was so bad that we now have to wear spacesuits on the surface of our own planet. And those birds you hear are mostly scavengers. \n\nIn order to understand what had happened, we created the Kerbal Space Center to carry out a study of our planet and the other nearby worlds.\n\nWe have explored Kerbin and placed stations around it and Mun. We have flown to the North Pole and scouted out the ruins of our past. We have gained much knowledge and great glory.\n\nBut two weeks ago new laws were passed, against my will, designed to limit our impact on the surface of Kerbin and other planets. One of these laws will be effecting the industry dealing with fuel production. It will force them to decrease it over the next few months.\n\nI need the KSC staff and those involved with the Kerbal Space Program in general to do their best to deal with these troubling times. We need to find new methods, new designs, and new equipment to overcome the barriers that have been put in front of us.\n\nThank you,\n\nsigned with respect,\n\nF. D. Kerman\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo:\n\nAll KSC staff\n\nFrom:\n\nB. V. Kerman\n\nDirector of KSC\n\nSubject:\n\nOur short-term objectives\n\nOkay folks, you have all seen the copy of the message from the Head-Banana of the Confederation.\n\nWell, there is more bad news, not just the laws that hurt our fuel tanks.\n\nIt has been detected that our own sun, Kerbol, will be having increase solar activity soon. As you know, this sometimes causes quakes on Mun and causes all kinds of havoc with our equipment. Our A.I units always, ALWAYS, go off line and need to be replaced. \n\nBut the fuel problem MAY be overcome soon. Our Science guys and those other nerds, the engineers, have found that many planets and their moons have material that can, if properly processed, can give us the fuel we need. Lately, most of our craft have been launching with half empty tanks anyway, to decrease their mass, so a shortage in fuel may not hurt us until later.\n\nNow, we are soon to be getting more hands to help in our labor in the form of female crewmembers. Yes, girls, so start shaving and using deodorant. They are still in training but I want you to start acting normal NOW. Think of it as your training. No more shirtless video calls.\n\nWhat I need from you guys are four things:\n\n1. Find ways to make craft that can be used multiply times in multiply ways - no more decommissioning a craft just because you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need it for the next few weeks. The Fuel Trailers and the program to develop the Space Tugs as the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMule\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of space are a good start. We also have a Orbital Tug that is being tested as I write this. \n\n![jR94dWr.png](http://i.imgur.com/jR94dWr.png)\n\n2. The Science Station around Kerbin, the ISS C.J.Cherryh, must be reconfigured to be used as a high traffic Fueling Station and Base of Operations for Kerbin orbit. That means that some modules may have to be removed or replaced. I want a careful study on all choices - we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t waste any material or any fuel.\n\n![Nek5iP4.png](http://i.imgur.com/Nek5iP4.png)\n\n3. We have a small base on the Mun and a orbiting Science Station. We will have to search for spots on the Mun where we can find the material we need for the processing of fuel. Mining Craft, Transport Craft and other craft will need to be designed and created for this. The Science Station, the ISS Lisanne Norman, must be used as a Base of operations and a Fueling Station. I want it ready.\n\n![uwJJg2g.png](http://i.imgur.com/uwJJg2g.png)\n\n4. As we will only launch craft and fuel when we NEED to, we must do our best, with every launch, to deliver skilled crew to our station and bases. I want engineers on the spot to repair equipment and trained pilots to do the flying. I want our scientists to record and study and give the KSC feedback on everything we do - so as to improve on it. See Point 1.\n\nAs you also may know, the Stephen Baxter, our working Space Tug, had two A.I units attacked to it with ports. The idea is damaged units can be replaced when needed. Or even moved to second ship if not needed by the first one. \n\n![WDuITUV.png](http://i.imgur.com/WDuITUV.png)\n\nNo more wielding the things to the hulls of the ship and having to destroy half the craft just to get them off.\n\nSo let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s get on it! Move, move, move! I want reports and suggestions on my desk by tomorrow.\n\nsigned,\n\nI said MOVE!\n\nB. V.

Kerman\n\nDirector of KSC\n\nFrom \n\nJebediah Kerman\n\nSenior Pilot of ISS C.J. Cherryh\n\nSubject:\n\nStatus Report\n\nGreetings,\n\nAfter filing a official complaint against your first set of orders I have followed them. The \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEscape\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Pod has been undocked after we took anything of value from it. Yes, yes, I know the proper term is unberthed. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153t care. Once again I protest this action. You know, as while as much of the staff, that is was not just an escape pod but a delivery system for the station\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s crew. \n\n![ZdYcwrO.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZdYcwrO.png)\n\nWhen it was time for the three crew members to leave they would use the pod. And the three new crew to Kerbal the station would come up with the new pod.\n\nAs for it being worthless, that is your fault. You shipped up more staff then the pod could handle. We have eight Kerbals up here! Three Pilots, three Scientists, and two Engineers. And ONE spaceship. ONE! Why three pilots?\n\nYes, I know we need the docking ports. And yes, I know one is occupied forever by the additional habitation module. But surely one of the three docking ports could have a craft of some kind ready for returning to Kerbin if need be. \n\nEnough of that. Your other order - to remove the unneeded extensions have been carried out. They are now ready for future unneeded extensions. \n\n![oJIoIEw.png](http://i.imgur.com/oJIoIEw.png)\n\n![K7wBkXe.png](http://i.imgur.com/K7wBkXe.png)\n\nI left Gilcott Kerman in command while I did the piloting myself. Didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to turn on the Tug\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nuclear engines, not that anybody wants those on so close to the station, and even saved some of the fuel from the discarded tanks. BUT used up about three-fourths of my RCS fuel and that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no joke. After all, when you think about, I docked three times in a row.\n\n![jOdkbbf.png](http://i.imgur.com/jOdkbbf.png)\n\n![LbMBZ12.png](http://i.imgur.com/LbMBZ12.png)\n\nI think the only reason I have any monopropellant left is because the two A.I. units came with some. I also think their probes are helping a tad with handling. Anyway, I know the station has a huge tank of the stuff but send more anyway.\n\nFrom now one I would suggest that the Space Tug, and future Space Tugs, be only used for Kerbin-Moon hauling. \n\nBob and Bill are both doing well. Of course they are - I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m the one that has been in command of this station for the past SEVEN years! \n\nOh, and we need more of the red food cubes. It was a real hit with the crew the last few weeks and now we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re out of them. Right now we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re living on the brown paste we get from the food recycler and we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re all just a tad sick of it. I even miss the green gel in a tube we use to eat on the Mun visits.\n\nsigned,\n\nI didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know she was you wife!\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nWell, you asked about life on the Mun. Not much to say. I man the Ranger Station here at the Historical landing site, where Bill Kerman, the first Kerbal to walk on the Mun, landed. Funny, we sometimes use man or Kerbal. Sorry, I always get off track.\n\n![ztRSFdx.png](http://i.imgur.com/ztRSFdx.png)\n\nSo here I am, watching over the flag and an old T-Rover from the time period. It looks small compared to my T-Buggy but they both handle badly on the Mun. They have a habit of not wishing to turn, even when you turn the SAS off. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been told it is the tires they both use. No reason to drive anywhere anyway, nothing to see.\n\nI mean, if I was a scientist and the base has science stuff, I might drive about and collect samples. But I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m an engineer. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here to make sure the equipment is kept in order and that visitors don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break it.\n\nThe site is in the Mun Highlands. I guess it is better then being on one of the flat boring plains. But landing here can be a tad dangerous. Slopes all over the place. \n\nThey say there may be mining on the Mun in the future and I am not sure but it may happen near me. While I am in the Highlands I also seem to be in a crater - maybe the hills around me were created when a large asteroid hit the Mun? Either way, it could be the material needed for the creation of fuel may be all around me.\n\n![YXnrtpJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/YXnrtpJ.png)\n\nThe Ranger Station is really just a lander with a two-crew command cabin. It gives me more room to relax or move around than some of the other command modules. The A.I. unit was decoupled and the engines turned off. It is now a base for the rest of its life. Funny, in a few years it will be the only space craft of its kind. All others will have ports for A.I. units.\n\nIt was a model very much like it that landed the Buggy and will likely be used in future landings. But those will all have A.I. units to help direct their operations and senior ports to carry cargo. I wonder if they are fun to chat with? The A.I. units, I mean. \n\nI have a small library of music I like, audio books I enjoy, and of course can send you letters when the Mun is facing Kerbin or when the station is in the proper position. Stocked up with all the food cubes, tubes of paste, and packets of flavored drinks a person could ever want. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry Mom, I watch my weight and don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t over do it.\n\nOf course, the day and night cycle is a tad weird. I have to use an alarm clock to tell me when it is time to get up or go to bed and I have a blanket I sometimes put over the viewing window. I like to keep active when I can - the low gravity forces you to keep exercising. I jog in place, do push ups and twists, and all kinds of other weird zero-gravity moves to help keep my muscles healthy. \n\n![zm4GopJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/zm4GopJ.png)\n\nI don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get much in the way of visitors, to be honest. Kerbin-Mun traffic happens more now that the station is in place but rarely do people land on the Mun anymore. The station above me does not even have a lander right now. Maybe they will get one for scouting out the surface? \n\nWell, I look forward to you writing back.\n\nlove,\n\nYour son\n\nJedgan Kerman\n\nSenior (and only) Engineer of the Mun Ranger Station"},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T02:29:26Z","Content":"Letters - Delivery Three\n\nTo:\n\nB. V. Kerman\n\nDirector of KSC\n\nFrom:\n\nN. V. Kerman\n\nSection 9\n\nSubject:\n\nSpecial A. I. Projects\n\nDude!\n\nHow\u0027s it hanging? I have some news for you from the research and development front of our little machine guys.\n\nFirst, all the math says our SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit) craft, named \u0022Buzz\u0022 can make it to stable orbit with a few drops of fuel still in the tanks. We just don\u0027t know how well it can come down. I mean, a Space Tug would have to meet it, take off the passengers and refuel some of the tanks, in order for it to reenter the atmosphere. But while we worked long and hard to make a small craft able to get into the vacuum of icy, deadly, harsh space, we only put on some heavy duty landing gears and some chutes. We don\u0027t know if Buzz, that\u0027s the name we gave the machine intelligence attached to the hull (don\u0027t you think the term artificial intelligence is mean?), can bring it down safely. So, I suggest when you use it the first time, only send up two Kerbals, no pilot, so when it comes we don\u0027t lose anybody. You dig?\n\n![fSEVt9U.png](http://i.imgur.com/fSEVt9U.png)\n\nNot that you can send anybody else up, I hear the station already has eight people. Unless you have people sleeping in the command cabins, that\u0027s the limit. \n\nAlso, even if \u0022Buzz\u0022 (the SSTO not the A.I. unit) works now, we don\u0027t know what future solar activity will, like, do to our atmosphere. Like, every time we get hit by the big bright guy in the sky, our planet reacts with the ocean releasing all kinds of isotopes and all kinds of chemical reactions. What do they call it - the \u0022flower shed\u0022 effect or something? I forgot. The problem is things will get worse and we may have to start thinking about protecting returning craft from the massive heat build up during reentry.\n\nThe other project, the A. I. controlled Rover program, was doing badly at first. We inserted one of those portable A. I. units and it worked up to the point where it started just driving in circles. That kind of spooked us, to be honest, and we had to retire it. It seemed a slight slope freaked it out or something. It was sad really.\n\nSo we made a simple rover, you now, with a low, wide body, reactors, a probe body, rechargeable bank, and a docking port in front. \n\n![M2m27do.png](http://i.imgur.com/M2m27do.png)\n\n It gives the A. I. unit a sense of direction. Then we mapped out a path for it to follow and let it go! We, of course, made sure the route selected went around any big mountains - even a crewed buggy has problems with those big boys.\n\n![zFeupUI.png](http://i.imgur.com/zFeupUI.png)\n\nSo we watched its progress, took some photos. At two hours, twelve minutes, and fourteen seconds, on the way to its second waypoint, it exploded. Have no idea why - can\u0027t even find any pieces. Total mystery. It\u0027s if the planet itself was trying to kill us or everything we make.\n\n![sobsjKb.png](http://i.imgur.com/sobsjKb.png)\n\nDoes explain why most Kerbals stay inside when off duty. \n\nBut we now know WHY the first one freaked out. We were telling it go somewhere without telling it where to go. Like, it got confused and had a nervous breakdown.\n\nOh, that Mun ranger has been sending us data about the two cars he has up there. I think one is a T-Rover (though not sure why it is called a rover) and the other one is a Mun Buggy. Seems the Rover handles a tad better and has a longer charge. Somebody forgot to give the Buggy solar panels. But both seem to handle well as long as you keep it around 4 meters per second. Kind of slow but, hey, low gravity, you dig? \n\n![5O4br5F.png](http://i.imgur.com/5O4br5F.png)\n\nOur Rover was doing a nice 10 meters per second. Course...it exploded. So it was doing badly at second too. HA!\n\nIn return for his data we gave him some advice on piloting the ship. No, don\u0027t worry, he didn\u0027t do anything outside his skill level. He just moved it about three meters, so the flag could get some of that light from the lamps. Looks a tad better, don\u0027t you think?\n\n![I3Pu6uR.png](http://i.imgur.com/I3Pu6uR.png)\n\nHey, well, I have to test out some new ways to use our friendly little metal minds, so try to chill.\n\nlovingly,\n\nDUDE!\n\nN.

I. Controlled Buggy. Only took about 22 minutes. I am not sure why the folks in charge picked such a close location to KSC - I guess they want me to move in small amounts.\n\nWaypoint One is 216 meters above sea level, at Latitude 0 45\u0027 29\u0022 North and Longitude 284 13\u0027 19\u0022 East.\n\nWe moved at 10 meters per second. As we were in the shore area and then glass lands there are only some small hills - nothing to really worry about. Yeah, we. I am counting the A. I. as a person as it gives me somebody to talk to. Being a Artificial Intelligence at least means it can understand half the stuff I am talking about.\n\n![mvApssD.png](http://i.imgur.com/mvApssD.png)\n\nThe Buggy is all function - the only science I get to do is pick up soil samples. I guess that is why they sent a scientist. I wonder if I could repair a wheel if I need too? The cabin has snacks, a food and drink recycler, and just enough room to let me sleep sitting up. \n\nI guess it is a good thing I can get out and walk around. This would seem to be good training if I ever go to the Mun or another planet. And yes, I did pick up a soil sample. Frankly, I am amazed anything lives out here at all. The so-called \u0022grass\u0022 looks more like moss or some form of lichen to me. \n\n![4j6xP5h.png](http://i.imgur.com/4j6xP5h.png)\n\nThe Buggy has a battery bank, with enough reactors and solar panels to keep it going. I think I will wait for nightfall before heading out for the next leg of the journey to see how well it does without Kerbol helping it along.\n\n![LWwyO1k.png](http://i.imgur.com/LWwyO1k.png)\n\nI know it is only a short distance but I can no longer see the space center. I better make sure the pellet gun they gave me is in working order. I never trusted those ugly birds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo:\n\nAll KSC staff\n\nFrom:\n\nB. V. Kerman\n\nDirector of KSC\n\nSubject:\n\nFYI\n\nOkay folks, just a little run down on how the different departments are doing - their projects and such.\n\nFirst off, the first few rover tests with A. I. units were not failures. No test is a failure unless WE fail to learn from them. We already have two A. I. mobile units at work on Kerbin. \n\nOne manned Buggy heading north - testing out how well a portable unit can handle a Buggy with a crew member in it.\n\nWe also have another version of the A. I. controlled rover, this time shielded, exploring the land south of KSC. It\u0027s assignment is to find a safe, flat area for the future SSTO to land for servicing and refueling.\n\n![D0uWqJP.png](http://i.imgur.com/D0uWqJP.png)\n\nWe also reopened the airfield hanger - had to clean out all the rusting aircraft and a colony of terror birds - so we could have a work space for our project of making a ground truck to refuel the SSTO. The CLAW system will be used.\n\nSection 9 is doing a wonderful job and I all hope you send a letter to encourage them to keep up the good work.\n\nThe SSTO should be ready for a live test any day now. The computer simulations show it reaching orbit, where it will need refueling, and being able to land near KSC, well within range of our ground crew to transfer crew and fuel it up. The drop tank was replaced with a permanent tank with the same fuel set up. So it is truly a Single Stage To Orbit craft that can carry three passengers.\n\nYes, we\u0027ll send up a replacement for Jebediah Kerman so he stops sending you all whining letters.\n\nThe Orbital Tug has had a slight change made to it. When Jebediah pointed out how much mono he used in docking just a few times we realized that the Orbital Tug will be doing a lot more docking then the Space Tug as it will be helping in space not just to move cargo but also in future orbital construction. We doubled the mono it carries. We doubt this will effect the launch in anyway as it is using the same launch assembly as the Space Tug. \n\n![7hU7ffI.png](http://i.imgur.com/7hU7ffI.png)\n\nWe also noticed that while the Space Tug costs $183,432.4 the Orbital Tug only costs $171,784. As the Orbital Tug can likely also carry cargo and parts to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons we feel, strongly, that instead of one Orbital Tug and two Space Tugs we should have two Orbital Tugs and one Space Tug. A small savings but every pence counts.\n\nFor comparison one Portable A. I. unit costs $44,840 and the SSTO costs $41,177.2. Remember that ships or stations with Portable A. I. units will have two so you would want to add $89,680 to the cost of each Tug. The SSTO will have a built-in A. I. unit, which costs $750.\n\nNow, as we have learned a great deal about using jet engines, and in fact have be using them for the first stage of the launch system for the Fuel Trailers, our costs may start going down as we apply this knowledge to future launches of the Tugs and payloads. The large cost of the Tugs comes mostly from the fuel and the launch system. Once we perfect the launch system and, we hope, start producing fuel outside the gravity well, costs should drop greatly. \n\n![QicJyM5.png](http://i.imgur.com/QicJyM5.png)\n\n![KtEIIbC.png](http://i.imgur.com/KtEIIbC.png)\n\nIn fact Fuel Trailer Four was launched, after some issues, with a new improved launch system. One that the A. I. unit found easier to handle. In fact, after replacing the de-coupler on the last booster stage with a senior docking port, to allow for fuel cross feeding, it was pointed out that this would also be a way to recycle rocket engines for future use in orbit. \n\n![ENlRbfg.png](http://i.imgur.com/ENlRbfg.png)\n\n![eGC07wZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/eGC07wZ.png)\n\nAs plans for interplanetary missions are drawn up, and distances become as important as cargo, we may increase the number of Space Tugs (if needed).\n\nAs our methods and designs improve the choices for future growth increase.\n\nsigned,\n\nKeep up the good work,\n\nB.

I. unit does not need light to sense its way, so we didn\u0027t use the headlights.\n\n![3Wx9hdx.png](http://i.imgur.com/3Wx9hdx.png)\n\n![xxp1Hjb.png](http://i.imgur.com/xxp1Hjb.png)\n\nWe got to the second Waypoint in less then an hour at 10 meters per second. Location 1 39\u0027 51\u0022 North, 75 35\u0027 13\u0022 West, about 404 meters above sea level. I walked about in the dark with my helmet light on to check the Buggy. No damage yet. Seems to be holding up well.\n\n![ehOVKEN.png](http://i.imgur.com/ehOVKEN.png)\n\nI didn\u0027t hear any birds so left the gun in the cabin. It may be there are none around here or they return to their nests at night. Or should I say dens? I assume they live under the ground so I assume the proper term would be den.\n\nBefore boarding I also collected a soil sample but the A. I. suggested I dump it back outside the cabin as it was the same as the first soil sample I took at Waypoint One. One soil sample from a \u0022grassland\u0022 is the same as another.\n\nI did what he suggested - why take on more weight then we need? I had a green food cube for dinner and than went to sleep.\n\nAddition : Woke up early this morning to a beeping from the panels. It is still dark outside and I am sure it isn\u0027t the wake up I asked for. Seems the A. I. sensed something happening behind us, at KSC. When I asked what was happening he told me that \u0022Buzz\u0022 was going up for the first time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMemory File - 1001101011\n\nGenerated By A. I. Unit 1010011 - Known As Buzz\n\n![SOIdvFw.png](http://i.imgur.com/SOIdvFw.png)\n\nIt has been 23 years and 31 days since the Kerbal Space Center officially launched its first mission. My sensors tell me it is still dark and I wait for the time to launch. My systems are checked and rechecked by my eager but also nervous creators.\n\nThey call me \u0022Buzz\u0022 after the craft I will be piloting. The Single-Stage-To-Orbit Kerbal Delivery Craft named Buzz by the VAB staff. This will be my first \u0022live\u0022 launch.\n\nI have done this flight a hundred times on the computers. I know what to do, when to do it. I don\u0027t understand why they seem so nervous. I was created to fly this craft. It was designed to do this. We are perfect together. \n\nThe weather is perfect for launch - but Kerbin has very little in the way of any type of bad weather. \n\nSenior Pilot Jebediah Kerman has already moved the \u0022Stephen Baxter\u0022 away from the station. I am to rendezvous with him and his craft. He is coming back to the surface. I am told he is very happy. I wonder if he understands he will likely be selected to launch the newly designed Orbital Tug back up to the station?\n\nIt is time for launch. It is up to me - I control everything. I warm up my jet engines and after about ten seconds I lift off the pad. I pull in my landing gears.\n\n![S6rBJYu.png](http://i.imgur.com/S6rBJYu.png)\n\nAt around 6.9 Kilometers I start the gravity turn. \n\n![ueFZofL.png](http://i.imgur.com/ueFZofL.png)\n\nAt around 20 Kilometers I turn off the oxygen intakes. I have turned my jet engines into rockets.\n\n![Qvx6E8U.png](http://i.imgur.com/Qvx6E8U.png)\n\nThis is the point where my design must prove itself. I allow my engines, as programmed, to overheat. I must make it into orbit at all cost. \n\nI finally turn off my engines, letting them cool off, as I coast to the edge of the atmosphere and beyond.\n\n ![6lYz6y6.png](http://i.imgur.com/6lYz6y6.png)\n\nI check my systems and my fuel. It will be enough. When it is time I burn to create a stable orbit.\n\nIt is done. I am in orbit. I have 174 units of Liquid Fuel left and 213 units of Oxidizer left. I alert KSC and the \u0022Stephen Baxter\u0022 that Buzz is in a stable orbit. There are cheers from the ground crew. Senior Pilot Jebediah Kerman lets off a shout. The A.I. units of his Space Tug start moving the tug to dock with me. \n\n![FYkHXEY.png](http://i.imgur.com/FYkHXEY.png)\n\nTheir names, given to them by their creators, are \u0022Lucy\u0022 and \u0022Ricardo\u0022, but only one is functioning right now to save power. \n\n![9sglEaa.png](http://i.imgur.com/9sglEaa.png)\n\nAlso, no station or ship needs the processing power of two units. That would be, as the creators say, \u0022overkill\u0022.\n\n![4ClL02R.png](http://i.imgur.com/4ClL02R.png)\n\nThe two ships dock and the returning Senior Pilot uses his seat\u0027s trans-matter cushions to move between the ships without having to do a \u0022space walk\u0022. I believe they still have training courses for it in the KSC\u0027s swimming pool. Not sure why - only the veterans seem to carry out EVAs anymore. \n\n![FrESxx1.png](http://i.imgur.com/FrESxx1.png)\n\n\u0022Jeb\u0022, as the other creators call him starts to look for, what he calls \u0022booze\u0022 as I take on fuel. Only my central tank will be topped off. I exchange data with \u0022Lucy\u0022 and \u0022Ricardo\u0022. I learn about the \u0022C. J. Cherryh\u0022 from them and I update them about the events on the surface. It only takes a few seconds to exchange all the knowledge we all three hold. By then I am ready to return to the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T17:34:48Z","Content":"Letters - Delivery Six\n\nTo:\n\nB. V.

Cherryh\n\nSubject:\n\nSSTO\u0027s Flaws\n\n![r91zbk8.png](http://i.imgur.com/r91zbk8.png)\n\nSo, while this thing takes me back down to the planet I figured I would use my portable notepad to type down a few things your engineers may have failed to understand before making this thing. \n\nBut first, to be fair, it does look lovely. Truly. Makes the rest of our current ships, and most of our past craft design, look like junk.\n\nOkay, first big fail. No booze. Heck, if I can\u0027t pilot it at least give me something to do during the ride. \n\nBut also the fact that you plan to make the Space Tugs, not just tugs and small fuel trucks but also shuttles. Now, that sounds great up to the point where three replacement crew use the SSTO to dock with a Space Rug carrying three crew returning to Kerbin. \n\nSomebody has to do a space walk. Here, let me spell it out for you. The trans-matter seats can\u0027t send somebody to a occupied seat. So somebody will have to leave one of the ships, let the rest of the people teleport, and then move to the other craft.\n\nDon\u0027t believe me? Draw two circles. Put three coins, head up, in circle A. Put three coins, tails up, in circle B. Take one coin out of circle B. Now, try to transfer the crew, the coins, between the two craft, or circles, without forcing that poor guy hanging onto the ladder outside to do a EVA to A other craft. Here, let me stop writing so you can try it.\n\nSee? The SSTO is nice and small and very cute. But a bigger SSTO would have been better. True, it would have needed more fuel, and mass, and blah, blah, blah.\n\nI can see such craft as being useful on other planets but it needs to be perfected first. It still needs work.\n\nMaybe experimenting with the Fuel Trailer launch system? That uses the same engines and that\u0027s overpowered, right? Maybe the next SSTO should have a Hitchhiker? With a BAR!\n\n![809kkVy.png](http://i.imgur.com/809kkVy.png)\n\nNow if you excuse me, the outside of the ship is starting to glow, so I better make sure my seat straps are tight and everything is secure.\n\nsigned,\n\nIncoming!\n\n\u0022Jeb\u0022\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Nephews.\n\nIts your Uncle Macdrin \u0022The Cosmic Engineer\u0022 Kerman! How are you guys doing? Did you hear - I am now the driver to one of the coolest ground Fuelers in the space program!\n\nI was waiting when the brand new, highly advanced, SSTO Kerbal Delivery Ship, named the Buzz, came down to a land. \n\n![7Z7Nwbo.png](http://i.imgur.com/7Z7Nwbo.png)\n\nIt was a beauty. All slim and powerful. Came down a tad off target but it\u0027s all good as long as you don\u0027t crash, right kids?\n\n![1gaCtxj.png](http://i.imgur.com/1gaCtxj.png)\n\n![dpW4gn2.png](http://i.imgur.com/dpW4gn2.png)\n\nAnd guess who was in it? Jebediah Kerman! Man, I felt honored to welcome him aboard once the link was made. He seemed excited about being teleported into the Hitchhiker. Checked out every draw and container. \n\n![bsLDKqo.png](http://i.imgur.com/bsLDKqo.png)\n\nNow, as you know, the CLAW is a piece of equipment based off the same technology we use for our trans-matter seat cushions. So it can be used to transfer crew as while as fuel. Course, pipes and hose move fuel faster, so using the CLAW to fuel up a craft takes forever. And I have to be careful about which tanks I fill up first - a unbalanced craft could tip over in our gravity real easy.\n\n![dwsKOwW.png](http://i.imgur.com/dwsKOwW.png)\n\nOnce it was fuelled up I teleported over to the cabin. Not just to check it out but so I could pop out the hatch and pack up the parachutes. The job of an engineer never ends.\n\n![XZmoG3v.png](http://i.imgur.com/XZmoG3v.png)\n\nThe Fueler had at least three-fourths of its fuel left as we backed away. Jebediah seemed REALLY happy to be back on Kerbin. Still, I bet he can\u0027t wait to get back into space, like all the fly boys! \n\nWell, tell your Ma and Pa I said hello and I will be visiting in a few weeks. Maybe have an old fashion picnic in the park? \n\nsigned,\n\nBest Uncle Ever,\n\nMacdrin Kerman\n\nPS - I think I might suggest they add headlights to the Fueler.

The discovery that the planet had not recovered from our harmful existence weakened their position greater making their environmentalist founders look, for lack of a better word, like idiots. There was a backlash and then a counter-backlash and no doubt more backlashes to come. \n\nRight now, there is a ripple among the populace. They want to see something great, somewhat wonderful, not just a few space stations, not just a moon mission once and awhile. And there are some among them willing to give their all to help the Kerbal Space Program create something wonderful.\n\nI am, of course, talking about the \u0022Duna Direct\u0022 crowd. Now, no, I know they sometimes come across as a tad strong. But their numbers are growing and, more importantly, they have become willing to fund any Duna related projects. \n\nSo today I will announce, to the public, the formation of the Duna Space Program, under the control of the Kerbin Space Program of course, whose goal is to explore and develop Duna.\n\nOur PR guys even made a flag for those craft and crew going to Duna.\n\nKSP Flag -\n\n![bP361Ks.png](http://i.imgur.com/bP361Ks.png)\n\nDSP Flag - \n\n![bk9U0Eg.png](http://i.imgur.com/bk9U0Eg.png)\n\nOkay, they only took a few minutes, but it looks good.\n\nWhat I need you to do is get the people to notice the space program. \n\nThank you,\n\nsigned with respect,\n\nF.

Kerman\n\nDirector of KSC\n\nSubject:\n\nFYI - Update\n\nOkay folks, as you may have heard over the vision channels or the audio stations, we now have a baby brother called Duna Space Program.\n\nNow, getting to Duna can be a problem - as the next window for launching to it is something like a year and a half. Which gives us a ton of time to develop some packages to send to it.\n\nThe R\u0026D department, with help from Section 9, has already designed a simple Robotic Tug with five tiny landing probes.\n\n![MtKM2Td.png](http://i.imgur.com/MtKM2Td.png)\n\nWe have also been asked to get the populace\u0027s attention. So, after some debate among my own scientists and engineers, we have decided we need to go to Minmus. Now, while it needs somewhat more Delta-V to get to its lower gravity means landing and taking off requires less fuel. And it is our belief that we should not put all our eggs into one basket.\n\nIn other words - having two future sources of fuel is better then one. \n\nAlso, exploring Duna may be exciting but will happen in very short bursts with long periods in between. We need projects to keep the public interested during those periods \u0022in between\u0022. \n\nPutting a station around Minmus and maybe placing a Ranger Station on it may help our public relations. \n\nWe also have another project in the works. We\u0027re thinking of a \u0022mother\u0022 ship, designed to carry probes and landing craft to other planets. A manned ship not just a large tug. Of course I mean after the other planets have been scouted out and developed. I see no reason to endanger such an costly piece of equipment by stranding it in some backwater part of the system.\n\n ![aUqtPw5.png](http://i.imgur.com/aUqtPw5.png)\n\nWe\u0027re still working out all the problems and issues with such a monster. It isn\u0027t as hard as you would think - in some ways it is just a space station with more fuel tanks and nuclear engines. Once in orbit we could add more craft and drones to it, refuel it, and crew it.\n\nWho ends up as its crew depends on how well you all perform in the next few years.\n\nDue to the nature of these new developments the Confederation has sent us extra security in the form of Confederation soldiers. PLEASE don\u0027t cause problems. They are here to protect and serve us, not spy on us or get in our way.\n\n![GdCm2WO.png](http://i.imgur.com/GdCm2WO.png)\n\nJust show them your IDs and try not to get impatient.\n\nsigned,\n\nLet\u0027s all get along,\n\nB.

Took a little more than 50 something minutes at 10 meters per second. Just grassland as far as the eyes can see with some larger hills to the north. We are 680 meters above sea level. \n\nOn the way here we transmitted all our data and the soil sample were destroyed (as the A. I. had to break it down for study).\n\nAccording to orbital maps, if I head a tad west, then northwest, I could slip through a passage between two mountain ranges. I could explore where no Kerbal has gone before.\n\nOf course, there is a debate but in the end the folks at KSC agree to allow me to try. After all if something happens I am the one who has to walk all the way back. Maybe I could find some new soil samples?\n\nShould take us about 20 minutes to get to the next Waypoint.

Of course, I pick up some dirt for the A. I. to poke at while I check out the Buggy and enjoy the fresh clean air. Ha! Little joke there - the air is deadly no matter where we go.\n\n![xIrNXk9.png](http://i.imgur.com/xIrNXk9.png)\n\nNow to try to navigate the passage.

No science stuff on it. Not saying we are going to neglect science - we can always land a few probes or manned missions once the station is up. BUT we need to worry about mass and fuel. \n\nSo I am thinking small. No, I am thinking TINY. I want TINY. We can always add Fuel Trailers and other equipment later. Docking ports are cheap.

Still, the equipment works and the A.I. tells me he is doing fine.

Or at least they sound like birds. \n\n![5LxLuYM.png](http://i.imgur.com/5LxLuYM.png)\n\nThe Buggy is still holding up well.

Cherryh and the Lisanne Norman. Sensors and surviving orbital droids report no sign of the two stations. It is assumed they were lost, with all hands, when secondary solar flares hit our region of space. \n\nFrom what we can tell, the flares caused bends in the space-time gravity well, making the stations wobble till they broke up\\*. \n\n![ZC2Y9wD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ZC2Y9wD.jpg)\n\nAlso it had been reported that the flares caused changes in the very nature of the fabric of space. Heat build up will be harder to deal with and our nuclear tug will have to be redesigned to handle such issues.\n\nIt is great sorrow that I have to report these events to you. But don\u0027t let this make you think our space program is shutting down. No. Nobody said space exploration was easy. \n\nAlready we have new designs on the drawing boards. The space station Jeb designed, for example, which is already being assembled will become the new ISS C.J. Cherryh (II) and will become the basic design for all space stations.\n\nI will ask that all of you, from the youngest student to the oldest retiree, respect the moment of silence we will be having tomorrow for the brave crew who lost their lives, till they can be cloned again, to the exploration of space. Those crew members are - Bill Kerman. Hadmal Kerman . Lanemy Kerman. Bob Kerman. Donard Kerman. Munmin Kerman. Enmy Kerman. Chadfrey Kerman. Shellong Kerman.\n\nI would like to inform you also that our Ranger Station on the Mun reports to be active and the Kerman crewing it safe. \n\nPlease let us all take a moment to remember the explorers, scouts, and brave people who push the envelope so that we may thrive in the future and not just exist in the past.\n\nThank you,\n\nsigned with respect,\n\nF.

Just a run down about our experiments with the third version of the SSTO.  We tried for a smaller design than the second version but no go.  It still runs out of fuel before reaching orbit.  So we decided to try to dust off some old designs from our files.  You know, jet planes and space planes.  \n\n![qrEAlqH.png](http://i.imgur.com/qrEAlqH.png)\n\nSadly, our computers show only limited success with our designs.  While we did learn some interesting facts, like there seems to be some sweet spots in the higher levels of the atmosphere where certain jet engines become SUPER effective, most of our designs were very hard to control for our little machine dudes.  I would not trust them to live pilots just yet.  \n\n![umCvuAp.png](http://i.imgur.com/umCvuAp.png)\n\nTo be honest, while I hate giving up on anything, I fear that SSTO and space planes are a dead end.

V. Kerman  \n\nDirector of KSC  \n\nSubject:  \n\nNEW Space station and new Fuel Trailer designs\n\nGreeting folks,\n\nJust a run down of what is happening up there in the great dark.\n\n![tR5aXnE.png](http://i.imgur.com/tR5aXnE.png)\n\nFirst, Jeb\u0027s space station, named C.J. Cherryh II in honor of our first station, is in orbit.  Perfect operation.  Even have the last stage and the A.I. unit still attached for now.  There seems to be some ideas about using the booster for future missions - maybe pushing the station into a higher orbit or even maybe placing it in orbit around the  Mun.  Who knows?  There is a debate about making all final stages attached with docking ports and, therefore, being about to move them about as portable boosters for cargo in space.  \n\nWe have found out, via computer tests, that our Space Tugs can still get into orbit and we plan to test this out soon, by placing a 1-Crew Tug into space soon.\n\n![m0AEmnF.png](http://i.imgur.com/m0AEmnF.png)\n\nAlso, our newly designed Fuel Trailer is now in orbit.  Unlike the old ones it now has TWO Senior Docking ports.  This means we have two trailers in orbit, one new and one old, so we will want to collect the fuel as soon as possible for future use.  \n\n![pFKKal2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pFKKal2.jpg)\n\nAlso, we have reports that some of the local life forms, known as birds, have been seen by security.  They seem harmless enough but please keep in mind that they are an unknown factor.  Please make sure to secure all airlocks, access panels, and don\u0027t approach them.  Somebody may wish to tell Matbo Karmen about this.\n\nAnd, no, Jeb, I am not handing out weapons.\n\nsigned,\n\nMake sure not to feed the birds,\n\nB. V.

No problems getting her into orbit.  The A.I. Units, named \u0022Ted\u0022 and \u0022Bill\u0022 were able to handle it well, though they did complain about it being sluggish when attached to Fuel Trailer Five.\n\n![gtqyU0X.png](http://i.imgur.com/gtqyU0X.png)\n\nThe heat sinks worked like a charm.  And may I say the \u0022Skipper\u0022 engine on the last stage is a very useful engine when working in orbit.  May I suggest any future orbital buses or people movers use this engine?  The LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 Atomic Rocket Motors are good for inter-orbital travel between planets or to the moons, but the RE-15 seemed great for getting the job done in short, powerful, spurts of power.  Just the thing needed to moving between fast moving stations.\n\nCourse, we only have one station right now.  But, let me continue with my report.\n\n![ibBkx2T.png](http://i.imgur.com/ibBkx2T.png)\n\nBy T\u002B 1 Day, 1 hour, 12 minutes, and 8 seconds, I had docked with Fuel Trailer Four, head first, and drained it of all its fuel.  \n\n![gooo2BE.png](http://i.imgur.com/gooo2BE.png)  \n![2qeG4l0.png](http://i.imgur.com/2qeG4l0.png)\n\nThe ISS C.J. Cherryh, the Second, was only about 15 minutes away.  Once again, I can\u0027t praise the \u0022Skipper\u0022 enough.  Then we had a problem.  I had to drain and release my own booster, because it was causing wobble.  This is the flaw of using regular docking ports, or any ports, extended from the hull of a ship or station.  \n\nOnce I undocked from the station if took me another five hours to find and attach to Fuel Trailer Five.  I did something stupid - I attached to the wrong end.  Which is why the A.I. Units were complaining.  \n\n![hU5JBp3.png](http://i.imgur.com/hU5JBp3.png)  \n![OrCTIdv.png](http://i.imgur.com/OrCTIdv.png)\n\nStill, we got back to the station in less then 11 minutes, which wasn\u0027t that bad.  Unless my clocks are all screwed up.  \n\n![Szk3Q8v.png](http://i.imgur.com/Szk3Q8v.png)\n\nBut then we had wobble again and I had to drain the station\u0027s A.I. controlled booster and let it go.  Still, now we have all that extra fuel in station.  \n\n![7CJnvyu.png](http://i.imgur.com/7CJnvyu.png)\n\nAfter using the trans-matter cushion to get onboard I checked out the view.  It sucks.  And the food tastes like mint.  Anyway, I would suggest all future missions remember to dock spacecraft on the \u0022South End\u0022 of the station and Fuel Trailers use the \u0022North End\u0022.  Also they want to be aware to which end they attach to when towing Fuel Trailers.\n\n![c1UeeTd.png](http://i.imgur.com/c1UeeTd.png)\n\nMay I suggest they work on Jeb\u0027s station design?  Wobble is what killed all those brave people - including me.  At least according to my own files.  Okay?  Good.\n\nsigned,\n\nSafety is Number One,\n\nBill Kerman"}]}
