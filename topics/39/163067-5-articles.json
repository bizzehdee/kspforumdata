A few high-rises dotted the west side of town near the mountains, but before Wernher\u0027s truck reached them they turned onto a side street and parked in front of the Bungalow Bar.

Three kerbals walked up, all of whom were smoking. They were dressed in black berets and black turtleneck sweaters. They took the stage, where a double bass and a pair of bongos were set up next to a microphone. One kerbal sat crisscrossed next to the bongos and the others stood at their proper places.

She would write about it the next day, and in a stunning bit of foresight, note that an economic boom was about to come to Juno\u2019s Landing. The boom never could have come, she argued, if Wernher and Gene had been contracted by the government to push the envelope. If that had happened, they would be contracted for a few years for public-relations stunts and short-lived defense programs before funding was cut to nearly zero. Instead, Sunny argued, Kontinental Planes would push money into Juno\u2019s Landing and get just as much out- and before long the sky would be filled with jets. She even suggested, as an afterthought, that a high-performance vehicle could break the sound barrier. The one thing she didn\u2019t include in her report, however, was a thought that she kept to herself, because she knew how fantastical and idiotic it was. Specifically, she thought that kerbals could walk on the Mun- but she dismissed it quickly, and sent her manuscript to the press.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:10.5pt;\u0022\u003EMeanwhile, out on the peninsula, Mortimer and his new hires were still jubilant. \u201CJust think of what you\u2019ll think of next!\u201D the CEO exclaimed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:10.5pt;\u0022\u003EGene and Wernher glanced at each other. \u201CActually, Mortimer,\u201D Wernher began, \u201CI used to work on a top secret program during the war.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:10.5pt;\u0022\u003E\u201CIf it\u2019s top secret then why are you telling me?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#353c41;font-size:10.5pt;\u0022\u003EWernher shrugged. \u201CNo one cares anymore.

Then they all pulled into dock and met Mortimer and Sunny, who had stayed onshore (there was room in the boat for them both, but Mortimer was worried he\u0027d be seasick and Sunny wanted to get a journalistic view from the beach as well as keep Mortimer company).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A toast,\u0022 Wernher announced, \u0022to our intrepid explorer!\u0022 Then he realized that there was nothing to toast with. \u0022Come on, let\u0027s go into town and get something to eat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalf an hour later they were all sitting at a table at the\u00A0Route 77 Diner and Cafe. \u0022I\u0027m starving,\u0022 Bob said. \u0022I could eat-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe waitress came up. \u0022What can I get for you all?\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Four fried chickens and a Coke,\u0022 Bob finished, before realizing that the waitress might think that was his order. \u0022Sorry...

With the history of a century of spacefaring stored in his mind, he was confident that he didn\u0027t need a team of hundreds of engineers. Gene and Val and all of them preferred a small, close group of workers, but they knew that if they wanted to achieve their visions of spaceflight they would need lots of boosters and lots of manpower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuckily, Mortimer had come to their rescue again. \u0022The R\u0026amp;D team at the KSP can try new things,\u0022 he explained, \u0022like a new booster or a capsule, and then once they get good at it we can hand it over to the production lines at Kontinental Aerospace.\u0022 Now the same R\u0026amp;D team was greeting him from inside Hangar 7, and around them\u00A0were rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSunny gasped.

A computer program, rudimentary by Valentina\u0027s futuristic standards, flipped the capsule a hundred and eighty degrees just as it passed seventy kilometers\u0027 altitude. Then the firecrackers went off and the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESparkler I\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebegan its fiery plunge into the ocean.

Jeb sniffed pure oxygen for a few minutes, and then he gestured to Valentina. Then he nodded and went to help them retrieve his pressure suit from its cabinet. When they had first showed it to Valentina, she was shocked by how hot and stiff it was. She quickly improved it with some of her knowledge of EVA suits from the future and gave Jeb the new version. As usual, it was painted orange, and soon Jeb looked like a big Jack-O-lantern swaddled in rubber. Then he tied on his black boots, laced them up to the ankles, and put on his gloves. When he tried them on for the first time, he had thought they were a little slippery, so Bob went to the store to find some gecko-rubber, whose existence Bill doubted. With the new gloves and the new pressure suit on, Valentina helped Jeb to strap on his parachute, and then all that was left was the helmet. Wernher came up from behind and carefully lowered it onto its ring and snapped it shut. Then Sunny helped to connect some of the life support tubes, and Jeb was dressed like a true astronaut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I have to admit,\u0022 Valentina said, \u0022a good deal of the modifications I made were suggestions by Sunny to make it look like a true spacesuit.

He stopped at the door with his air conditioning unit in his left hand and, turning, looked out at the cameras. Then, slowly, he grinned, and waved at the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey screamed. The reporters surged forward, but the path to the truck had been blocked off by some thoughtful engineer the night before. Jeb hurriedly sat down in the truck, with Valentina running up behind him and Sunny getting in shotgun, with Wernher behind the wheel. The ride to the pad passed in silence, the first time that anybody could remember Jeb didn\u0027t have something to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was thinking, though. He realized that even though he had lived most of his life in space, he was about to fly the first-ever space mission. The awesome responsibility took its toll- if he messed anything up, everything in the future that he\u0027d liked would disappear instantly: Station One, the Number Nine Shuttle, Munbase, and- worst of all- the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKraken\u0027s Spit\u003C/em\u003E. What if all of that went away?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Jeb realized: They were already there in the future, so this mission was guaranteed to be a success. All of the rockets after this one might blow up, and Jeb and his friends could die tomorrow, but this first flight would be flawless. Knowing this, Jeb grinned, and he knew that he could enjoy his unique place in history: on top of a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point the truck pulled up to the pad, and Wernher waved to Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m off to check the LOX inlet valve,\u0022 he announced. \u0022Good luck to our astronaut.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore Jeb could reply, Sunny was gone, too, chatting with some reporter by the fence around the pad.

In orbital flight, there is nothing to slow the capsule down once the booster is detached. For this reason, the single critical piece of equipment is the retrorocket module, which houses three small solid motors. Any one of them is capable of deorbiting the capsule by itself.

They came down Central Avenue and pulled into motels and diners and casinos with buzzing neon signs; they lost money, sometimes even at the casinos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSunny Kerman was the\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eleader of the Space Coast on launch day, barking orders like \u0022Put out cones at the front gate!

Wernher turned on the radio as they drove, and they heard a reporter\u0027s voice: \u0022With just over two hours to go before launch, there are thousands of kerbals eagerly awaiting Valentina Kerman\u0027s historic flight. In fact, I\u0027m speaking with the flight director now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith some dismay, Gene realized that the radio was turned to a classical music station and that the reporter they heard was somehow jogging alongside the van at seventy kilometers per hour, prompting him to roll the windows up, just before they pulled up at mission control, where Gene got out. Then Wernher revved the engine and sped towards the launchpad, where they met Bill and Bob who were, as usual, climbing up and down the scaffolding helping out the team of twelve engineers. Bob held a wrench in his mouth, but he dropped it when Valentina came in. \u0022Hey, Val!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe grinned inside her helmet and raised her faceplate. \u0022It\u0027s great to see you guys are having fun. Call the elevator for me, will you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the top of the launch gantry, the small kicker stage was clearly visible. After its choice of fuel, Bill had named this uprated rocket the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKerosene,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand the capsule was still a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESparkler.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EValentina pulled herself in and frowned. \u0022It\u0027s a lot roomier in here than I thought without Jeb\u0027s ego crowding the cabin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Face it- anyone who has your kind of piloting skills has got to have some huge ego.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob stepped over. \u0022Are you criticizing my flying?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sighed. \u0022Fine.

With an hour to go until launch, a klaxon sounded, and all of the engineers climbed down from the gantry and found rides back to Mission Control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBored, Valentina opened the window and was blinded.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESurely Kerbol can\u0027t be that bright! Has it gone nova?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0No, the blinding light outside was the glow of a constant parade of flashbulbs going off. Valentina idly wondered where all of the film was going in an era before digital storage. If she had a window in the right direction, she would have gotten her answer as moving trucks full of film streamed in and out of the gates at the far end of the peninsula.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe CAPCOM\u00A0on this flight was Franxie Kerman, and as the moment of launch approached they stopped talking so Valentina could listen to the rocket start up below her. First the high-pitched whine of turbopumps and the roar of the launchpad sound suppression system flooding beneath the engines... then a howl as the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EKerosene\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Elit up and took flight. Out over the ocean she soared, melting back into the couch as fuel drained from the first stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBang! There it went, fading in the distance as the plucky upper stage took over. She had thought that a solid-fueled insertion stage would have been best, but Wernher worried about how reliable its thrust duration would be- and besides, they needed to get experience with high-altitude engine ignitions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Passing the Karman line,\u0022 Franxie called. \u0022Seventy kilometers... mark. About five seconds left on the burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four small engines on the insertion stage shut down, but Valentina was not yet in orbit. By Wernher\u0027s estimate, Jeb\u0027s suggestion for the final insertion shaved fifty kilos off of the second stage. Valentina looked out the window, counting down the seconds-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll at once, a flash of light and an intense acceleration, then a boom as the escape tower\u00A0was jettisoned after giving the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMad Cow\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eits final boost into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Franxie... I\u0027m floating in my straps. I think this is space.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a lot of cheering in mission control, and Valentina felt happy, too, at least until she heard a heart-sickening\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBang!\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand a red light on her control panel came on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control?\u0022 she asked. \u0022Control? Do you read? I have a status report.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Valentina go ahead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked out the window and confirmed the signal light in her capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think we have a problem. The retrorocket package has been jettisoned and I can see it out my window.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was silence in Mission Control. Then Gene stood up and cursed for a few minutes. Jeb raised his eyebrows, concerned but not yet worried- about Valentina, that is. He was very scared of the reporters in the press box shouting at him, asking things like, \u0022Is the retrorocket package supposed to detach before it has served its purpose?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in orbit, Valentina was talking to no one in particular. \u0022The only rockets I have left are the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E vents. I can\u0027t fire those at the same time, so they\u0027re useless for\u00A0 maneuvering. That leaves me with-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stopped. She imagined approaching a space station in her capsule and yawing to the right. The nose of the capsule would rotate in that direction, but there would also be a very slight translation to the right... and if she waited until the nose of the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMad Cow\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas pointed\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eaway\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Efrom the station, and cancelled out her yawing motion, she would be accelerating in the same direction.\u00A0Then she could yaw to the left, and keep the cycle going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s eyes widened. \u0022Hey, Franxie... I\u0027ve got an idea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter five minutes of explaining the space station thought experiment to Mission Control (Valentina was quite proud of that analogy), Gene leaned back in his chair and brushed his hair back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well?\u0022 Bill asked him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well what?\u0022 Gene replied. \u0022It\u0027s the only thing we\u0027ve got.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina rolled so two of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E vents were facing in the direction of travel and then put her plan into effect. At first, Valentina tried a very rapid back-and-forth motion, yawing left for half a second and then cancelling out with the right, but the quick motion of the capsule was unsettling and she felt like she was wasting a lot of fuel. She switched to long burns and 180-degree rotations, flipping and spinning once or twice a minute; some back-of-the-napkin math told her she would complete this cycle between forty and fifty times each orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter three-quarters of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank was gone, Valentina stopped the thruster firing. \u0022I\u0027ll need some landing estimates for my final descent on the next orbit.\u0022 On the ground, nerds in white coats were already playing with slide rules to take the three-second, eighty meter per second burn and figure out how long it would take with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E vents. They worked together and compared their numbers, but when they chose the fastest of them to run the result back to mission control, he made a mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe moved the decimal point one digit to the left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Gene heard the numbers, he didn\u0027t think they were wrong, and so he passed them to Franxie, who also agreed with them, and so she gave them to Valentina, who carried out a burn for the duration she was given, flipping end over end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb chewed on his knuckles during the reentry, listening to Valentina\u0027s narration of the events. \u0022Here we go... down below seventy kilometers, I think... Starting to get a little red around the window... A/C kicking in; I hear the fan... Entry interface! Passive stability now, but keeping \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E active anyway... Fifty-five K!
