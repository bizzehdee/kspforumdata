I knew it would be harder than going to the moon in vanilla KSP, but I didn\u0027t realize how much harder O_o. The tiny rocket in the beginng is my standard moon rocket in vanila KSP, and that barely got halfway to orbit. I thought I\u0027d get to the moon with a 100-200 ton craft, but the one I ended up with weighted 1000 tons, and I barely made it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought of going anywhere else is daunting O_o\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther mods I used was FAR, deadly reentry and TAC Life Support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/INfcYFwBCiM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T22:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery impressed maccollo, Real Solar System is definitely KSP\u0027s \u0022hard mode\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T13:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery impressed maccollo, Real Solar System is definitely KSP\u0027s \u0022hard mode\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be really hard, in fact I\u0027m not sure I can build a rocket that can send a kerbal any further than Mars and back, but I can\u0027t go back to vanilla KSP now. In a way, having to build the mightiest rocket to launch a rather puny payload feels more epic and rewarding. Not to mention Kirbin/Earth feels much more imposing in RSS!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
