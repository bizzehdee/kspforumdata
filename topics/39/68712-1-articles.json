This is why there are four groups of engines, arranged perpendicularly. If the asteroid is heavier on the right, I can limit the thrust of engines on the left. same goes for front/backward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only did not take into account two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- once we drop the asteroid, it would be nice to revert to a setting of even thrusting! (solution might be to use an action group to shutdown the adjustable/appropriate engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- different thrusts consume different amounts of fuel, and there are fuel deposits above the engines that do not feed other deposits to make a god weight distribution once the top (main) deposits have drained.. (solution might be to place fuel deposits above the quad-adapters, or to use fuel lines)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T05:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need advanced goal line technology to see that one was worth a point.
