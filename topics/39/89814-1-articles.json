This satellite was part of our communication project, \u0022Deep Space Network\u0022, whose aim was to set up a telecommunication network over the solar system and to support interplanetary spacecraft missions. On the halfway to Dres, the Mission Control of the Kerbal Space Center suddenly lost contact with the satellite, and could not re-establish the contact. Last few lines of its recorded telemetry indicated that an unexplained hull breach had been occurred, resulting in the total destruction of this spacecraft. In our entire history of the space center, this was the first craft loss outside Kerbin. Despite the setback, we decided to build and send another satellite of the same type to Dres in the next transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, the Kerbal Space Center received three contracts from \u0022Explosive Space Tourism\u0022 agency and \u0022Marshall Lee Industry\u0022 corporation. The tourism agency wanted one hotel orbiting around Duna, and another one on the surface of the planet. The corporation requested a sample of the Karbonite resource to be mined on the Duna surface and to be delivered to Ike, the single moon of Duna. The sample would be parked in an orbit there. No reason was given for this odd contract, though few speculated that it might be just a rumoured ritual for a white-hooded boy and a talking dog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, the timing of this Ike contract was convenient. One of our space projects was to build a refinery and refuel station above one moon of a planet, along with a delivery vehicle. This vehicle which would land on the surface, mine some Karbonite, launch back into an orbit and deliver the payload to the orbital station. The station in turn would process and convert to rocket fuels for a wide range of uses, including home-return trips. Eve and Duna were the current targets of the near-future manned exploratory missions so two such stations were scheduled to operate above their moons, Gilly and Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPayloads\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver several months, huge amounts of funds and resources were poured into the designs and constructions of five launches and their payloads.

The unmanned hotel station to Duna also ceased broadcasting its telemetry and was no longer responding to any commands. The report was baffling. It said something about the distant stars and Sun disappeared instantly, and that two green long tube-like objects were seen approaching the spacecraft rapidly out of nowhere. No further contacts from the three Duna-headed crafts were received.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe large observatory of the Research and Development Facility was immediately ordered to pinpoint its giant telescope to the last reported position of the silent rocket. The observation of a wide field of debris was reported. Stunned, the Mission Control hastily attempted to contact the Gilly crew only to find they were alive but unaware of the disaster unfolding. In the next two days, the contact with the communication satellite would soon be lost forever. Its transmitted telemetry matched to the one of the first satellite. Frighteningly, it was similar to the telemetry of the lost unmanned Duna station vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23644462/KSP-karken-story/darthvader.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022darthvader.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAftermath\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23644462/KSP-karken-story/loss-lives.png\u0022 alt=\u0022loss-lives.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of the five space missions from Kerbin, the Gilly one was the only one arrived at its destination unharmed.
