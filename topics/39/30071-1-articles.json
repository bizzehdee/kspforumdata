I was quite pleased with this mission as so far I had only landed on the mun and minmus so making it to duna was quite exciting. I hope you guys enjoy the video of the mission as well as my interesting nuclear probe design. As always I would love feedback/suggestion about on the vid so hopefully I can do even more successful missions in the future. thanks for watching guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XoEke_tKOY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Decho","CreatedById":66774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T20:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I were you I\u0027d disable the gimble on your launch boosters, should help with the wobble.

And congrats on your mission as well, hopefully they have plenty of snacks while waiting for that potential rescue lol. I thought about making mine a manned mission, but with my track record on landings and not knowing anything about duna first hand I decided to go the safer route of an unmanned mission first. Though a manned one will be happening soon, just waiting on finishing my new lander I\u0027ve been working on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
