My friend and I have been working on a huge Jool mission, and just started a YouTube channel to share it. We were trying to come up with the biggest challenge we could think of in KSP, and decided that a single mission that visited every body in the Jool system was a good choice. We did *tons* of planning and are starting to actually put stuff in orbit so we can assemble it.\n\nCheck out our first video and let us know what you think!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXOcsLGDFEY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou can visit our channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmAVWm58KaBuFdRa04KauXw).
