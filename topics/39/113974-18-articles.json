Her arms, too, felt like lead. Her face felt like lead. Her *eyelashes* felt like lead. \n\n*...I feel as if I am walking on Eve...*\n\nA noise that might have been a laugh wandered past her leaden lips. She hoped Vasily really was safe, wherever he was. She couldn\u0027t do anything about that now. She could barely *stand*, now. A convenient pole provided a welcome place to lean. She couldn\u0027t trust her legs to sit, they might not work again, so she just leaned and pulled her bag up close. \n\nIt wasn\u0027t really *her* bag, but a weary traveler looked more legitimate with some kind of luggage. She\u0027d left the previous owner a good sum of cash. And a splitting headache. She felt rather bad about that. \n\nGetting off the Kosmodrome grounds had been easy enough, Valentina was more than used to sneaking away from Igor by now. A farm truck had given her a ride most of the way to Abvonovichatkaderivokistan, and she had crossed the border at a checkpoint on a deserted dirt road just before dawn. The border guards had, of course, asked questions for which she had no answers. They probably still had splitting headaches, too. \n\nShe didn\u0027t feel so bad about that. Judging from the large wad of foreign currency she\u0027d found on one of them, they were up to no good anyway. \n\nNot much later, a train carrying yaks had taken her all the way into and across Nusad. As it turned out *no one* really wanted to inspect a boxcar full of yaks very closely. That had been a stroke of luck. Mostly. \n\nShe left the train in Oglona, dressed in rags and unwashed yak wool, and simply walked across the border into Dachland. Nobody wanted to go anywhere near her, especially with the wind blowing the direction it was. Unfortunately, one baby-faced officer apparently drew the short straw, but even he found some place very far away to be when she had looked at him *pleadingly* and said, \u0022bugrit! Millennium hand and shrimp!\n\nIn a small, idyllic Dachlandish town not far from the border, Valentina had washed off as much of the smell as she could. Which really wasn\u0027t much. Luckily, she bumped into a very friendly perfume maker and soon learned that the odiferous secretions on yak wool were of great use to the fragrance industry. He was happy to supply her with a small bottle of something more pleasant in exchange for the wool. \n\nSadly, he, too, probably had a splitting headache still. She felt *really* bad about that one. She had no idea knocking over a jar of ambergris in an enclosed space would affect someone like that. Her own sense of smell had completely stopped working by that point.  \n\n*Bong-bing*\n\n\u0022Doors. Closing. Next. Stop. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E International Airport. Terminal. One.\u0022\n\nThe obnoxiously cheery voice called out as the train lumbered forward. Valentina wrapped an arm around her pole in a desperate bid to remain upright. The other pulled her heavy trenchcoat tight. She wasn\u0027t quite sure where she\u0027d acquired it. There was a matching fedora, too, and if not for her fatigue she might have felt quite ridiculous. After all, this *was* the tropics, but the copious material was good for concealment. Plus, just as she remembered, they didn\u0027t bother to shut off the air conditioning in the train cars at night, and it was always frigid. \n\nWhat had followed the poor perfumer was, oddly, the least troublesome part. With the pilfered wad of cash she had bought airline tickets to half a dozen places all in different directions. She only boarded one. The thick docket of papers every Comrade of the Union was required to carry had proven most useful, as she had no shortage of nonsensical documents in an unintelligible language to wave a the bewildered gate agents and security people, all while blabbering on as *loud* as she could in the most obscure Ussari dialect she knew. \n\nThat, and, well, she still smelled of yak. \n\nHours in the air. Stopovers in Cocomor and West Yalktika, a plane change in Kr\u00FCnia, and a painfully long ground hold on Zaroeka. And she hadn\u0027t slept through any of it. The one stretch where she didn\u0027t have to watch for people, well... sleeping in the company of huge, stupid animals was a good way to end up as another smelly pile of mush on the floor. \n\nSleep. Valentina knew she needed it soon. Exhaustion made you vulnerable. Just get to Kerbin City, find a cheap motel, the cheaper, the better, then she could get some rest. And to figure--\n\nA screech of metal announced the train\u0027s next stop, along with that hideously cheerful voice. She had been enjoying the empty car, deserted at this time of night, when an equally weary-looking family trundled on. Among their copious baggage was a very small kerbling who was *quite* upset about being up so late past his bedtime, and was doing his very best to proliferate this opinion to anyone within earshot. \n\nValentina groaned as the train moved on. Why couldn\u0027t her ears feel as dead as her nose? Plodding, she shuffled through the doors into the next car. \n\nAnd nearly cried aloud in anguish. If not for another convenient pole she might have collapsed to the floor. \n\nSadness. \n\nSuch crushing *sadness...*\n\nLike all the light had gone out from... *everywhere*.\n\nA hand went up to her heart, it felt like it might break wide open. \n\nEmptiness. \n\nRegret. \n\nAnd *guilt*. \n\n*...my fault...all my fault....*\n\n*...should have... I should have...*\n\nValentina tried to blink away tears blurring her vision. And cold. *So* cold, but not from the chilly train air. \n\nThe rush of feelings threatened to wash her away, only... they weren\u0027t *hers*. Her head shook back and forth, trying to find some path back through them. Someone else was...\n\nBut, no... The car was empty, like the last one had been. There was nobody else--\n\n*There*. Crumpled in the far corner. \n\n\u0022H...hello?\u0022 She said carefully. The form didn\u0027t move. \n\n\u0022Hello? Are... you...?\u0022 She approached with caution, ready for any counter move, specifically keeping the eye in the back of her head wide open. \n\n\u0022Hello...?\u0022\n\nHmm. \n\nA limp form sat huddled on a seat in the very farthest corner of the train car, hugging its knees. \n\n\u0022S... Sir?\u0022 It still didn\u0027t move. Just... shivered slightly. \n\n*Poor fellow must be freezing in here...*\n\nA vagrant, perhaps? He had at least a week\u0027s worth of dark stubble on his cheeks, but his face was buried in his arms. His hair was greasy and disheveled, clothes unwashed. Valentina imagined that if her nose were working, that might find evidence too. \n\nBut... his clothes *were* fairly new. A collared shirt and slacks. She peered at the ID badge just peeking out of his pocket. Couldn\u0027t see a name, but it looked like he worked at the Space Center. That made a certain sense, this train line was very popular with workers who commuted to Kerbin City. But... it almost looked as if he hadn\u0027t *left* the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for a full week. At least. \n\n...and it almost felt like the battering flow of emotion was coming from...\n\nNo, that was *impossible!* Dark conspiracies, shadowy dangers... *Ceriman assassins*... that was all well and good but... it just *couldn\u0027t* be. You can\u0027t just feel other people\u0027s emotions! Valentina knew she was beyond exhausted, stressed, emotionally drained herself. It was probably just her own feelings manifesting as some kind of hallucination. Yes, yes that was it!\n\nBut... the poor fellow certainly *did* look miserable. With a little half smile, and a sigh, she slipped the heavy trenchcoat off. \n\n\u0022Here,\u0022 she said as she wrapped gently it around his shoulders, \u0022you need this more than me. Besides, the cold--\u0022\n\n\u0022...never bothered me anyway...\u0022\n\n\u0022Sir?\u0022 She strained her ears, but he made no more sound. Just wrapped pallid green fingers around the lapel and clutched it tightly. She thought a moment more, then took the hat off and set it on his head, seeming to block the Kerb out from the whole world. \n\n*What could \u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E this to a person?*\n\nWith a longer sigh, she leaned back against the wall. There was nothing more *she* could do, yet... somehow... the weight of despair in her head seemed lightened. Wearily, she also realized she was more tired than ever. \n\nBut what to do *now?* She would shortly be in Kerbin City, and then what? How could she find one girl in a metropolis of millions? It\u0027s not like the girl would post--\n\nOnce more, Valentina felt and overpowering urge to put a hand to her face. Maybe she should just accept it and stop questioning these things. There, on the far wall, just opposite where the unfortunate huddled Kerb sat, was the same picture of the girl that Valentina held in her pocket.\n\nAnd, oddly enough, a phone number. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-26T04:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2016 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T06:35:29Z","Content":"Man you\u0027re on a roll at the moment.

Kleptogart claims a 30 mile limit all around the chain of islands, while the Imperium of the Ussari Union only recognizes 12, and maintains that its vessels were in international waters at all times. The Prime Minister of Omork was quick to condemn the, quote, \u0022blatant act of Ussari aggression,\u0022 and declared a heightened state of alert for all Royal Omork Air and Naval forces. An official from the Kerman Administration called the incident \u0022unfortunate,\u0022 but President Kerman has yet to release an official response. \n\n\u0022Semi-retired bazillionaire philanthropist Layland Kerman issued his own statement on the matter, calling for calm and restraint while emphasizing the importance of a diplomatic response. He has invited representatives from all three nations to a summit at his Exast estate to help resolve the matter. \n\n\u0022In other news, area hospitals are reporting a dramatic up tick in facial injuries as the wildly popular *Mon\u00E9yPoke OW* craze sweeps the nation. \n\n\u0022And now, over to Gregner with weather, Gregner?\u0022\n\n*\u0022It\u0027s hot!\u0022*\n\nValentina clicked the picture off with a grunt. The old, discolored entertainment box only got two channels: the news, which was depressing, and that *other* station that gave her a powerful urge to wash. Washing, however, was completely out of the question. There was some... *thing*... in the bathtub. She had no idea what it was. It looked grumpy. She\u0027d thought it best to just let sleeping... *things* lie, and had backed away slowly and just shut the light off. \n\nThen she had staggered into the all-night liquor store across the street from the motel, her gait, garb, and smell quite matching the regulars at that hour, and purchased two large bottle of 180-proof grain alcohol. These she used to sterilize, as best she could, this table and one small corner of the distressing room. Valentina had half-expected a monster to jump out of the closet when she opened it. Instead, it was an enormous rat. Which was unfortunate for the rat, but at least she\u0027d had something to eat. \n\nThe bed, too, was a non-starter. She felt like she needed a powerful course of inoculations just from looking at it. A rusty metal box mounted beside it promised an \u0022electrifying experience\u0022 for a couple of coins. Judging by the wiring coming out of it, that was completely true. Instead, she had curled up on a wobbly, cracked plastic chair reeking of high-proof booze and slept with one eye open. She briefly considered gripping a pillow tight, but not after what crawled out of it. Sleep, too, was a bit of a relative term. The occupants of the next room had been up all night, fighting. At least she hoped it was fighting, lots of screaming and cursing and breaking noises. She didn\u0027t want to think of what else it might have been.  \n\nSo here she sat, in her little slightly-less-disgusting corner of this house of madness, eating stale cereal from a box of *Captain Sugar\u0027s Sugar-Frosted Sugar Puffs of Sugar*\u2122*\\*, **now with more Sugar!***. She\u0027d found it in a cupboard, surrounded by a thick halo of dead vermin. Looking over the ingredient list, it was probably the most sterile thing in the building. Most of these chemicals were considered too caustic for use in rocket fuels. Sugar was actually the last thing on the list. \n\nShe sighed, and popped another not-quite-soft, not-quite-crunchy bit of not-quit-food into her mouth. The short but restless night had given her mind plenty of time to wax neurotic on her current situation. In one single, bloody moment... *everything* had changed. \n\n*You should have told them. You should have reported the whole thing*. \n\nAnd where would that have gotten her? Led away to a black van like Vasily? Or \u0022reassigned\u0022 like Tercella? The kind of \u0022reassignment\u0022 no one ever returns from?\n\n*You shouldn\u0027t have asked questions. Never make noise. Do what you must to survive. And never, ever take sides.*\n\nWere those really her Deda\u0027s words... or her own? She\u0027d always done just that... and saw what the Union did in turn...\n\n*Those are dangerous thoughts, you must not think such things! Have you not had an enviable career for it?*\n\nShe had. Then she had failed to follow the rules *...this... we do not speak of...* and now look at her. A virtual fugitive, dressed in beggar\u0027s clothes, surrounded by filth, eating cereal that expired eight years ago. \n\nShe glanced at the box again. \n\nMake that nine. \n\n*Nothing good can come of this fool\u0027s errand. Are you really so quick to trust a traitor who would besmirch the Imperium?*\n\nBut... he said...\n\n*What you wanted to hear. And now... you are a murderer...*\n\nThe thought stung, but it was true. \n\n*I killed a Kerb...*\n\nDefense! It was only to defend--\n\n*A traitor. And the others?*\n\nSergei... Donald... \n\n*...my fault... all my fault....*\n\n*But this time was different, wasn\u0027t it? You **wanted** to kill him. You **enjoyed** it. You felt **power**. And you would have killed the **others**.*\n\n*It is true. I am not a predator. I am a monster.*\n\nA tear threatened to fall, then Valentina\u0027s eyes shot open. \n\n*Lass, that\u0027s about the biggest pile of steaming \u0423\u0414\u041AP\u0426TI\u0419 Ah\u0027ve ever heard.* \n\nWhy... why was *Chadvey* in her head now?!\n\n*Ah\u0027ve absolutely no idea. Ah\u0027m probably just a repressed manifestation of your own subconscious, tryin\u0027 t\u0027 break through your dysfunctional mental defense mechanisms as you strive toward self-actualization. Or somethin\u0027 like that, Ah never did finish that psychology degree.*\n\nShe blinked several times, then looked over the ingredient list on the cereal once more. \n\n*That might have somethin\u0027 t\u0027 do with it, too.*\n\nThen she tried shaking her head and smacking it with the heel of her hand once or twice. \n\n*\u0027Fraid that\u0027s not goin\u0027 t\u0027 help, lass. Some part of your own mind wants to get a message through. So Ah hope you\u0027ll forgive me for sayin\u0027 this, but Ah do believe you\u0027ve got your head up your own patoot. And given Kerbal anatomy, that\u0027s rather a feat.* \n\nValentina gaped at the wall\n\n*Ah spent years runnin\u0027, denyin\u0027 what Ah saw with mah own two eyes. Somethin\u0027 is **wrong**, and you **know** that. **Don\u0027t** make the same mistakes Ah did.*\n\n*Are you mad? You see ghosts in shadows! You are not one to take to fairy tales and stories!*\n\n*Aye, you\u0027re a rational person who doesna ignore empirical evidence.*\n\nWith a grunt she clapped her hands to her head, \u0022shut up, shut up, *all* of you!\u0022\n\nA loud banging from the other side of the wall answered, \u0022bugrit! Millennium and and shrimp! Blowitoutcherteapot! And *shrimp!*\u0022\n\nAscending to the next level of weariness, Valentina rubbed her hands over her face. Tonight, she was finding a better motel. At least one that didn\u0027t charge by the hour. Laying on the table nearby was the flyer she had found taped to the wall of the train car last night. At the top was the same picture of the girl... the whole picture. Next to the girl was a face Valentina hadn\u0027t seen in a couple of years, not since the buzz about the M\u00FCnbase had ceased. Below that, printed words read:\n\nTo the workers at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E,  \n\nPlease help me.

Now he needs your help and no one will do anything for him. They\u0027ve locked him away and hope everyone will just forget about him, but I won\u0027t let that happen! Please, I just want to know what happened, I \u003Cu\u003Eneed\u003C/u\u003E to know. All responses will be kept in strict confidence. \n\n                                  --Anastasia Kerman\n\nIn the other hand was a scrap of paper with an address written on it. The girl had seemed quite friendly, despite Valentina having called her at such an early hour. They were to meet at a cafe a few blocks away, in the nicer part of town, where Valentina would disclose crucial information about... what, exactly? The Political Officer had said to find the girl, but... then what? Something stirred deep in her mind, bringing with it a resigned certainty. Once she actually found the girl, the next move would resolve its self. \n\nIt would probably involve running and screaming. \n\nWith a sigh, she popped another sugary lump into her mouth. At least she\u0027d had a good breakfast. She absently tossed a Sugar-Frosted Sugar Puff of Sugar (now with more sugar!) to a cockroach poking around in the corner. It approached cautiously, took a few bites... took a few more bites... then burst into flames. \n\nThen it burst into multicolored flames. \n\nThen it burst into *inverted* flames, which is rather a hard thing to describe, but it sounds a bit like the color blue tastes. \n\nGiven the way things were going, Valentina thought this one of the *less* unusual things she\u0027d seen. She stood, and tossed the box of cereal into the rusty trash can, where it promptly ate through the side and toppled out onto the floor, smoking just slightly. She took a moment to regard herself in the grungy, cracked mirror. Hair tousled and greasy, spilling over her shoulders. Face dirty, clothes ragged. Probably still smelled of yak, too. *No one* would recognize a famous Kerbonaut looking like this. That was good. The Imperium, or... someone... was after her. Someone daft enough to employ Cerimans. \n\nMuch was said of Cerima. Most of it was a joke. Most, because that *other* bit... that would keep you up nights, if you thought about it too much. But, why Cerimans? Why *her* at all? Why--?\n\n*Pfft*. Questions without answers. Nothing to do now but go forth, and see what the day brings. With that thought, Valentina opened the door, and stepped out into the sunlight. \n\nThe day didn\u0027t wait long.\n\n\u0022I\u0027ma\u0027 *get* you!\u0022\n\nShe spun around to face the assault. \n\n\u0022I\u0027ma\u0027 *get* you!\u0022  \n\n\u0022I\u0027ma\u0027 *get* you!\u0022  \n\n\u0022I\u0027ma\u0027 *get* you!\u0022\n\nThen just stepped aside as her attacker ran face-first into the wall. \n\n*Thud!*\n\n\u0022Ow.\u0022\n\nHe looked up at her with what might have been a sheepish grin, if it had more teeth. One hand triumphantly thrust aloft a red and white plastic ball with a cheap-looking LCD screen on one side. \n\n\u0022Peek-at-u! I *got* \u0027im!\u0022\n\nThe all-too-familiar hand found Valentina\u0027s face, and she walked off. At least *one* thing hadn\u0027t changed. \n\nThese people were so *strange*.\n\n\\*Contains no actual cereal or other grain products.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-29T05:31:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2016 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T05:44:22Z","Content":"Could that possibly be a poke at a certain popular virtual reality game? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  And I liked the cereal that only Calvin could love.

The bubble was notably larger on the downwind side, however. It was demeaning, but at least it made it easy to get around. The way people pointedly avoided making eye contact probably helped, too. \n\nHow long since she\u0027s last been here? Years, at least. Not since before the Foreigners\u0027 M\u00FCnbase. The City had always been new, back when Valentina first climbed into the earliest training capsule, it had been nothing but a couple of tents on a river favored by fisherkerbs. Yet it was continuously renewing itself. Towering construction cranes dotted the skyline as they always did, only the locations ever changed. There was none of the grand, ornate architecture of Old Kermangrad here, all was beautifully modern, with straight, sober lines and endless facades of glass on towering buildings. It was all a bit to sterile for Valentina\u0027s tastes, but it did have its attraction. \n\nKars on the wide streets whizzed by to the sound of whining turbines, crossed here and there by the stark concrete pillars that held up the elevated train lines. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s occasionally flitted past higher up, the transport of choice for the well-off for whom several tonnes of steel and half a dozen screaming turboshaft engines weren\u0027t quite ostentatious enough. \n\nJust as Valentina was mulling this over, she felt a low rumbling in her chest. The feeling grew and grew, soon joined by Doppler-shifted sound as something big approached. Even the people on the street looked up and took notice. She strained, trying to guess where the source was from how the sound moved, but it was hopelessly hidden beyond the canyon of concrete and glass. As rapidly as it appeared, the sound faded and soon disappeared. Whatever it was must have been enormous. Too slow for an airplane, it was surely another \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of some sort. A distant, very old memory whispered in Valentina\u0027s mind, but evaporated as soon as she reached for it. Still frowning off towards the noise, she walked on. \n\n***Oof!***\n\n\u0022Sorry!\u0022\n\n\u0022Excuse me!\u0022\n\n\u0022Oops!\u0022\n\n\u0022Pardon!\u0022\n\n\u0022Sorry, sorry!\u0022\n\nShe looked at the young Kerb she\u0027d just blundered into, and another memory whispered. \n\n\u0022Sorry. Sorry. My bad,\u0022 he mumbled, looking down, \u0022sorry.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, it was my fault,\u0022 Valentina said, \u0022I should have been watching.\u0022\n\nThe Kerb looked up, then his eyes widened.\n\n\u0022Ermagherd!\u0022 He honked in a high, nasally voice, \u0022you\u0027re-you\u0027re-you\u0027re-Valmmfplp--!\u0022  \n\nShe clamped a hand to his mouth, not initially considering the hygienic consequences, and raised a finger to hers. The fellow\u0027s brow pinched in confusion. \n\n\u0022I am, er, on vacation. Do not want too much attention, mister, um...\u0022 He was wearing a McKerbal\u0027s\u00AE uniform, so she glanced at his McNametag\u00AE, \u0022Door-pay?\u0022\n\nHis eyes grew even wider, and slobber splattered against her hand until he batted it away. \n\n\u0022You got it right!\u0022 He blared, grabbing her shoulders, \u0022nobody *ever* gets it right!\u0022\n\nShe struggled out of his grip, \u0022um, yes, my Dachlandish is a bit rusty, but is quite plain.\u0022\n\n\u0022You *are* V-- uh, *her*,\u0022 he gaped, then took in her appearance, \u0022why ya dressed like a hobo?\u0022\n\n\u0022Is a long story,\u0022 Valentina said with an eye roll, \u0022I would not want to keep you from job.\u0022\n\nThe young fellow\u0027s countenance dropped like a failing rocket, \u0022oh, ok. Sorry to have bothered you.\u0022 He turned and began to mope off. \n\nOh... just... *P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\nValentina caught his shoulder, \u0022is... something the matter? You seem most unhappy.\u0022\n\nHe turned, not quite looking up, \u0022I got fired. Again. They say I talk too much.\u0022\n\n\u0022You... look most familiar,\u0022 she said thoughtfully, \u0022have I not seen you somewhere before?\u0022\n\n\u0022Prolly. I\u0027ve lived all over. Always end up getting kicked out.\u0022\n\nShe thought for a moment, \u0022perhaps, you strive down wrong path, no? What it is *you* want of life?\u0022 \n\nHis face lit up, and he bleated, \u0022I wanna be a spacekerb!\u0022\n\n\u0022You. Want to be... Kerbonaut?\u0022 Valentina hoped that didn\u0027t sound as bad as she thought. \n\nDoor-pay didn\u0027t seem to notice, \u0022ayuh ayuh I wanna go inna space an to the M\u00FCn an to Minmus an to Duna an to anywhere else that\u0027s go-able ayuh!\u0022\n\n\u0022Well... Have you applied, then?\u0022\n\n\u0022No,\u0022 he sank again, \u0022they prolly wouldn\u0027t want me.\u0022\n\nValentina frowned, then clapped him on the shoulders, \u0022if this is what you want of life, then this is what you must do. Or you will never be happy. First you must chase your dream, if you wish to catch it.\u0022\n\nHe looked at her, confused for a moment. Then she could nearly see the wheels click into place in his head. \n\n\u0022You should march down there right now and submit your application.\u0022\n\n\u0022Y-yeah...\u0022 His eyes steadily grew wider. \u0022Y....*YEAH!* Imana do it!\u0022\n\nHe glomped into her, \u0022oh thank you thank you thank you miss hobo Valentina but wow you sure smell I mean I don\u0027t mean to be rude but you really sure smell like yaks or something but Ima go down there right *now* and Ima be a *spacekerb* woohoo ayuh!\u0022\n\nWith a little shake, he made a sound that was the aural equivalent of walking on broken glass, \u0022do a little dance! Uh, uh! Goinintospace! Uh, uh! Spaaacekeeerb!\u0022\n\nValentina watched the odd young fellow bounce away, occasionally kicking his feet up in the air or grabbing a random stranger and yelling his intention in their face. \n\n\u0022SpaceKEEEEEEEERB! SPAAAAAAACEkerb! Ima be spaaaaaaace keeeeeeerb woohoo!\n\nHmm. Apparently he was unaffected by pepper spray, too. Surely a useful talent for a Kerbonaut. But still... even though the KSA *did* have some notoriously lax hiring standards, as Valentina watched him go, she wondered if, perhaps, she hadn\u0027t just made a terrible mistake. \n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne last short one before stuff gets *real*. ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022) Was originally going to be part of the next chapter, but since *some*one ([@Shania_L](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58975-shania_l/)) asked so nicely a while back...![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-06T06:54:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2021 06:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"}]}
