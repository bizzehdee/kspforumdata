It was a real shovel, not one of the little gold plated ones usually used for ground breaking ceremonies. He looked over the slightly rolling land, the occasional tree and bush. Around him flashbulbs went off recording the moment. The dignitaries behind him stood with their frozen smiles waiting for him to put the shovel in the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne last job,\u201D he had told his wife when the offer came. \u201COne last job and then I will retire.\u201D Her response was a sniff and \u201CYou? Retire?\u201D It was followed by the smile he always loved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe smiled. Succeed or fail, it would be his last job. After he accepted the position he asked one of his friends about the whole project, a serious no non-sense kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWernher thinks he craps sunbeams,\u201D Simplain said. \u201CBut\u2026\u201D He picked up his slide rule as he began to flip through the proposal. He precisely and rapidly flicked it back and forth in the one hand as he read. He scribbled some notes in the margins with the other hand. One third of the way through, he slowed down. Halfway through, he stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProblem,\u201D Direc asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimplain looked up, through the ceiling, focused on something far away. \u201CNo, beauty.\u201D He shook his head serious and focused on the office. \u201CDirec my teams are available if you need them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirec smirked. \u201CBusiness reasons?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGovernment money spends quite well, as you well know,\u201D Simplain said. \u201CBut, this,\u201D he tapped the still open proposal. \u201CThis holds the promise of some new answers, and many interesting questions.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirec looked down at the shovel. The flashing of the cameras slowed to a stop. All the talk, all the paper, all the dreaming, focused on him, on one action, on the very tip of the shovel. He chuckled. He considered what would happen if he did not put the shovel in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe drove the shovel into the ground. He saw out of the corner of his eye a flag kerbal waving frantically. The workers in their equipment ignored him. The cameras started flashing again. He turned the shovel a quarter turn and drove it in again. It clanged against a stone in the soil. He turned the shovel a quarter turn again, and drove it in a third time. He lifted a clump of soil and grass out of the ground. The diesel engines of the earth moving equipment roared to life. He tossed the clump off the shovel. As the clump hit the ground the equipment moved into action\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChapter 2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGus Kerman watched the three trainers approach. Even at a distance he could tell who flying one of the planes. The first six kerbalnauts were arriving. He wondered who had drawn the short straw to fly the front seat with Jebediah.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planes flew by and circled back around. Two broke off and began approach to the runway. The third circled lazily overhead.\u00A0 As the two planes approached one of the two planes rolled onto its starboard wing. The other plane remained flat and level. It touched down in a perfect 3 point landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks like Valentina gets first smoke on this one,\u201D Gus thought, one of the non-vulgar terms for the first landing on a runway. \u201COr first dust at least.\u201D He watched the plane taxi down the gravel strip to the hanger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked back at the other plane as the engine powered back up to full. It turned into a steep corkscrew climb towards the third plane. Together the two planes approached the runway. One of the planes lined up starboard\u00A0 and aft of the other. They both touched down at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGus climbed into the jeep and drove towards he hanger. He pulled up as the last engine wound down. He got out and walked over to the flight suited kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelcome to the Kerbal Space Center,\u201D he said. \u201CI\u2019m Gus Kerman, head of operations. I\u2019ll introduce you to the rest of the heads later. Right now there is the introductory briefing in forty-five in mission control. There\u2019s showers and food in the Astronaut Complex.\u0022 He gestured to an idling truck in front of the hanger. \u201CShe\u2019ll run you around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe six picked up their duffel bags and walked to the truck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJebediah,\u201D Gus called after them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah turned around, \u201Cyeah?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re going to be flying further into the stamp than you can imagine. So you don\u2019t need to push my airframes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.
