I am thinking of now transforming the letters into something more like a cursive script - until the invention of the typewriter (not sure if this is the correct word, if not then use google translate to convert the romanian word \u0027tipar\u0027 into english) they would probably write by hand. At that point they would probably try to make the letters more distinguishable from each other (like they already did in the transition between \u0027ancient\u0027 alphabet and \u0027classical\u0027 alphabet) even when scribbled at high speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
