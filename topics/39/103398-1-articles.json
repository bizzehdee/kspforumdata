When I worked at Blizzard, that was the one we used.\n\nBesides that, I think [Nvidia\u0027s Shadowplay](http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/shadowplay) is supposed to be very un-intrusive and hardly uses CPU (assuming you have an NVidia GPU)\n\nThere may be a few more I\u0027m forgetting."},{"CreatedByName":"pvtnum11","CreatedById":58904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T17:13:15Z","Content":"Xsplit can also record locally, and although of slightly lower quality than FRAPS, generates far smaller files than FRAPS does.\n\nI\u0027ve heard of folks using OBS also.\n\nOne that I used to use was Razer\u0027s GameBooster - it comes with a video capture program. Might have been my machine being too weak at the time, but I found that the audio slowly desynched over time with the video, getting more and more out of synch the longer a vid lasted. But again, it might have been my machine simply having trouble with it."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T09:15:12Z","Content":"Bandicam is very handy.
