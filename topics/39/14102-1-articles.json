The information is currently being kept confidential but there are reports that the rocket that was launched later crashed on the Surface of the Mun while attempting to land. There is little information regarding this event but we will keep you updated as we hear more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been reports of a reconnaissance mission being assembled to Orbit around the Mun to confirm the location of the downed rocket. Kerbal Space Mission Manager, George Lenok, has confirmed that there is a rocket missing on the surface of the Mun and that they are working on a mission to recover the Kerbonauts. He has no further comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Mission Manager, George Lenok, has confirmed that the rocket missing on the surface of the Mun is currently carrying three Kerbonauts, Seanfry Kerman, Bobny Kerman and Nedsted Kerman. At this current time information is very limited how ever, George Lenok has confirmed that they are currently working on \\\u0027Daedalus IV\\\u0027. Daedalus IV is a brand new rocket being developed by Kerbal Space Engineer, Guy D, with the sole intentions of this reconnaissance mission. Guy D. is currently not available for comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_____\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgress on the Daedalus IV is currently progressing at a slow rate. During test launches the Daedalus has experienced malfunction after malfunction. The most recent launch was a failure after the Daedalus began to bend due to pressure when it reached the Altitude of 63,000. Kerbal Space Engineer, Guy D, has this to say: \u0027We know they\\\u0027re probably dead, but we\\\u0027re still going to pick up their bodies so we can give them a proper burial, after studying their bodies to find out why they died and how long they managed to survive. As far as the Daedalus IV goes, I made it a little shorter. There was a lot of flexing around the center coupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s reduced now of course but I\\\u0027m waiting to see what happens.\u0027. He also also stated that a follow-up test of the revised D4 (Daedalus IV), has showed an improved structural stability. They have stated that their next tests will be to confirm a safe Orbit around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore information will be released when available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E____\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Mission Manager, George Lenok, has confirmed that the Daedalus IV has successfully did a test mock up launch and have calculated that they are holding enough fuel to do a reconnaissance mission and be able to return to Kerbin. Three unknown Kerbonauts are currently preparing for the mission. At this time they are keeping their identities confidential. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Engineer, Guy D, has stated that he will not comment any further until after the Kerbonauts are home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E______\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Mission Manager, George Lenok, has confirmed the Daedalus IV is ready for the reconnaissance mission. At this current time the D4 is being prepped for take off at the Launch Pad. They are expecting the mission to take anywhere from 10 hours to 5 days. They are going to prepare to drop any supplies that they can if in the event that the Kerbonauts are alive. We will keep you updated as it goes on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E______\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Mission Manager, George Lenok, has confirmed that the Daedalus IV has successfully launched at 5:19 PM. After a 20 hour trip the Three Kerbonauts aboard the Daedalus IV \u0027Recon\u0027 are currently and safely orbitting around Kerbin. During their 20 hour mission the Daedalus IV has confirmed the location of the downed rockets and have confirmed VIA limited radio communications that all three Kerbonauts on board the downed rocket are alive. At this current time they have enough supplies to last aprox 5 days. During the reconnaissance mission their has been rumors of an unknown and unidentified structure on the Mun. No further information is available regarding that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeorge Lenok has this to say: \u0027We are happy to hear the Kerbonauts mumble and jumble around in the Command Module for the Intel Sat. They have confirmed through sneezes how much supplies they have and how many of them are injured. At this time we believe that the incident happened when the Kerbonauts tried to land on a small hill, which resulted in the rocket tipping over and breaking into parts. We will be working on a mission to recover the Kerbonauts. Thank you to the three Kerbonauts who boarded the Daedalus Rocket to do a low orbit around the Mun. We currently have a Shuttle orbitting the Mun keeping an eye on the area. We have no comments regarding the rumor of an unidentified object on the surface or around the Mun.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Engineer, Guy D, has stated: \u0027I need a stiff drink after this.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have obtained the de-classified version of the Mission Logs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2:25 PM - D4 Recon is being created/prepped for the Recon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:00 PM - D4 is ready for launch and is being prepped on the Pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:19 PM - D4 Prepared for Launch \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:20 PM - Take Off \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:26 PM - Exited Kerbin Atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:33 PM - Reached Apoapis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 Hours 44 Minutes (In to mission) - Acquired radar detection of an unknown Mass on Mun matching the Rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 Hours 13 Minutes (In to mission) - [glow=black,2,300]\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EVisual Contact of unknown object on Mun\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E[/glow]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 Hours 54 Minutes (In to mission) - [glow=black,2,300]\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EVisual Contact of same unknown object on Mun\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E[/glow]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 Hours 54 Minutes (In to mission) - Visual Contact of downed rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 Hours 55 Minutes (In to mission) - Radio contact acquired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 Hours 30 Minutes (In to mission) - Beginning return Home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17 Hours 27 Minutes (In to mission) - Entered Kerbin Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 Hours 03 Minutes (In to mission) - Orbiting Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is currently no further information about the recovery mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E______\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOOC: I\\\u0027ll be updating this as this happens, lol.
