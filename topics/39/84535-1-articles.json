Some of what I envision includes scenes from the official Squad videos\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off would be if someone could make KSP videos to go along with David Bowie\u0027s \u0022Space Oddity,\u0022 or Rush\u0027s \u0022Countdown\u0022 (their take on a Space Shuttle launch). No modifications to the lyrics required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, a video to go along with AC/DC\u0027s \u0022For Those About to Rock (We Salute You).\u0022 I did submit a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://coub.com/view/3b1zk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECoub\u003C/a\u003E for this but didn\u0027t modify the words, again due to my lack of editing skills and tools. If someone could make a full-length video for this, perhaps adjusting the lyrics to \u0022For those about to launch...\u0022 and/or \u0022For those up on this rock...\u0022 (with Mun or other airless body\u0027s imagery), I think that would be simply awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea if permission would be needed to use these songs in order to not run afoul of copyright laws, but I don\u0027t think they\u0027d mind. Geddy Lee is usually a good sport (Take Off, eh!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone could make my visions come true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
