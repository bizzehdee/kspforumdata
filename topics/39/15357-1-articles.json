Research first began on rocket design - the main instrument of space travel for this day and age. Until now, nobody has even attempted to design a rocket - therefore, the KSP team had their work cut out for them. Work first began on a means of propellant - without it, the rocket wouldn\\\u0027t be a rocket. Two types of rocket type were considered - a liquid fuel rocket, or a solid fuel rocket. The KSP R/D team was split in half and told to work on each project seperately. Three months later, they had it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo prototypes were produced. The EX-10 Solid Fuel Booster and the EX-T30 Liquid Fuel Engine. The two designs, with their pros and cons, were put in front of a UNK committee - while both engine prototypes would eventually be put into service, the decision would decide which project would get more funding.

There are multiple types of fuel types, although most are either weak in power or not long-lived, ruling them out as a fuel source. However, one specific type of fuel, known as composite propellant, mixes powdered oxidizer and powdered metal fuel together with a rubbery binding, which also becomes part of the fuel. Specifically, the EX-10 uses ammomium nitrate-based composite propellant, which gives it a performance time of around 210 seconds.

While many types of fuel exist, the only one that provides good performance is a mixture of liquid oxygen and hydrogen - other good fuel types exist but this is both the cheapest and the most reliable type. While at full throttle and at high atmosphere the LFE does not promote very high speeds or long burn times, with one fuel tank, at 50% throttle and in vacuum a LFE is roughly 4x as fast and burns 3x as long as a SRB. However, a problem with LFEs is that they require fuel tanks, and specifically, liquid oxygen and hydrogen require very large and heavy fuel tanks because of their low liquid storage temperature and fuel density. This generates a problem as for LFEs to maximize their selling point (the ability to expand their fuel reservoir for longer burn time per stage), they also have to weigh down the craft, sometimes negating the bonuses of a LFE.

Now, they had only 1.000.000 UKD (about $25,000 in USD) and a license for a now out of prototype LFE, the LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Engine. While interior tests proved sufficient, we needed a rocket design. We used some fuel tanks from a few older Kerbal airliners, and a salvaged cockpit from an old K-22 Fighter-Bomber. Finally, we added in a bit of safety equipment and computer guidance - bringing us just short of our maximum at 959.239 UKD in costs.
