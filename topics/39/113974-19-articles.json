The fellow certainty had heart, surely the KSA could find *some* task for him. But after that, at least the day couldn\u0027t possibly get any strang--\n\n\u0022Ima*get*chu!!!!!\u0022\n\nShe dodged to the side once more. Another person darted past, holding one of those odd little bicolored balls before him and completely oblivious of anything else. \n\n\u0022Shartle! Shartle! Imagetchu!\u0022\n\nHe sprinted out into traffic to a cacophony of screeching tires, blaring horns, and colorful metaphors before finally catching the Midtown Express bus.\n\n\u0022Owwwwwwwwwwwwww.....\u0022\n\nEyes rolled. Valentina was just about to think that *now*, this day couldn\u0027t possibly get any stranger, but quickly scolded herself about underestimating the incredible talent these people had for strangeness. \n\nAs she walked, she heard/felt that intense rumbling again. More distant this time, well hidden beyond the towering walls of buildings that flanked the street. Why would they be flying such a large craft so low over the city? Cargo delivery, perhaps? She *had* heard the Kleptogartis were fond of using enormous VTOLS to lift heavy equipment to the roofs of buildings under construction. Yes, that must be it. But... why was she getting that unpleasant sensation between her shoulders again?\n\nAnyway, she had arrived. The *City Caf\u00E9.* Just another roadside eatery that dotted the streets in this part of town, wedged into the bottom floor of a much taller building. Where Anastasia Kerman would be expecting... Valentina looked down at her stained, smelly garb and sighed... a well-respected Kr\u00FCnian rocket scientist. \n\n*Ding-a-ling!*\n\nA little bell on the door announced her entrance. A couple of patrons looked up and frowned, the big clerk slicing meat back behind the counter outright scowled. Despite the modern glass wall at the front, the rest of the space was rather more traditional, with ornately carved crown moldings and tiled mosaics covering the walls. \n\nValentina scanned over the dozen or so people sitting at scattered tables and... *there*. Sitting alone against the far wall, tapping madly away at one of those little keyboard-phones that were everywhere these days. There was no mistaking that face, and brilliant blonde hair. After so long, the girl who had haunted Valentina\u0027s nightmares sat there in the flesh, completely oblivious to the world. \n\nShe approached cautiously, \u0022Anastasia Kerman?\u0022\n\nThe girl looked up with a bright smile, which immediately evaporated, \u0022Ugh, as *if!* Don\u0027t even tell me, you\u0027re one of those conspiracy nut jobs who thinks we didn\u0027t even *go* to the M\u00FCn, right?

The homely little Kerbling had certainly grown into her eyes. Now, she was honestly pretty... the kind of pretty that was sure to make her father go grey before his time. \n\n\u0022Ja for sure, Ich bin ein Kr\u00FCnerin,\u0022 Valentina said with a weak grin. \n\nThe girl blinked again, \u0022you\u0027re a cheese danish?\u0022\n\n\u0022Nein, nein, Ich bin from Kr\u00FCnia!\u0022\n\n\u0022You,\u0022 she sniffed, and made a face, \u0022are a rocket scientist.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ja, for sure.\u0022\n\n\u0022From *Kr\u00FCnia*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Jawoll, from Kr\u00FCnia.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oooooooooo... kaaaaaay...,\u0022 she squinted, \u0022wait... have... *have* I seen you somewhere before?\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, er, nein... nein, nein...\u0022 Valentina gestured to the empty chair, \u0022um, may Ich gesitzen?\u0022\n\n\u0022*You* can do whatever you want,\u0022 the girl said as she began to rise, \u0022I was just leav--\u0022\n\nA smiling waitress suddenly appeared, and placed a cup in front of her, \u0022here\u0027s your coffee, hon, that\u0027ll be \u221A1.\u0022\n\nThe girl grunted softly, sitting back down. She produced a fashionably small wallet from a fashionably small purse, looked inside, and grimaced.\n\n*Bingo*. \n\nValentina slapped a large bill down on the table. This part of Foreign culture she\u0027d come to understand well. \n\n\u0022Tea, bitte, hot,\u0022 she said, \u0022und der roast beast zandvich, mit djan chips.\u0022\n\nA sly look towards the girl, \u0022und vatever die jungfrau vould like.\u0022\n\nSaid jungfrau\u0027s mouth fell open, her head twitching back and forth in a most disturbing way between glaring daggers at Valentina and gaping at the waitress. \n\nFinally, she blurted out, \u0022cheeseburger! Make it a double! With bacon! Andarootbeer!\u0022\n\nThe waitress smiled, \u0022sure thing, ho--\u0022\n\n\u0022And djan chips! With cheese! Andandand chili!\u0022\n\nShe didn\u0027t miss a beat, \u0022sure thing, ho--\u0022\n\n\u0022And ice cream!\u0022 the girl was practically shaking now, \u0022with *sprinkles!* Andandandand a cherry!\u0022\n\nThose huge eyes continued to dart back and forth for a few moments, carried by their own momentum, \u0022please.\u0022 The girl looked down at her lap and blushed. \n\nUnfazed, the waitress simply smiled, \u0022sure thing, hon!\u0022 Though with an uncertain glance at Valentina she did make sure to take the bill with her as she left. The clerk behind the counter was still scowling at them.\n\nThe girl went back to staring assorted stabbing implements as Valentina, \u0022All right, you\u0027ve got my attention.\u0022 \n\nGreat. So... what now? *Yes, I\u0027ve been sent on a special mission to find you, in the midst of dark conspiracies and shadowy metaphysical strangeness, come with me if you want...* what, exactly?\n\nValentina could only grin helplessly. The clerk moved from scowling to glowering. \n\n\u0022I swear I know you from somewhere...\u0022 the girl wrinkled her wrinkleless brow.\n\n\u0022Nein, um... Ich just have zee familiar face, no?\u0022 Valentina\u0027s grin began to falter. \n\nThe girl had just opened her mouth to say something, when a frosty mug appeared before her, \u0022here\u0027s your root beer, hon.\u0022\n\nHer eyes did the darting thing again, then she veritably smashed the mug into her face, \u0022NGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!\u0022\n\nShe went back to staring at her lap and held the mug up, \u0022moreplease.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sure thing, hon!\u0022\n\nDispensing with the grin altogether, Valentina just gaped at her. \n\n\u0022So, you\u0027re from Kr\u00FCnia?\u0022 She smiled politely, \u0022whereabouts?\u0022\n\n\u0022Um... er... M\u00FCnchkin,\u0022 said Valentina. \n\nThe girl\u0027s pretty face lit up, \u0022oh, I *love* M\u00FCnchkin! The waterfront is just *soooo* beautiful, there along the Inseine  River.\u0022\n\n\u0022Jawoll,\u0022 Valentina nodded feverishly, \u0022is schparkling jewel of der stadt.\u0022\n\nThe girl\u0027s smile became a wicked grin as her huge eyes narrowed, \u0022M\u00FCnchkin\u0027s not even on the Inseine River, it\u0027s on the North Sea. And the waterfront is nothing but dilapidated old warehouses that smell of fish and despair.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\n\u0022Um... perhaps my translate is not...\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m *positive* I\u0027ve seen you somewhere before...\u0022 She put a hand to her chin and thought for a moment. Then she raised both hands, fingertips and thumbs pressed together to make an O shape, and looked *through* it at Valentina. \n\nThe girl\u0027s eyes shot open, \u0022Ermagherd! You\u0027re Valenmrrphlgrrph--!\u0022\n\nValentina fervently shook her head as she pressed a hand to the other\u0027s mouth. The big scowling, glowering clerk was there in an instant.\n\n\u0022Is this... person... bothering you, miss?\u0022 He sneered. Valentina quickly withdrew her hand. \n\nThe girl seemed to consider her options, then looked up at the fellow with her best \u0027boys always do anything I want!\u0027 smile, \u0022no, we\u0027re just *really* good friends, but thanks *ever* so much for being so sweet, tee-hee!\u0022\n\n\u0022Aw shucks,\u0022 he said, blushing and scratching the back of his head. He spared another dirty look for Valentina before returning to his work. \n\n\u0022You *are* Valentina Kermanova!\u0022 The girl hissed quietly once he was gone, then looked Valentina over again, \u0022why\u0027re you dressed like a vagrant? And what\u0027s with the bad fake accent?\u0022\n\n\u0022Is long story,\u0022 Valentina began, \u0022I am not quite sure--\u0022\n\n\u0022But *you* can help me!\u0022 The other blurted out, not listening, \u0022of course you can! You\u0027re a famous Kerbonaut, of *course* you have information!\u0022\n\nShe leaned over, whispered confidentially, \u0022what is it? A secret communique? Classified Ussari intelligence? Is there really a giant--\u0022\n\n\u0022Cheeseburger!\u0022 The waitress beamed with plates in her hands, \u0022and roast beast sandwich, fresh as you\u0027ll ever get \u0027em!\u0022 She went about arranging plates and beverages on the table. Valentina looked wistfully at the cheeseburger. They just weren\u0027t the same unless they\u0027d been languishing under a heat lamp for--\n\nNo sooner had the waitress departed than the girl did the eye-dart thing again. Valentina wasn\u0027t *exactly* sure what happened next, but the girl seemed to unhinge her jaw like a snake, cram the entire mountainous meaty mess into her face, and swallow it whole. The mug quickly followed.\n\n\u0022NGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUKNGLUK--\u0022\n\nShe set it down slowly, blinked twice, and then--\n\n**\u0022BRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPP!!!!!\u0022**\n\nValentina gasped. One or two of the other diners looked up. The girl blushed a bit. She opened her mouth to--\n\n**\u0022UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!!!!\u0022**\n\nThen clapped a hand to it, her eyes bigger than ever. More patrons looked up. Disapproving mutters fluttered about. The girl raised a finger, took a sip of water, smiled sweetly and then--\n\n**\u0022BBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEIIIOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!!!!!\u0022**\n\nIt took a few moments for the windowpanes to stop vibrating, their dull \u0022*wooka-wooka*\u0022 the only noise left in the room. Nothing else made a sound. A dozen or so pairs of eyes stared silently, even the noisy soda cooler held its rattles in stunned awe. That, or the acoustic shockwave had simply broken it. Valentina\u0027s hair was plastered in a cone shape jutting from the back of her head, giving her a somehow alien appearance. The girl looked around at the bewildered stares before pondering her own lap again.\n\n\u0022Excuse me,\u0022 she mumbled. Then stole a djan chip.\n\nValentina shook her head to clear the ringing in her ears and ridiculous coif, \u0022erm... when is last time you had a proper meal?\u0022 \n\nThe girl looked up with a defensive pout, \u0022I dunno, like last week. Probably.\u0022 And stuffed another chip into her mouth.\n\nPausing to rub her face, Valentina groaned. When she looked up again, the other Kerbelle\u0027s plate was empty and she was now pilfering chips off of Valentina\u0027s. \n\nCaught greasy-handed, the defensive pout deepened, \u0022but I\u0027m not starving, ok??\u0022 she brandished a djan chip, \u0022I\u0027ve got a whole half case of ramen...\u0022\n\n\u0022Plain or flavored?\u0022 Valentina raised an eye... bulge. \n\n\u0022Plain.\u0022\n\n\u0022You poor girl...\u0022\n\nThe poor girl took a breath that became a long sigh, gazing at the table once more, \u0022it\u0027s tough to make ends meet.\u0022\n\nHm? She seemed *awfully* young to be on her own. The brother, the Kerbonaut, he was... in a hospital or something but...\n\n\u0022But... where are your parents?\u0022 Valentina asked. \n\nThe girl\u0027s eyes flicked up for an instant, \u0022gone. KerbAir Flight 86.\u0022 She seemed to deflate against her chair.\n\nValentina covered a gasp. Hesitantly, she laid her other hand on the girl\u0027s. \n\n\u0022I had someone close to me on that plane, too.\u0022\n\n*Gene*...\n\nThe eyes flicked again, their defensive edge perhaps softened, \u0022I get Billy\u0027s pension, but it\u0027s not much. An\u0027 I bag groceries part time at the BUY-N-BLOAT. It\u0027s expensive to live in the City.\u0022\n\nValentina went to speak, but instantly the edge sharpened. \n\n\u0022But I won\u0027t abandon my brother!\u0022 The girl snapped at some perceived assault, \u0022I *won\u0027t!*\u0022 She lunged forward and slapped a hand against the table, and a little sparkly object on a chain popped from the neckline of her dress. \n\nIt took a few moments for the threads in Valentina\u0027s mind to connect before she realized what she was seeing, and this time the gasp couldn\u0027t be silenced. \n\n\u0022Where did you get that?!\u0022 Her head snapped back and forth, searching for anyone else who noticed, \u0022*how* did you get that?! You... you cannot *have* that...\u0022 She sat back, agape, \u0022...can you?\u0022\n\nThe girl looked down at the sparkly grey rock cradled in her hands, a genuine smile blooming on her face for the first time, ascending her to new levels of loveliness. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s my m\u00FCnrock,\u0022 she said to it, \u0022my brother got it for me. He always promised he would. Now they took him away and it\u0027s all I have--\u0022 She looked up with renewed intensity, \u0022but you can help me, right? That\u0027s why you called me, *right?* Thats why the whole cloak and, um...\u0022 she gestured vaguely at Valentina, \u0022...beggar routine, *right?*\u0022\n\nValentina groaned and rubbed at her temples, trying to process everything, \u0022look, we need to get on same page, we are not even in same book. Miss Kerman--\u0022\n\n\u0022You can call me Anna,\u0022 Anna said brightly. \n\n\u0022Valentina. Miss Anna, why don\u0027t you start from the beginning? I will see if I can fill in any holes,\u0022 that sounded honest enough, right?\n\nAnna gave her an odd look, but just sighed and stared down at her lap again, \u0022ok.\u0022 It was some time before she began to speak again, \u0022Billy... my brother... he was never afraid of anything. I don\u0027t think he knew *how* to be afraid. The first couple times, I wasn\u0027t either, and then Mom and Dad--\u0022 She screwed her eyes shut for a moment, \u0022and then, the accident. Everything changed. It was hard. \n\n\u0022He was assigned to a space station crew, I didn\u0027t want him to go, but of course I never said anything. He was so happy, it would be his third mission and he\u0027s finally get to fly together with Edgas...\u0022\n\nAnother memory floated up in the fog just beyond recognition. Valentina thought the name sounded, somehow, familiar.  \n\nAnna didn\u0027t seem to notice, \u0022I kept playing the doting sister but it was hard. He\u0027d never been away that long, and I\u0027d never been alone at all. I was overjoyed when I heard they were coming back early. Then...\u0022 she let out a long breath, \u0022then Billy said they were going to the M\u00FCn. \n\n\u0022I\u0027d never seen him so excited. For months, that\u0027s all he would talk about, \u0027we\u0027re goin\u0027 to the M\u00FCn, Anna, Ed an\u0027 me are goin\u0027 to the M\u00FCn! M-U-doodleybop-N, that spells M\u00FCn!\u0027\u0022 A wistful smile crept across her face, \u0022he practically wore out that old geology book, studying. I had to sew new bindings for it, twice.\u0022 She trailed off, and her smile faded like the last brilliant colors of fall giving way to the dead of winter, \u0022once they got there, everything seemed to be fine at first. I talked to Billy a lot on the radio, tried not to let on that I was a nervous wreck. Everything was going good, and then... they went to the anomaly.\u0022\n\n\u0022Wait, what anomaly?\u0022 Valentina asked. \n\nAnna\u0027s eyes flicked around the room in a gesture Valentina found disturbingly familiar, and she spoke with a hushed voice, \u0022it\u0027s why they were sent there in the first place. It was never a real big secret, just not talked about much. Now it\u0027s one of the things nobody will talk about at *all*. There was something near the base, something the Company wanted them to survey--\u0022\n\n\u0022The Company... Layland-Wutani, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022Right, they paid for the whole thing. The day Billy and Edmund... Edmund Kerman, the mission commander,\u0022 Valentina just nodded her on, \u0022the day they went to the anomaly... something changed. I could *hear* it in Billy\u0027s voice, almost... feel it, too. I convinced myself he was just tired, that they all were, it\u0027s hard work after all.\u0022\n\nAnna stared down at the table for a while, her brow pinched. Occasionally her mouth would twitch, as if seeking words. Finally, she closed her eyes and let out a ragged breath. \n\n\u0022The call came in the middle of the night,\u0022 her eyes flicked up again, \u0022they always do, I think. Probably some rule about it. I knew right away, before the voice even spoke. It said--\u0022 her own voice cut off for a moment, her throat working in spasms, \u0022it said... that Billy had been... hurt. That they were aborting the mission and coming home.\n\n\u0022That\u0027s when the silence started. Nobody would tell me anything else. Nobody would talk about it at all. When they got back, they were put into quarantine for a week. I could still get into the building, then, but they wouldn\u0027t let me into the quarantine wing. So I camped out in the lobby. \n\n\u0022I overheard from someone that they let the Eds go. I never heard from Edmund again, they took him somewhere else. I tried to talk to him later, but he wouldn\u0027t see me. He doesn\u0027t see *anyone*, they say. I mean, he\u0027s the Commander, right?\u0022 her voiced edged toward hysterical,  \u0022He\u0027s at least suppose to send me a letter or something, *right?*\u0022\n\nBefore Valentina could even answer, the girl pressed on. Somewhere in her own mind, it registered that this might be the first time Anna had spoken this much about it to *anyone*.\n\nThe edge in her voice was reined back, and for a moment, something harsher came through, \u0022Edgas found me, eventually. Took me to a dim corner of the room, gave me this--\u0022 she gestured with the sparkly rock, \u0022said it was from Billy. Then he just... turned away and walked off. He was Billy\u0027s only friend in the whole world, and he just... left. Like he shut down. That was the last I ever saw of him, too. And they still wouldn\u0027t let me see Billy.\n\n\u0022They just ignored me, didn\u0027t even bother to call security. I threatened to break the door down if they didn\u0027t let me in. They didn\u0027t, so I did. Right off the damn hinges!\u0022\n\nAnna paused, obviously trying to rally herself, and ran a hand through her luxurious hair. Valentina wasn\u0027t sure when she had started holding the other one. \n\n\u0022But Billy wasn\u0027t in there. He wasn\u0027t *anywhere*. A staff doctor in a lab coat took me into a little white room,\u0022 her throat twitched again, \u0022he said, um...\u0022 she had to bite her her lip for a moment to keep it from trembling, \u0022he said that Billy had...\u0022 words came between barely controlled gasps, \u0022had... hurt himself... that he was... that he couldn\u0027t see anymore, and... and...\u0022\n\n*...plip...*\n\n*...plip...*\n\n*...plip...* \n\nTears patted against Valentina\u0027s hand, making little clean spots in the grime. Anna seemed to founder, the word \u0022and\u0022 coming out as a sob over and over again, \u0022... and they said he didn\u0027t know me anymore. That he didn\u0027t know anyone. Or anything. They... they said that his mind was gone.\u0022\n\nFor a few moments, Valentina groped for a response, but how do you respond to something like that without sounding trite and hollow? What words could assuage something so awful? In the end, she just gave Anna time to compose herself. \n\n\u0022They\u0027d already taken him to the Sanitorum,\u0022 she said softly, \u0022he\u0027s been there ever since. I visit him three days a week, it\u0027s all they\u0027ll let me. I cut his hair, shave his stubble. He always did hate stubble....\u0022\n\nAnna took another ragged breath, her eyes flicking up, \u0022Dr. Kerman\u0027s in charge there. He\u0027s nice. He lets me stay a little past visiting hours if Billy\u0027s having a specially bad day. He says... says there\u0027s *something* going on in Billy\u0027s head, but he doesn\u0027t know what. \n\n\u0022I know Billy\u0027s still in there, I *know* it, but like, trapped... trapped by...\u0022 she trailed off.\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 Valentina tried to sound reassuring, \u0022what is it?\u0022\n\nThose big, pleading eyes flicked up again, \u0022you... you\u0027ll just think I\u0027m crazy...\u0022\n\nValentina looked at her flatly, \u0022I am the one wearing smelly rags pretending to be rocket scientist, no?\u0022\n\nAnna didn\u0027t look up, but Valentina felt her hand tremble, \u0022sometimes... when they\u0027ve got him really sedated and leave us alone together... it\u0027s almost like... there\u0027s something *else* there. Behind the bandages. And like... I can *feel* it... *looking* at me... like... it\u0027s *hungry*...\n\n\u0022And still, *no one* will tell me *anything* about what happened,\u0022 she locked Valentina\u0027s gaze with renewed intensity, \u0022Edmund knows something, I *know* he does, he was *there*. But he\u0027s a shut in now. They say he\u0027s sick. I\u0027ve pestered everyone else I know at the Space Center, security won\u0027t even let me though the gate anymore.\u0022 \n\nHer hand shifted, and now she was squeezing Valentina\u0027s, \u0022they won\u0027t even *lie* to me,\u0022 Anna pleaded, \u0022and that\u0027s what scares me the most.\n\n\u0022I even sent a letter to the President, begging for help,\u0022 the pouty scowl suddenly returned, \u0022all I got back was a generic form letter and a signed photograph.\u0022\n\nShe crossed her arms with a huff, \u0022squid-licking son of a--\u0022\n\nValentina raised an eye... bulge. \n\n\u0022Well he is!\u0022 Anna said defensively, leaning forward. \n\nShe said something else, too, but Valentina didn\u0027t hear. She didn\u0027t hear anything in that moment. The entire world seemed to have dissolved away, as her vision narrowed down to a point, focused on the tiny, red dot of laser light dancing on Anna\u0027s forehead. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-12T06:08:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2016 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"}]}
