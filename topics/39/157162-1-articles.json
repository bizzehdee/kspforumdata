The gathered high ranking kerbals of the KSP watched as he picked up the one sheet of paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTelemetry reports the following: electrical nominal, fuels nominal, thermal nominal, solid consumables nominal, liquid consumables low. \u201C Gene paused. He knew what the next statements were. It made it real to see it written down on paper. \u201CAs of four hours ago, gas consumables depleted, life signs\u2026 none.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour days later, Gene stood behind the podium of the large lecture hall. Behind him were two large pictures of Jedidiah and Valentina. In the front rows were family, followed by the politicians and dignitaries. The members of the program filled the rest of the hall. The press weren\u2019t there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ve heard about Jeb and Val. Their exploits, their skills, their kerbal-ish flaws.\u201D Gene paused. \u201CYou all know the program was started to help us heal from the war. Jeb had earned the nickname \u2018The Slippery Eel,\u2019 Val \u2018The Perfect Monster\u2019 during their tours. I know during their time they served on the same front a few times. Perhaps it is fitting that the two top pilots of the KSP were good friends, and came from opposite sides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey weren\u2019t always though. Dicey and the Ice Queen did not get along. They would\u2026 vigorously debate each other\u2019s opinions on many topics.\u201D There was a general chuckle from the crowd. \u201CBut, things changed one day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t remember what it was about. It could have been over something minor, it could have been over who left the coffee pot empty, or it just could have been the accumulated friction between the two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI got down to the offices to see Jeb and Val standing in the open space in the centre of the desks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2019I will slay the monsta!\u201D Jeb said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVal laughed. \u2018You couldn\u2019t then with a whole wing beside you. What makes you think you could do it now?\u2019\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2019I didn\u2019t need a wing then, I don\u2019t need one now. That tone you hear is the lock my foot has on your ass.\u2019\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey had fought before. But, that time it was different. We could tell this time would end it one way or another. They stood staring at each other. I said afterwards I didn\u2019t see who threw the first punch. I still stay that. Those of us in that room got to see what many had seen, and few survived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe fight was an example of their styles; Jeb\u2019s focused chaos against Val\u2019s crisp perfection. The first few blows were tentative but deliberate, designed to figure each other out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey paused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t think the blows were to kill. But, they certainly would have incapacitated if they were to hit. They were either blocked or dodged. There was no showboating, no fancy moves, just simple and direct. They moved around the room, over the desks and chairs. The contents went flying. It was a terrible and beautiful ballet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs we watched they began to slow down. The blows began to connect. But, they had less power behind them. Soon they lost their form and elegance and became simple punches with no power at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen it was just like in the movies. They each landed a punch and stopped. They saged to the floor unconscious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen they both got out of the infirmary we all expected a repeat of that fight. But, they didn\u2019t. They were cordial with other. Things improved from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt was our history writ small. Those two who fought each other so hard for so long, were able to work together for the benefit of kerbal-kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene paused. \u201CThey have paid the price that so many have paid.\u201D His voice caught. \u201CThey knew what their sacrifice would be when it came time.\u201D It caught again. \u201CWe all know what it would be. What it would mean is what is important.\u201D He voice quivered. \u201CIt would mean peace, hope, and a future.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NISSKEPCSIM","CreatedById":173812,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-10T15:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas their sacrifice for science? :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
