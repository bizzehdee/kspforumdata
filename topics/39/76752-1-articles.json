Especially when Earth\u0027s best telescopes, which are bigger, sometimes in space, higher, and... bigger, but they can\u0027t even magnify an extrasolar planet to a quarter of that size. Not without an interplanetary space telescope using the sun as a gravity lens. Besides, about that rocket... Although it MIGHT have the power to get an escape trajectory, it would take tens of thousands of years to reach it\u0027s destination.
