This thread will be about my (Modded) KSP journey to the mun. Also, there will be comic stories about the jorney. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the prelude: /\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the early space age, KSP was the best space agency on Kerbin. Every Kerbal born during that age remembers the awesome sight of a mun rocket lifting off the pad, the engines thundering, the condensation turning to steam as it rocketed to the sky. After the launch of ScI-1, a large scientific station, the agency was looking better and better. As public relations improved, the older, more skilled Kerbonauts were regulated to press conferences, while newer, rookie Kerbonauts became the main fliers to the station. One of them, Billy-Bobkins Kerman, made a disaster unwittingly. During the 4\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E docking with the station by a manned craft, the RCS thrusters fired forward prematurely, and the TKS smashed into the front of the station. The first things to break off were the solar panels, then the hull was breached, and the scientific equipment floated out. After that, the fuel tank was punctured, sending volatile monopropellant out of the hull. Billy-Bobkins and his copilot, Bill Kerman, had to make an emergency deorbit. But up there, there was a large cloud of floating refuse. KSP, facing an irreversible problem, shut down. After 10 years, when most of the junk reentered, intrepid Kerbonauts Conor Kerman, purchased the facility and the remaining rocket parts. Conor Kerman had created a three-stage plan: Development of a one-man spacecraft, creating a logical evolution of that to test rendezvous and docking, and development of a new CSM to take Kerbals to the moon. Gene Kerman closed the book. For 10 years KSP had been the laughingstock of most of Kerbin. Now, that was set to change. The new mission controller, appointed after the launch of the first satellite, was ready to begin operations. Over a phone, Jenkins Kerman, head of launch control, asked clearance to roll out Hermes-zenith three. The first manned Hermes capsule flight. The march to the mun had begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeet the hardware to get there: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0TZdm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
