We can discuss about tourism in the game and share some ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp until now all I did was a few rockets that take tens (up to 192) tourist into space, so that they can have a better view of the stars/galaxies/planets/space-things and experience 0G. My rockets might not orbit Kerbin, but I thought it was enough for them to reach a very high altitude and land back on Kerbin (safely).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can take a look at my rockets here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/owMZ0kZCLgY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I didn\u0027t land them completely safe, but I didn\u0027t want to repeat the take-off.

Build a tourism agency on another planet and take lots of kerbals there and back? A tourism space-station?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
