Afterwards, me and a group of 2 other players will begin a long duration hike up the K2 mountains (to the west of the KSC) and get as close as we can to the K2 peak!\n\nI will only be hosting this via Steam sadly, however I will ask that if anyone would like to join us and live stream the event to Twitch or other locations, it would be greatly appreciated! Moreover, if someone would record this event you would be greatly thanked!!\n\nNevertheless I hope you join me for the early tutorial and the hike."},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T03:18:21Z","Content":"Current planned time for the stream is 1pm for the Helicpoter tutorial and 3pm for the hike. However I likely will have a 30 interim at about 2:30pm as a food/drink/restroom break along with preparations for the next segment. \n\nNote: All listings are for EST time zone."}]}
