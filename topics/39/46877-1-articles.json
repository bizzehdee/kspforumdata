For example, since I can\u0027t watch the streams(if only I could turn the archive quality down 720 px!), users might post transcripts of Squadcast 1, 2, and 3. This counld continue with any new Squadcasts. I just wanted to do this to help those with little time, a bad internet connection, or those who spend their free time playing KSP(Like me!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
