The intro does his job, the good old *Charlie* ambience is in-place and man is ready to hear more.\n\nThe broken leg, *the speech*.\n\nHorrible. Sure, it is a hard job, but really... Horrible.\n\nThe *silent movie\u0027s way* could have been a far better option, which also offer you a nice playground with camera effect.\n\nBut more important, this option would have give the vid\u0027 a nice coherence.\n\nKeep going!"},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:18:22Z","Content":"if you think that\u0027s lame, you should see the stuff i DIDN\u0027T upload!! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nThe whole talking thing is where i feel the least comfortable. when things start happening I can\u0027t think enough to speak right (calling the VAB the control tower, or just sputtering incoherently) also I hate the sound of my voice. lots of issues. I dont\u0027 really want to go the silent movie route since I\u0027m planning on doing longer videos than 1 minute, this was just a clip when I was trying to practice recording (get audio levels right, try to speak which I failed at, etc...). I wasn\u0027t even going to upload it but accidentally missile-ing the VAB and then nearly dying was too fun to delete. Building the rocket, on the other hand, took a few minutes and I may have said half a word and made a bunch of weird noises I didn\u0027t realize I was making... weird... \n\nReexamination of the video shows the failure was staging related. Does anyone else get that thing when you use symmetry and the one you clicked doesn\u0027t follow the rest of the duplicates? It may have something to do with the mods, i\u0027ll probably try to do vanilla KSP for the videos just in case."},{"CreatedByName":"Gnou","CreatedById":132378,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T02:53:13Z","Content":"Damn\u0027 I never thinked once it could have been a *real accident!! ^^* \n\n*The whole talking thing* as you said is a full job, acting. It is really hard if you dont have learn the basis.\n\nTo be honest, I cant remember any video where it was successfuly done... YouTuber\u0027s talking are usually pathetic and just kill their video doing so.\n\n(Your own is not \u0022lamer\u0022 than what we can see in other vid\u0027s ;o)\n\nBut whatever your narrative choice, the most important is *having something to say*. A storyboard is a very good way to build your scenario.\n\nAs you intend to go for \u0022little movie\u0022, talking will be even harder along the clock. You have to carefully spare your speech along your timeline.\n\nVoid is your enemy. But worst than Void is filling in the blanks (more exactly...when people see you are doing so!). You have to play with blanks. Dont forget that image speak too.\n\nGood luck in your project.\n\n@bout your technical issue,\n\nIt is very common that 1 part of the group appears \u0022unlinked\u0022 in the staging but this lead only to a little asynchronous start.\n\nIn your case, you have 1 vertical separator inside your launching stage so... Little staging mistake!\n\nAlso you have your chutes and escape system in the same stage. They have a high chance to break during the process. I suggest you to separate them."},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T05:05:12Z","Content":"Yeah staging is kindof a problem of mine, half the time I forget to check or I move stuff I don\u0027t realize. I made another vid on that just yesterday, but I must admit a couple of the fails in that vid are staged (not all, though). The first fail involves a 1st rocket design (as if in career mode) where the parachute and rocket get staged together and the thing flips. I\u0027ve done that (more than once) but the vid part was staged, so I *have* done it just not that time lol.\n\nIm trying to improve the commentary, but I\u0027m no actor. Like, not even close. My newer vids are also getting better audio/video as I learn to use the software/find better free software, too. Keep watching, I just might improve. Or I won\u0027t, IDK. I\u0027m still hella uncomfortable with speaking into a mic, too lol"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T16:37:35Z","Content":"Hello Rufledt!\n\nI must say that Gnou was being a bit harsh. That wasn\u0027t bad, especially for a first attempt!\n\nSo, here\u0027s some tips you can use in the future, if you want:\n\n- Watch other KSP YouTubers, especially people doing more-or-less what you do, and note what they do well and what they could do better. This will actually help a lot!\n- Pretend that your microphone is your good friend and speak to it conversationally. I named my microphone \u0022Sam\u0022 and drew a little happy face on it. I know it *sounds* weird, but it really works.\n- Start off making videos where you know about *everything* that will happen. If there are staging errors, add them deliberately (it\u0027s cheating, I know, but it will help your commentary). If you showcase a craft, play with it a lot before you make the video and have a more-or-less solid \u0027flight plan.\u0027\n- Then, make a brief overview of what you want to cover. Writing a script is okay, but I don\u0027t recommend it. Instead, write out some bullet points about what you will cover and fill in the rest with spontaneous dialogue. If there are some difficult terms for you, write them down! It helps a lot.\n- If this isn\u0027t working, it might be best to go Danny2462-style and just add in text boxes to describe what\u0027s going on. You seem to be pretty good with adding in text boxes at the right moments, so this could probably work for you too.\n\nAbove all, remember to have fun! That\u0027s what really matters.\n\nOh, and I\u0027m going to shamelessly plug my channel as a Thing to Look At. I regularly do short little videos with commentary, and I started off kinda \u0027meh.\u0027 I\u0027ve gotten better though, thanks to the tips I mentioned above! My channel can be found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/user/BagelRabbit)\n\nBest of luck!\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T17:54:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Writing a script is okay, but I don\u0027t recommend it.

I\u0027ve been using this method for everything, not just KSP vids. I love danny\u0027s stuff but I doubt I could do the exact same style of videos and ever get as good as his.

But sometimes, you just need a longer video format to do something right (see Alien: Isolation, most videos for that are about 45 minutes long)\n\n@DonLorenzo, if you have 430 subs now, you\u0027re just a month or two away from 500\u002B, probably."},{"CreatedByName":"Rufledt","CreatedById":115067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T00:18:32Z","Content":"Thanks for all the help! I\u0027m starting my planning now so I can hit the ground running when 1.0 releases in a couple days. My current idea is to do a career mode play through, but not like most of the other play-throughs I\u0027ve seen. I\u0027m planning on doing a bit less with instructional type stuff (since other people have that covered) and more of the short clips/text commentary kinds of things in that clip. I want to keep videos shorter than 15 minutes, focusing on fitting some excitement into each one, but without losing the greater story arc (like going to the Mun, then Duna, then a jool mission, etc...), instead of the long 30 minute type play throughs I usually see. Does that seem like a good idea? Obviously i\u0027ll lose some of the \u0027story\u0027 cutting out a lot of it, but i\u0027m hoping they will at least be entertaining. How does that sound? \n\nI have a longer KSP vid on my channel (also elsewhere on this board: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115941-Countdown-to-1-0-How-not-to-launch-a-rocket-in-0-90-0%21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115941-Countdown-to-1-0-How-not-to-launch-a-rocket-in-0-90-0%21) ) which shows what I might do for individual launches, but it\u0027s not a career mode vid so it\u0027s still a bit different from what i\u0027m thinking.\n\nThis basically means i\u0027ll cut all the \u0027grindy\u0027 stuff out where i fly the same craft to all the different nearby biomes and cutting where i\u0027m just waiting or burning but not doing anything particularly interesting, plus I\u0027m coming up with some ways to use the text to add interest to the duller parts. Similar stuff seems to cut minecraft videos in length by 50-75%, maybe it could do something in that ballpark for KSP but without losing the entertainment aspect. Hopefully it all works, we\u0027ll see in a few days!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T00:26:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rufledt**"}]}
