I have two streams under my belt now in which I first put a satellite, then an unkerballed rocket and later several crewed pods into orbit. Despite all the bugs, I only lost one kerbal in the process. RIP Bill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been designing NASA-style mission patches for these streams and wanted to share them with the community:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fsi-01-bumblebee.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u00221000\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022 src=\u0022https://fab.industries/img/2023/fsi-01-bumblebee.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fsi-02-blueball.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u00221000\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022 src=\u0022https://fab.industries/img/2023/fsi-02-blueball.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be making more.
