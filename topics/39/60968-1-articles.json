The duty officer at the Tracking Station that day was Emmyloo Kerman, and she was still recovering from the after-effects of attending an all-night rave. She had a wicked Bubbly Bounce Beverage hangover, and when the tiny distant object popped up on her radar screen, she was busy trying to remember the name of the handsome young kerbal she had given her phone number to the previous night. (Jub? Jab? Jib? He\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Esaid\u003C/em\u003E that he was a kerbonaut...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe object passed discreetly through the orbit of Jool, still unseen and unremarked. The duty officer that day was Ludfurt Kerman; he hadn\u0027t noticed anything in twenty-five years as a tracking officer and he wasn\u0027t about to start now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaining speed as it fell inward, the object slipped through the orbit of Dres, the Tracking Station still blissfully unaware. Rodblat Kerman, a political appointee, was duty officer of the day; and quite frankly, Rodblat Kerman wouldn\u0027t have noticed a 10,000 metric ton boron steel asteroid if it had made an impact crater right in the middle of his pointy little green head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe object was finally noticed as it crossed inbound past Duna. The Tracking Station was manned that shift by Trudat Kerman, an unpaid intern and an astronomy doctoral student at the Kerbin Mail-Order Institute of Technology, who had been banished to the Tracking Station after annoying his thesis adviser one time too many.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHoly macaroni!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2exclaimed Trudat, excitedly knocking his coffee over onto a fantastically expensive high-tech console. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat the heck is that thing?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COhboyohboyohboy!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Trudat gibbered happily to himself as he mopped up the spilled coffee and discreetly hung an \u0027Out of Order\u0027 sign on the billion-bitkoin console. The odds were slim that he\u0027d actually discovered a new comet, but he was excited despite himself. Stranger things, Trudat reminded himself, as he forwarded the object\u0027s telemetry over to the mainframe at Kouston, had happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mainframe dutifully received the incoming data, stopped what it was doing, and proceeded to calculate trajectories and intercepts for the unidentified object for the next six thousand years or so, as if it had nothing better to do with its time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mystery object appeared to be neither imminently dangerous nor edible, so the mainframe assigned it an identifying number, stored it away in its memory banks, and went back to playing Ketris. The computer was on the verge of achieving a new high score, a number so big that it could only be expressed using scientific notation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrudat\u0027s thesis adviser had said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGo to the Tracking Station and study comets for a while. Call me if you find anything interesting.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Upon reflection, Trudat Kerman figured the professor probably hadn\u0027t mean that last part literally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTell me again,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Professor Kerman grimly, \u0022why you woke me up at three in the morning to tell me you discovered a new comet?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He had been up late entertaining a pair of undergrads, and was not in the mood for any guff from Trudat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI don\u0027t think it\u0027s a comet!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 exclaimed Trudat, eyes bulging with excitement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COK, so it has an unusually high surface albedo.
