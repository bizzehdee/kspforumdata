Viewed from a distance, it consisted of a central truss, two long fuel tanks mounted alongside it, the internal bellows that had confined their contents during launch now collapsed, allowing the liquid ammonia inside to float freely. A more-or-less spherical systems module at one end sported the unfurling photovoltaic arrays, antennas and sundry other systems required to turn a pair of propellant tanks into a functional spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nViewed on the main screen of the Barkton Mission Control room, the spacecraft, like so many before it, was nothing but a marker. From the back of the room, Roncott watched it march along its elliptical path in lockstep with the remorseless logic marching through his own head. \u003Cem\u003EToo large for a Type 6. No spare launch capacity for an all-up test.

And at least it hadn\u2019t blown up. Roncott shook his head remembering long-ago scenes of despondency when Muna 2 had exploded shortly after lift-off. Much as he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to blame Rockomax\u2019s engineering teams, not least because they were probably as frustrated as he felt.

At the ten-minute mark, the timer disappeared, replaced by a split screen, one side a blur of computer code, the other side a checklist of key events and system start-ups. The one-minute mark was marked by a blue light at the Payload console, which blinked out at the tap of a key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E firing, Flight.

Then, with a sudden flurry of shifting data and a patter of applause from the flight controllers, it ticked over to the commanded point one radians per second and steadied. Geneney leaned back in his chair and looked up at the orbital plot. \u201CGood work, team. I\u2019m calling that a Go on stage one testing. Five revolutions, spin down, back into orbital rate and review. We\u2019re not getting as many revolutions as we\u2019d like, so lets make them all count.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe sad thing is that they weren\u2019t bad neighbours before this started.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy studied the other\u2019s careworn face and nodded in sympathy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI mean, it couldn\u2019t have been easy for them \u2013 the soil isn\u2019t good up there anyway and without a Kerm to improve it?\u201D The ambassador shrugged. \u201CThere\u2019s a reason we\u2019re mostly livestock farmers around these parts. They \u003Cem\u003Etried\u003C/em\u003E though, even managed to get a respectable harvest in last year. Not enough for them to share we didn\u2019t reckon, but plenty to keep them going by and by.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut this year?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ambassador sighed. \u201CWhatever they were doing, it wasn\u2019t enough. They came down here looking for help \u2013 and that must have been a bitter pill for them to swallow. We gave them what we could \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t take anything Kerm-grown but they were happy to take as many carcasses as we could spare. I suppose they figured that the beasts must have been grazing on clean grass or something.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COr they were too hungry to care.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COr they were too hungry to care,\u201D the ambassador agreed. \u201CWe gave them what we could of course. It cut into our Starseed donations but what of that. The space program will still be around next season but without food, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been.\u201D She grimaced. \u201CNot that everyone saw it that way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy nodded. \u201CNot with the space program starting to look like it\u2019s going somewhere. It\u2019s always easier to help out with something that\u2019s working.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd not give any more to those fools on the hill who are too proud to have enough to share but not too proud to take from those that have.\u201D The ambassador closed her eyes briefly. \u201CNot my words, Ambassador and, as I said, we did what we could but it just rubbed some folks up the wrong way. And when they took to stealing as well as taking, that was the last straw.\u201D She lifted her hands. \u201CWe tried speaking to them about it \u2013 after they tried denying everything, they chased us out of their\u2026 village at gunpoint. So, we called the authorities.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstandable.\u201D Gusemy made a note on his pad. \u201CI don\u2019t suppose you could give me an idea of the kinds of weapons they were carrying?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ambassador gave him an incredulous look. \u201CNo. I can\u2019t say that I can. For one, I wasn\u2019t there, and for two if someone pointed a gun at me and told me to leave, I\u2019d be too busy leaving to tell you anything about the gun.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course.\u201D Gusemy pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201CI\u2019m sorry but I had to ask.\u201D He closed his notebook and tucked it inside his poncho. \u201CYou\u2019ll be compensated for the lost livestock of course and please rest assured that those responsible will be brought to account. Thank you very much for your time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Ambassador.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy nodded and turned to leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce outside the hut he walked across the village green to the off-roader parked on the other side, oblivious to the curious looks from the villagers. He opened the door and climbed in. \u201CAbout what we expected from the complaint. Armed neo-kerman enclave; isolationist, turned to livestock theft when their crops failed. No further information on the number or type of weapons.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plain-clothes inspector in the drivers\u2019 seat gave him a resigned look. \u201CNever heard that one before.\u201D He gestured across the green at a low-built stone building with a sheet iron roof and a heavy steel door. \u201CTo hear these backwoods types talk, you\u2019d think they\u2019d never seen a gun, let alone the inside of the village armoury.\u201D He started the motor. \u201CAt least they\u2019ve had the sense not to start a shooting feud over a handful of stolen creva.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe road out of the village quickly turned steep, zig-zagging down to the valley floor before following the banks of a winding stream. Gusemy glanced around at the coarse, short-cropped grass, broken by the occasional patch of low-growing ferns or scraggly evergreen, and dotted with creva. Now and then, one of the creatures looked up as they passed, regarding them with an indifferent stare before lowering their heads to graze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they approached a fork in the stream, Gusemy leaned forward. \u201CThe turn-off should be just up ahead. Just a single-track road, I think. Ahh \u2013 that looks like it there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis companion just nodded, pulled up at the side of the road, and climbed out of the off-roader. Gusemy watched him cross the road and walk along the verge, stopping by what looked like the end of a farm track and staring along it for a moment, before turning and walking back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing to see at this end. Some of them like to put up a barricade or have a couple of lookouts. They\u2019ll probably have something nearer the village.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll the ones I\u2019ve been to had,\u201D Gusemy agreed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s get on with it then.\u201D The inspector slammed his door shut and started the motor again. \u201CEveryone alright in the back? Yes? Good. We\u2019ll go in nice and easy to start with but you all know the drill.\u201D He glanced around, then pulled out onto the road before turning up the farm track.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe track went on for longer than Gusemy had expected but was also in considerably better repair than he\u2019d expected. The track itself was still paved in places, with the larger potholes filled in with well tamped-down gravel. As they rounded a bend, he saw the weather-beaten remnants of two herder huts silhouetted against the skyline, the track petering out as it wound its way up the hill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh. Hunting rifles I\u2019d say, and they look comfortable enough with them.\u201D The inspector applied the brakes, bringing the off-roader to a smooth stop. Berating himself under his breath, Gusemy dropped his gaze back to the road and saw four kerbals dressed in heavy jackets, each with a rifle pointed not-quite-casually at the ground in front of them. He swallowed hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFirst time having a gun pointed at you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy forced his voice to remain steady. \u201CNo \u2013 but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s happened often enough for me to get used it.\u201D He was answered by a snort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe one time you do get used to it will be your last. Shall we see what these good kerbals have to say for themselves?\u201D The inspector raised both hands, palms outward, then lowered them to point at the doors. One of the kerbals in front of them lifted his weapon fractionally but nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSlowly does it. Keep your hands where they can see them. I\u2019ll go first.\u201D The inspector reached down and unsnapped the holster on his own sidearm, before opening the car door and stepping out onto the road. Gusemy counted to five under his breath before following him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s far enough. I don\u2019t know who you are or where you came from but I suggest you get back in that fancy car, turn it around and leave.\u201D One of his companions murmured something that Gusemy didn\u2019t catch and the leader\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201CAnd you should button down that holster before somebody gets hurt.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that, sir.\u201D The inspector paused. \u201CI\u2019m going to take this badge off my lapel and put it down where you can see it.\u201D Moving deliberately slowly, he removed his rank badge, took two steps forward and laid it on the ground before stepping back again.\u201D He watched one of the four pick it up and inspect it with a sudden hiss of indrawn breath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly so, sir. Why don\u2019t we all put our weapons down? I can avoid adding a great many firearms offences to your charge sheets, my colleagues in the back of the car won\u2019t need to join us, and we can all sit down to talk like civilised kerbals.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd wouldn\u2019t that be nice.\u201D The other didn\u2019t quite sneer but Gusemy noticed him lowering his rifle again. \u201CWhat do you want from us\u2026 officer?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019d like you to put your guns down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the kerbals cast an uneasy glance at the car. The inspector noticed her look. \u201CQuite.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBlight it all \u2013 I don\u2019t want any part of this grolnisch.\u201D She held out her rifle at arms-length with its muzzle pointing one side and its safety catch turned towards the inspector. She flicked the catch on with exaggerated slowness and put her weapon on the ground. The fourth kerbal followed suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe leader glared at his two companions but made no move to put his own rifle down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CC\u2019mon, Lant.\u201D The last of the four kerbals spoke out of the corner of his mouth, eyes fixed on the inspector. \u201CThey\u2019re not here to shoot first else they\u2019d all be out here together.\u201D He cast a disparaging look at Gusemy. \u201CFor damn sure they wouldn\u2019t bring an ambassador along.\u201D A third rifle joined the other two on the ground. Sullenly, Lant put down his own weapon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe bought this place fair and proper. Nothing you can do to get rid of us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s not what we came for,\u201D Gusemy said quietly. He gestured at the surrounding hills, ignoring Lant\u2019s truculent snort. \u201CThere\u2019s nowhere to plant a new Grove here that wouldn\u2019t overlap badly with the next one along the valley. As I think you knew,\u201D he added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sneer slid off Lant\u2019s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe did,\u201D one of his companions spoke up. \u201CBut if you ain\u2019t here to plant a murdering tree, what in the seven smoking\u2026 places,\u201D he amended, seeing the inspector\u2019s eyebrow raise, \u201Cdo you want?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTruthfully? We came here to ask for your help.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLant\u2019s jaw fell open. \u201CYou what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe came here to ask for your help,\u201D Gusemy glanced at the inspector. \u201CI think we all need to put our weapons down first though.\u201D He watched the inspector unbuckle his gun belt and lay it on the ground, the butt of his weapon pointed towards them. \u201CThank you.\u201D He turned back to Lant. \u201CMy name is Gusemy Kermol. When I\u2019m not at my own Grove, I work at the Berelgan Institute.\u201D One of the villagers started, her look suddenly intent. Gusemy dipped his head to her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMost of what we do these days is exactly what you\u2019re doing here \u2013 working out how to grow different crops in Kerm-free soil.\u201D He gestured at the village behind them with its paved roads and neat rows of brightly painted, corrugated iron houses, flicking his fingers to indicate the terraced fields lying fallow beyond. \u201CWe\u2019d like to compare notes, if you will.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould have shown you more last year. No harvest to speak of this year.\u201D She clapped her hand to her mouth, wilting under Lant\u2019s furious look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why you took to stealing livestock.\u201D Gusemy nodded to himself at the shamefaced looks from the other villagers. \u201CPlease don\u2019t be foolish,\u201D he added wearily, seeing Lant\u2019s eyes twitch towards the guns lying on the ground. The inspector gave Lant a quelling look as Gusemy continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe will need to talk about that I\u2019m afraid.\u201D Gusemy\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t unsympathetic. \u201CTheft is theft, even if the reasons for it are clear to see. But after we\u2019ve dealt with that, yes, I would very much like to speak to your farmers. If they were willing, we would have them Commune with our Kerm too.\u201D He held up a hand, seeing the hardening expressions in front of him. \u201CForget I mentioned it. Perhaps one of my colleagues might talk to them instead and learn their story.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause if they\u2019re unwilling to tell it to our Kerm, then I, or more probably our former Director, Erlin Kermol, needs to tell them instead. Under oath, I should add, with a witness in Communion with him, to ensure that nobody is misspoken.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe villager blinked. \u201CWhy\u2026 sorry, I\u2019m sounding like my youngest. That seems like a lot of trouble to go to, Ambassador.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt is,\u201D Gusemy agreed. \u201CYou are familiar with the One-Twenty, I presume?\u201D The dark looks and angry muttering from Lant and his other companions were all the answer he needed. \u201CIf I may borrow Chief Ambassador Aldwells\u2019 words: \u2018Nothing will be hidden. Everyone, be they kermol, neo-Kerman, or a Child of Kerbin, will have their views put before the Kerm. On that you have my word. In this forum. As a Pillar of the Council.\u2019 \u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy took a deep breath. \u201CIf we are to seek answers from the One-Twenty, then we must seek answers for all. You, your village, deserves to be heard as much as any other. And for their part, the Kerm also need to learn that kerbals are no longer wholly dependent on their Groves for food and shelter.\u201D He looked straight back at the villager. \u201CWe are indeed going to a lot of trouble. But only by guaranteeing that everyone gets their voice now, can we save a great deal more trouble in the future.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerm, that\u2019s quite the view.\u201D Jondun checked her tether and pulled herself free of Eve 6\u2019s hatch. She glanced at Calzer and Malmy who were watching her through the bridge windows. She raised her hand in acknowledgement before turning her full attention to the vista in front of her. Behind the bridge, the hub module stretched out before her, five of the eight spoke trusses arrayed around its circumference visible and gleaming in the reflected sunlight from Kerbin. Her home shone blue and green through their shining silver lattices as \u003Cem\u003ETenacity\u003C/em\u003E raced over the Northern Ocean, the Firesvarn western coastline just coming into view, Humilisia hidden by the curving bulk of the hub module. She\u00A0 peered up through her mirrored visor, catching a glimpse of the newly installed knuckle on the far end of its spoke, the lip of its auxiliary docking port peeping out from the white thermal blanket that swathed the rest of the module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNever gets old,\u201D Tommal agreed. \u201COkay, Flight, EVA-1 and 2, tethers secured and heading aft to the work site.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CCopy that, EVA-1. Tenacity, please confirm your status.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI have EVA-1 and 2 on camera, Flight. Malmy is in the Hub and ready to initiate inflation.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CVery good.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal and Jondun made their way over the Bridge module and across the hub, reporting each tether change and significant manoeuvre to Mission Control as they went. Aboard \u003Cem\u003ETenacity\u003C/em\u003E, Calzer switched from camera to camera to keep them in view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBeginning visual inspection.\u201D Tommal clipped his tether to the spoke truss and began a slow walkaround of the unstowed inflatable module already installed alongside the truss, stopping periodically to check the indicators set into the docking ring. \u201CAll packing straps have released correctly. So far as I can tell, the module skin looks evenly tensioned around the circumference, no obvious bulges or protrusions. Docking probes on knuckle port look good, hub port tell-tales are all green.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CGood work, EVA-2. Please withdraw to minimum safe distance.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COn my way.\u201D Tommal walked around the module, gathering in his tether as he went before joining Jondun behind the truss, which the mission planning team hoped, would provide some protection if anything went awry with the inflatable. \u201CEVA-2 is restrained and tethered at primary and secondary points.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEVA-1 is restrained and tethered.\u201D Jondun\u2019s voice was calm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CUnderstood. Tenacity, you are Go for inflation.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI hear that, Flight. Beginning minimum pressure expansion.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the minutes ticked by, Tommal thought that he could begin to see a subtle shifting of the shadows around the inflatable module\u2019s circumference. He tipped her head to one side, peering through the truss structure to try and find a reference point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CBack-pressure is holding steady on all four inflators, Flight.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight, EVA-1. I have visual inflation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CCopy, EVA-1.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal lifted his head a fraction, squinting along one of the truss cross-braces. Sure enough, the upper edge of the module was creeping past it, millimetre by painstaking millimetre, lifted on a gradually filling-out ring of fabric. \u201CGood eyes, Jondun. EVA-2 confirms.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first hour of the EVA came and went, the fabric ring now fully inflated and beginning to pull out a second ring from the stack of folded material attached to Tenacity\u2019s hub. The twelve structural tubes linking the two rings were clearly visible through the fabric panels which formed the outer shell of the inflatable module and the cross-tubing between them was starting to acquire definition. Tommal and Jondun shifted within the confines of their spacesuits, exercising muscles and joints in the almost subconscious routine of the experienced spacewalker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C\u2026and hold it there.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CCopy, Flight. Master regulator closed. Closing secondary valves on all inflators.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThank you, Tenacity. EVA-1, please proceed to work site and report.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood.\u201D Jondun unclipped one of her tether points and slipped her boots out from under their restraining bar. \u201CProceeding.\u201D She made her away around the truss and began her own circuit of the partially inflated spoke module. Aboard Tenacity, Calzer zoomed his camera out to keep her in view. \u201COkay, Flight, we\u2019re looking good here. Knuckle port is parallel with hub port, within visual limits. Upper ring is fully inflated, longeron inflation looks even around the module. Difficult to get a good visual on the cross tubes but I\u2019m not seeing any obvious kinking or protrusions. Outer shell looks to be unfolding cleanly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CVery good. We\u2019re not seeing anything on the telemetry either, so I think we can take things up a notch.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWill do.\u201D Malmy paused. \u201COkay, I\u2019ve let the regulator out a click. Ready when you are.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalzer watched Jondun make her way back behind the truss and heard her confirm her position to Mission Control. He cocked his head, listening for anything untoward in the Hub module before turning back to his monitors, Malmy\u2019s report that inflation had restarted coming both over his headset and from directly behind him. On the screen, the spoke module began to expand at a brisker pace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooking good\u2026looking good\u2026no wait.\u201D Malmy threw the master regulator closed. \u201CGot some pressure variance here, Flight. Backpressure on inflators one and two. Anything visible from outside, you both?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CGot a little bit of flexing about the hub port. It\u2019s damping pretty quickly though. What do you see, Jondun?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThe same. A little bit of stiction on the third ring I think but yes \u2013 it\u2019s pretty much stationary now.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CUnderstood. EVA-1, what is your assessment?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside, on the space station hull, Jondun thought for a moment. \u201CI would pulse inflators one and two a couple of times, wait for any motion to settle, then restart inflation at minimum pressure and see if we get smooth elongation. If not, Tom or I will inspect ring three, we call off the EVA for today and head back inside. Speculatively\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CGo ahead, EVA-1.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA little bit of grease on any problem folds might resolve the issue at that point, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt may well do but let\u2019s not borrow trouble for ourselves. The team here concurs with your first plan. Tenacity, do you read?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI do, Flight. Pulsing inflators one and two now.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJondun frowned, staring at the partially inflated module through her visor. \u201CNo obvious deflection from out here. Tom?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing visible, that\u2019s for sure.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CHere goes nothing, then. Restarting inflation, minimum pressure.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJondun blinked and tipped her head to one side. \u201CHmph. Looks like whatever was sticking just came unstuck. I\u2019m seeing a steady extension, a little faster than before I would say.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAnd I think we\u2019ll keep it that way. Sorry, EVA-1, you\u2019re out there for the long haul.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot a problem, Flight. Initial deployment was smooth as you could hope for though. With the second tube, we could maybe try a slightly less conservative inflation to ring two?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWe\u2019ll run it past the Barkton team. Right now, let\u2019s focus on installing tube one before worrying about tube two.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch to the relief of both spacewalkers, over the next few hours the spoke module continued its stately crawl up the truss until, at long last, the docking port attached to its far end was within range of the matching port on the knuckle. A sigh of relief sounded in Jondun\u2019s headset before Malmy came on the air to report what she could already see for herself. \u003Cem\u003E\u201CAnd that\u2019s a hold, Flight. Pressurant reserves well within estimate. How\u2019s she looking, Calzer?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CLined up just as neat as you could hope for.

The insides though, have been completely overhauled. Part count is down, chassis is lighter, the electronics are far more rugged and refilling is nowhere near the chore it was with the prototype.

Despite the meteoric rise in company capabilities and ambition, her memorabilia collection was still held in two glass-fronted cabinets by her office window, the old pared back to make way for the new. He smiled inwardly at the sight of the wrench still occupying pride of place in one cabinet, remembering the presentation by James, Sherfel and the \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E flight team. Evidently a tool used for the first on-orbit repair of a spacecraft was still deemed to be a worthy memento. And so, apparently, was the old firework mortar on its stand, the jagged Speciality Fireworks Company logo sprawling across it now faded by time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe company manager herself sat deep in thought, drumming her fingers on the edge of her desk. \u201CAgreed,\u201D she said at last. \u201CAny delays to the Type 7 program will be manageable and it would be politically wise to show the Doreni that Rockomax is taking the KSA\u2019s request seriously.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal nodded. \u201CHow are the Doreni taking it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout as well as you might expect,\u201D Ademone said dryly. \u201CI gather that Lodan received a \u003Cem\u003Eterribly \u003C/em\u003Epolite private welcome from his opposite number, after all the warm words for the cameras.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut a \u2018waste-anything-but-time\u2019 funding bill with a united Twelve Pillars behind it is providing a big enough carrot and a big enough stick to keep everyone smiling?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone raised an eyebrow. \u201CI prefer to believe that both sides are putting their disagreements to one side for the good of all kerbalkind. Although the funding bill will be helping no doubt.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal picked a speck of lint off his trousers. \u201CWe\u2019ll probably have to give them the SK1-P,\u201D he said. \u201CLodan\u2019s briefing seemed quite clear on that point. The Doreni want to launch their Duna shuttle prototypes on their own boosters, Lodan is in favour of that anyway because he doesn\u2019t see any point in shipping Doreni built spacecraft halfway around the world to launch them from Kolus, and the Council wants Doren launching Starseed payloads as soon as possible, if not before.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGive them it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe might as well. Again, judging from Lodan\u2019s briefing, their Hammerhead engine was intended to have roughly the same performance as the SK1-P and it\u2019s operating on the same cycle anyway. By the time we solve the combustion instability problems they\u2019re having, we\u2019ll probably end up with something that\u2019s a Skipper in all but name, so why not save ourselves some time and effort, bank some political favours, and move on?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone steepled her fingers under her chin. \u201CIt would certainly be a generous gesture,\u201D she said thoughtfully. \u201CDepending on requirements, that would let them field anything from an Endurance to a Type 5 equivalent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich should be enough for their shuttle program if they use the same Kerbin orbit rendezvous mission profile that we used for Pioneer,\u201D Hanbal finished. \u201CWhich is good because I\u2019d prefer not to hand over the Mainsail just yet.\u201D He eyed Ademone. \u201CLet\u2019s see how the Doreni get on with the Skipper first before we spend what will need to be a great deal of time setting up a Mainsail production line for them \u2013 time that I think could be more usefully spent updating our own launch facilities and putting the Type 7 into full production.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe saw the faint smile tugging at the corner of Ademone\u2019s mouth. \u201CDammit \u2013 it\u2019s not \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E! Leaving aside the fact that unless we make Starseed work, we\u2019ll be going bust anyway, the SK2-M is a dead end. Oh sure, we\u2019ll need the Type 7 to get Starseed into production but I can guarantee we won\u2019t be using it by the time we\u2019re done.\u201D Hanbal sat back in his chair. \u201CThe Type 7 is big, expensive, and disposable. By the time we get a couple of colony ships built, I think people are going to start noticing that last part. So, by then we need to be thinking about the next generation of launch vehicles.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite herself, Ademone leaned forward, intrigued. \u201CWhich is?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA reusable booster.\u201D Hanbal spread his hands on her desk. \u201CC7\u2019s spaceplane program is going well by all accounts but I doubt they\u2019ll be lifting more than crew to orbit with it. I\u2019ve run the numbers \u2013 even if the rumours are correct and they do have a working airbreathing engine - they won\u2019t have the mass fraction for anything else. For serious payload, we\u2019re looking at a two stage, reusable rocket.\u201D He gave Ademone a rueful look. \u201CI\u2019ve bounced some ideas around with Danfen and right now we\u2019re not sure what that\u2019s going to look like, but one thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 it won\u2019t be using an SK2-M. Too big, no throttle and no relight capability.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmmm.\u201D Ademone began ticking points off on her fingers. \u201CI\u2019d like to see those ideas. Once you\u2019re back from Doren, and the Type 7 failure investigation is complete, and the launchpad is back in operation, and the Type 7 program is in full production phase, and\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI get it. I get it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone\u2019s expression softened slightly. \u201CIt\u2019s a good point and one that I\u2019ll run past Loden but I think we have enough to be getting on with for the moment. For now, I agree that giving the Doreni the SK1P \u2013 assuming they need it \u2013 could be expedient. Keep that as a reserve option for now, find out whether their HH2 program is salvageable, and I\u2019ll speak to Lodan and the Board.\u201D She picked up a glass cube paperweight from her desk and rubbed her thumb over one edge. \u201CWhen do you leave?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal watched the sliver of M\u00FCn rock inside the cube appearing and disappearing behind her thumb. \u201CI\u2019m flying out the day after tomorrow. One of the first charter services to start flying again, I believe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone nodded. \u201CGood luck \u2013 and thank you, Hanbal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat time is your train tomorrow?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb appeared from beneath his desk, holding a can of chilled sapwood in each hand. \u201CNot until after lunch.\u201D He passed Bob one of the cans and popped the top off his own. \u201CSo Gene can get his beauty sleep in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney pushed the plunger down on his coffee press, waited for the grounds to settle, and poured himself a cup. \u201CI\u2019ll need it after tonight.

Difficult to say for sure since the times from going an-Kerm to Awakening have been all over the place so far and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any obvious pattern between Kerm age, Keeper age and Awakening time.\u201D Jonton smiled. \u201CThe next two have only just gone an-Kerm though, so they\u2019re pretty sure that Tivie will be next.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwenty-five Awakened Kerm.\u201D Patbro shook his head. \u201CWe\u2019d better get on with this second telegraph line then. Do we know where it\u2019s going yet?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEventually? Anywhere that Elton wants - it\u2019s just a telephone line after all. For now though, it\u2019ll probably be mostly for calls to the first Doreni Cluster at Almkat. He gets a lot of calls from Enedred\u2019s Cluster in Wakira, so between those and the regular conference calls with Erlin and his team, he thought it would be better to \u2018show goodwill and respect\u2019 to the Doreni by having a dedicated line installed for their Clusters.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Patbro\u2019s turn to smile. \u201CVery diplomatic.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd absolutely nothing to do with Jebediah\u2019s report that the Almkat Kerm are as space-crazy as he is,\u201D Jonton agreed. \u201CHe\u2019s been spending a lot of time reviewing what memories he has of Jebediah\u2019s namesake and trying to understand how he was able to get everyone to agree to the original Council of Twelve Truths. He hasn\u2019t said as much but I suspect that he sees an alliance with Almkat as a way to garner support for Project Starseed amongst the Doreni Kerm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPreserve me. A diplomat \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E a politician.\u201D Patbro glanced up at Elton\u2019s gently swaying branches. \u201CAlthough we kerbals could do an awful lot worse.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D Jonton gestured at a large crate and a reel of cable stacked next to his front door. \u201CShall we make a start on the Doreni hotline?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe criss-crossing trails of dead clover stood out clearly against the dense carpet of green which now surrounded Elton\u2019s trunk and Jonton thought he could have found a good site for the second Telegraph interface even without the ring of bright red canes marking the spot. He and Patbro scraped away the first few centimetres of earth with a spade before setting to work with their trowels. One of the red canes tumbled into the deepening trench and Jonton set his trowel aside and cleared away the last of the soil around Elton\u2019s fibre by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro handed him the U-shaped emitter jig which fitted easily over a large cluster of nodules on the main fibre, just behind a point where it split into two. Jonton marked the position of the jig holes, set it to one side and drove the two mounting pegs, for the emitter itself, into the soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight then.\u201D Jonton scanned the instruction card taped to the underside of the crate lid, before lifting the emitter assembly out of its packing. \u201CSwitch on the installation sensors. Okay, we\u2019ve got two green lights, so the sensors are working and the battery is charged.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo far so good,\u201D said Patbro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep. Hold the emitter unit by both handles. Depress trigger to release the guide grip, slide unit over the mounting pegs, and carefully lower it towards the Kerm fibre. An audible warning will sound when the emitter is at the correct height. Release the trigger to lock it in place.\u201D Jonton raised his eyebrows. \u201CI\u2019m so glad they told me to do this carefully.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro shrugged. \u201CBetter safe than sorry.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmph.\u201D An insistent bleeping noise sounded from the emitter unit. Jonton lifted it fractionally to shut off the alarm before releasing the trigger. \u201COkay. Now for the support legs \u2013 hmm, these are much easier than I remember. Could you do the backfilling while I hold onto this?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot a problem.\u201D Patbro began scooping soil back into the trench before tamping it down, taking special care to pack it around the support legs. Gingerly, Jonton let go of the emitter, hands hovering near the handles in case the alarm went off. Reassured by the silence, he stepped back and retrieved a stainless steel cartridge from the crate before squatting down beside the emitter and unlocking an access panel set into its stem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COpen the port. Insert double ended cartridge here, close the port and lock up.\u201D Jonton got to his feet and watched Patbro threading the telephone cable through a series of guides on the other side of the stem before plugging into its socket on the underside of the emitter\u2019s hemispherical cap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat should be everything.\u201D Jonton dusted off his hands. \u201CTime for the moment of truth. Well sort of. I guess that part comes later when Elton tries to use it but\u2026\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt definitely won\u2019t work unless you switch it on,\u201D Patbro said gently. \u201CI can do the honours if you like.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo. No, I should do it.\u201D Jonton unlocked a second access panel, revealing a single switch. He paused for a second then pressed it. A row of green lights under the emitter cap lit up in sequence and then winked out. Patbro gave him a thumbs-up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne Doreni hotline installed and powered up. He grinned at Jonton. \u201CNow let\u2019s go and face that moment of truth.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you getting this?\u201D Chad peered into his viewfinder and adjusted the focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CLooks fine from here. Reading you loud and clear on the audio pickup.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell alright then. Let\u2019s get set up for the big intro.\u201D Chad panned his camera round until the viewfinder showed nothing but blackness edged by curved metal corners.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CPatching you through to the studio now, Chad. Going live in two.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Flight.\u201D The chatter of technicians and television crew filled his ears alongside the more measured responses from the capsule systems team. Then the background noise cut out, replaced by a single familiar voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon everyone. I am Leland Kerman and this is a KBS News spaceflight special. With us today will be kerbonaut Chad Kerman, pilot scientist aboard Pioneer 6 and one of two remote operations specialists for this, the fifth Tenacity crew and its first full complement crew of eight kerbonauts.\u201D Leland paused. \u201CFoxham Mission Control has just confirmed that they\u2019re ready and waiting so, without further ado, let\u2019s go live to Tenacity. Can you hear us, Tenacity?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLoud and clear, Leland. It\u2019s good to have you with us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COur pleasure, Chad and thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re very welcome. We\u2019ve been working pretty hard up here for the last couple of weeks and we\u2019re looking forward to giving everyone back home a little guided tour.\u201D Chad cleared his throat. \u201CRight now I\u2019m at the far end of Spoke 1, our outermost spoke. It\u2019s the second one to be completed here aboard Tenacity \u2013 I was actually in here just this morning closing out the final set of leak tests and air quality checks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CI remember James Kerman talking about a \u2018new spacecraft smell\u2019 when he first opened Endurance\u2019s hatch. Do you still get that onboard a modern spacecraft?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad laughed. \u201CVery much so \u2013 and we like to try and keep it that way. A big part of the life support systems \u2013 well big for us crew anyhow - are the charcoal filters. They\u2019re mainly for removing any unwanted odours from the spacecraft systems but they do a pretty good job of keeping everything pretty close to new spacecraft fresh, even with eight of us floating around the place.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAre the spacecraft systems really that smelly?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe biology racks over in Spoke 5 sure can be. We\u2019ve been running some experiments for the long duration life support team, looking at different algal and bacterial cultures, to try and find one we can use for scrubbing carbon dioxide out of the air. Some of those can get pretty ripe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u201CI can imagine. Now, before we start, I\u2019m not seeing a great deal from our camera feed. Am I right in thinking that\u2019s because it\u2019s pointed at the outermost window?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely, Leland. I don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ll see from a movie camera but I can tell you now, this view is a treat. Stars upon stars upon stars.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWe\u2019re just getting a black disc, I\u2019m afraid.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh. Well I\u2019ll see what I can do to fix that after the show. Try and give the folks back home an idea of what it\u2019s like. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 you never get tired of looking at old Kerbin either, but I\u2019m looking forward to just bringing a ration pack up here sometime and spending some time with the universe over dinner, you know.\u201D Chad stretched out an arm. \u201CFor now I\u2019m going to do a slow pan around the module. There\u2019s not much to see at the moment \u2013 we\u2019ve got storage lockers and ventilation around the forward window there and then moving around, you can see the hatchway through to the rest of the spoke. Now that we\u2019re cleared for habitation in here, we\u2019ll be keeping the hatch open mostly but we can close it to seal off this module from the rest of the station in an emergency.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe image on Leland\u2019s screen continued its stately pirouette, coming to rest at a second, closed, hatchway that, to his eye, looked very similar to the first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd this here, is the aft hatch. Identical to the one you just saw to save on manufacturing costs. Right now it doesn\u2019t lead anywhere except hard vacuum but if we were onboard one of the actual colony ships, we\u2019d be facing backwards along the length of the craft towards the engines.\u201D A hand appeared in shot as Chad pointed at the hatch. \u201CAnd this would be the way into the main living area. During the journey to Duna, the ship will be spinning about its long axis which means that anything through there gets pushed out against the spacecraft hull. It\u2019s not real gravity but it\u2019s the next best thing.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you want to see how it works back at home, take a bucket of water, tie a rope to the handle and spin it round your head. Even if the bucket goes upside down the water won\u2019t fall out because the spinning is pressing it against the bottom of the bucket.\u201D Chad pushed off from the hatchway. \u201CYou should probably try that outside though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland chuckled.\u003Cem\u003E \u201CYes, for the benefit of our audience, KBS News recommends that any scientific experiments involving swinging buckets of water around, be carried out outside. Oh \u2013 now this is looking a little more lived in?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view from Chad\u2019s camera showed the interior of what appeared to be an immense tubular blanket, wide enough for two kerbals to pass one another with ease. On the left-hand side, a row of flattened, slightly convex, lighting panels stretched along the tube wall linked by slender fabric sleeves. Leland tilted his head to one side, trying to match up the image on the screen against what he knew of \u003Cem\u003ETenacity\u2019s\u003C/em\u003E construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere and there along the opposite side of the tube, somebody had stuck a handful of posters depicting scenes from Kerbin. They were, Leland noted, mostly of woodland or other rural scenes, and he wondered if any of the kerbonauts aboard the station had put up a picture of their Grove. Between the posters, sections of webbing had been strung up and now held a eclectic assortment of high tech equipment, squeeze tubes of water, paperback novels and other personal items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep, that\u2019s the great thing about Tenacity,\u201D Chad said. \u201CThere\u2019s enough room for us to get some personal space. When you\u2019re down in the Hub or the Bridge modules, there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that you\u2019re inside a spacecraft but out in the spokes it\u2019s quite cosy. Although, unless you\u2019re in a spoke that\u2019s rigged with equipment racks, there is a limit to what you can attach to the walls. Hang on \u2013 I\u2019ll just leave the camera here a minute.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a confusing jumble of images and then Chad appeared in-shot, floating next to one of the posters. \u201CCan you see me?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWe can see you fine and I think our viewers will really be getting that zero-G feeling, watching you.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. Now, I\u2019m gonna let you all into the big secret of living in space.\u201D Chad peeled back a corner of the poster revealing a patch of bristly looking fabric. \u201CGood old hook-and-loop fasteners. Pretty much everything you see in here is stuck to the wall with it and actually, any time you see anything at all attached to a spacecraft wall, it\u2019s a good bet that it\u2019s either welded on or stuck down with hook-and-loop.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad pressed the poster back into place. \u201CAnd before any of your viewers ask, the reason we don\u2019t use thumbtacks in here is not because we\u2019re worried about popping the tube but because we don\u2019t want anything small and sharp getting loose and floating around at eye-level.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is a question that a lot of our viewers have asked so thanks for clearing that up for us.\u201D Leland watched the kerbonaut retrieve his camera, orient himself and then push off along the spoke, the almost perfectly steady movement of the camera making him feel slightly nauseous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay then, we\u2019re passing through the hatch into the knuckle module. This is the halfway point of the spoke and, as you can see, it\u2019s got a window over there and two docking ports on the other sides. Right now, we\u2019ve got a Power, Assembly and Logistics module or PAL docked outside but down on Spoke 4 we\u2019re looking forward to hosting the very first Duna shuttle prototype, courtesy of a whole lot of hard work from our Doreni colleagues over the last year.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAnd some help from the Rockomax Corporation?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI believe so, Leland, although I\u2019m told that the shuttle is an all-Doreni design. I\u2019m no propulsion specialist but I know a lot of folks have been getting very excited about their KR-1L engine from Kerbodyne. Anyway, their first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E test flight is underway but if all goes well, their second test vehicle should be docked to Spoke 4 in a month or so.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CFor more of that new spacecraft smell?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad grinned. \u201CYep! Incidentally, that PAL outside used to be docked on the back of the Hub module \u2013 we moved it to this spoke to help out with construction and to free up a docking port for the second Bridge module.\u201D Chad drifted over to the window. \u201CNow, the angles aren\u2019t great from here, so I\u2019m going to pass you across to Mission Control for a moment, so you can get a good look from one of our external cameras.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland\u2019s screen flickered and suddenly he was outside the space station, staring at the PAL spacecraft docked to its spoke, photovoltaic arrays gleaming in the sunlight and its robotic arm angled towards the far end module where Chad had begun his tour. The camera tilted before zooming in on the knuckle window from which the kerbonaut was waving back at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh my.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s something isn\u2019t it? I was out on the end of the arm the week before last, helping to nudge that second inflatable section into place. Riding that thing is a blast \u2013 makes the EVA so much easier!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat to Leland\u2019s regret, his screen flickered again and he was back inside \u003Cem\u003ETenacity.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWelcome back. Let me just get myself turned around here. Little push against the window frame\u2026 and there we go.\u201D Chad slipped through the hatchway and along a second fabric tube, which was also adorned with posters and the occasional photograph. Leland caught a glimpse of a group of kerbals sitting around a picnic table, mugs hoisted at the photographer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, around the hatch here you can see the couplings for the equipment racks.\u201D Chad pointed at a set of clamps and connectors on either side of the hatchway. \u201CMechanical interface, power supply and data feeds. You can fit in two racks per module but it doesn\u2019t leave you with much of a gangway. Not a problem once we\u2019ve finished up the wheel \u2013 we can designate any double-racked spokes as a one-way street so to speak but right now it\u2019s kind of handy to have enough room for two crew to get past each other.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad checked his slow drift against the hatch frame before poking his head through. Leland reeled away from his screen at the sudden vertiginous sense of space yawning below him before perspective reasserted itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd welcome to the Hub. In here, you can almost believe that you\u2019re flying a spacecraft again. Hi, Milden. Quick wave for the folks back home?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHi, Chad. Hello everyone.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s on the tasklist for today then, Milden.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other kerbonaut dipped her head. \u201CUm, clearing any fan debris and checking the filters. Then Mitzen and I are prepping the rack mounts in Spoke 7.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was just telling Leland about the filters. Are you still with us, Leland?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWe\u2019re right here, Chad, and wondering if kerbonaut Milden could spare us a moment to talk about the fan debris. That sounds pretty serious?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh it\u2019s nothing much,\u201D Milden said. \u201CAll the hard modules here are equipped with ventilation fans to keep the air moving in zero-gravity and to pull it through the air conditioning units where the carbon dioxide is taken out and fresh oxygen put back in. The fans also act like little suction-cleaners \u2013 any loose items floating around tend to find their way to a fan eventually, so keeping them clear is one of our housekeeping tasks.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you find my lucky cufflink, that would be great,\u201D Chad put in. \u201CNo idea where that\u2019s got to.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeland got a distinct impression that the other kerbonaut was trying not to roll her eyes. \u201CI will, Chad. I should be getting on though \u2013 it was good to speak to you, Leland.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThank you for your time, Milden.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad watched Milden disappear into one of the spokes before turning his attention back to the camera. \u201CWhere were we. Ah yes \u2013 the Hub.\u201D He cleared his throat. \u201COn the actual colony ship, the Hubs are designed as emergency radiation shelters for the crew in case of any sunspot activity from Kerbol. They\u2019ll also contain the acceleration couches for the crew to use during any significant manoeuvres. Here on Tenacity, we\u2019re using our Hub as the main eating and sleeping area.\u201D The camera turned to give a view of a set of shelves, sleeping bags and more elasticated webbing for personal effects. \u201CThe sleeping arrangements haven\u2019t changed much since our very first space station, Endurance. They\u2019re simple but they work and they\u2019re pretty comfy in zero-G. We keep the dining table packed away during the day \u2013 one less thing for everyone to bump into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad checked his watch. \u201CWe\u2019re almost out of time I\u2019m afraid folks, but I\u2019ve got one last thing to show you before we go. Spoke 4 is pointing at Kerbin right now and the view out of the window there is pretty good \u2013 but you\u2019ve all seen the inside of a spoke now. So we\u2019re gonna head through to the first Tenacity module to be launched into space.\u201D He pushed off one of the sleeping shelves and towards a dim hatchway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is the forward gangway leading to the main docking port. And here,\u201D Chad reached over his head, caught a handhold and began pulling himself along the ladder, \u201Cis the access way to the Bridge. Officially it\u2019s the forward observation deck but on the actual colony ship it\u2019ll be the bridge, so that\u2019s what\u2019s stuck. As he emerged from the access tube, he heard a sudden intake of breath over his headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CPillars preserve me.\u201D \u003C/em\u003EThe veteran broadcaster\u2019s voice shook. \u003Cem\u003E\u201CIt looks ready to fly.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChad drifted over to the centre seat, panning the camera round as he went. Everyone in the KBS studio were treated to a view of the seats secured to the convex floor and the instrument panels and monitoring stations arranged around the outside walls, before the image on their screen settled on the view of Kerbin through the bridge windows. Then the camera tilted up slightly and zoomed in to reveal three items secured to the centre window frame. A carved wooden space capsule, its darkly polished surface reflecting streaks of blue light from outside sat flanked by a miniature flag of all Kerbin on one side and a equally miniature pennant emblazoned with a white cross painted on a tree stump and a stylised hand clutching a dripping paintbrush.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CGuardian Elton\u2019s gift, the flag of all Kerbin and the White Cross Company logo. How completely appropriate.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe thought so,\u201D Chad said soberly. \u201CHaving all three of them there with Kerbin in the background \u2013 well it helps put this whole thing into perspective.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy climbed out of the off-roader and eyed the Veiidan squad with trepidation. Clad from head to foot in Kerm-protective gear complete with helmets and full-face steel mesh masks, they resembled a cross between a motorcycle racer and a warrior from one of the more lurid historical dramas. The overall effect would have been comical were it not for the obviously Kerm-worn state of their armour and the air of grim competence that hung over them. Their sergeant stepped up to Gusemy\u2019s companion and saluted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPerimeter is set, sir. Bravo squad report no sightings of resistance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAcknowledged.\u201D The commander frowned for a moment then shrugged and turned to Gusemy. \u201CRight. Let\u2019s get you suited up, sir.\u201D He opened the back of the off-roader, hauled out two sets of armour and began climbing into one. Following his lead, Gusemy removed his shoes before pulling on a pair of heavy padded trousers, their tough fabric slightly ridged under his fingers. By the time he\u2019d donned his belt, matching padded jacket and steel capped boots, the sergeant had sorted through the pile of plates, straps and buckles at his feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVest on first.\u201D A heavy chest and backplate linked by shoulder straps dropped over his head. The chestplate gave slightly as the sergeant tightened its waist straps and Gusemy felt the metal plates inside shifting in their pockets. Knee, elbow and shoulder pads went on next followed by supple chain gauntlets and an aluminium gorget around his neck. The sergeant studied him for a moment. \u201CThat\u2019ll do. He\u2019s all set, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, sergeant.\u201D The commander studied Gusemy too. \u201CRight. You\u2019ve been to your share of neo-Kerman villages and I\u2019ve heard you can stay calm with a gun pointed at you. That\u2019s good.\u201D He looked the ambassador in the eye. \u201CUnfortunately, the Children of Kerbin are nothing like your average neo-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E. One camp might come quietly, the next will fight you tooth, nail and vine. Your armour should keep you out of most trouble but if it all goes south you hit the dirt and let my lot deal with it. Do I make myself clear?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CQuite clear, Commander. Thank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other grunted in reply before turning to his squad. \u201CForm up, move out, and stay sharp for Kerm trees.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe squad formed up around Gusemy and set off towards the forest at a trot. Weighed down by his armour, the ambassador did his best to keep up but by the time they reached the treeline, his gorget was already chafing and his shoulders were starting to ache. As they slipped into the forest, the Veiidans fanned out and, much to his relief, slowed to a fast walk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they pushed on into the forest, Gusemy swore he could see shadows flitting between the trees. The commander made a low hooting noise before making a sharp hand gesture to his troops. He saw Gusemy\u2019s raised eyebrows and nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s them,\u201D he advised quietly. \u201CGood woodcraft \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be seeing them unless they wanted us to.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cold trickle of sweat ran down Gusemy\u2019s back and, despite himself, he swallowed hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, I don\u2019t like it either. Remember \u2013 if it goes south, hit the dirt.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sergeant jogged over and muttered something into her commander\u2019s ear. A grim look crossed his face and he glanced at Gusemy before turning his attention back to their surroundings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forest began to thin out around them until they emerged on the edge of a large clearing, dotted with tree stumps. Further back, clapboard hut, linked by cobbled paths, had been built around the larger trees. Gusemy\u2019s nostrils twitched at the mingled scents of woodsmoke and drying fish and he noticed a larger hut, constructed from rough-dressed stone and set well away from the others, a ragged tendril of smoke leaking from its chimney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere and there, pieces of more modern technology broke the rusticity. Gusemy spotted the occasional hut sporting an antenna or photovoltaic array on its roof and some of the huts were equipped with steel rain barrels. And, in the very centre of the clearing, he was unsurprised to see a larger hut built around a Kerm tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAround the edges of the clearing hut doors opened and groups of grey-clad figures filed silently into the clearing dressed in long cowled ponchos. In eerie unison they pushed back their cowls, revealing circlets of woven Kerm leaves around their foreheads and lines of livid raised weals across their cheeks. To Gusemy\u2019s horror, the younger figures bore lines of swollen and still-weeping puncture marks. \u00A0The sudden hiss of indrawn breath from the commander told him that the Veiidan recognised them too but before he could say anything, one of the figures broke away from the group, hands flung out in surrender. Before she could take more than a second step she was cuffed to the ground, the impact cutting off her sudden cry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKermbal minsathona!\u201D One of the figures stepped forward and spat on his sprawling companion before lifting his head and staring contemptuously at the Veiidans. \u201CI see the cowards and the unworthy have arrived at last.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3737200\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 109\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3766061\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 111\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T15:43:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordOfTheNorth","CreatedById":191759,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-01T23:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBring on the next chapter (and excellent job as usual).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-02T12:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve made a start on the next chapter - and I always find starting to be the hardest part. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Misguided Kerbal","CreatedById":203209,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-08T02:48:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I\u0027m new to the forums, and I\u0027ve been reading this for a while and I just joined, I have a question: I remember in one of the chapters that you said something about joenie having to complete school, I think this was the berelegan.

The kerman are typically urban with lifestyles and occupations that would be broadly familiar to a human observer, once you\u0027ve accounted for the somewhat different social structures and priorities. The kermol are typically rural, responsible for most of the agriculture on Kerbin and - crucially - tend to the Kerm trees. The Kerm have a long and convoluted history with the kerbals but at a very basic level, they\u0027re required for kerbal reproduction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHence, if they want to raise a family, a pair of kerbals will need to \u0027go kermol\u0027 at some point in their lives. It therefore follows that all young kerbals (or kerblets) start off as kermol, although there are no social barriers that prevent them going kerman when they come of age, staying as kermol if they choose, or indeed switching back and forth as suits them over the course of their life. Geographically, each kerman town or city tends to be associated with a reasonably large number of neighbouring Kerm Groves and attendant kermol villages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - education and schooling. There are three stages - primary education, secondary education and tertiary education.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EPrimary education\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first few years\u00A0 are mostly given over to homeschooling, with formal schooling being worked in gradually. By the time they\u0027re ready to start secondary school, a kerblet will be spending three days a week at school, with homeschooling on the other days. Homeschooling is a mix of basic \u0027reading, writing and arithmetic\u0027 level education combined with more practical lessons in agriculture or one or more trade skills. It\u0027s very common for kerblets to be swapped around between different kermol parents in order to match up kerblet interests with the adult who can best teach them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFormal schooling is almost entirely devoted to soft skills at this stage. This starts off with \u0027learning to play nicely with others\u0027 and progresses to teambuilding exercises, puzzles (solo or team), and team games, along with lessons on citizenship and social responsibilities. Academically, a kerblet leaving primary education will be quite a way behind their human counterpart but they\u0027re typically better equipped to deal with the world around them and have a much better grounding in learning how to learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ESecondary education\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is marked by a greater emphasis on formal learning and covers most of the subjects you\u0027d expect to see in a human school curriculum. Secondary schools are almost invariably located in kerman towns (as opposed to primary schools - most Groves will have a primary school of their own or be neighbours with a larger Grove which has one), and the very wide catchment area of those schools would make the daily school run very time consuming and inefficient. As a result, most secondary schools are boarding schools with their pupils attending on a \u0027two weeks at school, one week at home\u0027 basis, at least to start with. The week at home is for acquiring and/or developing practical skills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final two years of secondary education are entirely spent at school.
