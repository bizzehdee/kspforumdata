Who would have thought that he would have been picked to lead the formation for the Kerbin City Grand Remembrance day celebration in his Vulcan strategic bomber alongside his friend and co-pilot Kendread Kerman and Navigator Bobdoe Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidvis slumped back into the seat and grinned, if only Jeb, his mentor could have seen this moment but unfortunately two years ago Jeb was killed in a freak training crash in his trusty Aries 3A in full view of his trainee class and Sidvis crew. Sidvis had taken over all of Jebs duty\u0027s and was quite happy to finally lead this formation of the latest military aircraft. \u0022Five minutes left until rendezvous Skipper\u0022 said Bobdoe from underneath the flight deck ,Sidvis Cheerfully replied \u0022Good I\u0027d like to have someone else to talk t...\u0022 his sentence was cut short by a large explosion and a horrific whine, they had been hit. \u0022We lost engine one, bird strike, looked like an albatross.\u0022 Kendread Shouted \u0022Bulls*** the albatross has been grounded for years now\u0022 screamed Sidvis Jokingly, Kendread chuckled back as he struggled with the control column of the crippled bomber Sidvis heard Bobdoe yell something about an over speed in engine 2 over the rattling airframe, and a small fire in the rear fuel tanks but his thoughts where cut short as the aircraft detonated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidvis woke up, falling was a strange feeling, especially when the aircraft was inverted, wait what? inverted? Sidvis reached for the controls and realised there where flames all around him, Sidvis Yelled frantically \u0022WE\u0027RE ON FIRE EJECT!\u0022 He Looked up towards the ejection hatch and realised it was blocked, he yanked on the controls and tried pulling the nose up out of its nosedive, and checked for his crew, Kendread stared back at Sidvis, shocked at something, and Bobdoe was frantically pushing buttons on his control panel trying to work out what was wrong, Sidvis realised someone was screaming and checking his friends again revealed something shocking, it was him who was screaming and he was on fire, the flame licking the cockpit around him, Sidivs stared out of the top hatch at the moon glaring down on him and slumped into the seat, and let the flame overcome him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T05:32:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by qwertyx2y\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPARAGRAPHING!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qwertyx2y","CreatedById":22588,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T03:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn hold for a while as I play .24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile tell me what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T03:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 03:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by qwertyx2y\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding stuff.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T05:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENeeds moar paragraphs - it would make it much easier to read.
