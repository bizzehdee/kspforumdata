We may not be NASA But we\u0027re KSC.

Jebediah replied \u0022That i\u0027m not really understanding either. I guess they just want to make sure we really know what we\u0027re doing. Besides if anything goes wrong and they can\u0027t help they don\u0027t want the kerbal dieing because he can\u0027t fly the ship.\u0022 Bill replied \u0022Yeah, Now that you say that it does make a little more sense now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey finished their tests.

You also understand there is a danger, We don\u0027t want to guarantee safety and have it be wrong. You courageously accepted this challenge. This briefing will be short, Everything you Already know. So if you succeed, You will go down in history and you will have helped kerbalkind greatly in their triumph of minmus. You will also be Number ONE Most selected for other missions.
