Has an atmosphere about half as thick as kerbin\\\u0027s. Its surface is mostly tan-coloured due to the vast amounts of Silicon dioxide on its surface, but there are patches of yellow because of Sulfur, which was spewed out by giant volcanoes long ago. The extinct volcanoes still remain, and one of them is the second-largest in the solar system.
