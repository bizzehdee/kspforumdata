This forum post is a fun one. A \u0022give a little, get a lot\u0022 type of post.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022^_^\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 title=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter much thought and excitement, I\u2019ve decided to make the leap and become a KSP YouTuber!\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI used to deem myself too shy and reserved for that, but I decided to make the leap as you can tell.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u2019s one small step for a Kerbal, but one giant leap for Kerbalkind!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, long story short, I gave making a Kerbal Space Program video a try the day before I wrote this post (July 4th, 2024!!!!) and found that it actually felt quite natural.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere I was thinking that my voice might have been a bit too grating or whatever-you-want-to-call-it for that, but upon listening back to it that day, I realized it was the contrary.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, that being said, my request is simple: send me whatever KSP video idea you have, as long as it\u0027s actually feasible, which is much different from practical, so that I can try it out!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI feel like, in doing that with all of you, that might serve to be one of the best parts, if not \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Whether it\u2019s challenges, mission concepts, or spacecraft designs, I want to hear it all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019m ready to take on ambitious, daring, and out-of-the-box ideas that do things like play around with the boundaries of what can be done in Kerbal Space Program and such.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u2019s like taking a piece of your imagination and beaming it up by broadcasting it to the entire community. How legendary is that?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s a win-win: you get the perks that come with being the one who gave me my video idea, and I get the fun challenge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, well, people need things to help them stay sane, right? Well, KSP is one of those things for sure, and I feel like what I have described would and will be a welcome supplementary addition.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot things too adventurous, crazy, simply plain dumb, or maybe even merely too involved to try out, but still want to see?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI got you covered. Keep those Kerbals safe and sound. I\u0027ll do it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is about unity... \u003Cem\u003EUnity Engine unity, even\u003C/em\u003E \u2014 coming together as a fandom and showing what happens when you pool collective genius.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u2019s about\u00A0creating something epic together, turning the spotlight on each and every one of you who wants it, whilst giving credit where it\u2019s due.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of writing this post, I was ready to start making KSP videos for all of you to watch short of having the channel for it created yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut that is precisely the plan, and, as much skill as I may have with making KSP videos, I want and even need your ideas, which is why I wrote this post.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo... go ahead! Type out what you want to see, and I will talk to you about it ASAP.
