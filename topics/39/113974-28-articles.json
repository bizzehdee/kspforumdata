She strained uselessly at the handcrank that now felt welded in place. Her breath was a ragged staccato, throat dry and face soaked. She circled around in the space that seemed to be getting smaller, trapped, panic rising in her gut. The shadows... she could *see* the shadows...\n\nThe assault came from every direction at once. Pale specters and ghostly phantasms converged on her, tore at her, screaming with unnatural sounds. Thrashing, not bothering to contain her screams any longer, she fell to the floor. A piercing shriek drilled into her ears. She could feel them, pulling, shaking...\n\nAs quickly as it began, it stopped. Valentina lay on the floor, panting, covering her helmet. Lingering clouds of dust slowly drifted away. It took her a moment to realize all was still. All, except the awful, undulating shriek. She looked around, confused, before letting out a sobbing laugh. \n\n***Of course!** I am such a fool!*\n\nDust mitigation. She remembered now, the dust mitigation system, it activated automatically. Probably engaged it when she opened the outer hatch. Perfectly normal. But... was the door itself automatic too? With that thought, she looked toward the inner hatch... the one something had thumped against. Or... had she imagined that, too? \n\n*Get a hold of yourself, now your eyes are joining in on the\u2014*\n\nWith a loud *thunk* as latches released, the inner hatch swung open. It absolutely, undeniably, creaked. The shrieking got louder. \n\n*Just dust in the hinges. The airlock pressurized, you can hear now. All perfectly normal.*\n\nValentina rose to her feet, and took a rock hammer from the pile of tools anyway. It felt incredibly light and pointless. All she could hear was her own breath and that horrible wail. The source of that, at least, became clear as she neared the hatchway. Across, on the far wall, was a bank of four monitors. One was plainly dead, but the others were covered in flashing yellow indicators, and a few red ones. \n\nShe peeked out, awkwardly turning her whole body; just moving her head only showed her the inside of her own helmet. Even *that* felt like it was getting smaller. A thick, heavy blob of sweat slid into her eye. Just before her, the patch of fog on her faceplate grew larger, the suit struggling to keep up with her labored breath. \n\nOne wall was covered in more tools, supplies, various carts and equipment. The other\u2014\n\nShe jumped, in spite of herself. Staring back at her with faceless scrutiny was a row of hanging EVA suits. With a long breath, Valentina stepped out into the room, clutching the hammer in both hands like a lifeline. She thought if she didn\u0027t stop that ear-piecing shriek it might drive her over the edge into madness. There was a Master Caution light over the monitors; hoping it worked like every other one she\u0027d seen, she pressed it. \n\nMercifully, it did. The din died away, once more leaving her own breath the only sound. For a short time, breathing was all she could do, before conscious thought gradually returned. This was probably an extra status display for returning EVA\u0027s. Scanning over the monitors, nothing looked *too* serious. Filters long overdue for replacement, scrubbers that needed recycling. \n\nOf more serious concern, the B-block coolant loop had ruptured, but the computer had automatically shunted it to the auxiliary line, which was overloaded but holding. It looked like... yes, that caused an overheat on the #7 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E, but again the computer had shut it down. Which was impressive, considering the computer had also shut down one of its own cores and put another two into safe mode. \n\nValentina took a step back, looking over the whole display. She hoped that dead monitor wasn\u0027t hiding anything more serious, but overall this was *very* impressive. For things to be running at *all* by now, those KSA engineers sure knew how to\u2014\n\nGasping, she spun around. Trying not to breathe, her eyes darted this way and that. No, nothing there of course. For a moment, reflected in that black screen, she thought she saw...\n\nSlowly, Valentina shook her head, dislodging another blob of sweat into her eye. She couldn\u0027t hear. Couldn\u0027t see. Thought it might even be getting harder to breathe. Maybe she should take her helmet off. No, probably not wise...\n\nHer eyes wandered back to the monitors. Pressure 95 kPa, fairly normal. Humidity 12%, dry like her throat. Temperature 28C. Oh, that sounded enticingly cool! Oxium 19%, carbon dioxium 757 ppm. \n\nHmm. That was odd.  The O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E level was slightly low while the CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E level was a touch high. Not nearly enough to be harmful, but... with no load on the life support system, the numbers should be more nominal. Unless something in here was still\u2014\n\nNo, that\u0027s just silly. Nothing could *possibly* be alive in here. With all the system failures, it was a wonder those numbers weren\u0027t even more off. \n\nShe moved to put a hand to her temple, but found only her helmet again. All right, think. So hard to think, with her head pounding. Mouth so dry. Now... the base was a big cylinder. This was the airlock deck. Galley is below. Probably nothing useful there. Except... maybe a bottle of water. But she\u0027d have to take her helmet off. She looked down, but again saw only the inside of her helmet. \n\nSweat ran into both eyes. Valentina took a step back, blinking. Through the metal grating between the levels, she could see the deck above. That should be the control center. Then the crew quarters. Then the labs at the top. Should probably head for the labs, that\u0027s where\u2014\n\nA gloved hand gripped her shoulder. \n\nValentina let loose with a scream that drilled into her own ears inside the helmet. She spun around and drove the claw of the hammer into her attacker\u0027s...\n\n*Sigh.*\n\nNo, she had just ruined a perfectly good EVA helmet. Her own face stared back at her accusingly, reflected in the cracked gold sunshade that now had a hammer jutting out of it. She had to get out of this helmet. She *had* to. Suffocating was better than this, *anything* was better than this! If she had to endure *one more minute...*\n\nFumbling in the stiff gloves, she released the latches. There was a slight hiss as pressures equalized. She tensed. Valentina took the helmet off and drew in a shaky breath. Her eyes fluttered open. A slow exhale.\n\nThe air was... stale, old. Reminiscent of all her months cooped up in space stations. A strange chemical odor overlaid it, like gunpowder. But it was cool and dry and wonderfully *open*. And... something else too. Old. Familiar. A sickly sweet smell, subtle, like... decay...\n\nThat couldn\u0027t be right. She raised a hand, and finally was able to rub at her temples. Coherent thought was slowly returning. Now, the crew had used up their fresh food long before they left. That, and the dry recycled air... there shouldn\u0027t be anything *left* to decay at this point. \n\nValentina brushed the thought aside for the moment, and looked down at her gloved hands. She might have to leave quickly, was it worth the risk? The air was obviously fine, but... With a grunt, she undid a wrist clasp. She had to hold back another scream, this time of pain. As the glove came off, so did little bits of skin. A thick ooze of sweat dribbled to floor in slow motion. Her skin was shriveled and pruny; pale, like a corpse-hand. Breath caught in her throat as she flexed. She hadn\u0027t realized how cramped the stiff glove had made it.\n\nWorking delicately, her stomach clenching as more dead skin sloughed off, she undid the other clasp and let that glove fall to floor. Her hands were covered in angry red patches, throbbing with pain. Why hadn\u0027t she noticed? As she struggled for steady breath, her eyes scanned around... *there*. A small wash basin off to one side. Did she dare? Stale air was one thing, but water, after all this time? She gingerly turned on the faucet. A slow, clear trickle ran out. Steeling herself, she moved a hand under it. The wounds stung until her fingers twitched, but as the old sweat washed away, sweet relief followed. \n\nValentina let the water flow over her ravaged hands for a long time, still mesmerized by the odd way it splashed and sprinkled in the low gravity. She cupped them together, and raised a thick, wobbling pool to her face. The sensation was beyond bliss. It felt like resurrection. Without hesitating to consider the durability of its electronics, she stripped off her cap-like communications carrier and wrung it out over floor. More viscous strings of sweat dribbled down to the grating below. Then she thrust it under the faucet, filling it like a basin before dumping the whole thing over her head. \n\nShe gasped in pure ecstasy. Cold, life-bringing rivulets ran down her neck, flowed into her suit and all around her. Electric shivers ran up and down her spine from the exultation of it. She felt like being born again. \n\nOpening her eyes, Valentina ran her tongue over parched and dry lips. It took an act of will to keep from sticking her head under the facet and gulping water down, but she knew where it came from, here. Even the tap was placarded, DO NOT DRINK. \n\nBut she could once again feel vigor returning to her weary frame. There must be *some*thing left here to drink, but for now she could press on a little longer. The first aid cabinet above the sink was raided for some soothing balm and bandages for her fingers, by then the skin that had stayed on her hands was already returning to normal. \n\nOf *course* she\u0027d been imagining things. Exhausted, overheated, that was to be expected. The mind was strange, like that. Now, to be on to the lab at the top of the base. If she remembered from the documents, that had been Edmund\u0027s domain, there must be something useful\u2014\n\nA noise drew her ear. \n\nShe thought... no, there it was again. A faint scratching noise coming from an air duct going up the wall. She stared at it. A bit of loose insulation, perhaps? An errant bolt, driven by the rushing air? Or... had she really heard it at all?\n\nCautiously, Valentina approached. No, still nothing. An unremarkable tubular duct running up the wall. She leaned her head near it, holding her breath that was once more loud in her ears. Nothing but the muffled sound of rushing air. \n\nThere, see? Nothing to\u2014\n\nShe jumped back as something *thump*ed against the inside of the pipe. It *thump*ed again, bouncing the duct against the wall. Then a third time, leaving a dent in the thin metal. \n\n*It was just... rats...* she thought as she backed away, eyes wide. \n\nYes, rats... that wasn\u0027t unreasonable. There had even been a rat on TINKAN 7, after all. Of course, it hadn\u0027t been alive, when they found it. The duct banged again, straining at its mounts. \n\nJust rats... yes, why that made perfect sense! A small group of rats had snuck aboard, this was a large facility after all. And they\u0027d managed to survive. The crew had left literal *tonnes* of storable food for them. And... that would explain the smell of decay, and strange numbers from the life support system. With such a light load it was only now beginning to fail from lack of maintenance. \n\nYes, that was it! Not at all abnormal, just some rats. She wasn\u0027t afraid of rats, surely not. Rats... here on the M\u00FCn... *breeding*... exposed to cosmic rays... ionizing solar radiation... and who knows what long-term effects m\u00FCndust has...\n\nUnbidden, and despite her own resistance, Valentina\u0027s mind conjured up an image of a horrible, twisted creature. With beady black eyes, huge, yellowed teeth, wickedly hooked claws... and hairless, its body covered in boils and festering sores. Something that would have seemed ridiculous in one of those scary movies, but now...\n\nThe pipe banged, again and again. \n\nValentina fled up the ladder.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-15T04:57:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2016 04:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T05:01:25Z","Content":"... whew.

They also had weeks of training suspended in spring-loaded lunar gravity simulators, and the ever popular Vomit Comet. Poor Val has had none of this, and has already been put through the wringer a few times with little to no rest.\n\nThe fact that she\u0027s also within spitting distance of an artifact that contains the essence of an eldritch abomination from beyond reality that\u0027s had plenty of time to move into its new digs and settle in after scrambling the brains of everyone nearby, *might* have something to do with it.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)\n\nOne one thing I could *not* find any good info on was how water behaves in low gravity.

Unfortunately, it was also dark. Only a couple of stubborn overhead lights still shone, one flickering just slightly. The arrays of blinking red and yellow lights from the displays surrounding the room melded with the flicker, and cast disconcerting shadows that twisted and moved like things alive. \n\nNo, Valentina quickly concluded, this was not a place she wanted to linger either, and continued on up the ladder. Crew deck. At least the lights were on, here. Probably nothing useful, though. Best to start at the top and work down. But as she looked up, she saw that the hatch at the top of the ladder was closed. \n\nThe lab. *Edmund\u0027s* lab. She had seen him, she had *seen* him... what, exactly? *What* had she seen? Only days ago, now it all seemed so fuzzy. Indistinct, like trying to remember a dream. Or a nightmare. Something happened to him here. Maybe up there. Behind the closed hatch. \n\nBut... not unusual. Prudent, actually. The rest of the base seemed to be one enormous pressurized space, *that* seemed unusual. Probably standard procedure to keep this hatch closed. Valentina reached up, and gave the crank a turn. It squealed in protest, grinding with the feel of old, corroded bearings. She had to strain to get it to move at all. Finally the mechanism hit a stop, and Valentina felt the hatch release. \n\nHeaving with her shoulder, she forced it open the rest of the way. It creaked and groaned even louder than the crank, the sound seeming to reverberate through the empty base. Again, something skittered in the walls. Beyond the hatchway was only pure, inky darkness. \n\n*That... **is** odd...* she thought. \n\nThere were windows in the lab. She\u0027d seen them from the surface, seen *lights* glowing inside. Even if the lights went out, the low sun should give *some* illumination... Being a pilot, Valentina produced a flashlight, and carefully poked her head up through the hatchway. \n\nShe tried to scream, but the air had been torn from her lungs. \n\nEverywhere. \n\nIt was *everywhere!*\n\nSplashed on the walls... ***SAW IT*** smeared on the windows... ***SAW IT!*** Dried with age and black as night... ***FLOATS*** The stench, thick and ripe, stealing her breath away... ***IT FLOATS!*** And all over... ***SAW IT!!*** *All* over... ***I SAW IT!*** Traced by hands in shaky block letters... ***IT FLOATS!*** All over... and over... and over again... ***WE ALL FLOAT***\n\nHer hands grew weak and she slipped back off the ladder. Falling... falling in slow motion like a nightmare. And she could *see* it... see the darkness take form... reach out for her... falling... floating...\n\nWith some latent bit of sanity, Valentina thrust a hand out as she fell, grabbed the latch, and pulled the hatch shut with her. The bump as she hit the floor grating seemed to jolt more sense into her. She scrabbled back up the ladder in near panic and hurled the handles of the crank around and around until it latched shut before dropping back to the floor. Something *thump*ed against it. Hard. She scuttled backwards until something solid blocked her way, eyes never leaving the hatch. \n\n*Edmund*...\n\nBut... he hadn\u0027t been...\n\nValentina sat there on the floor, staring up, barely daring to breathe. Expecting at any moment...\n\nBut no sound ever came. No squeal of the crank, no more skittering in the walls. Eventually, she looked around. She was... next to the open door to one of the crew rooms, bathed in a little pool of light. What..? Pulling herself up, she looked at the nameplate on the door. \n\nEDGAS J KERMAN  \n\nSCIENCE OFFICER\n\nEdgas..? Oh yes, the taciturn one. The one who always seemed so awkward and uncomfortable on the news reels leading up to their launch. She had met him, once, a very long time ago. Why did she always have such trouble remembering his name? \n\nStepping into the tiny room, Valentina found the overhead light still on. It seemed... brighter, somehow. In fact, *everything* seemed lighter in here. All the darkness... the fear... the doubt... it was still there, but... muted. As if behind a wall. She felt more than a bit awkward herself as she looked around, being unbidden in someone\u0027s personal space. \n\nThe bed was little more than a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003Ecot\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, its sheets lay tangled in a lump on the floor. A stack of papers from the diminutive desk had been scattered about, undisturbed after all this time, and next to an overturned glass\u2014\n\nValentina\u0027s eyes grew wide. Her throat spasmed involuntarily. There, not far from the glass, laying where it had fallen two years ago...\n\nA bottle of water. \n\nShe picked it up with trembling hands. Not daring anymore to think, she tore the seal off and gulped it all down in a single draught. For an instant it seared at her parched throat, then became sweet, cool, blessed relief that traced its way down to her stomach. She fell to her knees, and there saw, tucked away in a corner under the table, a cache of three or four more little bottles. One by one their contents disappeared over lips cracked and dried, but even as they did Valentina could feel life returning, coursing once more through her veins. She toppled back in a heap, leaning up against the wall, and raised the final bottle up with one last swig remaining. \n\n\u0022Mister Edgas,\u0022 she gasped, \u0022I could *kiss* you,\u0022 then downed the last bit. It wasn\u0027t enough. She didn\u0027t think she could *ever* drink enough right now. But it was much, much better. She sat there for a time, just breathing, beginning to feel like a Kerbal again. \n\nBut, as the Foreigners said, there was no rest for the weary. Valentina pulled herself up, grateful for the first time for the low gravity. Still not feeling quite right about it, she had a look around the tiny room again. It felt... different in here. There was no denying or brushing it away. Like... not a shadow, but the *opposite* of a shadow; like a lingering spirit of something gone away. Something *right*... amidst all this *wrong*.\n\nThere was an old, drying photograph taped up next to the polished steel mirror. A portrait of the crew, clad in their suits and holding their helmets before a model of the M\u00FCnbase. A scale Isfjell launcher poked up behind them. Edmund was at the center, of course, looking very different than last she\u0027d seen him. Strong. Proud. His mustache still trimmed just so, to hide the old scar on his lip. What had *happened* to him? For now, Valentina just sadly shook her head. \n\nTo his right was another face she could never forget. Always so bright and earnest. Even as international relations had soured, these three faces had been plastered across every newspaper and screen for weeks before the launch. And every single time, Billy-Bobrim Kerman had that same unbeatable, eager smile beneath his dark, bushy hair. Even in grainy monochrome newsprint, she had marveled at the boyish wonder in his eyes. She had never met him again after that hallway long ago at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, but that look always stuck with her. It brought a smile to her face again now. \n\nRounding out the crew, to Edmund\u0027s left, was... Gas-something? Valentina winced. Edgas. She had just *said* the name a few moments ago! It was as if her mind... rejected it, like\u2014\n\n...not real...\n\nShe blinked, then shook it away. *Edgas* looked confident in the photo. In more candid settings, he had always looked overwhelmed. Startled. For a mission assignment like this, he must be very good at *some*thing. Perhaps he just didn\u0027t like the cameras? She could relate to that. \n\nNow, what else\u2014 *there*. She took a small book from near the mirror. An old photo album, by the looks of it. That seemed like an odd and fairly *heavy* thing to bring to the M\u00FCn, but she supposed the crew had personal effects mass allowances the same as she\u0027d usually had. And something so personal probably shouldn\u0027t be looked through by the likes of *her*, but nevertheless...\n\nFeeling more than a bit guilty, Valentina opened the cover. A baby with a very familiar overwhelmed, startled look stared back at her. The smiling couple holding him looked old enough to be his grandparents. She flipped the page and\u2014 hmm. The baby was now a toddler with the same overwhelmed look, but the pair holding him had changed. They were much younger. She flipped again... and again...\n\nWith each page, the bewildered youngster got a bit older... but the couple with him always changed.  Older, younger; different faces, different smiles... sometimes looking more than a little forced. Was... was this Edgas... an orphan?\n\n*Like me...* Valentina\u0027s lips moved silently. Her eyes flicked back forth as pages turned, and the pattern repeated, until all at once... everything changed. \n\nNow a boy, Edgas was smiling brightly. This, despite a fading black eye and bandaged right hand, which was draped over the shoulder of an unmistakable, earnest young face, with a smile every bit as bright. Behind the pair was a new couple. Their faces drew only a vague recollection from her memory, but she could never forget that *shirt*. The after-image was still permanently burned into her retinas. And they bore the brightest smiles of all. \n\nValentina continued to turn the pages, a broad smile blooming on her own face. The changing guardians with Edgas were always there, but now each photo was tempered by one of the new quartet. Just as she expected, as the boys grew, eventually little Anastasia came along, an unmistakable tuft of golden hair sticking up past those enormous eyes. Within a page or two, those eyes found her brother, and then never left. \n\nSomewhere, Valentina felt a certain pang of longing for what looked like an unusual, but very happy, family. The last page was only Edgas and Billy-Bobrim \u2014and Anna peeking in from the background, eyes still locked on her brother\u2014 their arms draped over each other\u0027s necks again, dressed in blue caps and gowns and grinning with all they had. Not that far behind, a KSA Colossus rocket sat on its pad. Printed across the top were the words, \u0022KSA GRADUATING CLASS No. 1.\u0022\n\nShe closed the album, and laid it down carefully, almost reverently. Something so bright... in this place of darkness. Uncompelled, she closed her eyes, let something... she could feel it. She *could* feel it. A thousand kilometers way, or a million, like a candle flame in the black depths of the long M\u00FCnar night... something... no, *some**one***, was there. A little bundle of emotions that were not her own. Frail. Weak. Defeated. But she could feel the connection *pulsing*, back and forth like a second heartbeat. Drawing strength in its weakness. Drawing it... from her. \n\nValentina straightened, beholding herself in the steel mirror. She didn\u0027t know *what* was going on, but it was, undeniably, *going on.* And... something more. With effort, she let go a little more... let herself... feel... or tune in... or whatever it was... \n\nThis place... everything here... all the *wrongness* of it... it... it *floated*... it, too, *pulsed*... back and forth, in syncopated, *opposite* time to that bundle of feelings on the other side of reality. \n\n*I am no hero...*\n\n\u0022No,\u0022 her lips moved uncommanded, \u0022*he* is.\u0022\n\nHer brow pinched at the unsolicited idea as she looked around the small space. She wouldn\u0027t find anything here, this room was a... a sanctuary, some how. A leftover image of a Kerbal she didn\u0027t know, like a shadow.\n\nOr a ghost. \n\nShe was about to leave, when something caught her eye. Standing on the tips of her M\u00FCnboots, being careful not to snag her loose, hanging EVA suit on anything, she fished around on a shelf high up on the wall. Now what\u0027s this? It looked like a small, translucent, pill-shaped container of some sort. Whatever was inside was thick and sticky, but more strangely, appeared to be *glowing*. Some sort of standardized experiment the KSA was fond of, if she remembered correctly. But what was it doing in here?\n\nDismissing the question for later, Valentina tucked the pod away in her suit. And paused. Again not quite knowing why, she fiddled around until she could secure it inside her flightsuit. Then she left the small room behind. \n\nIt crashed into her like a fallen star. The impact, the sheer *force* of it sent her reeling, tumbling. She hit the floor hard, scrabbling backwards. The shadows... the *shadows*...\n\n*Not real...*\n\n*It\u0027s not real...*\n\nThe back of her head slammed against something hard. \n\nThe shadows. She could *see* them...\n\nAll of it. All the doubt, all the fear, all the *wrongness* of this place that had been held at bay now assaulted her with renewed strength. \n\nThe shadows...\n\nShe could *see* them...\n\n*Reaching* for her...\n\n\u0022Not real... it\u0027s not real!\u0022\n\nScratching in the walls... *thump*ing in the air vents...\n\nAnd the shadows... the *shadows*...!\n\n\u0022It\u0027s not real!\u0022 Valentina pressed her hands to her head, her words dissolving to a sobbing shriek as she screwed her eyes shut. \n\nShe didn\u0027t know how long it went on. Eventually, her throat became raw, and no more sound would come out. Only then did she realize the silence. Silence, save for...\n\n*Plip...* \n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\nShe opened her eyes, panting. The shadows lurked, immobile, hiding in corners. \n\nHad... had she just imagined it all..?\n\nIn answer, a soft *tap tap tap* of little feet traced along an overhead air duct. Slowly, she rose. Edmund\u0027s door was now behind her. Dream-like, her hand came up, reaching for the knob. Something skittered in a dark corner. Her fingers touched the cold, milled surface. \n\nSuddenly Valentina jumped back, looked around, confused. What...? Her eyes moved again to the door, and she drew her hand back a little more. No... No, whatever is in there, best leave it be. \n\nShe moved to the final room, her eyes still not wanting to leave Edmund\u0027s. Billy-Bobrim\u0027s door was slightly ajar; expecting something to jump out, she stood back and carefully pushed it open. The light was still on after all this time. And inside... it looked like a bomb had gone off. Clothing, papers, all sorts of things lay scattered about wherever they had fallen. A large metal cabinet had been torn from its mounts and a corner embedded into the polished steel mirror. What sort of person could *do* such a thing?\n\nBut... amidst the chaos was one tiny refuge of sanity. On a nightstand next to the overturned bed, sat a wooden-framed, rather formally set photograph. Valentina had seen it just moments ago. It was a duplicate of the last one in... that other fellow\u0027s album. The picture of the happy family all smiling together. It was resting on what looked like an old, worn-out textbook. *Field Geologist\u0027s guide to the Biomes of Kerbin*, read the faded cover. \n\nSetting the photo down and gingerly opening the it, Valentina smiled at the inscription on the cover page, written in neat, orderly letters:\n\nBEST BUDZ 4-EVER!  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E KLASS 01!\n\nThe dense, bone-dry text further in was peppered with pale yellow highlighting. Shaky, barely legible notes filled the margins. Here and there, the same precise hand from the inscription added some little bit of insight to them. Valentina turned the delicate sheets over as if reading from a holy book, watching the lessons play out around the edges. It went on for page after page; notes, notes on notes, analysis of noted notes. Valentina had to struggle to read the wobbly writing, reading Kerblish was a struggle for her in general, but after a while she could almost see the knowledge moving off the page and into the scholar. \n\nWhen she reached the end, she found a a small, equally bland award taped to the back cover:\n\nUPON SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF REQUISITE COURSE WORK, THE KSA RESEARCH DIVISION HEREBY CERTIFIES\n\nBilly-Bobrim Kerman\n\nAS A LEVEL 1 FIELD GEOLOGIST\n\nIt was dated only a few months after the photograph. As Valentina ran a thumb over the worn embossing, a bit of paper slipped out from underneath. She peered at it for a moment, and her smile widened. It was written in a beautiful, flowing hand in what looked like newer pink pen ink. \n\nBilly\u2014 \n\nI finally got my rating today! Thanx eversomuch for all your help!\n\n                                                                                        \u2014Lolli\n\nShe thought she could see a hint of faded lipstick on it, too. It seemed Billy-Bobrim had learned well, and payed it forward. Somehow, she wasn\u0027t surprised. \n\nValentina set everything back as she had found it, and once more looked around the room. No, what she needed wasn\u0027t up here. Like the rest of this place, there was nothing left here but ghosts. She stepped back out into the common room, pausing, not daring to breathe, to watch the shadows. Now, nothing seemed to move. Nothing made a sound. Except...\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\nIt sounded a thousand kilometers away. Like everything else, she wasn\u0027t even sure if she actually heard it or not. But the shadows... the whole base... it did seem awfully... quiet, now. \n\n*Have the air handlers stopped?*\n\nSliding down the ladder to the command deck and landing with a thump, she quickly scanned over the myriad of blinking lights and other errors. No, no major failure indicators. No alarms going off. Then what...? *There*. A flashing red light on a console. \n\nBut... her eyes twitched back and forth... this is just a video terminal. The light was indicating a new recording. That can\u0027t be right... Valentina hit a few buttons. \n\nMOTION TRIGGER: CAM13, DOCKING LEVEL.\n\nIt... it was dated two years ago. The day... whatever happened, happened. Dread... darker than the deepest M\u00FCnar night sank into her. A fear beyond anything this curs\u00E9d place had yet shown. \n\nShe knew... somehow, she *knew*...\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\nShe didn\u0027t want to see... she *knew*... but she couldn\u0027t stop... her finger reached out, trance-like, and pushed the blinking red button.\n\nA grainy image appeared on the screen. The docking tunnels far below. Dim utility lights cast twisted shadows. Presently, one of them moved... and a soft, ragged voice came with it.\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t... don\u0027t want to...\u0022\n\nA figure emerged, collapsing against the far wall.\n\n\u0022No... please...\u0022\n\nThat bushy hair... it was unmistakable.\n\n\u0022No... No...\u0022\n\nThe Figure clasped hands to its head as it thrashed about.\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t want to...\u0022\n\nShe could hear his wrenching sobs.\n\n\u0022No!\u0022\n\nBilly threw his head back in anguish, his face now clear on the camera. \n\n\u0022You... you can\u0027t have him! I... I won\u0027t let you... I... I...\u0022\n\nFor a moment, he looked down at his own hands, then raised them to his eyes...\n\n\u0022No...\u0022 Valentina breathed, ***\u0022NO!\u0022*** She slammed her fists uselessly against the console. \n\nGuilt flared, she tried to force herself to watch in penance, but it was just too horrible, and she turned away. Huge, gelatinous tears fell slowly to the grating below. Her shoulders heaved in answer to every scream from the tinny speaker. Then all sound abruptly ceased.\n\nPlip...\n\nPlip...\n\nPlip...\n\nStill choking on her own sobs, Valentina looked up, and ***saw***.\n\n*It.*\n\n*It* was looking at her. \n\n*It* had no eyes left, but *it* was looking at her. \n\nAcross a gulf of years, *it* was *looking* at her. \n\nBloody lips pulled back into a grotesque smile over jagged, needle-like teeth. *Its* mouth moved, but the voice was *in her own head*.\n\n***MARATH\u0027INDE DAMANE*,** it hissed, **I SSSSSSSSEE YOU!**\n\nValentina screamed as if casting all the air from her lungs might purge that horrible voice from her mind. Her shoulders quaked before the flood of emotion that broke over her. Silently, her hands balled into trembling fists. \n\n*It* was down there. \n\n*It* was still down there. \n\nShe was going to find *it*.\n\nAnd punch *it* right in the face.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-15T07:14:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2021 07:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T12:27:25Z","Content":"YEAH!

Somehow, *it* was still down there. *It* would *always* be down there; some part of *it* infected this place, permeated every bolt and wire. And not only *here*. \n\nEdmund. *It* had corrupted her old friend, twisted him...\n\n*...the day they went to the anomaly... something changed. I could hear it in Billy\u0027s voice, almost... feel it, too...*\n\n...and that poor boy Billy...\n\n*...there\u0027s something else there. Behind the bandages. And like... I can feel it... looking at me... like... it\u0027s hungry...*\n\nAnastasia had been right. Edmund knew something. Edmund knew *everything*, and with his connections... this *thing*... for all she knew, the whole *world* was stained by it. *Every* *person* could be like Edmund, now. *I could be, too. Maybe I have been, all along.* There was no use in going back. She had already accepted this place would be her tomb.\n\nA dim light of emotion tugged at her mind, far away.\n\nNo, not *every* person. \n\nAnd if one person... maybe more. Valentina Kermanova would not go down without a fight, she would take *it* down with her. She would find *it*. Stop *it*. Kill *it*, if she could. \n\n*I am no hero...*\n\n*No, but that makes me... expendable.*\n\n*Sacrifices must me made...*\n\n*There was always... a price...*\n\nBelow layers of fabrics and plastic, the M\u00FCnstone was throbbing against her skin, pulsing with the same cadence she\u0027d felt not long ago. And all the time, she could hear that incessant, dripping noise.\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\nThe galley was as empty as the rest of the base, a moment frozen in time. The hatch to the docking tunnels below still sealed tight. Valentina didn\u0027t hesitate, she spun the crank around and around until it *thunk*ed, and the hatchway creaked open. Below was inky darkness, broken only by the dim glow of emergency lights. \n\nThe sound grew louder. \n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip...*\n\n*Plip....*\n\nRage, indignation, fear Dibella spurned her on. She slid down the ladder into the node to face *it*, to *deny* *it*, to *avenge*...\n\n*...I am a monster, too. And I am coming for you...*\n\nThen the terror took her, and immediately, with every fiber of her being and remaining shred of sanity, wished she had *not*.  \n\nEverywhere...\n\nIt was *everywhere..!*\n\nNot the dried, blackened stains of the lab above. Here it was fresh, dripping from the ceiling or oozing down panels with the fetid reek of a slaughterhouse. All over the walls... *all* over the walls... it was smeared in hideous, arcane symbols that stung Valentina\u0027s eyes just to look upon them. The accursed words they spelled out... to know them was surely to know madness. \n\nHer face a mask of horror, Valentina staggered backwards from the ladder, deeper into a tunnel. The shadows cast by the dim crimson lights shifted and writhed. She could hear them... scratching at the walls... scuttling in the ducts. Something soft and yielding found its way under her foot with a shrieking squeal, causing her to stumble. Her hand disappeared into one of the shadows, and pain flared. Jerking it back, she saw her own blood oozing from two pairs of tiny teeth marks on the edge of her palm. \n\nDeep in the shadows... deeper than where the wall *should* have been... a pair of beady little eyes gleamed in the meager light. Then another appeared. And another. \n\nSomething scuffled along the conduits just behind her. Little feet *tap-tap-tap*ped in the darkness. Then the shadows *themselves* began to change. They shifted and moved, crawling along the walls, slinking along the floors, denying the already feeble light and *reaching* out for her. \n\nTerror sunk into Valentina\u0027s spine like a knife. This was no hallucination, no nightmare, this was *real* and the shadows were *reaching* for her! With cold dread she realized that everything \u2014everything!\u2014 that had led her down here had been crafted to that point. The doubt. The rage. The fear. \n\nThis... was a trap. \n\nAs the shadows circled around her ankles, conscious thought, wrath, and despair departed, and were replaced with one, single, base instinct:\n\nSurvive. \n\nShe bolted from the tunnel, flew up the ladder. She was nearly out when something seized her foot and yanked her back down. Falling *hard* against the raised lip of the hatchway, the goo container under suit shattered. Jagged shards of glass dug into her flesh, tearing it open. She kicked back against the threat, but might have been kicking against air. Hand over hand, finding good purchase on the grated flooring, she managed to pull herself from the hole. She braced a foot against the rim, and turned over to find an abomination of inky tentacles slithering ever higher up the leg of her suit, straining to drag her back into the yawning darkness below. \n\nChoking back a scream against the flare of pain in her flank, she reached back over her head and grasped the zipper pull of her EVA suit. With one fluid, practiced motion, she bowed her head and folded herself in half as she pulled up on the cord, splitting the back of the suit open and emerging like an insect shedding its skin. She grabbed tight to the floor again, letting the foul thing pull the suit off and down into the hatchway, ripping away water tubes and electrical cords. Beyond the rim, something squealed in anger.\n\nWith a wordless cry, Valentina threw herself back at the hole, slamming the hatch shut as she landed. She had barely turned the handcrank when something slammed against the other side, but the bolts held. Around and around she spun the handle while an incredible force bashed against it again and again. A blow actually knocked her backward, and she saw huge dents appearing in the thick aluminum surface. Each bang seemed to grow stronger and stronger. A light overhead exploded in sparks. The floor began to buckle. Then a coolant line ruptured, sending a spray of toxic ammonia up into air. \n\n*Survive.*\n\nShe fled up the ladder to the airlock deck. Reaching the row of spare KSA EVA suits, she threw aside the one with her rock hammer still jutting out of the helmet. And that\u0027s when it grabbed her. Looking down, she saw found it gripping her legs, trying to pull itself up or her down. \n\nInstinct... only instinct now...\n\nShe ripped the rock hammer from its gold-tinted faceplate and slammed it down again.\n\n*Crack!*\n\n*Crack!*\n\n*Crack!*\n\nEach blow brought a gout of vile black fluid running out of the hole. The empty suit grappled with her a moment more, then became still. She turned to the next one, and now *it*, too, reached out for her, pawing at her neck from its hanger. Struggling this close, Valentina finally noticed the reflection...\n\nThere wasn\u0027t any.\n\nThe thing\u0027s mask was a featureless golden expanse. She brought the hammer up and drove it down with both hands, shattering the plexiglass and revealing nothing but black *nothingness* beyond. One by one, the other suits raised their flaccid arms, and reached for her. \n\nValentina staggered backwards, away from the blank-faced horrors. She began retching as the acrid tang of ammonia reached her lungs from the deck below. Her eyes teared up, burning from the fumes. Her wounded flank roared against her. Doubt flooded across her mind.\n\nTrapped...\n\nShe was trapped...\n\nNo way ou... *EDGAS!*\n\nA memory flashed in her mind, a dim snippet from a dusty report read while half asleep in a broom closet a world away. She sprung to the ladder, pulled herself up hand-over-hand, ignoring the screaming in her side, her feet not even touching the rungs.\n\n*The lab.*\n\nShe reached the sealed hatch again. All around, the shadows were shifting, slinking. Scratching in the walls. Tiny feet in the ducts. The sounds of deforming metal rang up from below. She spun the handcrank around, threw open the hatch. Forgetting the atrocities sprawled on the walls, Valentina hauled herself upward, ever upward, as the shadows closed in around. One more hatch, and she reached the auxiliary airlock at the very top of the base structure. She slammed it back down, cranked it shut just as something *else* slammed against it from below. She ignored it, focused all her attention on donning the bright orange rescue suit.\n\nThe hatch rung like a bell again and again. These suits, mercifully, had no reflective faceplates, and lacked even a proper helmet. She fumbled, trying to work the unfamiliar fittings as quickly as she could in the cramped space. A tiny window in the outer hatch above let in a fleeting glint of sunlight. The floor groaned, something unseen popped and began to hiss. Valentina finished the last seal and tried to find the pressure controls. A dull, metallic ripping filled the room. She glanced down, saw the hatch begin to lift, saw the shadow oozing out of it like blood, reaching for her. \n\n*No time.*\n\nShe tensed, and slammed an elbow into the glass-covered emergency hatch release. There was a *whump*, and suddenly even the meager pull of M\u00FCnar gravity evaporated. Valentina found herself tumbling, flailing. Black and grey and bright flashed across her vision like a deranged kaleidoscope. She screamed, screamed until her lungs were empty then kept on screaming. Falling, drifting, rising. No sensation, only the flashing of the world passing away. \n\n*Maybe this is the end. Maybe this was what oblivion is like.*\n\nThe impact knocked the air from her lungs despite the pressure of the suit. Pain like she had never known flared brighter than the sun burning at her eyes as her shoulder popped. Not to be forgotten, the rip in her side began wailing ever louder. She bounced, tumbled, landed hard again. Flipped end-over-end across a blur of grey. When she finally stopped, her head was reeling, the pain radiating through her surging her mind back and forth like debris on the ocean, tossed between fainting and thought. \n\nValentina lay sprawled on the surface, just trying to breathe. Each gasp threw a wide patch of fog onto the scratched faceplate of the suit. \n\n*Can\u0027t... breathe...*\n\nWith effort, she sat up. There were no gauges on the suit, no indicators of any kind. Only a few buttons on one wrist. She pawed at them until a feminine, synthesized voice buzzed in her ear:\n\nWarning: minor suit breach. Seek shelter.  \n\nWarning: minor suit breach. Seek shelter.\n\nBones grated in her shoulder, sending hot sparks of pain shooting through the nerves. \n\n*Dislocated... maybe worse...*\n\nHer side was still raging. She could feel warm wetness pooling down in the seat of her suit. \n\n*I\u0027m bleeding to death...*\n\nAnd beyond it all, beyond even reason, the shadows now stretched far across the bleak landscape, cast by a sun barely above the horizon. There was no surprise, no horror at such swift motion of the sky on a world that took *four days* to rotate. Of *course* the night came too soon, on this world of darkness. \n\nOff in the distance, barely a spec, she could see the lander, its metallic skin glinting like a beacon in the dwindling light. \n\n*I... could still make it...*\n\nAll around, Valentina could see the shadows creeping closer, twisting and roiling. Thousands of beady eyes stared out from them. She could almost... hear... the whispers...\n\n*Go...*\n\n*Go now...*\n\n*Leave this place and never return...* \n\n*You are not welcome here...*\n\n*Go... while you still can...*\n\nSurvive... but to what end? Could she even survive the return, like this? And even if she did, would there be more like Edmund, waiting for her? Maybe more she knew, maybe even Dib\u2014\n\nShe winced at the thought. \n\nThere was still... the Anomaly. She wouldn\u0027t need a map to find it. She could feel *it*, pulsing in time with the rest of this place. Somewhere off over *there*, a few kilometers. Away from the lander. She tried to move, but pain stole the thin air from her lungs. \n\n*This flimsy suit... not meant for such a trek... I\u0027d never make it.*\n\nAgain, sunlight glimmered off the lander. It seemed to pull her towards it. \n\n*I am no hero...*\n\nJust then, a new whisper floated up from deep within, a whisper of her *own* voice, so long ago...\n\n*...test pilot...*\n\n*...test pilot...*\n\n*...test pilot...*\n\n*...am \u003Cu\u003Etest\u003C/u\u003E pilot. I fly airplane I do not trust, and have \u003Cu\u003Eno\u003C/u\u003E confidence in, to go past edge of envelope and \u003Cu\u003Efind\u003C/u\u003E it so big-head cowboy like you not go too far...*\n\n*...test pilot...*\n\n***I am a test pilot.***\n\n*I choose to go into the shadows, to seek them out, to find their limits. I ride the ragged edges of understanding. I fly into the dark places in the sky, the places others fear and fear well. I chase the shadows, harry them, \u003Cu\u003Escourge\u003C/u\u003E them. I drive them out, so that others will not have to know them.*\n\n*I am no hero.* \n\n*I am... a test pilot.*\n\nThere, on the lifeless, ash-colored surface of the M\u00FCn, Valentina Kermanova *rose*. Her face a mask of grim determination, she made her way to the large, tubular rover, her flank cradled in one hand, the other cradling that. The hatch opened. The hatch closed. Gloved fingers moved over unfamiliar controls as if they had always known them. \n\nBOOT SEQUENCE: COMPLETE\n\nWARNING!

SOLAR OUTPUT VOLTAGE LOW.  \n\nBATTERIES 84%\n\nThe dull whine of the motors that hadn\u0027t run in years carried through the structure as the rover trundled off away from the base, towards the distant pulsing in the darkness. The world might already be lost, she might already be dead... and as far as the world knew, she *was*... but...\n\n*It* didn\u0027t *want* her to go there... that was enough. That\u0027s exactly where she would go. \n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\u0022What do you think it is, Ed?\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, son. I do not know.\u0022 \n\nThe massive form towered into the dark, starless sky. Directly above, the blue half-circle of Kerbin hung like a cringing eye. Valentina stood before the... *thing*, trying to comprehend it.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m afraid...\u0022\n\nIt seemed to resist being looked at. Her eyes wanted to slide off, focus on something else. *Anything* else. \n\n\u0022L...lets get the data and get out of here. Ed\u0027s right, this thing gives me the creeps.\u0022\n\nWith great effort, she could look at it, but it stung her eyes like looking at the sun. A sun that seemed to radiate darkness, not light.\n\n\u0022Hey Billy! You ok? You look like you\u0027ve seen a ghost.\u0022\n\nBut even that burning was tempered by the cold, mindless dread that crept through her.\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t like it here.\u0022\n\nIt was terror beyond thought, beyond reason. Beyond the wise fear of the unknown or basal fear of death.\n\n\u0022Me neither. Let\u0027s just do what we came to do and go.\u0022  \n\nIt was beyond even the dawning fear that came with the recognition that everything... *everything*... had not been to drive her away.\n\n\u0022Billy?\u0022 Uncertain.\n\nIt had been to drive her, to *scourge* her, *here*.\n\n\u0022B...Billy?\u0022 Trembling.\n\nTo the hunter. \n\n\u0022Billy?\u0022 Pleading.\n\nThis... all along, *this*... was the trap.\n\nHe knew. He knew. And he knew it was already too late. It was the feeling from a nightmare, right before the monster gets you.\n\nValentina Kermanova screamed. \n\nAnd screamed. \n\nAnd screamed. \n\n*It \u003Cu\u003Ecame forward.\u003C/u\u003E*\n\nGreasy, invading tendrils of shadow slithered across the surface of her mind. Searching for any fissure, any weakness, they pried against it like a besieging army. And *beyond* that, beyond the *presence*... beyond the *nothing*...\n\nFuzzy and indistinct, as if through frosted glass; visions of such unspeakable horror, of such suffering and torment that for any mortal mind to behold them plain would destroy it past any vain concept of mere madness. Visions, from which not even death would bring release. And beyond *them*, beyond the chaos, beyond the hells, beyond the *Kraken*, waiting in the darkness...\n\n*She saw.*\n\nAs she knelt there before the object, her face twisted in agony, Valentina\u0027s own hands rose to pluck the eyes from her face, but found only the thin plastic faceplate. She knew, somehow, she *knew*, with the shadows pressing at her mind, that sooner or later they would find a crack, and the instant, the very *instant* they touched her consciousness, that screen would be shattered, the visions would be laid bare, and there was nothing... nothing at all she could\u2014\n\nThe M\u00FCnstone thrummed against her skin, and suddenly *Chadvey\u0027s* voice floated up through the maelstrom. The shock of hearing it, devoid of any trace of its familiar mirth, cut through her paralysis like a knife. \n\n\u0022Run, lass,\u0022 it whispered, \u0022*you are not strong here*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Run!\u0022\n\nStill struggling against the thing\u0027s overwhelming force, Valentina jerked her arm, sending a bright jolt of pain through her and finishing what the whisper started. She jumped up, filaments of shadow yet scratching at her mind. Wobbling, stumbling, she managed to find the rover again. With a leap she threw herself inside, jamming the controls forward without bothering with the hatch. The big rover lurched forward, away from the accursed thing. She could hear it, *feel* it within her head, howling with rage. \n\nShe saw.\n\n*She saw.*\n\nSomeone else had to know.\n\nThe rover sailed over a ledge, landing hard but level, and the invasion winked out as quickly as it had begun. Now the shadows themselves redoubled their efforts. The sun was just barely hanging over the rim of the crater as she skidded down into it. All around, from every outcropping and boulder, the shadows swarmed. She could see them, she could *see* them, now. No longer scratching feet and beady eyes, but risen nightmares with claws and teeth. They churned in the darkness, waiting their moment to strike. \n\nWARNING...WARNING...WARNING\n\nSOLAR VOLTAGE BELOW THRESHOLD, BATTERIES 23%\n\nValentina ignored the alert, focused on keeping the rover out of the shadows. Every time it passed near the lee of a ridge or depression, they reached out for it. She *saw*. And she knew that more than ever, they could not let her leave. \n\nBATTERIES 19%\n\nShe bounced along in hollow silence, sliding this way and that as the wheels threw rooster tails of grey dust high above the ground. \n\nBATTERIES 15%\n\nThe gathering shadows charged down from the lip of the crater. The sun sank ever lower, or perhaps they were reaching up for it, too. \n\nBATTERIES 11%\n\nDistracted by the roiling horde, she failed to see she had already come upon the base again. With a grunt she jerked the controls right, but not before the rover hit a bump and went sailing off the ground, narrowly missing one of the spent lander stages but smashing off its solar panel. \n\nBATTERIES 7%, DRIVE SYSTEM SHUTDOWN IMMINENT \n\nNot far from where she\u0027d started, the rover finally slowed to a halt. She was out of the hatch an instant before the looming shadow of the base structure swallowed it. Far away, so far away, the metal skin of her own lander still glinted in the fading light. Valentina loped toward it, stumbling, moving awkwardly in the minuscule gravity even with the lightweight suit. \n\n*Lightweight..?*\n\nShe paused on a knoll, shadows surrounding her, closing in like an iris. The next lit spot was a dozen meters away. Gritting her teeth against the pain, she put her feet together and *jumped* with all she had. With only a tiny, simple rebreather instead of the bulky life support pack of the EVA suit, she sailed high into the airless sky. Tumbling, she somehow managed to find her feet just before coming down once more in the other shrinking patch of grey. \n\nPain flared, but she pushed back against it, *used* it to jump even *farther* this time. Like this, she flew from one vanishing island of light to the next, never stopping, never slowing, as the shadows licked at her heels. They roiled beneath her, reached out in vain as she hurtled past. \n\nWith one final grunt she landed on the wide, flat tank of the lander. She skidded, slipped, caught the hatchway with her good arm and used it as a pivot to swing herself around and back inside. Once more, she swung the hatch shut just as something slammed against it. Breakers on, valves open, guidance override to ABORT. Fuels mixed and the engine ignited. As the last traces of pale soil beneath it disappeared, the lander rose off the ground. \n\nBut only a couple of meters. \n\nValentina looked in the landing window, and saw thick, slimy tentacles of shadow entwining the landing gear, straining against the blistering engine, trying to drag the lander back down into darkness. Slowly, they were reaching higher. \n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, *I saw*, and flipped open a cover, \u0022not today...\u0022\n\n\u0022Today, I live.\u0022 Explosive bolts fired, severing the landing legs. The lander rocketed up out of the abyss, arcing into the airless sky, and back into the light.   \n\n*I saw... I **know**... someone else must, too.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-06T07:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2016 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T12:04:21Z","Content":"Impeccable timing on a great chapter!\n\nI was wondering how the writing was going with all the house shenanigans to get in the way and was about to bump this thread with a polite enquiry ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nBut what did Val see....?"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T13:28:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, KSK said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Impeccable timing on a great chapter!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was wondering how the writing was going with all the house shenanigans to get in the way and was about to bump this thread with a polite enquiry ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But what did Val see....?\n\u003E \n\nIT.
