I thought it was pretty good, but of course I am the artist. Hope you Like it. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb looked at the rocket, it wasn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t very big, just barely halfway up the launch pad. It was obviously built by an expert, if it was supposed to get them into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153It\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s not very big.\u00E2\u20AC He remarked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153It\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s not supposed to be. We want it to be light as possible. As to not waist fuel.\u00E2\u20AC Said one of the engineers. Doing a checklist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Whats it called.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Verigan I, they are a step up from the original Asimov you guys were flying.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Hopefully.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Well, they are lighter, as I said. And with the third stage added on, we can use the second stage to get you guys in a more circular orbit.\u00E2\u20AC The engineer said. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Are Bob and Bill ready.\u00E2\u20AC He asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Are they ever?\u00E2\u20AC Jeb replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153To shay. Alright, launch is tomorrow. Pray this soda can doesn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t blow up.\u00E2\u20AC The engineer said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Over and out.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb smirked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153There is no way, you are getting me into another one of these sardine cans, its cramped, and shaky, and Jeb is in there!\u00E2\u20AC Bob yelled. Always the loud one of the group. Bill sitting in his seat, was pondering on the possibility of catastrophic failure. Jeb, going through the checklist, while laughing at Bob, standing just outside the capsule door, arguing with an engineer about how safe it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153It\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s not gonna be like getting in your car and driving to the store, this is difficult, we cannot promise much, but we can tell you this is much safer than the Asimov models you have been flying.\u00E2\u20AC The engineer argued. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I mean come on, it\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s only rocket science, you doubt us to much.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I want to quit this job, and become a desk jockey for the Kerbal Paper Program, but my wife wouldn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t like the pay cut. Just let me sit at a desk, and do your paperwork, please.\u00E2\u20AC Bob complained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I told you, that job has been taken, besides, you can\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t even sign autographs so the kids can read it, what are the chances of a official reading it.\u00E2\u20AC The engineer said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Hey Bob!\u00E2\u20AC Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153What Jeb.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I packed cake.\u00E2\u20AC Immediately Bob sat in his seat, and buckled up, tightly. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I think we are go on this end.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb told the engineer. Who smiled back at Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright then commander, you have the ship, bring her back in one piece.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll try.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I wish they did unmanned tests first.\u00E2\u20AC Bill replied. And with that the door closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright boys, all systems go. You ready.\u00E2\u20AC The flight General said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Do we get a countdown.\u00E2\u20AC Bob replied. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153So I can be prepared.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153No\u00E2\u20AC Said the general, and hit the big red LAUNCH button, and looked back at the Verigan I, as she lifted off the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Back in the capsule, Jeb muted Bob, and Bill, to quiet their screaming through the space helmets, and kept mission control updated on everything. Soon the spacecraft was up at 20,000 meters above Kerbin\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s surface. The final three tanks on Verigan one\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s first stage, was nearly empty. Jeb could hear their Cap-com trying in vein, to calm down Bob and Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Just give up man, I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll keep you updated from were I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m sitting.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb told him. They ran out of fuel, at about 38,000 meters above Kerbin. Jeb let go of the First stage, and fired the second one, turning his craft to the side for an orbit. But, with only two fuel tanks. It ran out about halfway around Kerbin, using the one tank they had, they fired until the Periapsis was at 75,000 meters above Kerbin. Well above the atmosphere, they had about 3/4th a tank of fuel left, and there apoapsis was about 300,000 meters above Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153So were are the cakes.\u00E2\u20AC Bob said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Oh yah, here you go.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb handed Bob a bag of freeze dried cake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153What is this.\u00E2\u20AC Bob said. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153This is that freeze dried crap, were\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s the cake.\u00E2\u20AC \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Bob, I can\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t pack an entire cake on the craft, it weighs to much, and during launch, will make a mess. That is cake, just add some water.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb said, handing Bob, a bottle of water. Bob ate the cake, yet still was not happy about being tricked onto the craft. Soon after two orbits, they were approaching their periapsis again. Jeb turned the craft around, about 30 seconds from the periapsis, and prepared the engines for decent. Once they were close enough to the periapsis, they fired the final stages last bit of fuel and landed in the middle of the Kerbalisca Ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Mission control this is Verigan I, we had a pretty smooth flight, and a nice vacation. We\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ll see you in a couple of hours.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb spoke into his mic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geeny","CreatedById":10680,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-07T02:55:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027To shay\u0027 - hahahaha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story is purposeless, though.
