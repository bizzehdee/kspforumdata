I won\u0027t be posting KSP videos anytime soon. It\u0027s just not worth the effort without feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis forum sure has changed since 2011, when people actually were enthusiastic when a new video was posted. I know, this is probably due to most having gotten used to KSP videos because of the huge amount of videos posted each month nowadays.
