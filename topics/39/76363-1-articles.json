However, this may soon change as an evilly evil company decides that the Snack Time Space Program is unfit for the duty of exploring space and decides to take matters into their own hands. The result? A war that is not simply confined to Kerbin, but reaches beyond the thermopause to the depths of space. It is in times like these, that, when alien spacecraft are out on exploration of the galaxy and pass by this particular solar system, they look the other way and hope to find a less explosive civilization.

You\u0027re the one telling the story!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: I dunno. Anyway, he sees a big smoke trail, looks up, and there\u0027s a freaking huge rocket going up, not eight KM from the wildlife refuge!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Whoa. I didn\u0027t know anyone else was doing launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: I know, right? So, anyway, he\u0027s a smart fella, and plugs up his ears pretty well, but the sound of it almost bowls the poor guy over! Manages to get a good look, and according to him that thing isn\u0027t using any parts he\u0027s ever seen, some sort of reactor, and some giant fairing! Wanted to take a picture, but he wasn\u0027t about to uncover his ears. You of all people know how a giant rocket sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Yep I do. So what sort of rocket was it? Who launched it? Did we find out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: He saw a pretty obvious logo on the side. Beehive aerospace. Of course, we called them up and asked them, but the HR guy there said that it was probably stuck there by some other company to direct the spotlight away from them. Besides, the launch center is a continent or two out of their jurisdiction. Old unclaimed Space Center, used to be used by Insular Aerospace. Can\u0027t remember who built it. As for the payload, nobody knows. One of our geosats detected a big ship on an escape trajectory, the same one, but the fairing was on. Still, based on the speed it was going at it had to be headed for one of the outer planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: What about transfer windows?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Ah, the guys at the astronomical society tried that, but there were windows for Dres, Jool, Duna, and Eeloo all there the time of launch! Freaking rare coincidence, and the only time we could use less transfer windows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: That, was an awesome story. And this is an awesome chocolate bar. Hows your coconut cookie? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: All gone, and it was delicious. Oop, looks like the director is calling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill Kerman walks over to a blinking panel on the wall and presses it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: What\u0027s up, Gene? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGene: You two are due to launch in an hour.

You mean, like an armed ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGene: Precisely. With all of this talk about unclaimed rockets and secret launches, we want to keep a guard dog in orbit. You\u0027ll be flying the \u0027KSS Predictably damaged\u0027 for orbital weapons testing.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Predictably damaged? That sounds a little bit like a Space Shuttle that crashed some years back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGene: Ran out of names. Well, there was the \u0022Widow Maker\u0027, but that was just grim.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Do we have to wash our hands before we leave again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGene: Yeah.

See you by the launch pad!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few minutes later, the crew are standing by a rather sleek looking cruiser, with structural panels surrounding the fuel tank and two extremely streamlined capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Whoa. That is one awesome looking battlecruiser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Hold on. If i\u0027m right, then these SpacePlanesPlus capsules. can hold four. Why isn\u0027t Bob coming?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Still in recovery after the Dres mission. I can imagine it was rather traumatic to see the ground fall from under him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: And they said there was no seismic activity on Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Yeah, the seismometers on that mission even had that result! The Sciencers down in R\u0026amp;D are stilling scratching their heads about that. Your guess is as good as mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: In that case, an evil space kraken ate some of the ground for snack. It was going to try to eat Bob too but he hadn\u0027t bathed since they left Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Heh heh, space kraken it is then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: So what are the weapons on this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: Glad you asked. It\u0027s got 4 bullets, and 8 guided torpedoes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Are those footballs over there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene: er\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Those are the bullets. Found a warehouse full of footballs, and for some reason 4 of them had decouplers on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Good to know.

He always did this, but now his powers of calmness were nearly stretched to the limit as he stretched his legs across his desk, although that was certainly not the cause of his anxiety. You see Incindia, his home continent, was at war with a powerful corporation. Once the attack occurred over the Mun, Beehive Aerospace found itself thrust into the spotlight, and was trying to fight it\u0027s way on top. He glanced at some freshly printed trajectory sheets, grimacing at the cold reality of their situation. He would have to tell them himself.

In shock, they leap up from their offices and desks and cubicles, form a line, and begin speedwalking out of the buildings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, at the tropopause, anyone caring to listen would hear a whoosh as dozens of flaming rods streaked down toward the space center. A lone Jet rotated a small ball on top, firing a powerful laser, melting it\u0027s target from kilometers away, and then rapidly switching to another. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t enough. The Debris was coming in too fast, and there was too much of it, that the pilot simply couldn\u0027t do anything about it. At least seven separate pieces of debris raced down, down past the Jet which had put itself into a dive to try to catch up with the rods, down through the clouds, and down toward the buildings of the KSC, and the scurrying green dots below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first rod crashed into the grasslands near the space center, admittedly not the most admirable shot. The second struck the mission control building by the front side, ripping windows to pieces, buckling and collapsing bulkheads, and sending escaping Kerbals flying from the shockwave. Fortunately, many of them were far enough from the blast, and all of them, being Kerbals, sprang upright, dazed but unharmed. The third struck the side of the tracking station hub, which survived surprisingly intact. The fourth hit a bridge in the R\u0026amp;D complex, collapsing it and crushing Kerbals under the wreckage. The fifth shot hit the top of the VAB, causing parts of the roof to collapse, destroying the floor of the large hanger inside and the many Kerbals escaping through there. The sixth rod hit the windows on the western side of the VAB, smashing glass everywhere throughout the Kerbals attempting to get out and the many who remained at their posts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The final rod raced down toward a road which was crowded with scores of Kerbals racing down toward the bunkers. Many of them heard the sonic boom and looked up, realizing that their promising lives had come to an end. However, in the few seconds before their inevitable demise, they looked to the side and saw that Bobak Kerman was in the crowd about to be struck and killed. They felt comforted by the fact that recurring characters rarely die, and never when it fails to enhance the plot. Though they soon realized how ridiculous that thought was and braced to die. But behold! In a maddening race to save lives, the 707 had barely penetrated the cloud layer by the time the sixth missile had hit. But the pilot was a quick shot, even in a 90 degree dive, and a laser beam melted the last missile roughly fifty meters above the ground, sending scalding debris across the road but it was better than a rod of death, and only two Kerbals were lightly burned. The plane itself pulled out easily but still passed uncomfortably close to the ground, causing the survivors to fling themselves to the ground lest it crash into something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe survivors cringed, expecting more rods, but after cringing for about ten minutes they realized that the entire strike was over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Not that it had not been an effective strike. Dozens of Kerbals were wounded, trapped in wreckage, or panicked. The front side of the mission control building was half torn-off, and several rooms were filled with broken glass. The tracking center had partially collapsed, and all sorts of plumbing was leaking, including a hydrazine coolant for the dishes, causing the area to be evacuated. The R\u0026amp;D was cluttered with debris, and many laboratories were destroyed by the shockwave. And the VAB... it was history. The entire roof had collapsed, ripping apart the hangar, and the shockwave had knocked away the supports connecting all four walls. And for afters, rod number six had wrecked the west wall, which collapsed into small chunks, knocking down the Eastern wall and tearing up the other two. Medical teams hurried into broken buildings and rubble, hospital helicopters landed and took off as fast as they could load patients, and at least threescore were carried into the overcrowded sickbay where Doctor Neillo, some volunteers, and paramedics were treating Kerbals as quickly as they could. Erbal, whom Bobak assigned to work with Neillo while he tried to free more survivors, gasped a little as he brought in two especially badly cut-up patients. They were Gene and Wernher.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T02:57:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by VelocityPolaris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VelocityPolaris","CreatedById":101162,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T21:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk everyone, if anyone still visits this thread, I want you to know that I\u0027ve procrastinated a lot and had a lot of other things to worry about, but the next chapter is soon to come.

Got it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, Jeb looks to his left and sees a shimmering light getting closer and closer. with two puffs of EVA propellant, he faces the shiny thing and thinks as quickly as he can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter forty seconds and a lifetime of holding their breath, the shiny thing becomes clearly visible as a heavily armored pod with two trusses coming off of the fuselage, and a pair of solar panels on the side. The trusses themselves were spiky to a sinister degree, with three Solid Rocket-encased rods on each side that doubtless were designed as makeshift missiles. Slowly approaching Jeb\u0027s stranded spacecraft, it flipped about and released a bit of propellant as to not accidentally ram them. as it did this maneuver Jeb noticed two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: It had an LV-909 engine, an ancient orbital maneuvering rocket renowned for it\u0027s high ISP and the ease with which it could be operated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: The maneuver to kill it\u0027s relative velocity resembled a dart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlipping back around, the pilot inside focused it\u0027s weapons on both Jeb and the orbiter behind him, then hailed them via radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot:\u0026lt;I\u0026gt;\u0022This is a warship of the Beehive Syndicate.

The pilot then paused briefly as his fighter, which had drifted to twenty meters away from the recoil, released a small amount of fuel in order to slow down. Jeb glanced toward the Mun to see if the rescue ship had arrived yet, and was rewarded by a small glimmer in front of the shiny rock they were orbiting... and punished by a rocket to the face. He looked back and saw it coming in time to try to veer off with his rocket pack, but due to the speed of the thing it grazed his helmet, surprisingly not puncturing it but ripping his radio transceiver off, along with his head light. Spinning out of control and stunned, he used his thrusters to stop spinning and looked down to see the battle fading away as he was flung several kilometers away. Amazed to be alive, he rocketed back as quickly as he could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Bill sent messages for surrender, all which went unheeded by the smug pilot who aimed straight for the capsule window. In a desperate bid for time, the service module was thrown at the fighter by an explosive decoupler. Unfortunately, it did little but to annoy the fighter pilot, who took maybe ten seconds to throw the thing away by pushing it with the nose of the capsule and to aim right at the window. The Pilot\u0027s trigger finger did it\u0027s work, and a rocket flew straight at the window as Bill and Bob hugged each other in fear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fortunately, ten seconds was just enough for the dedicated pilot of the rescue ship, who zipped by at forty meters per second as the Kerbal X was shielded by the bigger hull of the rescue ship, which took the missile impact but only lost a solar array which luckily acted like a whipple shield and slowed the rocket too much to damage the hull. Right away, the rescue ship started burning to slow down, as the fighter pilot blinked in surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Glad you could join the party, Phil!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhil:\u0026lt;I\u0026gt;\u0022Not too late, am I?\u0022\u0026lt;/I\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that moment, the fighter began rocketing towards the new arrival, taking stock of it. The Fighter Pilot found it to be relatively simple in design, two lander-cans and a couple of NERVAs. he also saw two rod-missiles, and rushed to lock on to the capsule before it did the same. The fighter, built specifically for combat, got the first target lock, and he jammed the large red fire button, but nothing happened. Surprised, he looked out a tiny side window to see his last missile slowly drifting away, and a smiling Jeb holding up a wrench and waving. With a sense of patriotic fatalism, the pilot waved back, then rocketed his ship back to the Kerbal X capsule, pressed his craft\u0027s nose to it\u0027s heatshield, and fired his engine for the last time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Phil saw what he was doing, and with Jeb following, tore after them with as much thrust as he could muster, and fired both rockets. The first missed altogether but the second was straight and true, and the fighter\u0027s engine was torn into little pieces. The pilot, recognizing that all was lost, pulled his oxygen pipe out and hoped that he would die before hitting the pointy rocks below him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Inside Phil\u0027s Lander-can2, he glanced over at a beeping indicator by his feet. Frowning, he called Bill and Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhil: Guys, you\u0027re sub-orbital.

Instead, as Jeb floated next to his window, he signaled by jabbing a finger in the prograde direction. Jeb activated his rocket pack, accelerating away. He sees a beeping indicator as Bill and Bob come inside, so he reaches over and opens the hatch to the Lander-Can below him. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: (drifts in with Bob close behind) Thanks for the lift, Phil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhil: Glad to be of service.

I\u0027m burning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey feel a light tug towards the perceived floor as the craft accelerates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Well then, get a fire extinguisher!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltogether: Hahahahahahaha-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb:\u0026lt;I\u0026gt;\u0022I thought there weren\u0027t any inside jokes in space.

Oh no, don\u0027t tell me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: Now I know why Wernher wanted to replace those NERVAs so badly.
