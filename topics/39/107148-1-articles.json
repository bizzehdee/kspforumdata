Eventually, the Government relented, and gave them the land and buildings, with the understanding that the space program would be privately funded. Gene had been very upset, as previous attempts had been funded by the state, but it seemed that this time, more than a few craters on the Mun would be required to please them. Mortimer had been drafted in at the last minute, as the government wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t trust any of the others to be able to finance themselves!\n\nAs their car passed the last few hills on the way to their new home, that got their first look at the Space Center. The Government had clearly spent the bare minimum on building, the VAB was rickety, and looked like a sufficiently strong wind could blow it over, while several buildings looked like little more than repainted shipping containers! As the parked up next to the building they had assumed to be the Astronaut Complex, they had no idea if they would be able to get a decent bed here, let alone a space program!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, this is indeed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.. usable.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Muttered Werner, as he inspected his lab\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIs this suitable for your research, Werner?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Gene nervously.

The parts they were using were clunky, unreliable, and difficult to assemble, and the parts were sapping their moral with every failure. Val knew that she couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t do anything about the current situation now, as everyone needed time to calm down after the latest failure, so after Gene gave the stand down order, she walked outside and started walking around the base. Sonnah was high in the sky, with Serran shining brightly on one side, and the duller Mun on the other. Even though Serran was much bigger than the Mun, the greater distance made it look a little smaller. Being two of the three other satellites of Sonnah, the two bodies had been extensively studied, and were well known. The Mun was an airless world, with a gravity of only one sixth of Kerbin, and a surface scarred with plenty of impacts, a consequence of being so deep inside Sonnah\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s gravity well. Serran was almost the complete opposite, a world of two thirds Kerbins size, an atmosphere of similar pressures and composition to Kerbins, and significant evidence of life on its surface. Aptur was the fourth and final satellite of Sonnah, a large asteroid that had only been captured two hundred years ago after a close encounter with Kerbin. \n\nAt this time of year, Sonnah would only eclipse Kerbol for about 20 minutes, but that was still long enough to lower the temperature enough that Val would want her coat if she was to stay out much longer. She started walking towards the Astronaut Complex, with half an hour until the eclipse, she didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to rush. As she approached, the remains of the media circus that had been following the space program were packing up to leave, and it spoke of how low in the public minds the KSC had sunk that the reporters didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even try to get an interview, they simply continued to leave. Not letting this get to her, Val continued into the Astronaut Complex. By chance, her route would take her past the reception to the whole space centre. As she walked through the door out of the main corridor, a low murmur of voices she had heard turned into a cacophony of shouting, with a large group of ten kerbals standing in the main waiting area of the reception. Val noticed that the group was divided into twos and threes. Each group had an object with them, and while Val was no engineer, she recognised several components being engines, communication equipment and other assorted aerospace parts. \n\nOne enterprising Kerbal began running towards Val, carrying a large, tattered box. As she reached Val, she tripped on one of the many uneven areas of the carpet, and dropped her package. The cardboard split almost immediately, and a large metallic object fell out and rolled towards Val. Carefully, Val stopped the object with her foot, and picked it up. It was a small metal sphere, about 20cm in diameter, with a mounting plate installed at one end. \n\nWithout looking at the Kerbal that had dropped the object, she asked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat is this?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nThe Kerbal, still on the floor, replied \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a probe core, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s designed to be placed on the top of a rocket, and it has short range communications and a small battery inside.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 She spoke so fast, that some of the words were slurred into each other, but Val was barely listening. Werner was the only kerbal working in the science labs, and the stress from that was starting to show. Jeb and Gene had been trying to get more scientists from the Government to help with the workload, but the response was they if the space program wanted more workers, they would need to find them themselves. The space program had become a laughingstock in the media, and any attempt at recruitment was met with ridicule. This could very well be they only chance they would ever get at getting more people involved.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s your name?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Val, still looking at the little probe.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CD-Di-Digee\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 she stuttered, as she picked herself up off the floor.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDigee, you are now the head of the new Command and Communications division, everyone else, follow me, but be quick, the Eclipse is about to occur.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nThe group of kerbals gathered their suitcases, their equipment and their composures, and followed Val out of the Astronaut Complex, towards the R\u0026D centre. The Eclipse was just starting as they left, the sunlight from Kerbol turning blue as Sonnah\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere started to eat into Kerbol\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s disk. The group quickly walked across the grass lawns, as the air grew chilly from the lack of heat. They just reached the R\u0026D centre as the area was plunged into darkness. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWerner! Werner, where are you?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 called Val, as they entered the largest building, and the only one that Werner was using. The lab was just as poorly build as the rest of the space centre, it looked more like a dirty garage than a science lab. Werner had installed air scrubbers, and had spent about a week just cleaning the building, but that had just removed the worst of the grime. Like most of the buildings here, it needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. Werner was sitting at his desk, holding his head in his hands.\n\n\u0022Val, what did I say before this launch?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nVal was taken aback, as she had assumed that Werner was only being sarcastic about the comments he had made a few hours prior.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou said that unless Mortimer brings you more money, or the Government gives you more kerbals to help you, you will be leaving the space program.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nThe kerbals that Val had taken in here were silent with shock at these words, as they had been idolising Werner for the last few months of him campaigning for the creation of KSC, and the last few weeks of launches, however badly they had ended. One confident kerbal walked to the front of the group, and, addressing Werner directly, said the sentence that likely saved the space program.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWerner, we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t bring you any money, but all 10 of us are more than willing to help you in your work.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2Werner had been sitting at his desk, with his back to the group. After hearing this, he slowly turned around, to look at the group that had appeared in his lab. \n\nLooking at Val, he asked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAre these kerbals hired yet?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDigee is\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 she said, gesturing at the awestruck kerbal \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cshe is the head of Command and Communications, with here new probe core.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nAfter looking at the new parts, Werner declared that all the kerbals assembled here were now hired, and a huge cheer went through the crowd. The new recruits took turns in hugging Werner, just at Kerbol appeared again from behind Sonnah.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T20:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MinimumSky5**\n  \nFormatting changes."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T19:08:05Z","Content":"Sorry to hear about the results - hope that\u0027s all sorted.\n\nI did enjoy Part 2 though!

Unfortunately, the beds at KSC were much smaller than back home in Zaroeka, and as a result he managed to roll over, and then out of bed. He landed with a thud on his back, which, while painful, did at least wake him up. *Well, Bilfield is always saying that I need to wake up better, maybe this will work.* He picked himself up, turned off his alarm, got washed and dressed, and headed to the canteen for breakfast. \n\nDunmey and Luddo had emerged as the best cooks in the space program, and had happily taken it upon themselves to cook for the group, as well as their other duties in KSC (as a result, lunches were strictly do it yourself, so that Luddo and Dunmey could get some lab/workshop time in.) Hadcas loaded his plate up with steaming meats, eggs and vegetables, and sat down with Debbella and Mortimer, who seemed to be the only other kerbals up at this point. \n\nAt the Eclipse celebrations last night, Hadcas really only stayed with Bilfield and Digee, as they all came from Zaroeka. This was the first time he had met Debbella or Mortimer, so he decided to at least try and be friendly! \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo, guys, what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the plan for today?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he asked, trying to break the silence.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDespair at Gene\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ability to understand basic accountancy.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Said Mortimer, in a way that implied that he had been despairing for many years.\n\nDebbella had obviously heard that reply before, as she was smiling at what Hadcas realised was a poorly delivered joke. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMe and Dilzer are going to talk with Werner about where our lab should be, and what he has already worked out about the control systems he has.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nIt was at this point that Hadcas realised that he hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t discussed todays work with Bilfield, which put him in a very awkward position in front of one of the original founders of KSC. Fortunately, Debbella was more than willing to discuss the intricacies of aerodynamics, and her theories about \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Wall\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, saving him the stress of coming up with a cover story. She spoke for nearly half an hour, by which time most of the other kerbals were up and about, eating, talking, and working out what the days tasks were to be. Just as she stopped, Gene stood on top of one of the tables, got his balance, and started speaking. Gene wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very tall, even by Kerbal standards, but his presence was enough to stop any conversations.\n\nShocked at the very sudden silence, Gene paused briefly, which only succeeded in building the tension further.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGuys, this isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a big announcement!

Alright, everyone, gather your thoughts, clear away the dishes, and arrange the tables in a circle. I want the conference starting in 25 minutes.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n30 minutes later, the dishes were washed, the tables were moved, and the kerbals were restlessly seated. At the edge of the circle furthest away from the kitchen, was Gene, at what became known as the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chead\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 of the table. To his right, was Jeb and Val, the pilots; and to his left, Werner and Luddo, the chief scientists. Clockwise from Luddo, were Bill and Bod, the chief engineers; Propulsion, made up of Tilotte, Lisna and Dunmey; Aerodynamics and Control, composed of Dilzer and Debbella; Capsule Subsystems, made up of Hadcas and Bilfield; and Command and Communications, composed of Digee and Derrigh. Mortimer was the final participant, between Derrigh and Jeb.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo, to our new recruits, we are sorry for the state of the buildings, but welcome to KSC!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Gene.\n\nAll of the new members of the team cheered at this, which made Gene blush a deep green!\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNow, us founding members have decided to start the space program again, not that we had got very far, so each of you will begin working on something, but to work out what that something is, we need a mission plan. So, any ideas?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nTilotte spoke first. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t got the capacity to get to orbit, so it will have to be a suborbital flight.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThat is correct,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Gene replied, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbut I meant what are the mission objectives, what data are we trying to collect, what height to we want to reach? Our problems before were that we were randomly bolting together parts with only a basic understanding of what we were doing. We need to have a good idea of our mission plans first, before anything else.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat data exists for atmospheric readings?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Dilzer.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVery little,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Werner replied \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwe know that the atmosphere ends between 100 and 150Km, but that is from extrapolating data from high altitude aircraft, the readings themselves don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t go above 25Km.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, it seems like a good idea to start from there, using sounding rockets to get upper atmosphere readings, so that we understand the flight profile of later rockets.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDilzer, that is an excellent plan, does anyone have anything to add?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Gene. \n\nHadcas was the first to reply \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat measurements are required, exactly?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAt a minimum, temperature, pressure and radiation levels.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMe and Bilfield have several instrument packages with us. We haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t got a thermometer, but we could make one in\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.. under a day, maybe?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExcellent Hadcas, that speed of construction isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t required but it would be useful if you could create a small instrument package, working with the Command group of, maybe, 25Kg? So, we need a name for this project, does anyone have any ideas?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \n\nLisna spoke up, for the first time since arriving at KSC. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow about Athena?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 she asked, in a voice so tiny that Gene struggled to hear her.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CLisna, Athena is a brilliant name. Project Athena is Go!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nAnd so, the first true project of KSC was born, Project Athena. The goals were to characterise the upper atmosphere of Kerbin using temperature, pressure and radiation measurements, and to finally work out where the atmosphere ends, and space begins. Dilzer and Derrigh were the leaders, as the data from this project would help them the most. Each team was given a specific part of the first rocket, the Athena 1, to work on. Dilzer and Derrigh would work on the fairings and fins; Propulsion would work, obviously, on the solid rocket motor, Command would build a probe core, and CapSys would build the instruments and launch infrastructure.\n\nTilotte was exited and more than a little nervous about this. The Athena 1 was targeting a 25Kg payload to 10Km, as a practice run for later missions. The largest rocket that she had ever launched was an off-the-shelf hobbyist\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rocket, that itself weighed 25Kg! As the teams dispersed to their assigned labs, the Propulsion team were still in their seats, looking a little dumbstruck at their task. Werner, taking pity on them, beckoned them to follow him out. Seeing a quick way out of their predicament, they gladly followed him. \n\nWerner led Propulsion over to the main lab. The Research and Development centre (R\u0026D for short) was composed of the main lab, a surprising well built, though not very clean building, two clusters of smaller buildings (Which, Werner noticed now, were military surplus bunkers), and a small fuel depot set far back from the other buildings. The main buildings was used by the Propulsion team and Werner, the larger cluster to the left was shared between CapSys and Communications, and the smaller right cluster was used by Aerodynamics. Inside the main lab, Werner sat down the propulsion team, to find out what was bothering them.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRight,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 started Werner, as he eased himself into his chair,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 What\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s got you lot all flustered then?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CW-we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve never made a rocket motor this big before, we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really know where to start!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Tilotte stammered, her voice getting louder towards the end.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYeah, this rockets payload capacity is bigger than our last rocket!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Added Dunmey.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Werner \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s start with the basics.

Dunmey was already measuring the steel and testing its strength, and Lisna was examining the new nozzles. Werner decided that the Propulsion team would, in time, understand that this place isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t where dreams are acted out, but where dreams are made.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T20:02:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MinimumSky5**"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T19:36:31Z","Content":"The next part will be going up soon, I have been making a config for New Horizons that turns it into a somewhat realistic planetary system (basically, a 10x config).

I still want to do some character building first though.\n\n**The Wall**\n\nThe door to the newly christened Aerodynamics and Control laboratory opened with a squeal of misaligned and improperly installed hinges, and the laboured breathing on two struggling kerbals. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COh, do come on!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 huffed Dilzer, as he slipped on the gravel path and received a mouthful of grit for his trouble.\n\nWith a loud snap, something in the door mechanism gave way, and Debbella also fell over, but this time into the lab itself. \n\nThe lab, like most of the smaller buildings in the Research and Development centre, was made of corrugated iron, bent into a half cylinder and capped with flat iron sheets. Cheap, but normally sturdy and reliable. In this case, the Government had decided that while public opinion was high for a space program, they didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to splash out on something that, traditionally, never quite worked out.

I wanted to say something, but I was past the point of no return, so I just had to continue and hope that no-one noticed.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nDilzer could only feel pity for the kerbal standing in front of him. She had thought that this would just be a group of friends launching small solid fuel rockets to the upper atmosphere, not a space program with the stated goal of footprints on every solid surface in the Kerbol system. Even so, Dilzer needed someone who understood aerodynamics as his assistant.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDebbella, what do you know of The Wall?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nWithout hesitating, Debbella replied \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a phenomena that happens when an object approaches the speed of sound. The drag suddenly increases beyond what the Kelwill laws state the drag should be, due to the sound waves created by the object collapsing into one another.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nDilzer had been listening carefully, and was impressed with Debbellas knowledge. But when he heard her explanation for The Wall, he started getting very interested indeed. As of that point, no kerbal had been able to explain the phenomenon.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDebbella, are you aware of any other theories about The Wall?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find anything on The Wall in fact, apart from a basic outline of what it is.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDebbella, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s because no-one knows what it is, you are the first kerbal I have met that seems to understand it. Could you try and explain your theory in more detail, please.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nDebbella took a pencil and a piece of paper from the nearest workbench, and drew four pictures. The first was a stylised drawing of a plane, with concentric circles emitting from it, representing sound waves. The second picture had the sound waves shifted, so that the lines in front of the plane were closer together, and the lines behind the plane were further away. The fourth picture had the circles arranged so that the front of them overlapped, forming a large shockwave in front of the plane. The fourth picture had a cone drawn from the front of the planet, with the circles inside of it. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDebbella, what score did you get in your maths exams?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Dilzer.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CA\\*, why?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou were first in your school?!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Dilzer practically shouted.

Debbella was clearly a maths genius, and she had quite possible solved the conundrum of what The Wall is, yet her teachers had decided that, for whatever reason, she was unfit for university!

The real question is, what do *you* need in order to lay the foundations of your story?\n\nStorytelling is a bit like playing a game of cards. You, the writer, can create any card you want and put it in your hand. The reader can\u0027t see your cards, so you\u0027re free to reorder them as you see fit, discarding some and adding others as needed. The catch is that you can\u0027t play a card directly from your hand-- in order to put a card into the story, you have to first lay it on the table, face down. How long you leave it there will depend on your story and your writing style, but you can\u0027t skip that step. \n\nEarly on, the trick is to keep your story interesting while giving yourself opportunities to lay your cards on the table. Then, as your story progresses, you can start turning them over to reveal the plot/characters to the reader. Such as the following. . .\n\n*Jeb set his glass down. \u0022Well, I think I can help with that. Rockomax has a good, long stretch of mining tunnel that is completely played out. They\u0027ve been trying to sell it off as underground housing, but everyone knows* *the tunnel is unstable* *and no one is willing to risk it. The asking price is desperately low, and I can\u0027t think of a better place to park that construction waste.* \n\nThe above is a bit of \u0022throw away\u0022 dialog from my own story. Jeb\u0027s suggestion is rejected and the story moves on. But in addition to helping set the tone for Jeb\u0027s current situation, it was also an opportunity for me to quietly lay a card on the table. At some point I may need that tunnel again, and at that point I can turn the card over. \n\nAt this point you probably have some idea of where your story is going, and a little bit about the characters who populate it. It\u0027s not a complete picture, and it will change over time, but it should be enough to give you an idea of what kind of cards you want to put on your table for future use. Plan and write your scenes accordingly. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T20:07:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Now that\u0027s an interesting hook.

As today was the Eclipse, he technically shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be on the road, as most kerbals get very anxious during this period. This was because, during the longest Eclipses, temperatures can drop to -15 degrees Celsius, even at the equator. As a result, all life on Kerbin had two circadian rhythms, a daily cycle corresponding to Kerbin rotating around its axis, and a weekly rhythm in sync with Kerbins orbit around Sonnah. Kerbals, as a result, become very agoraphobic around the time of the Eclipse, and develop a fear of the colour blue (as the early stages of the Eclipse are coloured blue by Sonnah\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere.) At this time of year at the equator, the Eclipse doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really happen, all that does happen is that the area goes slightly blue and dims a little.\n\n Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s route took him south, along the coast, through largely uninhabited areas. This was the main reason the KSC was in this area, as both the sea and soil were so poor that only a few scattered fishing villages and cattle ranches existed that could be in the way of a discarded rocket stage. Even so, KSC was only allowed to launch to the east or the south, as only ocean existed in those directions. The road was a dual carriageway, and despite being one of the main routes through Kelpogart, it was very hilly, with many tight curves. 15 miles from KSC, Jeb pulled over in the village of Mevagissey, as he had a small errand to run. He locked his bike to a rack in the main harbour, and walked first to a tiny bakery, sandwiched between a tailors and a pub.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAh, Jeb, how many this time?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked the lone baker.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C10 large Gartish pastries, 5 meat feast baguettes and three large vegetarian pizzas please, Kelcas.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe usual then!

Kelcas\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jaw dropped as he heard how much his pastries were enjoyed back in KSC, and on Jebs instruction, started packing his kitchen supplies away. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be on the other side of the harbour Kelcas, call if you need me.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \n\nAs Jeb walked across the small harbour, he stopped to take in the atmosphere of this small village.

He could smell the fish being unloaded from the ships, and the coffee from a harbourside caf\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9 next to him. He could hear kerblets playing in the narrow, cobbled streets, and seagulls fighting over scraps left by the fishermen. Jeb had grew up in a small village like this, and he would be sad to leave here. He also knew that the fish in the fishmongers would likely be second choice, the better quality catch being taken by the large transport and catering companies. As luck would have it, a fishing boat was pulling in near to him.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAhoy, skipper!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 called Jeb, using the old maritime greeting.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAhoy landlubber!

By now, several people were watching the confrontation with a variety of facial expressions. Jeb was also fairly certain that a pair of kerbals across the quayside were betting on the outcome.\n\nThe driver looked forlornly at the skipper \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t match that price. Give him the fish.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The driver started walking back to his truck, slamming the trucks back doors shut as he went. A 10 credit note changed hands across the quayside.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHey, wait!

Please!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nA small crowd gathered around Jeb, ecstatic at an actual member of the Kerbal Space Program visiting their village. After the autographs, photographs and handshakes, he paid the highly bemused skipper, and took his crate back to his bike. He took a metal contraption out of his pannier bag, and unfolded it into a trailer. This was a gift from Bill, who realised that with Jeb getting everyone lunch every day, he needed a better way of transporting the food back. Jeb placed the fish crate into the trailer, and covered the crate with a plastic lid, to protect the fish. He then walked back to the truck, and helped the driver to load the fish into it.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhy are you helping me? I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t done anything to help you.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The driver asked, as Jeb started loading some crates into the back. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI probably delayed you with that little sideshow back then, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m making sure that you get to your deliveries on time.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nThe driver smiled at Jeb. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou are an incredibly kind kerbal. Thank you.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat do you mean kind, this is my gym session for the day!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nThat earned Jeb a small chuckle from the driver, and the two of them continued to load pallets of fish in a companionable silence. Just as they finished, Jeb heard the distinctive rumble of Vals helicopter.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a pleasure meeting you two, but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s my ticket home!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nJeb retrieved his bike, helped Kelcas to load his things onto one of his mobile cooling rocks from the bakery, and headed towards the helicopter.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb, how is all this going to fit in a small helicopter?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Asked Kelcas.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not a small helicopter!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nAs they climb up, out of the village and onto the headland beyond, Kelcas caught his first sight of KSC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s helicopter. The helicopter wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a small craft, like the ones that the police and larger television companies use. It was a military surplus, dual rotor transport, designed to take several tonnes of supplies behind enemy lines. All weapons were, of course, deactivated. As soon as Jeb and Kelcas appeared over the hill leading into the village, Gene stepped out of the side door.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKelcas, welcome to the Kerbal Space Program! If I may be so bold, do you happen to have any Gartish pastries with you?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe helicopter landed on the runway outside an old hanger that KSC had inherited, as much by accident as design. The land had been an airstrip, and to save costs, the Government had just built around the hanger and runway rather than demolishing it. As soon as the rotors stopped, Val rolled the aircraft into the hanger, where Bill and Bob were waiting to perform checks and maintenance. \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVal,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Kelcas, after Val had gotten out of the pilots seat \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chow did you get a helicopter like this? It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a bit more than I thought you would have!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhen I served in the military, this was the chopper I was assigned to. She\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an old design, even back when I started flight school, and when I finished my last tour of duty, I was the only pilot left that knew how to fly these helicopters. The air force was scrapping them, so when me and Jeb were hired by KSC, when Gene asked for an aircraft, it made sense for the military to offload the old bird onto us.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \n\nSeeing the mildly shocked expression on Kelcas\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 face, Val elaborated \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry, she was built for reliability, and was only taken out of service because technology had progressed, not because she\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s unsafe!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Kelcas remained to be convinced, which Val put down to the Eclispe.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCome on, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s leave, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure Bill and Bob will want to give her a once over.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nAs soon as Val and Kelcas left, they saw Gene, Bill, Bob, and Mortimer have a quite animated discussion.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMortimer, the building isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t unsafe, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s *not structurally sound*, a particularly angry kerblet could knock the thing over!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not let any angry kerblets in, then.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was the infuriatingly calm reply.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t funny Mortimer, we are risking our lives every time we enter that building.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMaybe, but we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t afford the repairs that you are proposing.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCould we just evacuate the southern wing?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Gene, trying to calm the situation.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhen the southern wing collapses, *when, not if,* it may take down the whole building with it.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIs it possible to isolate the problem section?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nBill considered this for a second, then replied. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMaybe, but we would need significantly more powerful plasma torches to cut through the building structure.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGet them.

Val had completed her post flight checks, and turned to Bill, who was currently almost upside down, buried in the engine bay.\n\n Quietly, she climbed up the helicopter and asked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow is he?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\n Bill had been expecting this, so he wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t at all surprised at the sudden question.\n\n \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s doing as well as could be expected, but the new therapy hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t helped at all.

Bob clambered down the side of the helicopter, with little of the grace of Val, and scooped Bob up into his arms. Bob was very small and skinny for a kerbal, and Bill was quite strong, so it wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hard to carry Bob back to his quarters.
