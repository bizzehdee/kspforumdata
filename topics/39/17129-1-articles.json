Sorry if it\u0027s been done before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E============================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPHADE: The Phantom Debris Initiative\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E============================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe operator checked the numbers for what seemed the thousandth time, in disbelief. Something was wrong. And it was a little more than thirteen thousand kilometers away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, he called to the chief operator. You should come and see this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe operators were in charge of monitoring the many Kerbian objects outside of Kerbin. Their task was phenomenal given the Kerbal program\u0027s signature \u0022let\u0027s just let these empty rockets take care of themselves... in space\u0022 attitude. The large amount of debris in orbit around both Kerbit and the Mun necessitated the creation of the monitoring bureau, who tried their best to keep things from exploding, although some directors inside the KSP argued this would probably be the best way to get rid of these debris for good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chief operator bent his large frame over the chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What is it now, he sighed, checking the monitor.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe paused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This can\u0027t be right, Bob. Check it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I... I did. I can assure you the numbers are correct, the signal is strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And it\u0027s ours?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would hope it is. I can even tell you they\u0027re giving off the signal of our rocket.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESent five years ago, the Poseidon IV-X shuttle had been one of the agency\u0027s greatest success: send a team of three Kerbonauts on the Mun and back. It had been a harrowing task, had taken years of preparation, but against all odds this mission succeeded, bringing the Kerbal Space Program on the forefront of space exploration. (It did help that the KSP was the only agency actually involved in space exploration.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well there are always discrepancies in the coordinates of these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bill, with all due respect, this is not a \u0027discrepancy\u0027. These debris are shown travelling at more than 2000 meters per second...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe operator caught his breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And they\u0027re shown moving INSIDE the Mun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4UyXr.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E______________In-Mun Debris\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I knew it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe now well-known suave, deep voice had come from a dark spot in the operating room. The First Kerman on the Mun. Decorated by royalty; honored by his people; adulated by a generation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small light appeared, illuminating for brief seconds the lone Kerman\u0027s face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jeb, how did you... Hey you can\u0027t smoke in here!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah Kerman got up, ever so slowly. His body seemed to strech forever as he started walking smoothly to his interlocutors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure I can, Bill. Change in policy.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since Jebediah came back from the Poseidon Mission, his behaviour had been, to say the least, strange. Without even a thought for his safety (or others\u0027, for that matter) he simply did or said what came to his mind at the moment. The last of his antics involved one of the center\u0027s roof radars, an extraordinary amount of champagne, a few beach balls, some prominent members of the Kerwomen Baskerball Team, and eventually a sizeable portion of the police force. Reports that a dolphin was involved had been promptly denied by the agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut he was the best at what he did, and what he did was making rockets fly. Nay, soar. It was a thing of beauty to watch Jeb fly: one of his co-Kerbonauts had once called it a \u0022beautiful ballet of brilliant insanity\u0022, and he had been every bit right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know, when we landed on the Mun... I always thought it was strange. We let go of our three empty rockets and... Nothing. There were no craters when we landed, no debris. Nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We were on the darn moon, Bill answered. It\u0027s not like we were expecting to see anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We didn\u0027t even check for it, Jeb agreed. But now...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb took a look at the monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now we must go back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chief operator stared in disbelief.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You want to go back to the Mun?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb laughed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, are you crazy? Kerking Bad is back on TV, and I have a tennis match with the President next week. Nah we\u0027ll just send... I don\u0027t know. People.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SaYZj.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E____________________Some people\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the control room, all eyes were on the monitors. In the past few weeks preparations had been hectic, crazy, to put it briefly, Kerbian. Jeb had designed a brand new system that permitted him - despite the protests of the crew - to be in contact with the command pod at all times. Despite claims of a busy schedule, Jeb had been at the space center virtually every day, and had taken quite an interest in three brand new recruits of the now very popular Kerbal Space Program, who followed him everywhere as he oversaw preparations for what was now called the \u0022Phantom Debris\u0022 initiative. Everyone took to calling it PHADE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree PDs had been identified by Bob the operator at first, and a fourth one had been discovered on the other side of the Mun. It had been decided to wait until the PDs were under sunlight to permit better studying, but it seemed this was never to happen: they were rotating ever so slightly as to always stay in the dark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbonauts were ready. Three experienced, space-hardened veterans. The rocket - a Poseidon IV slightly modified for better steering - was ready. The control room was ready. Jeb was sitting in the controller\u0027s chair, an odd smile on his face. The exact same smile he had that one time he tricked the chief of the IT department into climbing on a rocket and launching it. He was retrieved from the water several days later, very blank, but otherwise unharmed. Charges were not pressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay guys, ready to launch? Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes, sir!\u0022 three voices answered in unison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait a minute, Bill said, squinting at the screen. These aren\u0027t Neil, Ed and Michael.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb scratched his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah... Neil, Ed and Michael had a little, uh, mishap yesterday at my party, and if I remember correctly - which I might not - they\u0027re probably still in the bathtub.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe shot a smile up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But I found three really motivated, young and eager kerbonauts who were more than happy to take their places and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- HI !!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And do exactly as you say, Bill sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And do exactly as I say, Jeb nodded. Alright boys. Ready?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- YAY !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We have countdown! 10... 9... 8... sevenfiveone SURPRISE LAUNCH YOU GUYS!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MDirv.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E________________________SURPRISE LAUNCH\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip to the Mun itself was rather uneventful, aside from Jeb\u0027s non-sequitur quips about various topics - tropical cocktails, the right temperature at which to raise chickens, how much energy would be needed to put an actual Kerman head in orbit - all about which he seemed to have gathered a suspicious amount of information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay guys, he said in the mic. Now we\u0027re gonna burn it nice and slow, in orbit. There.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We have orbit, sir, 10 klicks over surface. It\u0027s... It\u0027s beautiful.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb smiled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes it is, boys. Okay. You\u0027re going to the sunny side now. We\u0027re going to lose contact for a bit. See you on the other side. Then... The show\u0027s gonna start.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb took off his headphones. Bill was staring at him disapprovingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whaaaat? Jeb snapped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You\u0027re sending these boys to their deaths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First, you don\u0027t know that. Second, that\u0027s the ONE thing they wanted to do. All their lives. Third, anybody we\u0027re sending to the Mun in those rackety things... I just mean there\u0027s a good chance for ANYONE to explode in these things. You and I... And Bob... We just got lucky. And look where it landed us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill scoffed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022First Kerman on the Mun, best buds with the director, hero to the world... YOU got lucky. Bob and I get to watch dead debris floating around all darn day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Don\u0027t hate me because I\u0027m beautiful. Besides, you made what is maybe the most important discovery of all times right there. These things are going through solid matter. Or so it seems. Think of the implications.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill pondered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is nonsense. Once we find a reasonable explanation, you\u0027ll be back to square one, as miserable as ever.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb frowned and opened his mouth, but said nothing. Bill went on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You don\u0027t think I know what you\u0027re doing? With your little act? You\u0027re escaping this little greeb orb. You never got back from up there, Jeb. Not one of us did. It did something to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yeah yOU\u0027re right...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb paused, and put his headphones back on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...It made me freaking AWE-SOME. Alright guys? Guys, you there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes we...

It seemed one or two of them, uh, exploded on impact of the Mun surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Instead of re-entering the surface?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Just because you guys were hanging around?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I wouldn\u0027t know about this sir. We\u0027re going out of range. Talk to you in a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do yourself a favor and keep an eye on your friends. And by that I mean keep them strapped down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb thought long and hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay. They\u0027re going crazy out there. We got confirmation from Bob in monitoring that two of the PDs disappeared and stopped sending signals. There is something going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You don\u0027t say, Bill scoffed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A little HELP here, Bill?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill sat down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022When I was on the Mun, he started, I remember the... emptiness.

It acted differently on us of course. We got all frightened and never wanted to go back in a spaceship. You got...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb raised an eyebrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...You got weird. Well. Weirder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So? Why are we talking about this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill shrugged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know why. It seemed like it made sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It did.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb pointed at the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Video comm, coming in. One of my additions to the pod.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the screen, the grainy, panicked face of Tomson Kerman appeared. His nose was bloody, and his left eye half-shut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They left, sir!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What do you mean, left? Where do they think they\u0027re going?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They took their EVA packs and left. They said they were \u0022going after it\u0022. I have... I took one last shot of Melman as he was jetting away but... I lost contact with him a few minutes ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gZaih.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E______________________Melman bobbing away\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seems like he was aiming for one of the last two debris, sir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Okay.
