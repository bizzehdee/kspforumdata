story short, my lovely wife has gifted me a small assortment of computer parts that formed the base of a good machine.\u00A0 Case, motherboard, processor.\u00A0 For my birthday, a graphics card.\u00A0 I spent some of mine own coin, for 32GB ram, a small NVME drive for the OS and such, nothing too fancy.\u00A0 Well, an old buddy of mine called me over, said he had some stuff.\u00A0 I got given a better graphics card (sorry honey, but thanks!) and more memory at a slightly lower speed.\u00A0 So, I\u0027ve just gone from 12GB ram on the shadow remote system I\u0027ve been using, to 64.\u00A0 Incredible.\u00A0 Oh, and if anyone\u0027s interested about the processor, it\u0027s an AMD Ryzen 5 3600.\u00A0 Six core, hyperthreaded.\u00A0 Whee!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got college work I gotta do, so I can\u0027t spend a lot of time on this just yet, but boy, I\u0027m gonna go for my biggest build in forever.\u00A0 I\u0027m using a whole new operating system that\u0027ll take some getting used to (Linux MINT!) but if I can figure out how to record and such, hey, maybe some new Youtube vids.\u00A0 I can\u0027t promise, but I\u0027m gonna try to produce.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t figure out how to do a quick screenshot and slap it in here, so bear with me while I figure out
