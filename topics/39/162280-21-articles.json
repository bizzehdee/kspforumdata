At one time, long ago now, the word referred only to those who had been properly trained and permitted the use of the Source. In more recent times, it simply meant those in whom the Spark had manifested.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain Dibella\u2019s brow crinkled, \u201C\u2018permitted...\u2019 But if \u00A0such a thing is inborn, how could its use even be controlled?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Chelyaad can sense each other, even the unmanifested Spark in each other, and also its strength. But a Chelyaad cannot touch the Source unaided. Something is needed to begin the connection, an access key, of sorts,\u201D the Empress held up the deep blue m\u00FCnstone at her neck, \u201Cthey are called \u003Cem\u003Egrail\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella and Valentina shared a look, \u201Cm\u00FCnstones are these... \u003Cem\u003Egrail?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D Valentina asked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot all of them. Quite few, in truth. A \u003Cem\u003Egrail\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0can be nearly anything, and do many things. Most are access keys like this, and most of those are also \u2018amplifiers\u2019 of a sort, allowing a Chelyaad to channel more of the Source than they otherwise could. Yet some of them are very different, with very specific purposes, and of \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E, some are even able to be used by anyone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned, and cast a thoughtful eye on Valentina, \u0022like the one you wear beneath your shirt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u2019s shot wide. She looked to Dibella, who seemed equally as surprised.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can sense grail, and occasionally discern what they do,\u0022 explained the Empress, her face revealing nothing more,\u00A0 \u0022it is a Talent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNote the big T,\u201D Burdous poked Edgas in the ribs, \u201Cthats probably important.\u201D Edgas scowled back at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress gave them both a nearly imperceptible frown, but held out a hand to Valentina, \u201Cmay I?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinding no answers from Dibella, Valentina shrugged, undid the clasp around her neck and handed her M\u00FCnstone to the Empress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned the jewel over in her hands, ran a thumb over the face, held it up to the light, \u201Cthis setting is titanium, yes? Very durable, and quite striking.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, Your Majesty,\u201D Dibella little more than mumbled, \u201Cit was in my family for a very long time, the original setting is lost to the ages I suppose.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D the Empress nodded to herself, as if expecting the answer. \u00A0She cradled the stone in her cupped hands, staring down at it very intently, her eyes making subtle little motions as if seeing something no one else could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer gaze did not break as she spoke, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E, is a Seeing Stone. Very rare. You have had visions perhaps, yes? The past... the future... strange dreams you cannot understand...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared back in amazement, \u201Cyes... maybe... I do not know...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd something more...\u201D the Empress perhaps did not hear, \u201Csomething I am not familiar with... a great force indeed forged this stone, more so than any Chelyaad I have heard of...\u201D she gave a little jerk, then the slightest shake of her head. She handed the M\u00FCnstone back to Valentina, \u201Ccourage of the heart is very rare, this stone has a power... when it\u2019s there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt... does..?\u201D Valentina gaped down at it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D the Empress said, \u201Cand it has been protecting you, I think, though how, I am not sure. But one thing is for certain, it \u003Cem\u003Elikes\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs... \u003Cem\u003Ealive?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\u00A0Valentina fumbled and nearly dropped it, looking mortified.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGrail are not alive, but some of them have... a kind of will. They can be quite... possessive of those they consider their own.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina just sat speechless, staring at the jewel in her hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the Empress waved a hand around the room, \u201Ceverything on these shelves is a \u003Cem\u003Egrail\u003C/em\u003E. I have been... collecting them, these past few years, ever since things... changed,\u201D she cast her eyes over the others, silence stretching out to the edge of discomfort, as if prodding them. The four rose together, then dispersed to the bespectacled\u00A0shelves lining the walls.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere seemed to be little organization, Edgas thought, as he looked over one shelf full of jewelry. It struck him a bit odd to see gold and silver, often speckled with jewels, just laying out on a shelf like this, but he somehow gleaned that nothing about this room was as it seemed. Mixed in with the precious metals were crafts of far simpler make, as well. Necklaces of bone, bracelets of copper and animal horn sat next to a small fortune. Here was a simple stone brooch, and there was...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a quick glance back to the Empress, he picked up a shiny polished ring forged from patterned steel. It otherwise didn\u2019t... \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable, or feel, remarkable, or...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat is an access key for a kerb,\u201D Roland said, \u201Cbut a fairly unremarkable one.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas frowned. Turning aside just a bit, and feeling quite ridiculous, despite himself he closed his eyes, slipped it on, and tried to feel...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing. He had felt his share of... \u003Cem\u003Eunusual\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sensations, but this seemed like just an ordinary, if quite striking, ring.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd he could \u003Cem\u003Ecertainly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0feel the eyes of the other two boring into the back of his neck. He gave an annoyed little grunt, and moved on to the next shelf.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one was covered in... well, he wasn\u2019t quite sure \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0they were. Abstract forms of every description lay before him. A rather plain-looking rod of pure white. A three-pointed star in a ring made of pitted metal. Something that looked like a golden cast of a melted face. And...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe poked at it. It looked like a very large, clunky flashlight, broken in half. And just behind it was a thin, black skullcap with a pair of big black discs jutting from it. He picked this new thing up...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...And quickly set it down again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe felt a great unease, like a disturbance, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced. Somewhere, somewhen, he feared something terrible had happened. Edgas stared down at the dark headgear in disgust. Surely, this was a thing of incredible greed and corruption and... \u003Cem\u003Eprincesses\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe gave a little half-turn, and saw the Empress still staring at him, the intensity in her eyes belying her serene face. He thought of raising the question, but before he could, Burdous cried out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhoah!\u201D he hefted something from another shelf, \u201Ctalk about your hand cannon!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCannonical it certainly seemed. It was a massive, almost comically large revolver, with deep, patinated engravings on the metalwork and heavily worn grips of light colored wood. The bore was as big as his thumb.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou should not play with guns!\u201D Valentina snatched it away before said thumb could be shot off, checking to see it was unloaded. She set it carefully back on the shelf.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas frowned their way, but kept toddling along the shelves. Here, was a collection of rather ordinary-looking items\u2014utensils, hair clips, buttons. There, was a haphazard pile of gleaming knives and other edged weapons. He picked one up carefully. Like the ring, it was forged from patterned steel, and while the leather-wrapped grip was worn and faded and obviously not original, the blade looked absolutely flawless. He thought of running a thumb along the edge to test it, then thought the better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSharper than any knife you\u2019ll ever encounter again,\u201D Roland said without quite looking at him, \u201Cand you can beat it against concrete \u2018til you\u2019re blue in the face and it will never dull.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce again, Edgas\u2019s question was overruled by a squeal from Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve found it! At long last, I\u2019ve \u003Cem\u003Efound\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it!\u201D he cried out in a loud voice, \u201Cmy noble quest is at an end!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you going on about now?\u201D Edgas rolled his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous thrust aloft a hand-sized object that seemed to be filled with large voids, rather like a certain kind of cheese, if it were painted red and all sparkly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve found the Holey Grail!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas buried his face in his hands.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI would put that back if I were you,\u201D the Empress said, a bare hint of alarm creeping into her voice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy? What\u2019s it gonna do, blow me up?\u201D Burdous casually tossed it from hand to hand, \u201Csome kind of hokey hand grenade?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoland and the Empress looked at each other, \u201Cwell, no, not exactly,\u201D Roland said, \u201Cbut it does seem to summon a \u003Cem\u003Emost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unpleasant rabbit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous\u2019s eyes suddenly popped wide. He \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0carefully set the thing back on the shelf, and then just for good measure, gave it a gentle push to the back as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a loud groan, and beginning to wonder what exactly the point of all this was, Edgas moved on. He found a detailed globe in a carved wooden stand, bearing a landmass he did not recognize. On the wall above was a projection map of a world the color of Duna, but also swathed in blue and green. An old walking stick was propped up next to the two.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore he could contemplate any further, Dibella spoke.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, I know this,\u201D she held a small, green statuette in her hand, \u201CI have seen this before. This is a harvest icon from pre-Roamin Delain, I remember it from an old textbook. It must be thousands of years old!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress said nothing, offering only a slight nod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella frowned, \u201CYour Majesty, have these... items always been in the Crown\u2019s possession?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSome of them,\u201D another slight nod, \u201Cfor a very long time indeed. The others, I have been gathering since the fall of the Imperium, with Roland\u2019s help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella looked all around the room before turning back to the Empress, \u201Cbut... there are so many...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is but a bare fraction of what still lies beneath the Sacred Waters in Arstotzka. For a thousand years, the Kermanni were the keepers of these secrets and countless others. But even before... the end, their strength had begun to wane.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t follow,\u201D Dibella said, returning to her seat. And glaring at the others when they dallied in following.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot all Chelyaad can draw upon the Source with the same strength,\u201D the Empress explained, \u201CI am... not considered strong by any measure, even in these times. But if even a fraction of the Legends are true, the Chelyaad of Ages past could do \u003Cem\u003Ewondrous\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0things,\u201D she turned to Valentina, \u201Cyou were indeed correct that the city was in no danger even from the vast army of\u003Cem\u003E Ivan Grozny\u003C/em\u003E. The \u003Cem\u003EAshan\u0027shoufa\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0who were sworn to protect the walls were warriors without equal. Even without the Staff, they could have swept the army away like the buzzing of flies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut the last Tamyrlin was wise enough to see that the final hour of Arstotzka had come to an end,\u201D her eyes fell, \u201Cand now the final hour of the Kermanni was at hand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow do you mean?\u201D asked Dibella.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Prophecies had always hinted at a coming time of decline, the \u2018\u003Cem\u003EWaning\u2019\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it was called. No one remembers what sort of life the Kermanni had, cloistered behind their walls, but it was surely a more agreeable one than that of nomads, charged to wander a land that was not their own, outcast and forgotten but alive. The Tamyrlin saw that using the Source to wreak destruction to protect its secret was no longer sustainable, that the Servants \u003Cem\u003Ethemselves\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0must diminish, and eventually fade away.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella raised an eye... bulge, \u201Cfade away?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother nod, \u201Conly a very few among the Kermanni are ever born with the Spark. At the beginning of the Exile, it was perhaps two or three in a hundred. By the time the Ussari Empire reached its height a few hundred years ago, it had become perhaps one in a thousand. When the Troubles began, even that number had dwindled to only a bare handful among the entire population. And each new generation of Chelyaad, with few exceptions, grew weaker in the Source than the one that came before. Only the line of the Imperial monarchs maintained some of the strength of old, still weakened by ever fewer who had been fully trained in its use. We have seen the end coming for a very long time, even if there is no sense to it. But such is the nature of these times.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt makes perfect sense.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll eyes snapped to Burdous.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor his part, Burdous only studied the floor with great intent, hunched over in his seat, fingers steepled before his face and just touching his lips.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI beg your pardon?\u201D the Empress eyed him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Spark... is it genetic?\u201D he did not look up, \u201Cum, hereditary?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe considered him a moment longer before speaking, \u201Cto an extent.

There\u2019s some biological aspect to this \u003Cem\u003ESource\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0affinity, I don\u2019t know what it is but I don\u2019t need to. If you looked at it on a graph, you\u2019d see peaks and troughs\u2014 your powerful Chelyaad, your not so powerful Chelyaad, and then the normies... people who actually \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have this biological factor but it\u2019s below some threshold, too low to detect.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress and Roland\u2019s eyes grew wide, and they looked at each other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous didn\u2019t seem to notice, \u201Cnow, over time, a few people leave, and in their genetic lines the factor just gets diluted until it really is gone, biologically. But in the main population, with no new genetic material coming in, everything just sort of stagnates. The peaks become lower and lower, the Chelyaad less powerful, the normies get a little more of it, as a group, but it\u2019s so distributed it\u2019s still way below the threshold. The Imperial bloodline remained powerful because it \u003Cem\u003Ewasn\u2019t\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pure.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore blinking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous downright scowled this time, \u201Coh, come \u003Cem\u003Eon\u003C/em\u003E, guys, it\u2019s not rocket science! Whatever this factor is, \u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0blood is crucial to maintaining it. It has to be kept in balance. The Kermanni were essentially breeding the Spark out of themselves, even though by the end they \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had some minuscule measure of it!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow all eyes grew wide, but Dibella outpaced them all with a gasp, raising a hand to her mouth, \u201Cthat\u2019s why they did it. They knew. Somehow, they found a way to know.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it was Burdous\u2019s turn to blink, \u201Cwait, what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Imperium. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is why they committed the worst genocide the world has ever known.

Maybe it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as simple as a blood type, the Kermanni did not exactly embrace modern medicine, or modern... anything. The Imperium discovered the Kermanni\u2019s secret, discovered how to detect it, that \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Kermanni carried it... and then slaughtered them out of fear,\u201D she looked at the Empress, \u201Cdidn\u2019t they?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo. Not fear.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEyes turned to Valentina.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot fear. Control,\u201D she stared at the same patch of floor that had so captivated Burdous, \u201Ccontrol is all that has ever mattered to such as they. If it cannot be controlled, it must be destroyed. \u003Cem\u003EHow?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D she looked up at the Empress, \u201Cyou can do great things. More than we know. Your Grandfather, the last Emperor, could do even more, no? Even if he could not sweep armies aside like this Tamyrlin, surely with his power and all the might of the Empire behind him, he could repel a band of angry peasants. How could the Revolution even happen? How could such as him, such as \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E, be led about by the Imperium like a... a... a dog on a leash?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress\u2019s hands, a moment ago folded calmly in her lap, tensed, one even curling into a fist. The features of her ever-serene face somehow seemed to soften and grow icy at once. Her throat twitched, and just above her lower lip trembled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Roland laid a hand on her shoulder, and to Edgas\u2019s surprise she reached up and squeezed it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer eyes fixed on Valentina with a new fury, like a polar storm barely held behind a fragile window pane, and the younger kerbelle shrank back before the torrent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet, it did not seem directed at \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere are those who have said, that my Grandfather, the Emperor, was devious: that he \u003Cem\u003Ewanted\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0revolution, thinking he could contain and guide it, and use it to weaken and remove his political rivals. Others said he was arrogant, that he did not even believe there \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a revolution, or it was of no concern. Others still, that he he believed his own reforms could not go far enough, and true upheaval was the only way to bring about meaningful change.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer eyes slipped from Valentina, again touching on everyone else in the room, \u201Cbut whatever is the truth, my Grandfather delayed in acting, until it was too late. By then he had lost not only the allegiance of the people, but of much of the Army as well, and his political rivals were quick to set upon what they perceived as weakness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen the revolutionaries stormed the Winter Palace, perhaps my Grandfather thought he could just slip away, avoid conflict in Kermangrad and regroup in Kernobyl. He certainly had,\u201D her eyes cast about the room, \u201Cresources at his disposal. But this Vladimir Kermin had, as you say,\u201D and landed on Edgas, \u201Cdone his homework.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked to a wall, and a book floated from it, settling on a table before the group. A page flipped open, \u201Cyou know these, yes?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe look on the other two kerbelle\u2019s faces told Edgas they did indeed. He peered down at the three pictures, and did not see anything unusual. At the bottom, the Empress stood with the eight members of the Imperium in an official-looking State photograph. At the top, he recognized Emperor Nicholas II, her grandfather, standing with a different eight. The kerbelle in the middle one he had only the vaguest recollection of, some flash of memory from an old history documentary. Alexandra I, daughter to Nicholas, mother to the current Empress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey all seemed... different. Different styles of dress, different decor in the room behind, even the varying fuzziness of the ever-older photographs. And yet, his scientist\u2019s brain kept nagging at him, begging him to see some obvious detail his eyes were somehow missing, something that connected the three\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThose rings,\u201D Burdous\u2019s brow crinkled as he leaned down closer, \u201Cthe black rings those \u003Cem\u003Eseffleks\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are all wearing... and... and that gem around your\u2014\u201C\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHorrified understanding dawned on his face. He slumped back in his seat, eyes darting back and forth between the page and the kerbelle sitting across from it. Edgas saw a slew of unfamiliar emotions run across his friend\u2019s face, a hand drawing up to his neck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside him, Valentina would no longer meet the Empress\u2019s gaze, but her mouth was a thin, pale, tightly pressed line. Dibella looked outright ill.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas again looked at the pictures, and he \u003Cem\u003Esaw\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach of the Imperium members wore a wide black ring on their index finger. In fact, they all stood \u003Cem\u003Especifically\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0so that all the rings could be seen, immortalized on photopaper. Around the Empress\u2019s neck was a m\u00FCnstone, its color faded with the aged picture, hanging on a short chain from a tight necklace he knew to be called a... choker. Her mother wore the same stone. And her grandfather...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas felt his own stomach wrench and then clamp down, as understanding he \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was incomplete but no less horrible for it passed over him like waves of nausea.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVladimir Kermin,\u201D the Empress said, \u201Chad found his own grail.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA thing most foul,\u201D Roland spat, \u201Cno doubt Crafted in the very darkest bowel of the Ninth Hell,\u201D then actually spat.

Eight rings to rule the one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt does not grant control of the mind, but the leashed one cannot touch the Source without the ringbearers\u2019 consent, cannot channel anything they do not wish or resist channeling anything they do.

And the leashed cannot touch the collar with even a \u003Cem\u003Ethought\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of removing it without being overcome by sickness. It is a prison from which there is no escape, and history would have been \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0different if those old goats had realized even a \u003Cem\u003Efraction\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the power they controlled.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut, could not someone else take it off?\u201D Valentina looked up at Roland, \u201Csurely the Emperor had his own... retainers? Servants? Or..?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe and the Empress shared a look, \u201Cindeed, he did. The \u003Cem\u003EAshmanni\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Protectors of the Kermanni, conservators to the Throne, and successors of the \u003Cem\u003EAshan\u0027shoufa\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0who once guarded the walls of Arstotzka itself.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, but,\u201D Valentina persisted, \u201Cif he had guards, why did they not, well, guard him?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo one knows,\u201D the Empress said, \u201CI was... too young, at the time, to understand much, and my mother never told me afterward. Some things we... did not speak of. But, in the weeks that followed, my Grandfather discovered that the bond was... flawed. The chain pulled both ways. They could control his channeling, and even his behavior, indirectly, but likewise he found he could influence them. Guide their minds to where he wished, up to a point, not unlike channeling the Source itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDespite the misery of the arrangement, he forbade the Ashmanni in Kermangrad from releasing him, and instead sent nearly all of them out across the nascent Union and the world, to watch and listen from the shadows. With this information, he thought he could guide his country to a better place, certainly more so than tearing it apart in civil war.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd for a time... things did not seem so bad. Vladimir Kermin had many faults, but he was not an evil kerb. My Grandfather forged... not a exactly a friendship, but at least a rapport with him, and found much common ground. But as years moved on, Kermin and his co-rulers began to change. They became contentious, mistrusting, even paranoid. My Grandfather tried to guide them away from the most reckless acts, but then came that fateful day in Kerbelsk.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress\u2019s eyes dropped away, one hand finding the blue m\u00FCnstone on the loose golden chain around her neck, \u201Cmy mother told me, some time later, that Kermin and the Imperium had gathered emissaries from across the world for a very specific reason.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked up, \u201Cthey were going to force my Grandfather to expose himself, and all the Chelyaad. Perhaps to display them as weapons, or monsters, or even to begin a push to find Arstotzka and the greater secrets hidden there. I still do not know. But they failed to understand that there are some oaths which \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E...\u201D her eyes found each one again, \u201C...be broken.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe flows he was forced to channel turned back on my Grandfather, creating a feedback loop, like a short circuit, with his own body as the conduit. When at last he...\u201D her shoulders sagged a nearly imperceptible bit, \u201Cexpired, all the Power he had been channeling was released uncontrolled. There was no bomb that day. For Vladimir Kirmin\u2019s ignorance, my Grandfather was made to destroy everyone he loved, and nearly took the Imperium and the entire Union along with him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut someone realized what was happening, and pulled several Imperium members\u2014and my mother, just barely\u2014 to safety behind a heavy stone wall. The collar was placed around her neck before it had even had time to cool, leaving a mark I will never forget. One month later, before a reconstituted Imperium, she was crowned Empress Alexandra I... and I never saw her again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI spent the rest of my youth cloistered in this very building, watched every moment of every day, and kept far away from anything that might be a grail. When my Grandfather died, the Spark had only just begun to manifest in me. Roland guided me how little he could,\u201D her eyes flicked up to him, \u201Cbut a bird cannot teach a fish to fly, nor a fish teach a bird to swim.

His friends who had travelled across the Narrow Water, to the great cities in the green lands beyond, had sent back word of a \u2018white rain\u2019 that was called \u003Cem\u003Esnow\u003C/em\u003E, which sometimes fell on days when the cold was more bitter than they could have ever imagined.

Ubuntu tried not to look at the trees these days, the vast grove that stretched out beyond the hills and back to the village. It was not his place to challenge an Elder. Surely, the Elders were right.

But paused. He looked over the cracked trunks and naked branches of the grove, where not a single leaf had emerged this season. He looked to the rows of the garden he had been tending, where not a single seed had sprouted. He looked to the withered scrublands spreading off across the rolling hills, where even the sungrass had grown brittle and pale.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length, he spoke, \u201Cthe Tribes are hungry, Elder.

I am... concerned.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Elder nodded from his place up in the tree, seeming to take the junior kerb\u2019s words with great consideration. He returned his focus to the tree for a moment, looking at the branch this way and that, before snipping off a single twig with his pruners.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe cast it a satisfied look as he spoke, \u201Cperhaps... you are not so young anymore, O budding chieftain,\u201D his twinkling eyes flicked to Ubuntu for just a moment, \u201Cbut you must not lose hope. The rains will come,\u201D in emphasis, he held up his hands to the heavy, slate-grey clouds above.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cold did not seem to bother him, as he swung down one more branch as deftly as a spider-monkey. The heat of summer never seemed to bother him either, as he bothered with little other than a loincloth, no matter the weather. His skin was as thick and though as old leather, his hands callused like stones. To Ubuntu, even now the Elder seemed indestructible. If \u003Cem\u003Ehe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0could persist for so many years, and always with that mirthful twinkle in his eye, surely the trees, and the land and the People could, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rains would come, if the Elder said they would.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if in agreement, the heavy clouds overhead rumbled with thunder.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou see?\u201D the Elder smiled up at them, \u201Cthe rains will come.

His eyes turned off towards the East, towards the green lands across the Narrow Water. Another icy breeze tugged at his cloak, and he absently wondered if perhaps it might snow \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0too.

He rolled himself over, still trembling, his throat unable to give up the scream before the competing urges to breathe and vomit. Confused, drifting thoughts shrouded in mist and smoke pressed against the inside of his head.

Yet before it could form, acrid smoke caused his lungs to seize and tighten. Fighting against the fog in his mind, he looked out, and saw the entire almond grove ablaze. Twisting yellow and orange tendrils of flame rose up to the sky like demonic fingers reaching up from the very deepest hell. The wind whipped at them, twisting them into burning cyclones, choking black smoke mixing with the clouds above.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUbuntu clapped a hand to his mouth, struggling to breathe.

He let the wind pull his cloak away, hefted up the Elder and laid him across his own shoulders. Then Ubuntu set off, running as fast as he could across the blazing sands. He dodged flaming debris, snaked around burning sagebrush that seemed to reach out to him and call his name. His feet sank into sand that pulled at him and tried to drag him down below. At some point, he didn\u2019t know where, he lost the Elder.

It stabbed into her lungs like thousands of tiny, white-hot needles and left her mouth dry as desert sand. And then... there was the smell. No hint of wood to it, despite the fields of sage and mesquite being consumed. Only the acrid tang of rubber, the reek of plastic, and a gagging mix of brimstone and chemicals like putrid fruit. And... something else, as well. Buried beneath all the other stinks. Subtle, scratching at the edges of her mind, as if her mind knew better than to acknowledge it.

At least, that\u2019s what she told herself. The craft wobbled in the turbulence of a legion, joining other VTOLS, helicopters, and anything else that could fly in a mass aerial exodus. The armada stretched nearly to the horizon, hundreds or even thousands of shapes jostling for a little space of air like affluent rats from a foundering ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe took a bottle at random from the wetbar next to galley, discarding her mask and downing a few gulps in hopes of clearing the stench, or at least numbing her throat to it.

Below the flying armada, the streets were strangely empty. Even on any normal day, it was a surreal land of swimming pools and movie stars Lolli had somehow come to call home. Only now, the swimming pools were all dry, drained in the too-little, too-late effort to delay the inevitable, and the movie stars fled not long after. The land grew darker still, and inky black clouds replaced the scudding grey. For a moment, streetlights twinkled, but as she watched they winked out in great cascading blocks. Flickering in the pitch black below, wind-born embers were already taking root.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLolli squeezed her eyes shut, and gave her head another shake.

Twelve. Her own staff, who had refused to leave when she told them to. And... from the next estate over, owned by people she refused to call neighbors.

The two pilots stared ahead, dumbfounded, then at each other with the same unbelieving look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CN\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is coming back up on number two, looks like we\u2019ve got stable burn again,\u201D the copilot barely whispered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilot roused himself, \u201Cwhat about number four?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe copilot scowled, shook his head, \u201Creadings are all over the place.

This looked far too appealing to Lolli after everything, so she did the same, collapsing back in the little cubby of the closed airstair and taking a moment to just breathe. Her wrist was throbbing. She tried moving it, and let out a yelp as she felt bones grind together. The flight must have a first aid kit, she turned to the cockpit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and saw a flash of gold, and gaudy paint.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn engine, and then a wing and a tail filled the windscreen. There was a horrendous ripping like a monster\u2019s wail, and icy wind bit into her face with a thousand burning teeth. For an instant there was screaming all around before the air was torn from her lungs. A gruesome vision of bodies and twisted metal cast across the blue sky assaulted her eyes, and the screech of a roaring jet engine slammed into her ears. Something crushed her hard against the airstair, the sun flashing across her sight faster and faster.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pressure built ever higher, the engine screamed louder, the sun melted into a strobing flicker as she was spun around. Shadows danced at the edges of her vision, closed in, narrowed to a point... and Lolli Kerman was given over to the darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDarkness... darkness was split by a blinding light, somewhere a world away, on the razor\u2019s edge between Above and Below. Ancient, rusted hinges shrieked in protest. Something crumpled on the floor quivered, drew back from the light. It huddled in clothing torn and ragged, stained with blood and filth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe light dimmed as a figure appeared in it, a ghostly silhouette of pitch black, broken only by a hungry grin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDown on the floor, a tongue like old leather slid over cracked lips as dry as desert sand, and a bare creak of voice trembled back up, \u201Cp... please... I already told you everything...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe specter\u2019s grin only widened, \u201CAh know.
