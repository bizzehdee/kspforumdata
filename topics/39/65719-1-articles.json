Today we don\u0027t have a crisis; we have an opportunity. To seize this opportunity, I\u0027m not proposing a 10-year plan like Apollo, no, no; I\u0027m proposing a long-range, continuing commitment. First, in five to seven years, for the coming decade, I propose an Assembly Space Station in LKO, an critical step in all our endeavours and the Kerbal Exploration of the Solar System. And next, I propose that we return back to the Mun, back to the future, this time, to stay. And then, an journey into tomorrow, an journey that will inspire, innovate, and cement our leadership in the field of technology and spaceflight...an manned mission to Duna.\u0022 - President Madfield, 20th Anniversary of the first Kerbal Mun Landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECHAPTER PORTAL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrologue Part 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter One: The Core\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter Two: Shuttle SSK-23\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter Three: Random Stuff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter Four: Assembly Required (SSK-24)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[PROLOGUE]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresident Madfield shivered nervously. The temperature had dropped several degrees in his meeting room despite the best efforts of his heaters as an cold front swept across his country. He sat silently in his chair, reading the daily paper with an determined patience, almost as if he was anticipating something. He had been awake the entire night giving press briefings and performing an last minute visit to the Chaiqeng ambassador before he left for his home country, such were the duties of his office, and although he felt no sentimental attachment to them, he certainly liked the air of respect and authority his presence carried, almost as if he were some grand emperor. Which, in a sort of way, he was. Although his hair had mostly whitened in his years in the Presidency, and although he nolonger ran two miles a day as he had before, he was still as grand and as healthy as he ever was. In the next room down the hall, the phone rang, and his Assistant Press Secretary popped his head in through the door and called him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. President!

Although more than 4.5 billion dollars in funds had been allocated to fund and develop the assembly platform for the first year, the Orbital Platform was soon scaled back. Facing budget cuts, the 90-Hour Report was only saved with the intervention of President Madfield himself and the NAA Administrator, both of whom took political reprecussions for their defense of the program. But onward the program persevered, its engineers and scientists laboring away, their toil and sweat spent fulfilling one of the most ambitous projects ever proposed. Alongside them, the propulsion engineers worked, trying their best to modify one of their rockets to fit the standards set forward by design teams.

He was being mandated and constantly pressured by the President to hurry with the Space Exploration Intiative to achieve results quickly and cheaply; and he was faced with constant funding wars raging across Congress. He couldn\u0027t achieve the results without the money, and the money was being withheld by Congress, and Congress was being soon overrun by fillibusting Senators. The fact that the Midterm Elections had put many political enemies of President Madfield into the office hadn\u0027t helped either. But progress was being made, he was sure of it. Rockomax Aerospace was finishing up the core of the new Heavy Lift Vehicle, and the contractors at FusTek Corporation were finishing up the space-worthy payloads for the first launch of the assembly site. This was coming at an cost; many technical issues were being overlooked and most of the systems had been quickly rushed. There would certainly be alot of good luck charms and prayers during the day of launch, he was sure of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The ion thruster research needs to be funded too!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We don\u0027t have the funds.

Once Madfield pulls the plug, its all over. We have one more year to get the station core into orbit, that\u0027s all. One more year, and then the budget axe comes down and hacks off the SEI programs. It\u0027s that simple. We cannot support your program at such critical a time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdgert hated cancelling design projects that had ambition, but this time, he had no choice. It was either the ambitous programs that wouldn\u0027t bear fruit in the short term, or his career and the future of spaceflight, and likely the careers of President Madfield and his political allies. He chose the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But my proposals can make that happen! I can get it done at a cheap-\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Enough.

He stared at the photo of one of his predecessor, Webb Kerman. \u003Cem\u003EWhat would Webb do now?\u003C/em\u003E, Edgert pondered, wondering about his next course of action. The vultures were closing in on the SEI, and the political rivals were already circling the target, their mouths salivating at the thought of such an easy kill. Madfield was starting to distance himself from the Space Exploration Intiative, and had even admitted to him that he might cancel it at some time in the near future. Edgert couldn\u0027t take the political fallout, nor could he take the guilt from the SEI\u0027s death - but he had an impossible schedule with funding that was being quickly strapped down to only the basics. He was trapped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the VAB, work was frantic. The workers well knew that their very jobs depended on the SEI\u0027s survival, and they knew that they only had a year left before the unspeakable happened.

He was respected, adored, and admired by the space community worldwide as a god amongst kings, and was an rising popular culture celebrity. He had been the first to plant his foot into the Munar regolith, and now, he stood in one of the computer aisles of the Mission Control center, watching as the future of spaceflight sat on the pad, the clock ticking down to launch. Next to him stood Director Edgert and Vice President Jedfrey. Jedfrey was an small, unassuming Kerbal, and was an unlikely running mate for the tall and grand Madfield to choose for his Presidental campaign. But in office, he soon proved his worth as an effective politican who could get bills passed. But even now, he was facing difficulty gaining support in Congress for the SEI. The tensions were rising, and the entire future of the program depended on this one launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gWbKWKj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gWbKWKj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Congressional Budget Hearings were tomorrow, and they needed a success to convince the Congressmen, to sway some of them over to their cause.

The station was still heavily incomplete, and couldn\u0027t support much more than three at an time. Onboard the shuttle was an docking module to accomandate supply vessels. The Mission Commander was Adam Kerman. Adam had flown two times prior to SSK-23, having went to space on SSK-11 and SSK-20. This was the first Mission he had commanded, and he was going to ensure it wouldn\u0027t be his last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis sole companion for the entire mission was an Kerbal named Billybobfred. Billy was one of the younger astronauts. This would be his first time in space, and he still hadn\u0027t lost the glee of floating in microgravity, an experience which would seem like an complete and total annoyance to an \u0027ol-salt spacefarer\u0027 like Adam or Jeb. Billybobfred had grown up worshipping the astronauts who had landed on the Mun and who had went to space, and had been very excited for an chance to work in the astronaut program, alongside his heros. He was somewhat annoying, but Adam could stand it. He had been through much worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control, we have station rendezvous in five minutes, visual contact with Assembly Platform has been established.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Roger that SSK-23, make your way to it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdam gripped the shuttle controls, and cautiously fired each thruster, one at a time, to ensure that they all worked. Taking a deep breath, he set the shuttle on a course to intercept the station, which was currently an small dot on the horizon. The approach was an long one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control, we are going to pass through to the night side in twenty minutes. Should we dock or should we await reentry of the daytime side again?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdam knew how dangerous it was to dock with an spacecraft in total darkness. The Great Union had attempted such an feat with its Kaylut Station a year ago, and only succeeded in losing three astronauts, a spacestation, and creating around a hundred pieces of debris; this came with the added gift of political backlash, as the Great Union had to delay its plans of an multi-modular station for another five years. Luckily, the station was at an low orbit, and all the debris had rentered only a month ago. But still, Adam didn\u0027t want to die in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027ve underestimated.

After what felt like an eternity, the module finally docked. They had twenty more minutes until the shuttle crossed over to the nighttime side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pstc5cp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Pstc5cp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let\u0027s do this!\u0022, Adam murmured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle banked and rolled over, exposing its docking port to the newly installed docking module. It approached cautiously and slowly, careful not to collide with the station. Approaching at 0.5m/s carefully, Adam brought the two ports together.

We need one HLV launch and one Shuttle launch per Munar mission. I\u0027ve looked at the plans for the SEI, and they plainly cannot be sustained for much longer.

His approval rating was on an downward streak after he took off some money for social welfare programs to fund the SEI, and some Congress were pressuring him to elimate the program outright - an process that would require the deorbiting the assembly platform and the shutdown and layoffs of much of the NAAs facilities and workers. This, and the fact that his nation was in an recession. He had to be responsible for his nation and he had to win reelection, but he couldn\u0027t abandon Edgert, and he would never forgive himself if he ever abandoned the SEI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fine, one more year.\u0022, the President said sadly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I won\u0027t dissappoint you\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with that, Edgert hung up on the conversation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMadfield sighed.

No Kerbal had walked there since Munshoot 17, but as Madfield had put it \u0022We shall return to the Moon; return to our future; this time, to stay\u0022. Of course, that was all political banter on his part (After all, he was supposed to give an speech as something symbolic exactly twenty years after Kerbals first landed on the Mun), but Congress and Edgert took him seriously, with an Anti-Space coalition forming up and Edgert ordering design times to quickly write up an proposal to fulfill the goals set forth by Madfield in the \u002290 Hour-Report On The Current Status Of Provincal Spaceflight And Offworld Operations\u0022, which had been uncerimonously called the \u002290HROTCSOPSAOO\u0022 in an acrynom that no Kerbal had yet to pronounce correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdgert was sitting down for another conference with his Assiociate Adminstrator. Being an government agency, they had to have meetings to ensure that everyone was working on the right thing; there had been an few catrosophic instances when ARPA had been ordered to produce robotical killing dogs, but had produced genetically engineered cute puppies instead after misreading the orders set forth by Congress. Of course, the government had made an massive profit by selling them, but they couldn\u0027t afford the same style of that mistake here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s going to take two launches per Munar expedition. One to carry the lander, one to carry the crew and other consumables. Or we can just build the whole thing at the Assembly Platform.\u0022, Edgert announced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing an veteran of the Munshoot Program, it was starting to worry him about how mind-bogglingly complex that this new program was, with orbital construction, fuel depots, and an colony on the Mun with its own nuclear fission plant. The cost estimates had started at $150 billion, but had grown to $450 billion. Of course, spread over twenty years, it was somewhat affordable, but that budget had put the agency in the crosshairs of every one of Madfields political enemies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027ve already got design teams working on the assembly platform, which we\u0027ve named \u0027Liberty\u0027.

Opposition in Congress was getting quickly unbearable; and Madfield was rejecting much of their proposals. And they had the Aeronautics Council refusing to cooperate and lend them their aircraft for transport, and almost every engineer in the agency was fighting to add their own little piece to the SEI, increasing costs, which was quickly proving to be unsustainable.

Malrey was an powerful leader of the Anti-Space Coalition, which adovocated more down to Kerbin expeditures of government funding, and had been almost radical in this respect, once slandering Edgert on the Senate Floor a couple months ago.

Edgert found a close confidant with President Madfield, who was quite relieved by this new unexpected development, \u0022Almost like waking up one day to a Christmas present that you didn\u0027t expect and were too ashamed to ask for\u0022, he said in an phone call. The truss segment of the newly named Space Station Liberty had docked with the station a week ago, delivered up in segments onboard an HLV booster and an assembled with several EVA\u0027s by Adam and Billybobfred, of whom were scheduled to return to Kerbin soon. The MAD (Munar Archetecture Design), teams had finalized their Munar Excursion Vehicle designs, and they would be finished soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first, they needed to build the modules in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would take three launches of an shuttle to construct an single Munar expedition in LKO, unlike the previously estimated two launches. The crew would remain onboard \u0027Liberty\u0027 while the construction was taking place, an process which could last anything from one day to three months. The Station was now in its operational configuration, and Beyond-Kerbin Orbit exploration could begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eBS9KA3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eBS9KA3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSK-24 stood on the launch pad, ready to be shot off into space. The shuttle was one of the twelve constructed for the Space Program, and it was an fine masterpiece of engineering. Being completely reusable except for the orange External tank, it could provide low-cost access into space, and would form the backbone of any concentrated space effort, especially one as high-profile and extensive as the SEI. Onboard the shuttle was an massive delivery of rocket parts, needed to construct the Munar Module in LKO. The shuttle was fully staffed with an crew of six, Jebediah Kerman as the commander as per request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mission Control, we\u0027re ready to launch\u0022, Jebediah said proudly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jebediah, be careful out there. You\u0027re the hero of our nation, and we can\u0027t afford to lose you. I\u0027m worried\u0022, Gene replied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was true, Jebediah was the first Kerbal to step on the Mun and was widely regarded as an international hero of sort. Jebediah disliked being thought of as an historical figure, as he said it \u0022Makes me feel like I\u0027m gonna die\u0022. But that didn\u0027t matter now, he had to accomplish this mission if he was to prove to Edgert that he could command an manned mission to Duna. He had to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t worry Gene, anxiety is not good for your heart\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m more worried about yours.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m not worried; you are.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What do you mean?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gene, I\u0027m Jebediah Kerman. I went to the Mun. If I can get to the Mun, a short jaunt into space isn\u0027t going to kill me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This isn\u0027t a short jaunt, its a week-long stay onboard Space Station Liberty\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ah, well, who cares? My Mun trip was a week.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlipping through the pre-launch checklist, Jebediah took a quick head count. There were six Kerbals onboard, and he was the only Munwalker. He was the oldest, but one of them, Ordas Kerman, had made three spaceflights compared to his two spaceflights prior. He had an entire paylaod bay full of fuel and rocketparts for the assembly of the Munar Module, an act that had violated the protocol set in place after the \u0022Dauntless\u0022 disaster three years before. He still remembered that day, the shuttle rising up, only to flip over three kilometers up then nosedive into the R\u0026amp;D center. The R\u0026amp;D center itself took an whole year to fix, and was still scarred from the blast to this day. There weren\u0027t even enough remains left of the crew to host an funeral. He took a deep breath. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T Minus Two Minutes\u0022, Gene said, going through the usual pre-launch countdown. Jebediah felt his grip tightening on the controls, the alderiane rushing through his veins. He savored the excitement of an space launch, and he wasn\u0027t going to waste this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T Minus One Minute\u0022. One of the crewmembers, an Payload Specialist by the name of Nedbob Kerman, tapped Jebediah on the shoulder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are the experiment racks secure?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T Minus Thirty Seconds\u0022. Jebediah stared out the window at the open blue sky above. There was not an cloud in sight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T Minutes Ten Seconds\u0022. There was an rumbling inside the shuttle as its main engines started up. The flight deck started shaking, and one of the astronauts looked around in worry as the deck started to vibrate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt zero seconds, the boosters ignited and the shuttle hurled off the pad, roaring as it hurtled toward the heavens. The onboard computers worked feverishly, transmitting data to Mission Control and providing the astronauts inside with information about their current trajectory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztZlHW6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ztZlHW6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene monitored the situation from his seat in Mission Control, reading over telemetry and other assorted data. SSK-24 was the ninth shuttle launch that had had suprevised, ten if one counted the Dauntless disaster. The disaster had nearly killed the entire SSK program, and it wasn\u0027t until an massive investigation that it was confirmed that the mission, listed as SSK-14, had an faulty pump that had disengaged on the launch pad, forcing the orbiter to use its onboard, which ran out at around 3KM. With the fuel gone, the engines shut off, and the onboard computer immediately decoupled the SRB\u0027s. The spacecraft attempted to glide back to the runway, but instead smashed into the SRB Research Building in the R\u0026amp;D center, causing an chain reaction of explosions that had destroyed the R\u0026amp;D division, obliterated two of the three tracking dishes, and set the VAB on fire. For added insult, the underground hydrailuc pipes that brought water to the firefighters had failed, forcing an complete rebuild of the VAB, setting the space program back by an year and delaying almost every manned launch by two more years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shouts of several of his colleagues shook him out of his thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022SRB\u0027s have been decoupled! SSK-24 is speeding to apogee\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022SSK-24?\u0022, Gene asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This makes it the tenth shuttle mission since the Dauntless Disaster!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of his friends, and stout Kerbal named Sammund grinned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well then, let us drink to the shuttle program and the success of the SEI, shall we?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No, not now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QJTnujO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QJTnujO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiter was now heading into the blackness of space. Where the atmosphere ended and space began was always an subject of dispute, with some setting the limit at 50KM, some at 70KM, and even some at 30KM. But it was an generally accepted fact that space was hard to reach, even with the technology and engineering of an Modern Kerbin. The early days of the space race had only proved this, as rocket after rocket exploded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027ve hit the Apogee!\u0022, came a cry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle had now decoupled its external tank and was coasting to its highest point, at which it would fire its engine again and enter into an round orbit. Years of satellite launches had fine-tuned this process, and it had become almost rountine to the different space agencies around the world. Onboard the flight deck, Jebediah looked out into the blackness of space for the third time. An drop of water, condensed into an ball, floated past him. He felt an surge of nationalistic pride that was both embrassing and amusing. Here he was, as an Provincal astronaut, in an Provincal-built spacecraft, conquering space. He quickly shook the thoughts out of his head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zDlSEYE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zDlSEYE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Should we start our experiments?\u0022, Nedbob asked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENedbob was an scientist by nature, and had been assigned to the flight as it payload specialist. As an aspiring scientist, he had no clue on how to fly the shuttle, like most of what Jebediah called the \u00223rd generation spacers\u0022. There was an slight thump as the circulization burn ended, and the computers flashed for a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure, go ahead, we\u0027re in orbit and we got three hours until our rendezvous with Liberty. Feel free to do whatever you want, as long as you don\u0027t kill us all!\u0022, Jebediah called out to the rest of the crew. There was an slight murmur of approval as the astornauts began to unbuckle themselves from their flight seats and started to move around the interior, accustoming themselves to the microgravity. Jebediah turned the shuttle tenatively, trying to figure where the sun was, then set the \u0022Sundshader\u0022 controls to \u0022Automatic\u0022. He couldn\u0027t afford to be blinded by the sun, not at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome three hours later, the crew was bored, bouncing off the walls and floating as the station and shuttle slowly danced arund each other, getting closer and closer to dock. Jebediah was asleep, having turned the shuttle onto \u0022Autopilot\u0022 mode an hour before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NPyj84Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NPyj84Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was an sudden bump as the station and shuttle docked, followed by an fizzling sound as the docking ports pressurized themselves. Jebediah woke up an an start, then made his way to the airlock. Most of his crew were already inside the station, restarting its computers and systems. Nedbob was at the science module, admiring the gleaming equipment that now lay at his disposal, and several astronauts could not hide their amazement as they went from module to module, touching, poking, and generally acting in an curious manner. Jebediah could\u0027nt blame them; although he had flown to the Mun and had one flight flying solo on the longest solo space mission, he had never seen the interior of an space station, let alone an multimodular one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TllCkhI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TllCkhI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe looked over the mission profile. He had a week to construct the Kerbin-Departure Stage for the Muanr Excursion Vehicle, after which he was to leave a crew of two to assist in the assembly of the main body when SSK-25 docked. After undocking frm the station, the crew was to perform scientific experiments in orbit, then fly back down to Kerbin. Opening the station\u0027s blueprint containers, he found the design outlines for the Munar Module. He grinned as he looked through each and every design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let\u0027s get started!\u0022, Jebediah shouted excitedly as he found an roll of duct tape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was time to begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-16T16:21:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2014 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T11:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, ok now, this AAR is certainly suffering from \u0022Chronic-Nonposting-Disorder\u0022.
