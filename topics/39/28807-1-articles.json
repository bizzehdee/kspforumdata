Therefore, I assure you this is no joke or science fiction dream. This is a serious assessment, and should be treated as such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA popular trend among the space programs recently is the concept of the \u003Cstrong\u003EGrand Tour\u003C/strong\u003E, In which every planet and every moon in the Kerbol system is visited in a single flight, always making use of docking, and sometimes (but not always) refueling. This is an enormous endeavor, costing several billion Kerbits and lasting many years, but if it can be pulled off, the program instantly gains amazing prestige. The scientific value is also immense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore this is attempted, however, I believe we should complete the following tasks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReturn from one of Kerbins moons--This is an absolute must.

This is also the place where the landers would dock, so a multi-docking port would need to be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe artificial gravity chamber is where the crew would spend most of it\u0027s time. It would consist of two arms, containing Hitchhiker cans, constantly spinning to simulate Kerbin-like gravity. It would, of course, be locked down during major operations such as burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thrusters would consist of several jumbo orange tanks attached to nuclear engines. This stage would do all major burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the landers, there would be three, one for worlds with atmosphere, one for worlds without atmosphere, and one for Tylo and Eve, which are special cases. They all would use a two man lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are currently searching for a supplier of rotating parts for the artificial gravity chamber. B9 Aerospace has been considered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe use of the MechJeb autopilot is a tossup. On one hand, it makes many operations easier. On the other hand, it is not infallible.
