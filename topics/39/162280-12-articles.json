Edgas was showered with attention and national gratitude, became an overnight celebrity here. For his tireless as selfless work to return the memory of little Tatiana to the Motherland,\u201D she gave a little roll of her eyes, \u201Che became the first foreigner ever named as Hero of the Ussari Union.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut...\u201D Valentina now raised an eye... bulge, \u201Cwhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey thought if they dazzled me with boloney I\u2019d go away happy and not look any closer at what I had,\u201D Edgas added his own eye roll.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, so \u003Cem\u003Eunfortunate\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0about the poor girl, murdered in such a dangerous place by a miscreant, and the crime never solved by the simple foreign police.

But for a time, he did go away,\u201D Dibella gave Edgas a nod, \u201Cwhile this new wave of national pride swept the country, and people forgot all about their silly ideas of reform. And just as that wave started to ebb, a new opportunity presented itself to the Imperium, and once again they borrowed strategy from the Foreigners.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA rocket launch, a very \u003Cem\u003Eimportant\u003C/em\u003E, televised, mandatory-viewing rocket launch, suffered a \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57438-catastrophicfailure/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257438\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57438-catastrophicfailure/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@CatastrophicFailure\u003C/a\u003E. The crew were saved by their abort rockets, but some very \u003Cem\u003Eexpensive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0hardware for a new M\u00FCnar orbital station was lost, all due to a defective liquid hydrogen pipe that had been manufactured in Gytep. Upon further inspection, the entire lot was found to have critical flaws. The Imperium used the incident as a pretext to annex the entire country.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D Valentina scoffed, \u201Cjust... just like that?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey thought they could keep riding that wave of patriotism and distraction, and spur it even further. This, of course, led to some... tense moments with the rest of the world, but the Gytepi themselves were oddly patient about the whole thing,\u201D Dibella gave Edgas a look, \u201Cbut not even a deluge like that could extinguish the spark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CForeign media, smart phones, the global computer network... it was becoming ever more pervasive, ever more impossible for the Imperium to control. When the flames rose again, it was not merely protests in the streets but mass demonstrations. Technology allowed huge numbers of people to gather in an instant, then disappear into the cities just as quickly when the authorities showed up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Imperium was becoming desperate, so they doubled down on what had worked so well so far. They created some nonsense about Ussari \u003Cem\u003Epeacekeepers\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0taking fire from South Erakonia across the Demilitarized Zone, and used it as a pretext to launch a full-scale military invasion of the old,\u201D Dibella rolled her eyes, \u201Crebel province.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina just stared, \u201Cwhy would they do a fool thing like that? \u003Cem\u003EEveryone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0knows what happened the last time...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella nodded, \u201Cthe South Erakonians had not forgotten, either. And they had been quite busy the last couple of decades. The Glorious Crimson Army, Ever Victorious!.. advanced quickly, up to a point. And then the attacks would come from the \u003Cem\u003Erear\u003C/em\u003E, the sides, the middle... everywhere at once, leaving the army nowhere to go but \u003Cem\u003Eforward\u003C/em\u003E, then the attackers would just seem disappear into thin air. This went on for weeks, \u003Cem\u003Eofficial media\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0always reporting the vast gains of our glorious forces, while the true toll trickled in in bits and bytes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt wasn\u2019t until an entire division was engaged deep within the country that the South Erakonians began to fight for real. The Crimson Army continued to advance, but they paid a dear price for every meter they took, leaving nothing but ruins behind to occupy. They won every skirmish, yet still seemed to be losing the conflict. Then a new rash of attacks began: far behind the front, on the Army\u2019s supply lines back in \u003Cem\u003ENorth\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Erakonia.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe North had finally tired of watching the Imperium\u2019s treatment of their southern cousins. And with their open resistance, the world beyond finally tired of the situation as well. Aid began to pour in to the peninsula, first through third parties and then by flagged vessels: food, medicine, eventually even munitions. It all culminated in a bold maneuver by the same group of nations signed to the KSA treaty. They granted diplomatic recognition to the new Republic of Erakonia. A single, sovereign, unified nation... which the Ussari Union was now occupying in violation of established international law.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina seemed to be processing several steps behind, but pressed on none the less, \u201Cthat... could not have gone over well...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt didn\u2019t. It made the tension over the Gytep situation seem like a minor trade dispute. For two days, the entire world seemed on the brink of an unprecedented global war,\u201D Dibella smiled, \u201Cbut in the end, it was the Imperium who blinked first. They granted Erakonia its independence, and agreed to withdraw their troops. Many of whom flatly refused, deserting in the night and pleading asylum from the very same people they had been fighting with days before. The rumors had already started by then, you see, that the returning troops would be deployed across the Union to pacify the spreading unrest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe smirked at Edgas, \u201Cand then \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0guy shows up again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas jerked as if surprised, \u201Cer, yeah... it took me longer, but I\u2019d uncovered something... important, buried in all those files.

Something \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E, as physical as the press of his hand against hers.

The project was likely going on in the shadows for years, passed along from father to son to brother.

Too many people, too much land... the infected who survived have gathered into a massive hoard moving down the peninsula and west into Autmalaga. But the summer has not been kind in the south, either, only instead of snow they\u2019ve had torrential rains. That isthmus is a swamp even in the dry season, now it is an impassable quagmire.

Ahead of that wall, they are flooding the marshes with crude propelluim to be set alight at a moment\u2019s notice, and behind it, every rifle for a thousand kilometers is pointed east.

They are slowed, not stopped,\u201D her eyes flicked up, \u201Cthe wall will not hold either. Maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks, but there are just too \u003Cem\u003Emany\u003C/em\u003E, and all it takes is \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0getting behind the line to leapfrog it.

Every one of them with one of those \u003Cem\u003Ethings\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in their hand, walking around as if any other day.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy do they do nothing?

Ripples of that are being felt all across the south, and that\u2019s before the environmental and economic damage is considered: crops failing, fishing grounds ruined, people\u2019s livelihoods destroyed. Conservative estimates say\u2014\u201C she choked, cleared her throat, \u201Csay the death toll could eventually reach... two billion people.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas crumpled a bit more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina spat a curse, \u201Cthat is a \u003Cem\u003Ethird\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of all the people in the world!\u201D She spun back to the window, \u201Chow are they not...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt... may not be so bad,\u201D Dibella said with that same half-cheerful diplomat\u2019s tone, \u201Cif the nations of the world can work together, present a unified front as the southerners are doing...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut they aren\u2019t, are they?\u201D Valentina stared at her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella dropped her eyes, \u201Cno. We... we are in a better position than most to weather whatever comes. The Ussari-speaking nations of the former Union. We have good cropland along the southern coasts, minerals and fuels in the west, the \u00A0technology corridors radiating from Gytep in the east. Plans are being accelerated to form a trade federation to ease the transit of goods...\u201D she shook her head, \u201Cbut the borders beyond are already closed, and nothing is being exported. The other nations of the world are taking similar... and sometimes more... drastic measures.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared off at the throngs of people, for a moment longing for the blissful ignorance she had so recently enjoyed. Then, she didn\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0what she didn\u2019t know, but now, as memories fought one another for attention in her mind, she didn\u2019t even know what she \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0know.

Okay,\u201D Valentina nodded, and tried again to dislodge the lump from her throat. The \u003Cem\u003Erational\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0part of her said she shouldn\u2019t be concerned, she was an experienced test pilot, after all, and no stranger to high speeds. Even at low altitude and controlled by an autopilot. But the \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E rational part of her was simply running around in a big circle, waving its hands over its head and screaming.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for the moment it seemed to be making the more convincing argument.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo she turned, and stared out the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0window, which didn\u2019t really seem to help. Something \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0shot past them in a blur, but all that she could say for sure about it was that it was \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERED!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.

Apart from the freeway they were on, separated from it by a very stout-looking wall of metal lattice that was \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0whipping past at incredible speed, was another ribbon of concrete. Here there were... her mind struggled to construct the thought... double-high shipping containers mounted on little more than what appeared to be low-slung wheeled dollies. That much didn\u2019t seem to be \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unusual, but there were dozens, even \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of them, all rushing along in an unbroken line, and there seemed to be no accommodation for a driver \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Anywhere. And worse, each dolly was bare \u003Cem\u003Ecentimeters\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0from the one ahead, almost like a train only \u003Cem\u003Ecloser\u003C/em\u003E, but then... one unit broke out of formation, the others moving up seamlessly to assume the space it left, and took a long, sweeping, highly banked off-ramp toward a collection of low buildings in the distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they were \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0moving faster than the kar.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight on cue, it once more slid out and around some slowpoke who was \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0doing 180 or so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina pulled her eyes away from the window, squeezing them shut and finally managing to swallow that lump in her throat. Dibella had \u003Cem\u003Etried\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to explain it all, something about \u2018why-fie\u2019 and a \u2018star-link\u2019 and... well, there might have been yak in there somewhere... or was it a musk ox? It was all \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0confusing, and about that time that little part of herself had gone from keening to groaning, working its way toward screaming, and everything else got just a bit... fuzzy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight about now, that part of her had curled itself up in a ball in the corner, and was running a finger over its lips making little \u2018\u003Cem\u003Ebibble-bibble-bibble\u003C/em\u003E\u2019 sounds, and she desperately wanted to just curl up next to it and have a good \u003Cem\u003Ebibble\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0herself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppressing a groan, she shifted in her seat, and her seat seemed to shift right along with her. Somehow, it felt like it had been custom-made for her particular posterior, and any time she moved, it moved right along with her, as if it had been made that way all along.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina forced her eyes open, letting them run over the interior, trying to find a distraction. Anything that wasn\u2019t buttery-soft leather was wood polished to a mirror shine, here and there touched with accents of gold and brushed steel. The lighting seemed to come from nowhere in particular, just sort of... leaking out from behind various panels in an oddly pleasing way. The entire roof looked like a single sheet of curved glass, which grew just a hair darker any time the \u00A0sun threatened to come out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the whole thing was so \u003Cem\u003Equiet\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Silent, even. She couldn\u2019t hear a \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0from outside, no rushing wind, no roaring engine, there wasn\u2019t even a \u003Cem\u003Ehint\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of vibration in the palatial interior. Another vehicle slipped behind them, the kar riding as if on a cloud. She was actually starting to wonder if it even \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0wheels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of such...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u2019s hand groped out along the rich Corinthian leather, \u201Cis... there really no seatbelt?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella stopped whatever she had been saying and blinked at her, \u201Coh, no, of course not, they haven\u2019t put seatbelts in kars for years, now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe groaned a little louder, \u201Cbut... what if there is accident?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, that never happens on the AutoWay,\u201D Dibella waved a hand, \u201Cnot since they added bigger barricades after some Luddite with an ICE dinosaur tried to force his way in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina raised a hand to her head, \u201Cwait, now there are giant frozen lizards too?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella looked at her, \u201Cer, what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas just laughed, \u201Cturn of phrase.

Like we discussed, hoods up, faces down, until we get inside. There are cameras everywhere around here and I do mean \u003Cem\u003Eeverywhere\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0and for \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0reason, too. You are not specifically breaking any rules by being here with me, but best if no one knows all the same. \u003Cem\u003E\u0414\u0419D\u00A0\u042F\u0404M\u0404M\u042C\u0404\u042F, SP\u0417\u0414K\u00A0\u0424\u0419L\u04B0\u00A0\u0426SS\u0414\u042FI\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe glanced at Edgas, \u201Cwait, does he still sound like he has marbles in his mouth?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRocks, yes,\u201D Valentina giggled. Edgas scowled at them both.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmm, rocks... \u003Cem\u003Eyes\u003C/em\u003E,\u201D Dibella mused with a hand to her chin, \u201Call right, on second thought, say nothing. Let me do all the talking. Alexa, limo tint please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLimo tint applied,\u201D the cheery voice said, as the windows darkened until they were nearly opaque. Dibella pressed a button, and her seat shifted and revolved until it was finally facing the \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0way. \u201CConfirm self-drive.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have the wheel,\u201D said Dibella, and there was the slightest little shuffle as she began to steer. The kar slipped down a long, deserted road flanked by open fields where nothing seemed to be growing at all, gradually slowing to a more reasonable speed. In fact, there seemed to be nothing anywhere, in \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually they came to an unremarkable-looking fence, chain link topped with razor wire. Sturdy, but not unusual. There was no guard post that Valentina could see, only a lonely gate across the road. They slowed as they approached, the gate rattled open on its own, and that was that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had just slipped out of view behind them, when the \u003Cem\u003Enext\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fence appeared on the horizon. This one was... far more significant. A good ten meters tall, at least, with rows of steel I-beams jutting up from the ground at an angle all along the base, and more coils of razor wire above. As they neared, she could see there were actually two fences, one just beyond the other. They approached the first, another, much heavier gate sliding open, and stopped in the space between. That gate slid closed, and the far one opened, like some kind of highly inefficient airlock. \u003Cem\u003EQuite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0imposing, but still... where were the guards?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter, where was the \u003Cem\u003Eprison?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Surely such a thing was not easily\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ground ahead suddenly dropped away, and there it was. The entire facility had been built in a deep circular depression in the land, almost like a crater on the M\u00FCn, hiding it from view until nearly inside. There was one more fence, this one more a wall, made from a lattice of centimeter-thick metal wire. From the color, it almost looked like \u003Cem\u003Etitanium\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0All along the base here was a structure that looked a bit like the cow catcher on the front of a train, stretched to ridiculous proportions. And here, too, were there finally guards, looking down from high watchtowers. As they approached, Valentina couldn\u2019t help but think the whole mess could even stop a tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thought likely not lost on whoever built the place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small squad of guards patrolled before a pair of solid, towering gates, festooned with signs extolling all the reasons why one should \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0want to be here. The guards themselves looked more like soldiers, clad in thick helmets and heavy flak vests.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas peered up at the doors, and the little lightning-bolt emblems there and on the fence, \u201Cwhat\u2019re they keeping in there, King Kong?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOld images flashed from her memory, trying to form a thought in Valentina\u2019s head, something about a tyrant lizard king, \u201Cworse. The Imperium.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHush,\u201D Dibella said, rolling down her window. The guard who approached had eyes every bit as hard and cold as stone, eyes that had \u003Cem\u003Eseen\u003C/em\u003E, and the casual, almost disinterested way he slung his rifle declared this was no bumbling sentry from the decommissioned Fortress wall. He eyed Dibella, eyed the kar, then presented her a tablet. She waved her phone over it, looked at it intently, then pressed her hand to the screen for a moment. The only acknowledgement the guard gave was a curt nod, and with a bare flick of his eyes, others opened the massive gates.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce inside them, there didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere to actually \u003Cem\u003Ego\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0only the edge of the cavity looming ahead. Dibella pulled the nose of the car up to a railing straight ahead, then just as Valentina and Edgas were sharing a confused look, she felt her stomach drop.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the whole \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was dropping. They were parked on a broad elevator platform descending at at a surprising speed for something so large. Valentina had wondered if the depression was an \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E crater, but now it was clear that was not the case. Sheer walls of dull grey concrete rose all around the periphery.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Imperium... is in there?\u201D She gawked at the spotlights and menacing buildings beyond. Tyrant kings, indeed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Dibella said, \u201Cthey were to be tried in an international court for crimes against Kermanity, and would likely have faced execution. But not a one of them made it that far,\u201D she met Valentina\u2019s eyes in the mirror, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Eaccidents,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you see. Here, are the underlings. The cogs that made the brutal machine work. Them, and worse.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow...\u201D Valentina still struggled to wrap her mind around what she was seeing, \u201Chow did they build such a thing so quickly?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey didn\u2019t, it\u2019s been here for over twenty years.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?\u201D She slumped back into her seat, \u201Cbut... we are not far from the Space Center, I... I \u003Cem\u003Elived\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0here, I must have flown over this place many times a month, there was no...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know how good they were at keeping secrets,\u201D Dibella said, \u201Cthis was a place for people they wanted forgotten, and now, I suppose, it is not so different.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe platform landed with a \u003Cem\u003Ethud\u003C/em\u003E, the railings continuing to sink into the ground. The kar hummed off, passing rows of buildings like dark sentinels. Each one was built at an eye-watering angle, seeming to loom outward. Grids of deeper shadows speckling the downcast facades indicated windows, and Valentina realized, that between that and the outer walls, whoever designed this place sought to deny those condemned within even a glimpse of open sky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length they came to a more \u003Cem\u003Enormal\u003C/em\u003E-looking building, if the austere and uninspired Imperious architecture could ever be considered normal, separated by its own set of fences and gates. Just across from it was an ancient-looking, overgrown graveyard. The kar glided into a space, and Valentina took to blankly staring at the door, wondering how in \u003Cem\u003EST\u0414LI\u0419S\u00A0ST\u0414C\u04A2\u0404\u003C/em\u003E one actually \u003Cem\u003Eopened\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUm, er... here, let me...\u201D Edgas leaned across her, what little she could of see of his face going quite red, and touched an unremarkable-looking patch of remarkably finished wood. Then with a muffled \u003Cem\u003Eclunk\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and soft whir of motors, the door slid upward, folding in on itself in a \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remarkable feat of mechanical origami. She stepped out...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...And immediately cinched the hood of her sweatshirt a bit tighter. An icy breeze pulled at her as it marauded its way around a wall, despite the entire place\u2019s sheltered location. She looked over at Edgas, tugging on his own coat. Yes, he seemed to be handling things \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0well, considering...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut perhaps, only \u003Cem\u003Eseemed\u003C/em\u003E... While the back of her own mind flip-flopped over itself trying to make sense of the last few hours, cut off from and only distantly watched by her conscious mind in that unique way of pilots, Edgas didn\u2019t seem to be... processing at all. She could \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the weight pressing down on him, but\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flash above caught her eye. Trying to look up without actually \u003Cem\u003Elooking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0up, she thought for a moment a large building was falling out of the sky with one end on fire. Her eyes tracked it down the concrete canyon as it slipped in and out of the clouds above, before disappearing beyond the edge of the crater.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat much, at least, she \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0understood, if she scarcely believed it. Dibella had explained the new economy rapidly taking shape across the wold... and far beyond it. The very craft she had once been sent to destroy had been repurposed to become the vanguard of a different sort of revolution. The same engine, copied, refined, \u003Cem\u003Eevolved\u003C/em\u003E, had opened the gates to the solar system, and to coin a silly Foreigner phrase, there was gold in them thar hills.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd not \u003Cem\u003Emerely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0gold. Platinum, titanium, and iridium. Iron and nickel and copper. Wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, and all the materials to build new worlds. While scientists had salivated over access to the planets, entrepreneurs had made straight for very different sirens. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, enormous tugs were constructed entirely in orbit. They were then pulled to the M\u00FCn, where their impossibly powerful nuclear reactors could be built and installed over less... sensitive environs. Finally, they made their way to Minmus to be fueled and provisioned from refined ice before heading out into deep space, where a dragon\u2019s hoard of treasure awaited.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe odd Kerbin-crosser at first, then the main belt where legend told of a place called Dres, and eventually even ancient Joolian Trojans became fair game, plucked from the heavens like the very Fruit of Life and returned to Kerbin and her moons to be smelted into the raw materials that drove the engines of this new industry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, asteroids made the world go round, and all the minutiae of tankers, colonies, crew shuttles, bureaucrats, and everything else such an endeavor demanded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven industry itself was\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTia?\u201D Dibella touched her arm, \u201Care you alright? You look a bit, well, spacey...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina shook herself, looking around. Perhaps her mind wasn\u2019t... \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0as well controlled as she thought.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe should get inside,\u201D said Dibella, motioning toward the doors, this is no place to linger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EInside\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seemed like no place to linger, either. As soon as she walked in, Valentina was hit by the stench of decades of rattail smoke, so thick and heavy that for a moment she thought she had simply walked into a wall. The actual walls were no more inviting, covered in peeling paint and set with deep gouges that left piles of grit on the floor, as if the walls themselves were slowly trying to escape one pocketful at a time. The ailing fluorescent overhead buzzed at its own misery, and the Head Nurse who came to greet them had all the charm and bedside manner of a colicky wolverine. She led them through a creaking set of doors to a flight of rusty wrought-iron stairs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHave you come to dangle a pardon in front of his face, now that he\u2019s on his deathbed?\u201D she huffed as they went, pausing often just to breathe, \u201Cthe Warden sometimes does that with the others, is good fun.\u201D She followed with a long, raspy cackle. Or perhaps she was just choking on her own tongue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEr... no,\u201D Dibella kept her voice diplomatically... diplomatic, \u201CI am here as a... favor to an old colleague. State business, you understand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, of \u003Cem\u003Ecoarse!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D she probably meant \u003Cem\u003Ecourse\u003C/em\u003E, but everything about this kerbelle seemed... coarse, \u201Cno shortage of \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0around here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt length they reached the top, Valentina growing concerned someone was going to have to \u003Cem\u003Ecarry\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the Head Nurse if the climb continued much longer. Down this hall, either the paint had entirely peeled away or no one had ever bothered to paint it in the first place. The floors were covered in an assortment of grunge a scientist like Edgas would probably find \u003Cem\u003Efascinating\u003C/em\u003E, while the concrete walls appeared to have been scrubbed exactly \u003Cem\u003Eonce\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in their sad existence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nurse pushed through a door that positively \u003Cem\u003Escreamed\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0into a long gallery lined with surprisingly high windows. Before each one was a bed or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003Ecot\u003C/abbr\u003E, some with machines beeping away, the occasional raspy cough the only other sound breaking the sepulchral stillness. Valentina tugged her sweatshirt closer against the chill in the air.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s over there in number three, it\u2019s the drafty one,\u201D the nurse smiled, or at least bared her stained teeth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, thank you,\u201D Dibella eyed her, \u201Cer, a bit if privacy, if you please? State business and all...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, yes, of course,\u201D another hacking cackle, \u201Cnot like any of these other \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419SKIS\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are going to go telling secrets.\u201D She fished a rattail out of her blouse then leaned up against the wall beside the door and proceeded to puff away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina frowned at her, but made her way towards the designated bed. Which... appeared to be unoccupied. Had they perhaps moved \u003Cem\u003Ehim?\u003C/em\u003E There were no machines, and the bed was empty save for some rumpled\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand drew slowly to her mouth. The Kommissar was a mountain of a kerb, hewn from the very rock itself, awesome and terrifying with piercing eyes that bored into one\u2019s soul.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe creature lying here was hardly recognizable as even a Kerbal. Little more than a skull devoid of any trace of hair, with skin like thin parchment stretched across the bone. Breath came in thin, rattly gasps, barely moving the filthy sheet above its hollow chest. She approached with a fear unlike any she had felt before, as if the mere disturbance of the air by her movement might cause this pitiful thing, little more than a corpse, to crumble into dust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then... its eyes flicked open, drilling into her and removing all doubt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CComrade Kommissar...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo her further surprise, his dry, cracked lips split into a wide, humorless smile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou live.
