I thought that I should share them with the community, as I have not as of yet seen any ARM-specific flags or emblems for such a purpose. The first of the two images is the emblem for a mission - a graphic that I designed with the purpose of looking good on the various parts of a craft that allow the flag to be put on them (such as the SLS parts and the 3-crew module). The second image is the full flag for the purpose of planting one. This is less likely to be used, but may be planted where an asteroid has been safely landed on a body or for general use in any mission, if you so wish to use it in that way. Feel free to save the images and use them in your copy of Kerbal Space Program. A link to a Spaceport upload will be available when I am confident that the images are near-complete or entirely complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still have a file that is ready to be tweaked to almost any detail with relative ease, so if you have any suggestions for improvement or want some personalisation for your flag, let me know in the replies. The images themselves may be updated without notice or suggestion if I see potential for improvement. More images may be added to this thread if I decide to make more. You may request a flag to be made by me if you so wish, but I may not be able to get through any for four weeks or so due to work. I\u0027d be happy to make some graphics for people though. More detail about this will be posted in a blog in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA download for the graphics will be available when I\u0027m confident that they are complete.

I am not entirely happy with how they\u0027ve turned out, but I can\u0027t seem to correct what\u0027s wrong with them. If anyone can shed some light on how I can improve them, please do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
