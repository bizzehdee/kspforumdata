I\u0027m starting what I hope will become a long term writing project. It will combine elements of loosely strung together mission reports with a look into the internals of (my) Kerbal Space Program. I should stress up front that I will take a lot of liberties with the characters/places/history/machines of KSP in order to create what I hope is a compelling narrative. So if any parts of this story disagree with accepted knowledge of the Kerbal universe just remember I\u0027m creating things as I go along in order to work out a narrative, I am not trying to propose that any of what I write is cannon. Ok with that out of the way let me begin. I\u0027d love to hear feedback so feel free to share. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 1, Part 1: Vertigo \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStuck, the hatch was stuck. Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mind was racing; \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be stuck\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he thought to himself. After a second try with no success Jeb determined that the cockpit hatch was definitely stuck. Jeb gave a quick glance over his shoulder to the reporters waiting for him to board the KX-1. Sure enough they were still there, anxiously waiting for Jeb to climb aboard the craft, cameras eagerly snapping pictures of Jeb poised/stuck upon the hatch of his rocket plane. Jeb couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t stand reporters. Jeb didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mind that the glorified missile he was about to climb into had a 25 percent chance of killing him instantly, in fact he reveled in it. What Jeb did mind was that if something went wrong it would be captured on film for the entire world to see. He could just read the headlines now; \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Jebediah Kerman Bumbles Flight Losing Million Dollar Aircraft. . . . and Life\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2. Jeb realized that his mind was drifting off and snapped himself back into reality. He needed to get the hatch open and get into that plane because there was only one thing on Kerbin he hated more than reporters; ladders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WpBoh9f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WpBoh9f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELadders, Jebediah Kerman\u0027s one true weakness. Not that anyone but Jeb knew this, he had always been careful to hide his anxiety on and around ladders from others. Despite his best efforts though, his nerves were beginning to wear thin. He tried the cockpit hatch again and again nothing. His palms were beginning to sweat and he could sense the vertigo coming on. For a split second he glanced down and the 5 foot drop to the ground might as well have been 5 miles, he began to feel faint. Jeb knew he had to act fast less he faint in front of an assembly of international reporters. Summoning what was left of his composure he grabbed the hatch handle and pulled with all his might. With a metallic clang the hatch finally gave way. Jeb enjoyed a split second of relief before realizing that the exertion had thrown him of balance and he was beginning to fall backward off the ladder. In one panicked instinctual motion Jeb flung himself forward back toward the cockpit and scrambled inside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally inside the cockpit Jeb allowed himself a few brief seconds to recover from the terror on the ladder. He shut his eyes lightly and breathed as smoothly as he could. He allowed his torso to sink into the seat which had been custom molded to fit him perfectly. His hands came to rest on the controls which, despite his eyes being shut, he instantly recognized as he had helped develop them. In fact Jeb had had a hand in the development of the entire KX-1, the ship was almost an extension of his very soul. Jeb relaxed further and allowed himself to become one with the ship, his mind folding into every seam and rivet. Sealed inside the cockpit of his ship, away from the insanity of reporters and ladders, Jeb was truly at home, truly alive. Jeb\u0027s quiet moment of meditation was broken by the electrical hiss of the comms line opening up \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGround control to Maj.

Jeb was slammed back into his seat by nearly four times the force of gravity as the 215 kN of thrust of the LV-T30 Engine suddenly and violently roared to life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qcf52uN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qcf52uN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KX-1 was slingshot down the runaway, accelerating to 70 m/s in only a few short seconds. Inside the cockpit was chaos, and Jebediah Kerman was born for chaos. The structure of the KX-1 groaned under the twin forces of thrust and aerodynamic lift. Vibrations shook every bit of the craft and made reading the instruments nearly impossible. The roar of the rocket engine was deafening, though not deafening enough to drown out the comms link to flight control. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDamnit Jeb we haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t finished the pre-flight checks yet!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Flight control sounded fairly angry, Jeb couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t understand why. All it was with them was checks, checks and double checks. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d spend hours pouring over boring lists just to make sure that in the all too likely scenario that this flight happened to be Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s last, blame for the failure could be passed along the work chain; Engineers, contractors, technicians, the damn President, anyone else to foot the blame except flight control. Today however, Jeb wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t in the waiting mood and decided to go ahead with the flight after completing his own extensive checklist: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Plane on runway? Check. Jeb in plane? Check. All systems go.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 And while this rigorous check was enough for Jeb it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to sit well with flight control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cWYi7Rq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cWYi7Rq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb decided to offer them a few words of comfort , \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRelax boys if there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s anything wrong with this bucket of bolts we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find out during flight.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Flight control responded instantly with a fury rivaled only by the rocket strapped to Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s back \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s why we do a pre-flight check you idiot! Your going to get yourself killed!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb reflected on flight control\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s words for a moment before remembering that he didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care. Also he needed to lift off the runway immediately since the KX-1 was beginning to travel across the tarmac at speeds well beyond those rated for its tiny landing gear. Jeb allowed himself a split second to answer back flight control with a snarky \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 before returning to the business of getting the KX-1 off the ground. Jeb fought against the crushing acceleration as well as the vibrations to bring the stick back as gently as he could. If he brought the nose up too suddenly he risked striking the nozzle of the rocket engine against the runway and turning both himself and the plane into confetti. With his trademark skill and determination Jeb eased the nose of the KX-1 a few degrees upward until the plane\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s stubby wings eventually caught enough lift and were hurtled skyward, mercifully taking the rest of the KX-1 with them. With the KX-1 now off the runway Jeb decided it was time to put the plane through its paces. With an almost euphoric delight Jeb heaved back on the control stick to point the plane\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nose further skyward. However, in his excitement, he failed to take the KX-1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fully fueled weight distribution into account. Before he could react the nose of the plane slipped away from his control and began to climb. Jeb tried his best to compensate but the plane was out of his control. 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 55\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, 65\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 the nose of the KX-1 pointed higher and higher while the planes center of mass continued along a shallower path. Jeb knew he only had a split second before the craft entered a spin. In his headset Jeb could hear the folks at flight control beginning to panic \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2Your angle of attack is too steep Jeb, you\u0027re going to lose control!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb, however, was not fazed. In fact, these moments of near disaster were the moments he lived, and potentially died, for. As he and his plane skidded toward a fiery doom Jeb soothed flight control\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s panicked pleas with a cool almost happy response, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRelax I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a plan.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Flight control was not soothed, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat do you mean you have a plan!?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 With a devious smile forming at the edge of his lips Jeb responded with the poise and confidence of a Kerbal that had decided long ago that he was invincible, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m gonna roll it.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T01:14:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jigglypuffdaddy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T02:01:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this story, it\u0027s good so far.\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EOne or two sentences are a bit clumsy, but that happens to everyone.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReminds me of the time I had Jeb crawl down about 50 meters of ladder during my Cannon experiments.
