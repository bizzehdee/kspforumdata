His 5\u0027 7\u0022 body could barely fit in the machine made for 3 feet \u0022Kerbals.\u0022 On the left side of the chopper, the sergeant held onto a bar while the wind billowed his clothing. The other soldier, who appeared to be a private, sat next to him looking out the right window, his arm resting on a heavy machine gun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl glanced out the right window and saw a large building of about 30 stories high\u00A0below the helicopter. The sergeant who was in the doorframe was now leaning over the side, waving his open hand in a circle motion. As the aircraft slowly descended onto a helipad, Darryl met the gaze of a human being. The first he had seen so far. The gentleman looked about six feet tall, and he had slick brown hair. In one hand he held a notepad, in the other a two-way-radio. The helicopter blades powered down and the man approached Darryl.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sergeant, what did this man do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sergeant saluted the well-dressed man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We found him spying on the wreck of the Osprey II, sir.

As it slowly began moving downwards, Darryl was amazed to find a rocket standing in a large pit being worked on by an army of workers and engineers. Astounded, his jaw dropped in amazement. It was a larger vehicle than anything ever made by humans. It was a 7 stage craft, with 8 boosters surrounding the main stage, with a large lander nestled on top. As the duo passed through the 21st floor, a large section of fairing was bolted to the top of the spacecraft. The sound of welding, hammers, and bolt drills filled the air, which smelled like grease and fuel. As both arrived on the first floor, which was marked with a large sign saying:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDanger!

Leading Darryl to a small rack, he handed him a yellow hardhat with a badge on the side. It looked just like the NASA symbol, but with the words KASA. Putting it on, he followed Jack near the large rocket while explaining what was happening around him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is our newest rocket. The Orion IV. Capable of travel up to the planet Eve. Massive thrust with a crew capacity of 4. Hopefully it will launch us to the heavens.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait a second.

Also on the desk were human movie cassettes, possibly recovered from other people who had entered this universe with it on their person.

He would never see his family again, never do anything of human nature again. He was stuck on this \u0022Kerbin\u0022 with some green beings and one other human. He slumped over on the desk and began drifting into sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same second, a small\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etap tap \u003C/em\u003Eon his door woke him.

First...Guess how old I am.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl surveyed the man.

Darryl liked the sound of no age, but without other humans, who would help keep his sanity? \u0022Well, how have you stayed alive without other humans? I mean, maybe Kerbals are like us in some way, but without human interaction, you\u0027d go crazy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There are human settlements here. The current human population on Kerbin is around 10,000.

As he rubbed his eyes and surveyed the books and materials\u00A0he had laid out the night before, strewn this way and that. A pen lay nearby, used to write furiously and take notes. The blue ink showed all over the pages, with notes about everything imaginable scrawled all over the paper, some quite deep, obviously written with anger.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSighing, Darryl slowly strolled over to his door, where he very quietly and carefully opened it. The hallway was quiet and the constant din of the A/C system made an almost soothing sound as the tired man put his bare feet onto the cold linoleum floor. Adjusting to the temperature, Darryl checked his watch.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00224:50 AM. I wonder how many people...\u003Cem\u003EKerbals\u003C/em\u003E...Are awake right now.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nDarryl continued down the hallway, until he reached a small stairwell. Also descending this, he found himself on the main floor of the Astronaut Complex. He was surprised to find a relatively large group of kerbonauts wearing tee-shirts and sweat pants playing pool and reading in the lounge. Darryl shuffled in amidst strange looks from the Kerbals, and poured himself a cup of coffee.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSitting down at one of the circular tables, he slowly sipped his tea and watched the game of billiards. As his coffee cooled down, a slightly taller Kerbal entered the room and exchanged greetings with the others. Some saluted, others called him sir, and a handful slapped him on the back and called him Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSitting down across from Darryl, he opened the conversation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Is this seat taken?

The one I was the closest to. Her name was Valentina. She was killed last month on a routine commercial flight. It crashed in the mountains. There was no way anyone could have survived.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl squeezed his hands together, trying to think of a response.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry to hear that. How old was she?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Heh. Well, in your years, she was 90. In our years she was 26. She certainly didn\u0027t look 90 according to the many humans who met her.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl smiled gently, but sat in silence, as the two of them avoided eye contact. The two men didn\u0027t know what to ay after that, so as Jeb read his newspaper and the other drank his coffee, they didn\u0027t speak, but when Jeb was done, he got up, smiled heartily, and bid goodbye to Darryl, promising that they would see each-other around. As Darryl finished his coffee and left the table, the other kerbals began saying hello as he left. Apparently Jebediah starting the greetings showed the other ones that he was a good guy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrinning all the way back to his suite, Darryl opened his door with happiness, and changed into his newly issued official \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Uniform. Jack had told him that in order to get in and out of various buildings, he would need the outfit and a badge, the latter of which was given to him after he had talked to Jeb by the desk assistant at the Astronaut Complex.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl brushed his hair, straightened his suit, and left once again, this time to visit the administration building, where he would be given important things to make his life on Kerbin easier.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJack met him at the small office, and they both went in. There at the front desk was the second human Darryl had met while on Kerbin, a 50 year old woman who looked 22. She greeted Jack first.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Hey Jack! Is this the newcomer?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey Stacey. Yeah, this is Darryl Whitman. He arrived through the rift yesterday. I thought you could hook him up with what I told you about.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe beamed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0027Of course! Come with me, Mr. Whitman.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl was led through a double door and into a colder room which looked like a small warehouse. Looking at the large shelves, he saw many items, some he recognized. On a peg board sat many different kinds of keys; on a shelf lay sleeping bags, neatly rolled and stacked; and on yet another were cans and cans of food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mr. Whitman, this is the National Kerbal State\u0027s Human Recourses distribution center number 32. Here you can find human food that we\u0027ve genetically modified from things here on Kerbin, other food that has come in through the\u00A0rift, sleeping materials, clothing for humans, car keys, house keys, you name it. You can take most things freely on a food-stamp until you get a job at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or elsewhere, and then you can buy it from us for a small price. You can start by picking some new clothes, an extra key for your suite, a Kerbin-City public transport key, (trust me, you\u0027ll want it,) and some food. Everything else will cost you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl began choosing some new clothing, starting with some jeans and slightly small tee-shirt, as well as some socks and a few slacks. He grabbed quite a few microwave meals, and then some MREs. He also took a transport key, but as he glanced at the board with all the car keys, he inquired what it\u00A0was for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That board, Mr. Darryl; is filled with care keys for the various golf-carts around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

And, if you happen to have any bank receipts in your pocket, we can transfer those to funds as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl quickly opened his wallet and flipped through it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Um.. I have $84 exactly\u00A0in cash, roughly 300 dollars on this visa card, and...\u0022 As Darryl struggled to remove a card which was stained with blood, he ripped it out of the wallet. \u0022And a bank receipt for my current savings account, with $2,405 in it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStacey took all the money and went to the back of the building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturning a few moments later, she handed him a stack of paper money, which resembled American cash except for the fact that it had Kerbals on it, and the paper was stained a faint but deep red color.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Mr. Whitman, you have \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:funds:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/Funds.png\u0022 title=\u0022:funds:\u0022\u003E4,978. I would recommend finding a job before doing anything with that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanking Stacey, Darryl left the building with his new items and strolled back to the Astronaut Complex. A stiff breeze had picked up by the time he returned, and the flag in front of the building was fluttering, and various small pieces of trash in the parking lot began to blow everywhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Darryl settled in his bed for a nap, he realized that Jack had still not explained the \u0027rift.\u0027\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\noh well.

They hopped in a little utility-cart.\u00A0Going nowhere in particular, the pair drove around. It was a funny sight to see; A three foot tall almost dwarfish Kerbal driving an almost six foot tall human in a cart made for Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So Darryl, here\u0027s the Space Plane Hanger, where we build aircraft. It\u0027s my favorite building here, because it\u0027s fun to watch in action. It\u0027s a fully operational airport too.\u0022 Hearing a low but loud droning, the two looked west to see a large four-engine turboprop transport making an approach to runway 09.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah yes, here comes our weekly arrival of more human goods. The Government collects human items, and then ships them to us in a Kerbus A400M. Today we\u0027re getting a shipment of food, mostly canned goods, as they\u0027re the only actual human food we get. The other things we make by hand from genetic engineering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe very weighed down aircraft almost staggered in the air as it lumbered towards the ground. It touched down with difficulty with a small puff of smoke from the landing gear, and the sound of the engine got more high-pitched as the pilot jammed all four props into reverse thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the large machine hesitantly slowed to a crawl, the crew made a right turn and taxied onto the ramp in front of the hanger. Slowly but surely, the A400 finally came to a halt as ground officers ran to place wheel chocks and begin the un-loading process. Darryl watched for a few moments, and then turned to Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jebediah, I\u0027ve been here a few days, but Jack still hasn\u0027t told me what the \u0027rift\u0027 is. Could you explain it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stared at him and rubbed his chin.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Actually, I can\u0027t. I have no idea how it works. I can give you an overview if you want...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl nodded his head.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, this will be fairly long, but here goes. 10 years ago, the first human appeared. His name was Ralph Douglas, and he appeared in the middle of the desert. We only found him when one of our fighters spotted a message scrawled into the sand. He barely made it. Needless to say, it was all to waste. He couldn\u0027t live all alone, so he... Well... You know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl nodded.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, when he first came in, what was your first reaction?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pondered this for a moment and then answered:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Well, to be honest I didn\u0027t know what to think. When he arrived we treated him as a potential enemy, because we didn\u0027t know what \u0027humans\u0027 were at that point. I think that added to his depression and loneliness. All of our scientists couldn\u0027t explain it, and it wasn\u0027t until more began popping around that we realized this wasn\u0027t going to stop.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, has English always been your language? I mean, with no connection to the human world, how did you know what the dilect\u00A0was?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022One time an English professor came through and realized that\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eour\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Elanguage apparently sounds a lot like two languages on your planet, Russian and Spanish. He quickly decoded it and taught us English so it would be easier to communicate with new rift travelers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EIS\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethe rift?

When a human enters the rift they die in your universe. So on Earth, your first personality is actually dead and buried. Your second persona...\u003Cem\u003EYou\u003C/em\u003E...Is alive here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarryl just stared at jebediah with a blank expression.

The Woman inside it sat inside\u00A0nonchalantly, scrolling through her phone notifications, most from guys who had failed to court her in the past, and now were coming around for a second try. As she opened her social media account, a phone call came through, scaring her on the dimly-lit evening.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Hello? This is Juliet...What?

Finishing off her third beer, she tossed it into the passenger seat and continued to allow the phone to consume her on this rainy but very mellow night. In her car were various things, mostly alcohol and old drive-through meals. Juliet was a beautiful blonde, 5 feet 6 inches tall, with freckles and a thin body. Most people would call her perfect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot far away, in the wind and continuous rain, stood a man with a black umbrella watching Juliet\u0027s car. He was wearing a strange shirt, resembling that of a Nyan Cat. It was a 2D view of a cat wearing a jetpack, surrounded by a blue background of the stars. Standing with raindrops pouring down the side of his umbrella, he stared at the silver car, now made more reflective from all the water on the surface of the metal. Writing in a pad, (which was now soaked) the man struggled to get the ink to stay. Finally, after a audible \u0022humph,\u0022 the gentleman backed off into the darkness.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuliet however, put her car in drive and began rolling, unaware of how drunk she was. As she rounded the corner of the nearby intersection, she found herself face to face with a large truck slamming on it\u0027s horn and trying to skid to a stop. That was the last thing she saw.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing she saw, was a hot sun staring her in the eyes. Closing them quickly to avoid the burning, Juliet turned over to find herself on a beach next to a large ocean. The waves made a loud crashing sound, and various shorebirds ran across the sand, looking for grubs and small creatures. Long grass swayed in the gentle breeze on this beautiful sunny day. The blue of the sky was disrupted by various blots of white clouds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly sitting up, sand falling out of her clothes, Juliet stared out to sea. The water was choppy but looked good enough to swim in. She considered taking a dip, but figured it wouldn\u0027t be worth it at this moment. Glancing down, she realized she was still wearing the clothes that she had on before this happened. Checking her pocket, she realized her phone was still in her car. Looking behind her, she was alarmed to find the first half of her vehicle buried in the sand. From the hood to the back of the front seats was sitting, quite randomly, in the middle of a sand dune. The engine was smoking, and the entire front was crushed, like it had slammed into a brick wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuliet strolled to the car, now with flames licking out of the oil tank. She decided she HAD to get her phone, so she ran to the drivers side, covered her mouth with the sleeve of her jacket, and opened the door. Groping in the now blackened interior, she suddenly felt a smooth metal rectangle, and hauled it out of the center console. Jumping backwards, Juliet hacked as smoke filled her lungs. Throwing her arm on top of her chest, she lay down in the soft sand and stared into the sky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomford looked out of the window of his aircraft as it slowly lumbered over the desert.
