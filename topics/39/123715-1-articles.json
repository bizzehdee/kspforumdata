Cold as space. If it\u0027s pressurized, I can\u0027t tell from here. No lights, no attempt at signalling, nothing but that initial signal. Gravity detector goes nuts when I point it at the tail end, but nothing otherwise. Mag-res*** isn\u0027t giving me anything useful... the entire damn hull reads like it\u0027s got synapses integrated into it, so not helping.\u0022 Bill rattled off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb frowned. \u0022Anything potentially hazardous?
