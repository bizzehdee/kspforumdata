Landred, a gifted telescope-maker and Shelcott\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s good friend, had unpacked another one of his telescopes from the back of his truck. The grass was whispering in the light breeze and a few crickets had begun their steady rhythm under the rapidly darkening sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As Shelcott had swung his tiny telescope towards Eve, Landred had asked him, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow much can you see of, say, Jool with that thing?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Shelcott, momentarily startled, had jerked the telescope upwards. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKerbol Almighty!

You know that!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Satisfied with the focus, Shelcott had paused, and had looked up from the telescope straight into Landred\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s eyes. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat are you trying to get at?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Landred had taken a deep breath and said in a rush, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo what would happen if we got a telescope above the atmosphere of Kerbin?

A sprinkling of stars dusted the perimeter of his view. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou know, that would be a noble idea\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 if it were at all plausible.

If the government decides to direct funds to spaceflight, I would very much like to see the images that they could get. But what are the chances of that happening?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He had chuckled and raised his head from the eyepiece again. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSecond to none, I would say.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou never know,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Landred had said slowly, walking back to his massive telescope and slowly pointing it up towards the sky. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou never know.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E More stars were appearing by the second.
