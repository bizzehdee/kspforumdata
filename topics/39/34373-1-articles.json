Jeb whipped is hair and flashed a smile at one of the female Kerbal engineers.\u0022God\u0022,she muttered as she left the bridge.\u0022Jeb,enough of that I need you to pilot the rover to the surface of the plane\u0022,Bill said sternly.\u0022Alrighty Capty-tain\u0022,Jeb said as he made his way to the remote guidance computer.\u0022Decoupling in 5,4,3,2,1,....Jeb you have control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jebediah made exaggerated plane and laser sounds,\u0022Ok\u0022said jeb,\u0022How long is this gonna take\u0022? \u0022About four days until the touch down\u0022,Bill said.\u0022WHAT\u0022Jeb got out of this seat and started to leave,\u0022Call me when my skills are actually needed\u0022.\u0022If only we could like time-warp or something\u0022.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapter Three\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Four days later a great deal has been learned about Planet NX GG 1667,it has 1 moon and hundreds of tiny un-identified hunks of space junk.It\u0027s atmosphere is composed of 78% Nitrogen,21% Oxygen and low amounts of other gases.Planet NX GG 1667,is very geologically active,Earth quakes and volcanoes are constantly erupting.NX GG 1667\u0027s moon is larger then Jools largest moon Tylo but has less gravity then Kerbins Mun.Large storm systems can be seen traveling across the planet.The large areas of green land confirms the fact that life does exist on this planet. Jebediah and Bob made their way to the bridge,\u0022It\u0027s my big day\u0022,said Jeb.\u0022I\u0027m landing the rover,what are you doing with your life Bob\u0022? \u0022Well i\u0027m uhh,you know...uhhh umm\u0022.\u0022Yeah that\u0027s what I thought\u0022,Jebediah chuckled a little.\u0022Seriously i don\u0027t know why you\u0027re my best friend Jeb\u0022,Bob muttered.\u0022Admit it,you LOOOOOOOVE me\u0022,Jeb said as he twirled around as he floated down the hall.\u0022Shut up Jeb,just pilot your rover\u0022...

Bill smiled as he drove the Rover closer. One of the giant Automobiles stopped in a what appeared to be a parking lot like back on Kerbin.A Kerbanoid figure stepped out,\u0022Woah,it\u0027s huge\u0022,said Bill.\u0022Looks about 1.7 meters\u0022,Ribely said while excitedly jotting down notes.\u0022Guys\u0022,Jebediah said,\u0022We just made the biggest discovery in Kerbal history,and it\u0027s all thanks to ME\u0022! Everyone wanted to be annoyed at Jeb but they were filled with to much pure excitement to feel anything but joy.The rover crossed a road and just as they took some more beautiful pictures of the scenery.....*Crash* A huge truck ran over the rover. * Signal Lost*. They all stared in dismay.\u0022I\u0027LL PILOT THE MANNED MISSION\u0022,Jebediah shouted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapter Five\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Jebediah,we have no idea weather they will respond to our presence positively our negatively\u0022.We\u0027ll need more information before we can execute a manned landing\u0022,Bill went on to continue work with the engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022I still can\u0027t get over the size of it\u0022,Bill marveled,\u0022It\u0027s a Jool sized Kerbin.\u0022I sure wish mission control knew what was going on\u0022.\u0022Commander Bill\u0022, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Ribley shouted as he speed to the bridge.\u0022What is it Ribely\u0022? \u0022Remember all of NX GG 1667\u0027s space debris?\u0022 \u0022Well after some studying I found it all to be man made\u0022,This is a space travelling civilization!\u0022 \u0022Clearly much less advanced than we are,but I have here images of what I believe is a space station in a low orbit around the planet\u0022.Ribely rambled uncontrollably,\u0022As he loaded Bill with his evidence and photographs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Are you sure about this,Ribley\u0022?

Bob asked.\u0022I guess we didn\u0027t think about that one\u0022,Jebediah said disappointedly.\u0022Alright crew we need to devise a method of communication,and fast\u0022,said Bill.\u0022I want every crew member on it\u0022. \u0022Yes Captain!\u0022 they yelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapter Six\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Captain\u0022,Gennie Kerman called as she headed to the bridge.\u0022I\u0027ve developed a series of pictographs to display our basic history and our journey here\u0022.\u0022If this race is intelligent enough,they should respond with their own pictograph series\u0022.Bill looked through the images on the monitor,\u0022Good work Gennie\u0022.\u0022Send the transmission\u0022,he ordered.\u0022It should be a few minutes before they can construct their response\u0022,Gennie said as she stared at the monitors.\u0022Were getting the reply Captain\u0022. \u0022Bill,Gennie,and the rest of the control crew watched,biting their nails as the images loaded.High defanition images of the Kerbanoid figures were shown.\u0022Wow\u0022,said Jeb,\u0022Their heads are so proportionately tiny\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The slide show shows the advancements in technology of the species and they\u0027re first space launches.The very last image was digitally rendered and was of one of them holding hands with a Kerbal.\u0022Peace\u0022...muttered Ribely.The entire bridge started celebrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapter Seven\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Several days have passed and the Kerbin Freedom is nearing it\u0027s rendezvous with the Space Station orbiting around NX GG 1667.The alien species and the Kerbals have been communicating via pictographs and know a great deal about eachothers history,biology,and culture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022I\u0027m gonna get me a hot alien babe\u0022,said Jebediah as he played around with a floating pen.\u0022Ha,yeah right Jebediah,you can\u0027t even get a girl on Kerbin\u0022,said Bob laughing.\u0022Isn\u0027t it strange how low this planets density is?\u0022asked Ribley.\u0022Infact recent studies show most planets in this Solar system to have a low density relative to the Kerbol System.\u0022 \u0022And to think were only a half hour away from making contact with an alien species\u0022,Ribely floated back to his monitor.\u0022Prep for the rendezvous stabilization burn\u0022,said bill to Ribley and the other crew member.The behemoth ship,the largest ever assembled in orbit around Kerbin,swung it\u0027s way around into a retrograde position.As the ship neared the Alien Space Station they commenced the burn.\u0022Rendezvous is stable,Captain\u0022,said Geofin the head of the propulsion functions.The Kerbals once again pressed them selves up against the viewing ports to get a good look at the station.\u0022Wow,it\u0027s huge\u0022,marveled Bob,\u0022It\u0027s gotta be atleast 500 standard Kerbin units long\u0022.\u0022That\u0027s what she said\u0022,said Jebediah too himself.\u0022Seriously Jebediah,grow up\u0022,Bob scoffed and floated down the hallway.\u0022Uhh Captain Bill,our docking ports are nearly 4 times smaller then theirs,absolutely no possibility of a connection\u0022,said on of the Kerbin freedoms engineers.\u0022I want your team working on a solution\u0022,said Bill slightly frustratedly.\u0022We well EVA our way to the station if we have to,but for now see if there\u0027s a way we can dock\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapter Eight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Captain Bill,here\u0027s our solution\u0022,said an engineer.

Bill nearly let go himself as he tried to grab Ribley,but it was to late.Ribley was pulled out into the cold unforgiving emptiness of space.Commander Bill had never felt so much like giving up before,in his entire life of success this was his lowest moment.\u0022I counldn\u0027t save him\u0022,though Bill.And as the oxygen levels were depleting Bill realized he mustn\u0027t give up.\u0022JEB,grab me that cable!\u0022 He shouted.\u0022I can\u0027t make it over to you Commander\u0022,cried Jeb,his voice nearly drowned out by the noise.\u0022Were gonna jump at eachother\u0022,Bill yelled \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eover the deafening sound.\u0022WHAT?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Just trust me Jeb!\u0022 Jeb nodded.And without another second to waste the two leaped towards eachother.-Smack- Jeb and Bill collided mid air and Bill grab the cable.\u0022We got to get close enough to the docking port to manually close it\u0022,Bill started lowering down on the rope.Just then the hatch closed.The Kerbals all fell to the ground with a thud.\u0022What,how did that happen\u0022,Jebediah was stunned.Just then they all turned to the bridge viewing windows to see one of residents of the Alien Station.It was wearing a suit very similar to the Kerbals standard Astronaut Suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Look at that,he\u0027s waving at us\u0022,said Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Chapter Ten\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Kerbals all gazed at the awkwardly waving being.\u0022This is it Gentlemen\u0022,Bill said,\u0022But at this time I\u0027d like us all to remember Ribley\u0022.Jebediah still hadn\u0027t got over the shock of the recent events.\u0022Were safe now Kerbals,the mission must continue as it was meant to\u0022,Bill walked to the windows and repeated the waving motion of the Alien.Just then the Alien help what looked like a primitive form of Kerbal cameras.And made a flash as it took pictures of the kerbals and their ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022It\u0027s studying us\u0022,Bob was outraged.\u0022Doesn\u0027t it see we lost a Kerbal,and all it does is take pictures!\u0022.

The somber Kerbals stared at the gleeful creature who was shaking with excitement as it continued to take pictures and ramble to itself in it\u0027s language. Bill then stepped forward to indicate himself as the Captain; The alien presented a new series of pictographs seeming to display the races studying eachothers biology and technology. \u0022He, who gets the best out of that deal?\u0022, Jebediah said staring at the alien. \u0022We need a more efficient means of communication, that is priority one\u0027, Bill said. The biologist circled the alien taking measurements and obersving,\u0022 Well it\u0027s hard to tell with its suit on, but its proportions are radically different from our own.\u0022 \u0022Miniscule head, short arms, long legs, it\u0027s practically the opposite of us. \u0022Yeah, it\u0027s pretty disturbing to look at\u0022, Jebediah giggled. \u0022I bet it\u0027s thinking the exact same about us Jeb, Bill retorted. \u0022Eh whatever it\u0027s still gross, I definitely don\u0027t want an alien babe anymore\u0022. \u0022Hah, you were never getting one anyway....and i\u0027m sure there\u0027s laws against that\u0022, Bob laughed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To be continued, as always constructive criticism is welcome and appreciated, thanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-14T16:43:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2014 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Voyager55\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ninjakids","CreatedById":70896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T03:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally good, just your grammar has some problems.

NX GG 1667 is roughly 9 times the size of Kerbin (slightly smaller than Jool).\u003Cp\u003EOnboard the vessel \u0022Kerbin Freedom\u0022, 14 brave Kerbals set out to NX GG 1667. \u0022Commander Bill\u0022, said Bob Kerman, \u0022Mission control gave us the go, we\u0027re ready to engage the FTL drive.\u0022 Faster Than Light Drives don\u0027t actually make you travel faster than light, rather they fold space over itself to open up portals of a sort through space, but they ended up getting the nickname FTL drives.
