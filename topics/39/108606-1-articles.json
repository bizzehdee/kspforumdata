What lore do you attach to them?\n\nLiquid Fuel - A filtered version of an abundant hydrocarbon on Kerbin, Liquid Fuel is a moderately efficient fuel. However, through heating the fuel heavily, or clever engine design, Liquid Fuel can approach the efficiency of hydrogen-based fuel. It burns quite readily and cleanly, allowing re-ignition of engines without any regard for residue. It also ignites at low temperature, allowing rather simple ignition systems.\n\nOxidizer - Koxygen - a dense compound of oxygen with some other chemicals (that happen not to affect the burn much, or they affect it positively.) (5kg/unit (liters?) compared to 1.141kg/l for real LOX.) It is moderately croygenic, but less so than pure liquid oxygen, allowing it to be stored with negligible boiloff.\n\nSolid Fuel - Kerbals have not learned the art of making efficient solid fuel. Thus, Solid Fuel on Kerbin is simply advanced black powder. It burns powerfully and agressively, but inefficiently."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:19:55Z","Content":"LiquidFuel - Basically Aerozine 50 with a density closer to RP-1.\n\nOxidizer - Basically dinitrogen tetroxide.\n\nMonopropellant - Probably just simple hydrazine.\n\nSolidFuel - Probably PBAN in a mixture similar to what the Space Shuttle boosters used."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:22:54Z","Content":"KSP\u0027s unobtainium?

I\u0027ve done some reading up on engines so hopefully my fictional versions of KSP engines make some kind of sense, rather than just being technobabble but fuels - not so much.
