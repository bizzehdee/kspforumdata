Breath would only come in ragged gasps. \n\n*No...*\n\nShe pulled herself along toward the gaping hatch as fear constricted around her spine, dug into it like ice. \n\nFear, bleak and certain. \n\nOne of her helmet lights had been smashed in the chaos, the other flickered uncertainly. The darkness and the light continued their struggle before her as she clawed her way along. Reaching the breach, Valentina thrust herself inside, head first, her breath tight in her throat. \n\nBut it was too late. \n\nDibella\u0027s lifeless eyes stared back accusingly, glassy and vacant, one pupil blown. Her skin was pallid, gray; her mouth hung open, eyelids drooped. \n\n\u0022No...\u0022 Valentina shook her, her head flopping back and forth, unresisting, \u0022no, you cannot...\u0022\n\n*No...!*\n\nThe sobs came in great, ragged heaves, echoing in the tiny space of Valentina\u0027s helmet like the last dying wails of innocence. There was no anger here, no vengeance, only sorrow. Tears clung to her face before sloughing off to float around like tiny crystal globes. \n\nThere were no words. There was no point. \n\nThe cold metal tomb drifted through space that paid no mind to the anguish within, empty and indifferent. Valentina\u0027s remaining helmet lamp flickered one final, futile time, then darkness consumed her. \n\n*What?*\n\n...only, it... *wasn\u0027t* dark.\n\nValentina blinked against the tears that clung stubbornly to her eyes, and gasped. The tiny space of the capsule was lit up like a galaxy. A thousand points of light danced, swirled, played across the walls. They swayed and cavorted, each one like a... like a memory, a memory of *light*. Even in this place of final darkness they glittered; frail and fragile, still they shone, they burned back against the darkness, and they denied it. By their tiny beacons, Valentina stared into that darkness, and found hope. \n\nHope.\n\nBut where...? How...?\n\nHer eyes flicked around the cramped cabin and... *there*.  Bolted to an experiment rack on the wall was a small, translucent capsule. She couldn\u0027t tell what was in it, whether it was liquid or solid, but whatever it was, it was *glowing*, the light refracted and scattered by her own tears floating about in her helmet. Not even daring to give the thought form, Valentina looked back to her friend and...\n\n*There*.\n\nShe never could have seen it in the harsh glare of her helmet lamps. Inside of Dibella\u0027s faceplate, over her open mouth, was a tiny patch of fog that hesitantly waxed and waned. \n\nWith a cry, suddenly fighting against hands that seemed slow and numb, Valentina pulled the hastily-machined adapter from a pocket, snapped it into place on her chest pack, then pulled Dibella\u0027s umbilicals from the panel socket and clipped them into it. Her ears popped as the pressure between the two suits equalized and for a moment her own life support struggled to keep up. Valentina waited, not even daring to breathe, the only sound the distant rush of air in the hoses. \n\nTime stretched out, Kerbin continued to drift by, unheeding, far below.\n\nBut it was not to be. Not in this place. Valentina sadly closed her eyes, her faceplate clicked against her friend\u0027s. No, this was not one of those saccharine Foreign films Dibella had taken to. There would be no last minute reprieve, no rescue, no miracle. \n\nThere was only the dark, still, finality of the gr--\n\nDibella\u0027s thin chest heaved. Her limbs convulsed, her body spasmed. She took in air in long ragged gasps, coughing and shaking. Finally, her eyes fluttered, then focused. Valentina stared, still not quite believing. \n\n\u0022Valentina?\u0022 Dibella said, her voice thin and reedy, carried across the abyss of vacuum by their touching faceplates.\n\n\u0022I knew you\u0027d come,\u0022 she closed her eyes as her breathing steadied, \u0022...knew you\u0027d come...\u0022\n\nThe two friends floated there in the darkness, together, denying it. There were no words. There was no need. Together they breathed and cried and hugged each other\u0027s helmets. Which was awkward, because they were huge. \n\nAt length, as the situation at hand started to creep back into Valentina\u0027s mind and the shared air in their suits stabilized, she began to notice... \n\n\u0022Um... \u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0418\u042DVS \u042A\u0414LD P\u0414T\u0417 what the P\u0426TI\u0419 is that smell?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Er... I think that\u0027s.. me,\u0022 Dibella said sheepishly, \u0022I haven\u0027t bathed in three days and this space food is a bit...\u0022\n\nSomewhere, distantly, was a sound disconcertingly like a rocket engine. \n\n\u0022...unsettling.\u0022\n\nIn a tiny capsule floating in a void above an inconsequential world, the two laughed, until the sun peeked over the horizon and flash in Valentina\u0027s ear drew her attention.\n\n\u0022Valentina... *Kokos*... what is going on? What happened? Are you... Is--\u0022\n\n\u0022She is all right!\u0022\n\nThere were no words. There just were not. Valentina heard the cries of jubilation as Tercella simply held her mic open. In the coming days, a grainy, anonymous photograph would make its way to every news outlet in the world. Tercella Kerman holding her headset above her bowed head, surrounded by cheering controllers. \n\n\u0022So, can we go home now?\u0022 Dibella managed a fragile smile, \u0022I\u0027m sick of space.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*,\u0022 Valentina said emphatically, then clipped a tether to Dibella\u0027s suit, \u0022you are not getting away from me again.\u0022\n\nShe struggled her way backwards out of the hatch, then assisted Dibella, being cautious of the other Kerbal\u0027s delicate suit, never intended for EVA. Dibella paused as she left the capsule, taking a moment to watch the face of Kerbin below, raising a hand and shading her unshielded face against the glare. \n\n\u0022It really is beautiful, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 She said distantly, touching her helmet again to Valentina\u0027s, \u0022I never thought I\u0027d actually get to see it like this.\u0022\n\n\u0022It is,\u0022 Valentina stared for a moment too. Nearing the western terminator, the two great powers had reversed roles. Now the darkness fled, and the light triumphed. The light, and the darkness. She suspected there was another profound revelation in there somewhere, but at the moment, Valentina was just too P\u0426TI\u0419I\u0419G tired for profound revelations. The darkness had been denied twice, now, and a price *would* have to be paid. She was more sure of that than ever. But not now. \n\n\u0022Come,\u0022 Valentina said, \u0022we are not home just yet.\u0022\n\nThen she reached down and keyed her mic, \u0022control, do you copy? We are in position.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy you... I am bringing *Zarya* in slowly... ugh this is not easy with just a camera...\u0022\n\n\u0022What? *Zarya*?\u0022 Dibella carefully peeked around Valentina\u0027s helmet, \u0022how... how did you get *that?*\u0022\n\n\u0022I stole it.\u0022\n\nThe other Kerbal did a double-take, their two faceplates going *click-click*, \u0022you... you stole a space ship?!\u0022\n\nValentina grinned, \u0022no, of course I did not steal it. Bit of a long story, I will fill you in later. But really, stealing a space ship? What sort of buffoon would come up with an idea like that?\u0022  \n\nDibella just glared at her for a moment, then her eyes widened and she began frantically pointing. Valentina spun around, slowly and awkwardly spun around, just in time to see the tip of the parachute at the end of *Zarya\u0027s* nose come to a halt only centimeters from her own faceplate. Close enough to see... \n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u0022MADE IN GYTEP\u0022 was stamped on the casing in three different languages. \n\n*Lately, it seems \u003Cu\u003Eeverything\u003C/u\u003E is made somewhere else*, but she shook the thought away for another time. \n\n\u0022Control... you nearly made a paste of me.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ah, sorry about that. Trying my best, I have had even less training than you.\u0022\n\n\u0022What? Tercella? *You* are flying it? But you are the CAPCOM...\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes... apparently in a room full of rocket scientists I am the only one qualified to actually fly one.\u0022\n\nValentina put a a hand to her faceplate. Dibella gave her a quizzical look, not having heard the exchange. She shook her head and clipped a tether to a recessed ring on *Zarya*, then offered the other Kerbal a hand. Dibella took it, and again their faceplates clicked.\n\n\u0022One moment,\u0022 Dibella said. She braced her arms, put a boot against her stricken Orbiter, then gave it a mighty shove... or as mighty as she could manage. \n\n\u0022*P\u0426TI\u0419* on you!\u0022\n\nThe pair watched it slowly tumble away for a time, before finally retreating into *Zarya*. As she slid the hatch closed and switched on the cabin lights, Valentina could see the weariness in her friend\u0027s face. \n\n\u0022You look you something Igor dragged in,\u0022 she smirked as she slid her faceplate up.\n\n\u0022I feel like it,\u0022 Dibella did likewise, \u0022probably smell like it too. But I\u0027m alive, thanks to you.\u0022\n\nValentina resisted the urge to wrinkle her n... face, \u0022then let us go home.\u0022 She entered the sequence into IVAN, anxiety nibbling at the back of her neck until the thrusters had finished their burn. She switched to the estimated landing display, checked the numbers, and... giggled.\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 Dibella raised an eye... bulge, \u0022what is it?\u0022\n\nValentina smirked back at her, \u0022you are not going to believe this...\u0022\n\nSome time later, the capsule cleanly separated from its service module, as the tenuous upper atmosphere began to lick at the hull and glowing ionized gas danced around it. \n\n.   .   .\n\n*Ping*.\n\n\u0022What was that?\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-04T08:19:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2020 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T14:05:29Z","Content":"Again with the oh-my-gosh-they-saved-each-other-but-now-they-might-die cliffhanger?

The stomach-turning feeling of weightless returned briefly until a pair of loud bangs signaled the successful deployment of the parachutes. *Zarya* was soon drifting sedately to the ground beneath them, her nose pointed halfway between the horizon and vertical. Valentina switched off a few more circuit breakers as the checklist specified, but mostly kept still and braced for the coming impact. \n\nWhen it finally came, it was accompanied by an awful crunching noise, the capsule tipped forward onto its flank, rolled back and forth for just a moment, then was still. \n\n\u0022Crumple zones,\u0022 Valentina said, \u0022quite clever, really.\u0022 Dibella managed a weak smile. \n\nA pair of more muted bangs announced that the parachutes had automatically cut to keep from dragging the capsule. Valentina shut down the final few systems before sliding the hatch open and exulting at the feel of fresh air on her face again. Still, that landing did seem a bit softer than she\u0027d been expecting. \n\nShe hopped up to sit on the lip of the hatchway, raising a hand against the glare of the low, late fall sun. And swallowed hard. IVAN may have its teething problems, but its landing calculator was certainly accurate. With nothing else to do for it, Valentina reached down and pulled Dibella up to sit on the edge as well. She felt as yielding as a sack of potatoes, a small one, but after taking in the scene for a moment herself, still managed a trembling wave. \n\nAnd, as they say in the Foreign lands, the crowd went wild. \n\nThe sound washed over the two bewildered Kerbals like a wave. All through the throngs of people, tall *ushankas*, wide-brimmed caps, and one diminutive police officer went flying up into the air with patriotic fervor. Whoops and whistles resounded off the walls. The parachutes had wrapped themselves around a building, boldly displaying the Star of the Union several meters across. Those nearby busied themselves with cutting small swatches off as souvenirs. \n\nValentina slid off the side of the capsule to the ground, and realized it had landed on... something. Whatever it had been, it was little more than kindling and ribbons now. She caught Dibella as she, too, slid off, then had to hold her upright as well with a hand around her waist. Valentina was just wondering what to actually *do*, now, when the crowd parted and a small convoy of utes and trucks rumbled into the scene. Tercella beat Igor this time, sprinting up to the other two, wrapping her arms around their necks and kissing them both on the cheek with a loud smacking sound.\n\n\u0022Do not *(mwa!)* ever *(mwa!)* do that again! We *have* to stop meeting like this!\u0022 She took up position opposite Dibella, helping to hold her up as Igor thudded forward. To Valentina\u0027s great surprise, Igor simply held out a hand like four thick sausages stuck in a hamhock. \n\n\u0022Is well,\u0022 he boomed with an odd little smile. Valentina shook the offered hand gingerly. From the gathering vehicles, personnel spread out across the area, keeping back curious onlookers and discussing how best to retrieve the capsule. A team of medics helped Dibella to a waiting ambulance and began triage. Out of this new crowd, Sergei Kermanev appeared, now wearing a white lab coat himself and looking quite concerned. \n\n\u0022Valentina.\u0022\n\n\u0022Sergei.\u0022\n\n\u0022You... um, you lost the primary buffer panel...\u0022\n\n\u0022I... the what?\u0022 Valentina looked back at the spacecraft. It looked about like she would expect a re-entered space capsule to look, charred and blackened, but nothing appeared to be missing, \u0022...is that important?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, typically after that you would experience some slight turbulence, and then, explode.\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s jaw fell open. Despite being somewhat shorter, she glowered at the white-clad Kerbal. \n\nHe threw up his hands, \u0022some of the tests were still inconclusive!\u0022\n\nShe rolled her eyes and huffed, then her expression softened, \u0022look, ...Sergei, none of this would have been possible if not for you...\u0022\n\n\u0022Um, well... I uh... just did what anyone else would have done...\u0022 he scratched the back of his head nervously.\n\n\u0022Perhaps,\u0022 Valentina offered a hand, \u0022but I do not know how to ever thank you--\u0022\n\n\u0022I do,\u0022 Tercella suddenly stalked up to him. She grabbed Sergei\u0027s cheeks theatrically, then kissed him so hard his bulging eyes rolled back in his head and his toes curled. And on a Kerbal foot, that\u0027s quite a feat. He let out a slight whimper, and toppled over backwards with a thud. \n\nTercella walked away looking quite proud of herself, \u0022medic!\u0022\n\nValentina was staring at the limp form on the ground, wondering if maybe she *should* help him up, when a dark shadow crept over it. Her eyes rose.\n\n\u0022Comrade Kerbonaut.\u0022\n\nShe snapped a quick salute, then began digging for her papers before she remembered she was still wearing a space suit. Oddly, the Political Officer just held up a hand, stepping over poor Sergei. He looked... out of sorts.\n\n\u0022It seems you have done it,\u0022 he said slowly.\n\n\u0022It seems.\u0022\n\n\u0022And Comrade Dibella is well?\u0022\n\n\u0022She well will be.\u0022\n\nThe two stared at each other for an uncomfortable moment in the chilly late fall air. The crowd continued to cheer.\n\n\u0022Out of all the places on Kerbin you could land,\u0022 he said at length, \u0022you land *here*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 Valentina said, with an innocent little smile.\n\n\u0022In Crimson Square.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\n\u0022In the middle of the Glorious Octember Revolution Commemoration Parade.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes.\u0022\n\n\u0022But...\u0022 he nudged a piece of debris on the ground with the toe of his boot. It looked like a pointy wooden beard.\n\n\u0022...you have demolished the float of Great Comrade Kermin!\u0022 His voice actually cracked. \n\n\u0022Y--\u0022 Valentina spun around and gawked at the pile of sticks and colorful ribbons beneath *Zarya*. Oh, so that\u0027s what that was. \n\nOops. \n\nThe Political Officer took his hat off, scratched his bushy hair with it, wiped an eye, then set it back on his head. \n\n\u0022I shall have to modify my report,\u0022 he sniffed. \n\nHe stared at the mess a moment longer, and with a cough seemed to recover some of his usual presence, \u0022but nevertheless, this is a great day! A *glorious* day!\n\nThen he leaned in close to Valentina, and in an instant the predatory grin with far too many teeth was back. \n\n\u0022But rest assured, Comrade... this will *not* soon be forgotten.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-04T08:27:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2020 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T13:07:17Z","Content":"Well, couldn\u0027t they have landed at the Pad?

They seemed to go on and on, converging at a single point somewhere high above. The entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E could probably fit through these doors. But then, she knew what lay behind them, too. \n\nFlanking the massive wooden doors stood two pairs of very serious-looking guards with eyes that never lingered long in any one place. There were no gilded breastplates here, no ceremonial polearms. The rifles the guards held to their shoulders looked very, very functional. Three more stood at the back of the cavernous ante room. \n\nShe had been hoping to avoid all this, or at least deal with it quietly. Hoping, but not expecting, even after being successful. *Especially* after being successful. The Imperium must have their spectacle, after all. \n\nA rather rotund Kerbal in a crisply-pressed blue uniform stood just to the side of the door shutter. Gold stars gleamed on his collar. The fruit salad on his suit breast must have weighed an entire kilo. He didn\u0027t seem to notice. He stood stiffly, his hands resting on the pommel of a short staff in front of him. His bored eyes regarded Valentina as he might an unfortunate stain on his uniform. One that was about to be laundered. \n\nValentina\u0027s own uniform had had its first proper cleaning in some time as well: her metal insignia shone, every crease had been pressed just so, even the visor of her wide-brimmed hat had been polished. It probably wouldn\u0027t help at this point to made a good impression, but it couldn\u0027t hurt, either. At any rate, her sweat was rapidly undoing all the cleaning that had been done. \n\n\u0022It is time,\u0022 the rotund Kerbal thundered, seemingly without any sort of time piece. Valentina looked up again at the towering doors and swallowed hard. \n\nDibella stepped up from the side, looking somber. She wore a formal yet simple dress, with long, elbow-length gloves to hide the bandages on her hands. Even so, she carefully adjusted Valentina\u0027s collar and gestured as she spoke. \n\n\u0022Now, do not worry, you will be fine,\u0022 her voice was comforting despite the inevitable, \u0022just remember, chin up, shoulders back...\u0022\n\nDibella\u0027s lips broadened in example, \u0022and *smile*, she likes that.\u0022\n\nThen she leaned in closer, \u0022*they* hate it.\u0022\n\nDibella stepped back, and the stout Kerbal thumped his staff on the floor three times, echoing like thunder in the cavernous room. \n\n*BOOM... BOOM... BOOM...* \n\nWith a clatter of latches, the enormous doors slowly swung open. Valentina squinted against the light beyond, and stepped forward...\n\n...the assault began immediately. A charge of trumpets nearly sucked the breath from her chest. With a flourish of tympani and cymbals, the staccato fanfare swelled, bigger and brighter horns joining in, doubling upon its self and shifting up a key. Valentina found herself utterly frozen for the moment, dimly aware that her jaw was probably hanging open. This room... if it could even be called such... it didn\u0027t seem possible. \n\nHuge. Gigantic. Enormous. A thousand poets writing for a thousand years could not convey the grandeur of it. The village she traded at so many years ago would fit easily in a corner. The latticed glass ceiling above was so high she could barely see it, the distant walls looked kilometers apart, yet there was nothing, nothing interrupting the cavernous space. No columns or posts or buttresses. Every surface, every single one, from the marble floor to the gilded ironwork to the varnished woods, glimmered in the sunlight, polished like mirrors. \n\nAnd then, there were the *people*. Thousands, tens of thousands easily, standing on the expansive floor or in raised galleries around the periphery that gave them a view despite the distance. They stood, rigidly at attention, facing the wide center lane before Valentina, where a long, deep crimson rug covered the marble floor. The rug led to the center where...\n\nValentina\u0027s blood ran cold. \n\nA subtle cue in the music as a rising chorus of strings joined the fanfare of horns and trumpets now reaching a crescendo. \n\n*Walk*.\n\nOn legs that suddenly felt like jelly, Valentina stepped forward, just hoping she wouldn\u0027t stumble. Right as she did, with a final flourish the trumpets led the full orchestra into an ancient march. It was from a time far, far away, before the Ussari Union, before even the Empire. A time when the \u016As\u0027 had been little more than a tribe of vagabonds trying desperately just to stay alive as the former stability of the old Roamin\u0027 Empire collapsed around them, and merely surviving was an act of bravery. \n\nValentina\u0027s step fell naturally into the beat of the march, or the music shifted to match hers. She couldn\u0027t quite tell. As she passed the first rows of dark green uniforms and stiffly held, wide-brimmed hats, they executed a crisp side-face in perfect unison, now facing forward. The thunder of their boots punctuated the score, row after row, never facing away from her. She passed by the deep greens of the Army, the dark blues of the Air Force, the crisp whites of the Navy. Every branch of the martials was represented, waves upon waves of them. \n\nNow, as Valentina moved on, the dress became more varied. The people here did not turn in drill formations, but stood rigidly and somberly, eyeing her with caution. The first droves wore proper yet humble suits. The small part of her mind that was not completely overwhelmed identified them as engineers and academics. As she moved past, the dress slowly became more grand and imposing. Here were the apparatchiks, the minor bureaucrats, the factory heads and committee leads. They gave way to the political officers, the kommissars, the middle managers. \n\nAt the very head of the crowd was, of course, the finest attire. Exquisitely tailored suits of lavish foreign fabrics, long flowing dresses that seemed to change colors, and the occasional completely ridiculous set of gold-braided epaulets. The nobility had been officially abolished just after the Revolution, but these people had never noticed. Here was wealth so vast that who ran the nation at the time was mere formality. They looked at Valentina as one might a particularly unpleasant pest that was most certainly someone *else\u0027s* problem to deal with. \n\nThe crowd ended now. An open expanse of marble floor led to a dais that must have been ten meters high, and above *that*... Valentina had been deliberately trying not to look up, afraid she would lose her nerve, but it was unavoidable any more. \n\nHigh above the rostrum, suspended god-like in seats of iron and stern wood, above everyone and everything, it was *them*. It was *they*. It was the Grand High Imperium of the Ussari Union. They looked down on all those gathered with eyes as cold and remorseless and the long Ussari winter. There was no hate there, hate would have been a feeling. The eight faces above were as feeling as stone: watching, measuring, judging all they perceived as tools to be used to their own ends, or impediments to be removed. And towering above even them, beyond the crystal ceiling of this palace behind the walls of its Fortress, loomed the stark, grey curve of the Dome of the Imperium.\n\nSome part of Valentina\u0027s mind saw all this, cataloged it, saved it away for later. The part that had been honed by years in the taiga to be ever watchful, always aware of the dangers surrounding. Her *conscious* mind, however...\n\nIt saw only *her*.\n\nThe thundering march softened to a melody of strings as Valentina\u0027s foot stepped onto the first of the wide steps leading up the dais. By statute, *her* picture hung in every home in the Union, not a single person didn\u0027t know that face. And yet, it was a scarce few who ever truly saw her like this, so close. She wore a long, flowing white gown with ruffles and filigrees and other fancy... things Valentina couldn\u0027t name. Her long, pale hair was gathered into a single braid hung over her shoulder, and she wore a simple tiara on her head. Her face was serene and ageless, her eyes sad despite the patient smile on her lips. There was no trace of sweat on her smooth skin despite the warmth. She stood before the Winter Throne atop the dais, her hands folded demurely in front of her. Tall, so tall, and slender, seemingly born of grace and poise, she was... resplendent. Seeing her, Valentina could not help but smile. \n\nHer Imperial Majesty Alexandra II awaited.\n\nValentina stepped to the top of the dais, the music ending with a final flourish the instant her last foot was down. For a moment she just stood, unsure of what exactly to do. Should she say something? Bow? No, they\u0027d been very specific about that. *No one* bows to the Empress anymore. Then the Empress stepped forward, her heels clicking softly on the marble floor. \n\n\u0022Welcome,\u0022 she said simply, quietly, with the slightest hint of a nod. Then she turned to face up at *them* in their high seats.\n\n\u0022May it please the Imperium,\u0022 and she most certainly *did* bow, but did not seem to wait for a response before turning back and looking over the crowds of people. She looked slowly from one side of the expansive space to the other, the silence stretching out, then unfolded her hands and raised them slightly in greeting.\n\n\u0022Comrades. Esteemed dignit\u0027ries. Honorede guests. Friends.\u0022 The Empress spoke with the ancient nuances of the old dialect, her words clipped yet lilting, adding or dropping syllables seemingly at random, like a distillation of Dibella\u0027s own faint accent. She continued scanning the room as she spoke, as if wanting to include every single person in what was said. \n\n\u0022We gather here, today, in this place of history ande monuments, to honor one,\u0022 her gaze fell back upon Valentina, still standing stiffly at attention, \u0022who is most worthy.\u0022 Her slight little smile, it was enchanting... but there was something else, there, too. Valentina also realized with a shock the Empress appeared to be speaking with no electronic amplification, not even raising her voice. The acoustics in this hall must be *that* good. \n\n*...right?*\n\n\u0022By her actions ande devotion to her comrades, she has demonstr\u0027ted the very pinnacle of what it is to be Ussari, to stande for our Glor\u0027yous Union, and to ...*serve* our Great Advocate, the Grand High Imperium.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked. Did she really hear...? No, it must simply be the other\u0027s odd speech pattern. \n\nThe Empress gestured to the side, every move she made deliberate and flowing. A page scurried up the dais, and held out a flat box of lacquered wood to her. She opened it gently, and took a scroll from inside. \n\n\u0022I shalle now read the c\u0027tation,\u0022 she scanned across the audience again. Valentina was sure there was... something in her eyes. \n\n\u0022Be it knowen,\u0022 she read, \u0022that on or about the Octeenth of Septober, in the twenty-first year of the rein of Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra the Second, one Valentina Kerman of Kerberia Oblast, Lieutenant, Crimson Air Force, did act with honor ande courage most befitting a Comrade of the Imperious Union of Ussari States.\u0022\n\nHer voice was full and melodic as it carried through the expansive space, the strange little smile never quite leaving her lips, \u0022on or about said day, Lieutenant Kerman did willingly, ande without hesitation, volunteer to take command of a dangerous mission, using untested equipment, against impossible odds, to rescue her Comrade, one Dibella Kermanov of the City of Kerman, who was marooned in deep space while engaged in the noble pursuit of its expl\u0027ration.\u0022\n\nValentina could feel her cheeks flushing, but kept her face neutral. It hadn\u0027t been as grand as all that, she just did what anyone would have done. Right? She sensed the cold eyes above measuring her even as the Empress spoke. \n\n\u0022...on or about said day, Lieutenant Kerman engaged in acts of physical ande mental prowess never before endured, accomplished that which was heretofore impossible, and at great personal risk returned both her Comrade and sensitive hardware safely back to Ussari soil.\u0022\n\nThen the Empress looked to her with piercing blue eyes. There was measurement there, too, and shrewdness, but mostly... curiosity. And something else Valentina still couldn\u0027t quite place. \n\n\u0022Valentina Kerman, in recognition of these acts ande others, for demonstr\u0027ting a measure of devotion ande selflessness that all Comrades of our great Union should aspire to, ande for gallantry and courage above ande beyond the call of dyuty...\u0022\n\nValentina swallowed hard. \n\n\u0022...the Grand High Imperium of the Imperious Union of Ussari States hereby advances you to the rank of Major in the Glorious Crimson Air Force, ande names you, Hero of the Ussari Union.\u0022\n\nA lightning fast wave of dizziness washed over Valentina, but she somehow managed not to sway. Behind her, she heard a murmur in the crowd. The Empress replaced the scroll in the box, and slowly lifted the gleaming medal, holding its ribbon strap wide. For a moment Valentina thought she might panic. She really felt she should bow or... or *something*. But the tall Empress deftly lifted the medal over her head with a practiced hand, laid the ribbon upon her shoulders, and tucked it under her collar. It felt quite heavy. \n\nThen the Empress stepped back, heels clicking softly, and regarded the audience. The murmuring began to build toward applause, but she half-raised a hand. \n\n\u0022There is more,\u0022 she said, the corners of the smile on her serene face ticking up a fraction higher. She nodded to the page, who swiftly drifted down the steps and returned with a much larger scroll, sealed with a daub of crimson wax. He handed it reverently to her. The Empress snapped the seal with her thumb and unrolled the scroll solemnly. Valentina\u0027s brow furrowed. In the Empress\u0027s eyes, was that a... mischievous twinkle?\n\n\u0022An Imperial Proclamation,\u0022 the Empress cast her gaze across the crowd again, as murmurs grew to mutters, then read, \u0022on this date, in Union assembled, in lawful accordance with the rights and privileges afforded under the Agreement; I, Alexandra the Second of the House of Kerman, pronounce the following Decree: in recognition of the actions of one Valentina Kerman, on or about the Octeenth of Septober; be it knowen: that land ande property in Kerberia Oblast lawf\u0027lly seized under the Truancy Decree from one Pyotr Kerman upon his passing, are hereby restored,\u0022\n\nValentina gasped.\n\n*Deda...*\n\n\u0022Be it knowen, that derogatory records ande dockets in the matters of Vladimir and Elena Kerman are hereby expunged, and they are pronounced rehabilitated,\u0022\n\nAgain Valentina had to struggle to remain upright. She felt like she\u0027d been punched in the gut. This... this wasn\u0027t mentioned... Now the murmurs came from the high seats above as well. Why would--\n\n\u0022And you, Valentina Kerman,\u0022 the Empress\u0027s winsome, considering eyes fixed on her once more. They seemed to have reached a conclusion, \u0022for your devotion to your Comrades, and valiance in the face of danger, by my Imperial prerogative under the Agreement, I bestow upon your family name the following honorific, and name you henceforth, Valentina Kermanova.\u0022 \n\nFor a moment, Valentina felt like she was back in space. The world shifted and lurched, she felt weightless, and was sure she would have collapsed if the Empress had not suddenly... *hugged* her? The world shifted the other way. Yes, the Empress, the *Empress*, was *hugging* her! It was warm and wonderful and genuine. And just a bit awkward, what with all the ruffles. She smelled of lilacs and honey. \n\nThen the Empress whispered softly in Valentina\u0027s ear, \u0022turn around and let the people see you, child, for you are *worth* seeing.\u0022\n\nValentina somehow found her footing as the Empress stepped back. Placing her toe behind her other ankle, terrified for a moment she would spin out of control and tumble down the steps, she made the most precise about-face of her life, stood rigidly to attention, and looked out over the spectacle for the first time. \n\nThe rows of people seemed to go on forever, the orchestra pit to the side was, of course, immense, with fields of brass and stings and woodwinds. And one tympani player in an enormous spherical helmet. But more importantly, there, in the very front...\n\nDibella was practically beaming. Igor looked quite sharp in his dress uniform. Someone had managed to get Tercella into an *actual* dress, and by the way she was picking at it irritably, they probably wouldn\u0027t be doing anything else for a few weeks, at least until the casts came off. \n\nThe Empress floated up beside Valentina, her voice louder and clearer than ever, \u0022Comrades. Esteemed dignit\u0027ries. Honorede guests. Friends. I present to you, Major Valentina Kermanova, Hero of the Ussari Union!\u0022\n\nThe applause began reverent and mild, but any hope for decorum was soon lost when someone in the back among the martials yelled \u0022WOOOOO!\u0022 and the entire gallery exploded into cheers. Whoops and hats and the same diminutive officer went flying up into the air, but he seemed to be enjoying himself a bit more this time. \n\nShe had done it, she had finally *done* it. Recognition, respect, redemption. This is what she had set out for all those years ago in Kerberia... right?\n\nBah!\n\nEnough with the thinking! That was for later, for now, Valentina would just enjoy this beautiful, perfect moment while it lasted. She could feel eight pairs of eyes boring into the back of her neck like fleshworms. She suspected she hadn\u0027t made any friends among *them* today, their spectacle had not gone as planned. There would be... repercussions. \n\nBut for this one beautiful, perfect moment, Valentin Kermanova did not give a *P\u0426TI\u0419*. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-29T08:56:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2017 08:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T13:00:53Z","Content":"Ahh man, that was a good chapter.

The M\u00FCn, pale and bloated like a corpse, occasionally peered through the gaps. Below the clouds, a nightmare stained the land. The twisted, blackened forms of dead trees, their limbs burned away, jutted from the ground at unnatural angles, like the fingers of the damned reaching up from the grave. Some weeks ago, a blazing rocket booster that had lofted Sergei Kermanski on his brief breach of the heavens had fallen here, and hell had followed with it. What was once a verdant forest became an inferno, the conflagration raging for days, burning away every trace of life on the surface, and far below.  \n\nAlready, the local farmers and miners shunned this forsaken place. In hushed words by the consoling glow of their cook-fires, they told stories of strange sounds and unearthly figures that haunted these skeletal woods. Do not go near, they said, or you will hear the voices of the accursed beckoning to you, and be bewitched. Do not go near, for that is a place where lost souls roam. \n\nOne of them wandered through the spectral trees now, a dark voice indeed whispering in its ear. It had been given the name Valentina Kermanova. \n\nShe had slipped away from the celebrations at the nearby Cosmodrome easily enough, once the obligatory analyzing of rocket fuel had begun. Despite the prevalence of the tradition in Ussari society, she\u0027d never gained a taste for it. It clouded the mind and dulled the senses, and tonight... tonight she would need her head clear for... as long as it took. In her hand was a small, brown glass bottle of translucent blue pills. Darnitol\u2122, 75mg. Sleep. Sleep, without dreams. \n\nThe easy way out. \n\nThe voice had returned as the lonesome capsule had descended through the clouds, harrying and offering. All through the pomp and circumstance, it had not ceased. Valentina realized this was not sustainable. After all that had happened, after all that had been lost, and gained, the voice had always been right about one thing. The price must be paid. There must be sacrifice. There must be blood. \n\nValentina walked along before gnarled hulks that leered like demonic sentinels, a frigid wind chasing away puffs of soot cast up as her boots crunched along the baked ground. Something was wrong. Something was wrong about this place, far deeper than these tortured pillars. Something was... hungry. It watched. It stalked. It smacked its lips in anticipation. And yet, it waited. Valentina had hunted many things. Hunted, and *been* hunted. Something haunted the darkened halls of the Cosmodrome, the bustling streets of Kermangrad, the forbidden passageways of the Fortress. Something beyond the mere ambition of any Kerbal. Or even eight Kerbals. If it had all this before it, and still stayed its jaws, that could mean only one thing. \n\nIt wanted *more*.\n\nValentina turned the bottle of pills over in her hand, oblivious to the cold air biting at her face, focused on her grim task. Presently she came to a clearing, where a lens of fetid, poisoned water had filled the crater left by the falling missile. Misshapen hunks of ice in eye-watering colors dotted its oily surface. The dead trees seems to gather round it like black-robed figures at an arcane rite. Valentina stepped to the edge, and saw her own twisted reflection staring back at her. \n\nShe knew what must be done. There were two ways to stop a hungry predator, no more, no less. Kill it, or feed it. \n\nSacrifice. \n\nKermanova. She sighed.\n\n*-ova*. It was an ancient honorific, from a dialect no longer spoken and a time long past. It meant *the dauntless.* Valentina gave a mirthless chortle at the horrid visage gazing up from the water.\n\n*If only they knew...* she thought bitterly. \n\n*It does not have to be like this,* the voice coaxed in her mind, *there is another way*.\n\nShe cast a rueful glance up at the featureless sky. *No. No, there is not.* Director Kermanev. Sergei. Tercella. Dibella. How many did she not even know? How many more would be hurt? How many would be lost? It had to end. It had to end *now*.\n\n*This will not solve anything. You will make it worse. Even \u003Cu\u003Ehe\u003C/u\u003E warned you of this!*\n\n*Deda*... she squeezed her eyes against the sting. But it was too late, now. \n\n*You do not comprehend the forces with which you meddle.* \n\nThat, too, no longer matters. \n\n*Such a waste, such... potential.*\n\n\u0022Who are you?\u0022 Valentina said to the wind, \u0022who are you really?\u0022\n\n*I have so many names...*\n\n\u0022*What* are you?\u0022\n\n*The voice of reason, in a world gone mad. Join us, and let your eyes be opened. It is not too late*.\n\nShe did open her eyes, a single running down her cheek. Indeed, he *had* warned her.\n\n*Never make noise, do what you must to survive. And never, ever take sides.*\n\n*I am sorry, Deda...*\n\nOverhead, the M\u00FCn broke through a rift in the clouds, and stared down on her like a blighted eye. With difficulty, she held its fell gaze. \n\n\u0022Whoever you are, whatever you are, before I go, know this..\u0022\n\nShe raised the bottle...\n\n\u0022...know that this night, you gain only a bitter enemy. I swear upon my family\u0027s name, I will be a scourge unto you. I will hunt you. I will find you. I will *fight* you.\u0022\n\n...and squeezed until it exploded in her hand.\n\n\u0022And I. Will. *Break*. You.\u0022\n\nThe voice cried out, it recoiled, raced back from her mind as if wounded. \n\n*You arrogant fool! You will loose your sanity!*\n\nValentina Kermanova turned, and began walking back toward the Cosmodrome, letting glass and pills and blood... and the still unbroken seal... fall from her outstretched hand, as the first hesitant snowflakes of winter drifted down around her. \n\n\u0022Come, and take it.\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T05:30:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 05:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T05:23:57Z","Content":"State Anthem of the Ussari Union (What\u0027s the nation\u0027s full title?)\n\nInstrumental: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5ZWzhhtlNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5ZWzhhtlNE)\n\n**Duuunnnnnnn**\n\n**In union assembled, how glorious and mighty!**\n\n**So noble and grand is our Imperium!**\n\n**Created upon the people\u2019s ideals!**\n\n**Unshakeable faith in our heroic cause!**\n\n**Chorus:**\n\n**Sing to our glorious union!
