After that process Bob will see this and try to make a exact copy of it in the actual game. Then he\u0027ll take a screenshot and up load his impression of the blueprint to the forums. Upon seeing the rocket, probe, rover, space station or spaceplane Bob has created, Bill will rate Bob on how close he became on a 5 star or 1 out of 10 system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my blueprint for the Munar Probe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/aIazET0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/aIazET0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zorque","CreatedById":86033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow\u0027s this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(BTW, it doesn\u0027t have enough get-up-n-go to make the mun orbit... gets to kerbin orbit though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZMleGu4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZMleGu4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find this challenge oddly interesting\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm *strokes non-existing beard* interesting...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zorque","CreatedById":86033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:36:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, it DID have enough to get to the Mun...

Oh dear, the name \u0022Noober I-2\u0022 is program here. First, there is a 50% chance of disassembly on the Pad when physics kick in (low launch clamps = not very rigid). If it doesn\u0027t, liftoff to booster and mainsail separation is suprisingly stable and with a near-perfect TWR. After that, the problems start. The intermediate stage Poodle has nowhere near enough thrust (TWR \u0026lt; 1), and shortly after that, air resistance and gravity do their job and return the crew to the surface. Crew survivability is no problem, even with last tank\u002Bengine still attached the parachute will not rip off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice challenge!
