Even then, the cover story had been impeccable, the renovated cold storage facility for the local fishing villages being politically popular, easy to hide one more freezer room in, and conveniently located to receive the occasional small shipment of Kerm seeds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecurity had been another matter of course, although to be fair they\u2019d had limited options. A cold store and its contents were valuable enough not to be left wholly unguarded but even so, excessive security around what was essentially a fish warehouse would almost certainly have attracted too much attention to be worth the trouble. In the end, they\u2019d\u00A0decided to rely on additional physical measures and discreet reinforcements to the Kerm freezer, rather than increasing the numbers of guards around the building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, finding enough \u003Cem\u003Eacceptable\u003C/em\u003E guards would have been a challenge in itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven before the politically disastrous Maldonian annexation, Confederacy sympathies had mostly lain with the President\u2019s - and Chief Ambassador Aldwell\u2019s - strong pro-Kerm stance. The resulting Wakiran skirmishes, the raft of new Veiidan trade tariffs, and the heightened border tensions with Doren, had only served to cement that stance in the public mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure chuckled sardonically. \u003Cem\u003EYeah, us politically neutral types are rarer than greenback herring these days. With good reason\u003C/em\u003E. He glanced at his companion who stared back at him expressionlessly, breath fogging in the oppressively chilly, fish-scented air. Both kerbals knelt and heaved open an access panel in the floor, exposing cable runs, pipes and a pair of subtly modified junction boxes. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo keys slipped into place and turned as one. With a faint click and a hiss of escaping gas, a section of wall panel slid open, revealing a shallow steel rack holding half a dozen white plastic trays, which were swiftly emptied into a pair of heavily insulated backpacks. Working with exaggerated, fastidious care, the figure knelt again and placed a small laminated card in the very centre of the open doorway before he and his companion calmly walked out of the freezer room, through the warehouse reception and out into a pleasantly warm Spierkan evening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bemused fisher-kerbs, who found the card the next morning, puzzled over it for a moment, before shrugging their shoulders and handing it in to the guard at the front desk, not noticing the sudden tightening of her expression when they explained where they\u2019d found it. She waited until their van was safely out of sight before locking the front door and racing down to freezer room four.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe open wall panel told it\u2019s own story. The guard turned and sprinted for the nearest phone. Behind her the card landed face up on the polished concrete floor, displaying a circle bisected by a wavy line. A stylised kerblet smiled from one side of the line, facing a stylised Kerm seed on the other. And underneath the circle were printed three words:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EChildren of Kerbin.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA door slammed and at long last, the truck in front rumbled through the checkpoint. Corrod hastily swallowed his mouthful of \u003Cem\u003Edjan\u003C/em\u003E, jamming the half-empty packet into his door tray and flicking off the radio. The traffic light overhead turned green and Corrod obediently edged his own vehicle into the inspection bay. In his wing mirror the queue of assorted trucks and wagons stretched back as far as he could see. A grey-uniformed kerbal tapped on his window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CImport permits please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrod retrieved a stack of forms from the passenger seat and, wordlessly, handed them over.

The border official merely glanced at him before continuing to peruse his paperwork.\u00A0\u201CStep out of your vehicle, please sir. I need you to unlock your trailer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMay I ask why?\u201D said Corrod pleasantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRoutine inspection, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have a lot of cargo to inspect.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m aware of that, sir but I must insist.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrod ground his teeth. \u201CVery well,\u201D he said. \u201CWill you need me to open all the containers too?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYour cooperation would be appreciated, sir.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrod stared at him flatly before climbing out of his truck cab and pointedly slamming the door behind him. Two more officials were waiting for them behind his trailer, one wearing an oddly shaped device strapped across his chest, a stubby wand on a curly black cable plugged into its side. The other was restraining a large and enthusiastic guard-beast on a leash, which snuffled at him as he walked past. It\u2019s handler pressed a cloth pad over its nose and for a moment Corrod thought he could detect a faint breath of cinnamon.\u00A0Resisting the urge to pat the creature on its furry head, he undid the long row of buckles holding the side curtain of his trailer closed. Sensing the three pairs of eyes crawling across his back all the while, he hauled the curtain open, not caring whether the rattling hid his muttered oaths or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guard-beast sprang onto the trailer and began nosing around the double row of containers strapped to it. Corrod climbed up behind it and walked slowly down the rows, opening the inspection hatches on each container as he went. Hopping off the tailgate he stood silently to one side and watched one of the officials scramble awkwardly onto the trailer behind him and poke his wand into the nearest hatch, studying a screen on his device as he did so. Carefully, he closed the hatch again and then, to Corrod\u2019s bemusement, methodically subjected each container to the same peculiar inspection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally the official clambered down from the the trailer and whistled sharply for his guard-beast. Catching Corrod\u2019s eye he jerked his hand across his chest and pointed at the trailer curtain. Corrod nodded and began closing up his truck. None of the three officials offered to help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYour manifest, sir. Thank you for cooperating with Doreni border security and have a safe onward journey.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrod stared at him expressionlessly then turned away and climbed back into his cab.

Cursing deck gunners scoured the horizon for contacts, eyes hidden behind mirrored shades. The Wakiran flag fluttered from their sterns, white diagonal slash clearly visible against a green background.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cluster of dark specks on the horizon resolved themselves into a loose formation of vessels unhurriedly steaming to the northeast. The Wakiran boats swung wide, skirting around the invaders, then coming at them again from the west, out of the sun. Deck officers peered through binoculars, searching in vain for any identifying marks or signals. The captain of the largest Wakiran vessel frowned as his third hailing attempt met with nothing but static. \u003Cem\u003EI don\u2019t know who you are my friends, but it\u2019s time you woke up. \u003C/em\u003E\u201CWarning shot - maximum range.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single flat crack from the deck gun echoed across the waves. Seemingly indifferent, the unidentified vessels steamed steadily onwards. The captain grimaced. \u201CHelm - stand by evasive. Gunners - second warning shot. Across their bows.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo shots whistled overhead. Abruptly, the loose formation broke apart, the air suddenly heavy with the roar marine engines at full throttle, punctuated with flat thunder of gunfire. Fountains of water erupted around the Wakiran forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEvasive action! All crews - return fire!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn board one of the unmarked boats a grim-faced figure watched the battle unfold. Satisfied that the enemy patrols were fully engaged, he raised one hand and brought it down in a short, chopping gesture. His helmskerb reacted instantly, swinging the boat round due east and making best speed for the Wakiran coast. Behind them, twin columns of smoke rose into the sky, two Wakiran vessels stopping to pick up the survivors, the others scattering in pursuit of the fleeing invaders. He closed his eyes briefly. \u003Cem\u003EThey did well. We will mourn them later.\u003C/em\u003E He stepped over to the chart table, studying it intently for a moment. \u201CBring us round; east by north-east.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boat sped onwards, slipping around the fringes of the Wakiran radar line, its captain calmly watching the oncoming cliffs. \u201CMake your course due north. Stand by decoys.\u201D Another chopping gesture and the deck crews released their net. A cascade of decking fragments, fittings and spare equipment, tumbled over the side, swiftly followed by the contents of an oil barrel. The deck officer studied the dark slick and floating debris with satisfaction before heading forward to the main cabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDecoy deployed, Captain.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure turned to face him. \u201CVery good.\u201D A gesture at the chart. \u201CThe cliffs will hide us from the remaining radar stations. By nightfall we\u2019ll be headed for Firesvar.\u201C The figure patted the insulated box by his feet, the bisected-circle emblem on his shoulder clearly visible for a moment. \u201CWhere our mission will truly begin.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely drew the worn square of cardboard from his pocket and rubbed his thumb over the embossed gold seal. Just hope these things don\u2019t have an expiry date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe check-in assistant watched the stooped figure approach, pack slung over one shoulder, clutching a glinting something in his other hand. Her eyebrows rose at the sight of his dusty green-trimmed collar and rose still further at the wrinkles around his eyes and weary expression on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan I help you, Keeper?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely looked up. \u201CI\u2019m not sure,\u201D he answered. \u201CDo you have any seats on the next flight to Barkton?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet me check that for you, Keeper.

Hello? Yes, the number is zero one four, two zero nine, one four six. It is? T-thank you very much. Good day to you too, ma\u2019am.\u201D She turned back to Enely. \u201CIf you could wait one moment, sir, I\u2019ll have somebody take you straight through to the priority lounge.

Jeb leaned against his car door, smiling faintly at memories of a drainpipe and a very much smaller signboard hidden behind an old bed sheet. \u003Cem\u003EAn empire so humble in fact that most of you were probably blissfully unaware of it\u003C/em\u003E, he murmured to himself. \u003Cem\u003EI think that rocket has long since flown.\u003C/em\u003E He watched the organised chaos enveloping the assembly and fitting warehouse for a moment. \u003Cem\u003EIt\u2019s been a while since the old junkyard days.

A crane swung into position overhead, lowering a complicated bundle of chains into position. Kerbals clambered onto the trailer, unbuckling thick restraining straps from a plastic shrouded pallet, reaching for dangling carabiners, making them fast. The foreman jumped up onto the trailer, checked the fittings then, stepping back, raised a portable radio to his mouth. The drooping chains slowly tightened, then lifted, hauling the heavy machine tool effortlessly into the air, swinging it clear of the trailer and setting it down next to the others. A second team of kerbals set to work unfastening the chains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScaffolding criss-crossed the gap between the Assembly and Fitting building and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s newly acquired warehouse. Shouting kerbals, most of them dressed in dark blue coveralls with CMB stitched in yellow across one pocket, struggled to make themselves heard over the steady din of hammering, scraping, and construction machinery. Jeb waved at the few workers he knew as he walked past. One of the CMB workers turned to see what was happening, eyes widening as he recognised the kerbonaut. A cheer went up, swelling as it rippled over the scaffolding, head after head swivelling round to watch Jebediah Kerman walk past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrinning, Jeb flashed the crowd a quick double thumbs-up before making his way to the kerbonaut training building. The warehouse doors were wide open, a small procession of engineers wheeling computers and other electronic equipment in on steel trolleys. An electric hand-truck rumbled past, carrying what looked like a modified Eve capsule on a wooden pallet. Jeb spotted Calzer standing by one of the doors, deep in conversation with another kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMorning, Calzer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalzer looked up. \u201CAfternoon, Jeb. You met Geoff yet?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t think so,\u201D Jeb stuck out a hand. \u201CJeb Kerman - pleased to meet you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other hesitated for a bare instant before shaking hands. \u201CGeofkin Kerman, Steadler Engineering.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlease thank your team for pulling this together on a short schedule,\u201D said Jeb. He swept his arm out, \u201CWe\u2019re having to pick up the pace a bit and we couldn\u2019t do it without a proper training facility. Speaking of which, Calz, how did the integrated sims go this morning?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot bad,\u201D said Calzer. \u201CLucan\u2019s all settled in over at Foxham and I\u2019m thinking Sherf lit a couple of fires under everyone at Alpha site because they got their share of the set-up work done double quick.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201D chuckled Jeb. \u201CTraining session go alright?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalzer waggled a hand back and forth. \u201CI\u2019ve seen better but considering that Tommal had to step up and replace James at the last minute, it went pretty well.

Time we started up a reserve crew rotation too I think, now that we\u2019ve got the hardware.\u201D He turned to Geofkin. \u201CAnother reason that we\u2019re very glad to have Steadler on board. Hasn\u2019t much mattered up to now if one of the crew was out sick for a couple of weeks. But now\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeoff nodded. \u201CWaste anything but time, Director Lodan said.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly,\u201D Jeb agreed. \u201CAnd on that note, it\u2019s about time I did some work today. I\u2019ll see you good kerbals at dinner - if anyone needs me before then, I\u2019ll either be wedged into a brand new Whirligig capsule or buried under a pile of hydraulics. Pleasure to meet you again, Geoff.\u201D And with a brisk wave, Jeb set off in the direction of the simulator room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI tell you, Genie, there hasn\u2019t been this kind of buzz around here since Kerbal 2!\u201D Jeb shovelled a forkful of meatcake hash into his mouth, grimaced and reached for the ketchup bottle. \u201CPains me to admit to it but Lodan is certainly making things happen!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho knew all that bureaucracy would be so good at organisation,\u201D said Geneney straight-faced.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb made a face at him. \u201CDepends if it\u2019s Institute bureaucracy.\u201D He shook his head with grudging respect. \u201CI\u2019m betting Lodan can push pens with the best of them but at least he isn\u2019t trying to micromanage the whole thing to death.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSays the kerbal who wouldn\u2019t go near a monthly report with a two metre strut,\u201D said Geneney dryly. \u201CYou might get a distinctly single-digit reply to that from the Accounts team too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSince when did we have an Accounts \u003Cem\u003Eteam\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSince we started sub-contracting with CMB and the rest,\u201C said Geneney. \u201CNot to mention putting out tenders for booster manufacturing. And before you ask, no, Rockomax couldn\u2019t take up the slack. Ademone\u2019s got enough on holding up her end of Pioneer, along with everything else.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb slowly stirred ketchup into his hash. \u201CHow did Wernher take it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPragmatically,\u201D said Geneney, \u201CBut then I\u2019m only tendering for the Minmus probes. Anything with a capsule on top still gets built here.\u201D He grinned. \u201CWe owe the Probodyne team a round of drinks too, next time we\u2019re over at Alpha. Turns out they were having problems with their landers - they were very respectful when they asked Wernher for help.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb laughed. \u201CThat would help.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CAnd he came through for them too! Brushed off the old LV-1 plans, adapted it for pressure-feed instead of turbo-pumps and rigged it up with one of those toroidal tanks that Seelan was playing around with. No need for landing legs - Minmus gravity is low enough that it can land on the tank. Put a minimal instrument package on the top - basically just a seismometer and a radio - and there you have it. Probodyne are calling them buttons and Wernher reckons an Eve booster should be able to lob a decent sized comsat and a handful of buttons into Minmus orbit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent,\u201D said Jeb, swallowing another mouthful. \u201CShould have a decent early warning system up\u00A0 and running by the time we get a crew out there. Reckon we\u2019ll need another controller to watch for outgassing?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s the plan,\u201D answered Geneney.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pushed his plate away. \u201CWho won the tender by the way?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbodyne Space Projects Ltd,\u201D said Geneney, \u201CNot a company I\u2019d heard of but Ademone\u2019s worked with them before and was happy enough with their work. They\u2019re basically the old Steadler propulsion department who struck out on their own when\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSteadler decided to focus on capsules,\u201D finished Jeb. \u201CSounds like they\u2019re worth keeping an eye on. It\u2019s not that long since Steadler reorganised and if they\u2019ve gone from a standing start to contracting for Rockomax in that time\u2026\u201D He nodded. \u201CDefinitely worth watching.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGot them both,\u201D reported Bobrie. \u201COrbiter systems look good, lander\u2019s on it\u2019s way down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPropulsion looking good,\u201D Ferlan called out. \u201CValves, line heaters and helium pressure are Go.\u201D He scanned his console, eyes flicking between the flight clock and the engine readouts. \u201CComing up on engine relight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermore checked her own console, watching the altitude and velocity indicators flicker past.

The velocity indicator began to slow and Ferlan confirmed what she already knew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIgnition confirmed, Autopilot on and holding.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGermore tapped a button, patching her console readouts through to the main screen.

He felt a brief moment of panic, foot sliding past a missing step before hitting the ground with a thud.

The second was the crude hammock that he was lying in. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes, vaguely aware that something around him was creaking and popping. Liquid gurgled through a pipe next to his ear and a fan blew a tepid stream of metallic smelling air over his face. Gradually his eyes adjusted to the gloom, taking in the metal walls illuminated by firefly lights and softly glowing patches. Light crept into the room around a pair of window blinds, oddly lambent for daylight, reminding him more of\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMunlight!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan jerked in his hammock, remembering at the last minute not to sit up too suddenly.

He retrieved Tommal\u2019s life support pack, checking the water and oxygen gauges on the back and held it out for Tommal to wriggle into his chest harness. He watched his commander unplug himself from the lander systems and connect up the hoses from the backpack to his spacesuit, mentally ticking off items on the checklist as they went. \u201CLet me just check those hoses, Tom. OK, they\u2019re locked in tight. Ready for your helmet?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal nodded. Lucan lifted his helmet into place and locked it onto his neck ring.

Quietly, Lucan set about securing the sample boxes and loose equipment whilst Tommal piled up the backpacks and other EVA gear, for disposal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter their initial exuberance, conversation with Mission Control became steadily more businesslike as Tommal and Lucan worked through their checklist. Surplus gear was thrown overboard,\u00A0 communication systems were checked, guidance and radar systems were double checked, engine readouts were scrutinised by Mission Control and kerbonauts alike. As their preparations for lift-off continued, Lucan\u2019s acknowledgements and comments grew increasingly terse. Tommal glanced over at Lucan in concern, but he carefully avoided making any comments over the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Flight.

Got everything we came for, left a bunch of extra samples for Probodyne to scoop up and poke at, once we\u2019re gone, proved out the trackers.

You\u2019re gonna press that button, that decoupler will pop right off and then we\u2019re out of here.

Not much else we can do.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan nodded slowly. \u201CI guess not.\u201D He straightened up. \u201CAnd those moving parts were built by the best kerbals in the business.

Lucan stared fixedly at the mission clock, shuffling his boots securely into their restraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CT minus two minutes on my mark, Pioneer\u2026 Mark.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMarked, Flight.

Even if it had, he probably wouldn\u0027t have had time to do much work on them at the Institute before he, Jeb and the rest of the fledgling KIS got kicked out.

The larger LV-2 and LV-3 engines, developed by Wernher and Jeb as part of Jeb\u0027s final year project, were enough (barely) to get a couple of sounding rockets off the ground. The early KIS engines were all plagued by power issues to a greater or lesser extent, right up to the LV-15 used on the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EKerbin\u003C/em\u003E boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor comparison, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://archive.org/details/GPN-2002-000140\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E is a Goddard P series rocket, which were the first of his to use turbopumps.

Keeping the spare gloves bagged until the last minute sure helped - they didn\u2019t get a chance to get junked up like the EVA gloves.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy, Pioneer. FD has a circularisation update for you. No changes to attitude, delta-v fifteen dot five metres per second.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll take that, Flight, said Tommal. \u201CPretty close to our first-pass calculation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGot them on radar now, Flight,\u201D Fredner announced. \u201CI make their distance to be three hundred seventy kilometres, closing at one twenty two metres per second.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAgreed,\u201D said Lucan, \u201CThree hundred seventy, closing at one twenty two.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CForty second to loss of signal, team. Good luck.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Flight. See you on the next pass.\u201D Tommal waited for the expected rush of static before flipping his radio back to a direct link to the \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 5\u003C/em\u003E capsule. \u201CYou still with us, Fred?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWay ahead of you, Tom, just like always.\u201D Fredner paused. \u201CSo what was it really like down there, guys?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal stared at his microphone for a moment. \u201CSpectacular,\u201D he said at last. \u201CThe flying matched up pretty well to the sims in the end but that gravity\u2026nothing could match up to that. The training team did their best but that harness just isn\u2019t the same. All of you feels light and when you take a jump - you just keep going and going and going.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat scenery too,\u201D said Lucan, \u201Cwhich is not something I thought I\u2019d get excited about, especially after listening to Jeb and Jondun go on about it. But yeah - even without Kerbin hanging in the sky, it really was like walking on another world.\u201D He laughed. \u201CWhich sounds pretty stupid put like that but I can\u2019t think of a better way of describing it. How about you, Fred? What was it like being the lone explorer?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPeaceful,\u201D said Fredner wryly. \u201CDefinitely the best thing about the Far side - not having Mission Control in your ear the whole time.\u201D His voice shifted subtly. \u201CActually, that\u2019s not true. Being on your own did make it different. Kerbin somewhere over \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u003C/em\u003E, you guys on the surface somewhere down \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u003C/em\u003E. And Kerm knows what else out of the window. Stars by the thousand, most of them prob\u2019ly with their own planets, even if we can\u2019t see them, maybe even other life on some of them. We\u2019re not really so far out here, guys. Just barely paddling in the shallows.\u201D He coughed. \u201CBut enough of this. You two had better get set up for circularisation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal checked his navball. \u201CWe\u2019re good. Attitude all zeros. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E holding steady.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan tried to ignore the unwelcome queasiness in the pit of his stomach. Busy with the lander computer, he didn\u2019t notice Tommal\u2019s quick glance. \u201CBurn program loaded. Delta-v, fifteen dot five on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Guidance on primary.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSixty seconds,\u201D said Tommal calmly. He flicked his microphone over to their private channel. \u201CThese old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters are even tougher than that ascent engine, Lucan. We\u2019re gonna be fine.\u201D He flipped back to the air-to-air loop. \u201CGo at twenty.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reaction control system fired for a handful of seconds, its meagre thrust still more than sufficient to propel the lightweight lander - fuel expended and barely more than a cabin -\u00A0 and its two occupants. Lucan\u2019s feet settled against the cabin floor and then, as quickly as it began, the burn was over. Lucan stabbed out a command on his keyboard. \u201CNinety-five by ninety-three dot seven,\u201D he said in relief. \u201CHow does that compare with you, Fred?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re not quite with me,\u201D Fredner answered, \u201Cbut the shaping burn shouldn\u2019t be more than a metre per second at most. Quick dab of the thrusters ought to do it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou weren\u2019t fooling about that bag of charcoal!\u201D Fredner exclaimed, peering down through the lander hatch into a hazy dark-grey cloud. \u201CDust bags coming through!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan stepped into his bag, stripping off his filthy spacesuit amidst a shower of debris. Pulling the drawstring closed, he passed the bag up to Fredner, who stowed it under the navigator\u2019s couch in the capsule. Lucan emerged from the lander to find his crewmate waiting for him with a squeeze tube of water and a pack of wipes, both pleasantly cold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStowed them both next to the outflow pipe from evaporator A.\u201D Fredner reached into the open access panel and retrieved another squeeze bottle. \u201CFlight thought you\u2019d both appreciate a cold one after a hard day\u2019s work on the M\u00FCn.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan took a long drink, sighing with pleasure as the chilly globules splashed over the roof of his mouth. \u201CCertainly do - thanks, Fred. Why don\u2019t I get that access panel back on, whilst you stow Tom\u2019s suit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredner grinned at him. \u201CThat was the plan.\u201D He pulled himself over to the hatch. \u201CYou about done in there, Tom?\u201D A bagful of spacesuit drifting towards the hatchway was his only answer. Deftly he snagged it from midair, manoeuvred it under the commander\u2019s couch and passed Tommal his squeeze bottle.\u00A0Tommal raised his eyebrows at the chilled bottle and the sight of Lucan twisting the access panel latches closed. He opened his mouth to speak, thought better of it and contented himself with a swallow of water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen you two have finished putting my spacecraft back together, you might want to check the high-gain alignment before reacquisition time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAlready checked,\u201D said Fredner, \u201CShould be picking them up any time now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026ight, Fr\u2026r. Co\u2026n\u2026.ner.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredner ignored Tommal\u2019s pointed expression.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Fredner. Come in, Fredner.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPioneer, Flight. Both prospectors safely on board!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Pioneer. Got a lot of smiling faces down here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThree big ones up here too, Flight,\u201D said Fredner. \u201COkay, I\u2019ve got Lucan here looking for TKI updates, so I\u2019m going to hand you over to him, whilst I head back and help Tom with the lander.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Fred. Please remind Tom to leave the lander computer in REMOTE for the de-orbit and seismometer calibration test.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWill do, Flight.\u201D Fredner unplugged his headset and lowered himself into the equipment bay. Working in companionable silence, he and Tommal began to unload the lander, pausing occasionally to consult an equipment list taped to the wall. Finally, he poked his head through the lander hatch for last, long look around the dusty cabin. He nodded to himself, fitted the hatch back into place and pulled the locking lever closed with a clunk.\u00A0Lucan looked up as Fredner climbed into his couch beside him, settled his headset into place and reached for the environmental system controls. \u201CPioneer, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead, Pioneer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHatch secured, Flight. Tom\u2019s squaring everything away down in the equipment bay. Ready for re-press test?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re ready, Pioneer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredner flipped a switch. The cabin pressure gauge edged upwards, accompanied by a more insistent drone from the environmental system fans. \u201COverpressure holding at fifteen percent, Flight. Vent after jettison?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCapSys confirms, Fred. Lucan has the attitude data for the jettison manoeuvre, to be followed by a five second plus-z from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFive second plus-z,\u201D Fredner repeated. \u201CGot it, Flight. Looks like we\u2019re about to lose you, so we\u2019ll get set up for jettison and see you on the next pass.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSpeak soon, Pioneer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EPioneer 5\u003C/em\u003E disappeared over the Munar horizon, the radio link to Mission Control crackling and then cutting out precisely as Tommal and his crew expected. Shortly afterwards four puffs of flash-frozen vapour appeared at the join between capsule and lander cabin, before the two spacecraft drifted apart, the lander slowly tumbling as it went. With a brief burst from the service module thrusters, \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 5\u003C/em\u003E pulled away. Unseen lights sprang on across the lander\u2019s instrument panel and, the autopilot systems checking the tumble with short rattling pulses from its manoeuvring thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two spacecraft flew on around the M\u00FCn. Then, with another flicker of hidden lights, the lander cabin pivoted in space, aiming it\u2019s thrusters along an invisible line. The thrusters came on - and stayed on, slowing the fragile metal shell, breaking the delicate balance between speed and gravity, and letting the M\u00FCn claim it once more. As the crew of Pioneer 5 began their final orbit, the spacecraft which, mere hours before, had brought two kerbals back from the Munar surface, began it\u2019s final journey.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGimbal drives are Go on pitch, roll and yaw. Tank pressures nominal, all valve controllers drawing power.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Fred. How\u2019s our guidance, Lucan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan unclenched his fingers from the edge of his keyboard and quickly scanned his checklist again. \u201CBurn program loaded, platform aligned for TKI. Gimbal angles set for ignition. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in AUTO, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E propellant levels safe above reserve and balanced across all quads.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the spacecraft alignment is green,\u201D finished Tommal. \u003Cem\u003ECorrect end pointing forward\u003C/em\u003E, he added silently, eying Lucan\u2019s taut expression and whitened knuckles. \u201CSix minutes to ignition.

Proceeding on blue light at sixty and if we don\u2019t get a light we\u2019re going with backup plan B.\u00A0 Engine stop, SME override ON, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to HOLD. We reestablish contact with Mission Control, check the systems and go for the manual burn on orbit TKI plus two.\u201D He paused. \u201CNot that we\u2019ll need it. We\u2019ll be catching the first train home.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan watched the flight clock count away the seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBlue light!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reaction control thrusters nudged him in the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe got ullage\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe service module engine slammed him into his couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIgnition!

Pitch and roll are good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CChamber pressures steady,\u201D added Fredner. \u201CBurning at one minute.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan stared fixedly at the velocity readout.

First train home, one stop only - the Great Tranquil Sea!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe train creaked and juddered its way to a stop, threatening to spill the contents of the luggage racks over the carriage floor. Enely shouldered his pack, patted his pockets to check for anything missing, and stepped onto the platform. This far down the line from Barkton, the station was barely more than a pair of platforms and a waiting room. Greenery ran riot; the colourful vines trellised up the outside wall enthusiastically competing with the profusion of blooms bursting through a nearby fence. Enely mopped his brow on his poncho sleeve and looked around for the exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next carriage along disgorged a group of chattering kerbals, some of them struggling to squeeze their backpacks through the train doors. Enely caught snatches of conversation, frowning at the occasional unfamiliar word, the local Kolan accent still very strange to his ear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...well there is a bus but it\u0027s only a couple of days on foot. We\u0027d planned to just walk it - you\u0027d be welcome to join us. What\u0027s that? Oh - riverside\u0027s the quickest way - nice and shady in this heat. Good swimming too in places. Yes - yes, me and Tivie came this time last year - met most of this sorry bunch along the way!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely heard laughter accompanied by other, mock indignant, comments aimed at Tivie\u0027s partner, followed by a mumbled question that he couldn\u0027t quite make out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, Kerm yes. Expect we\u0027ll all be back here next year too, sooner if we can manage it. Communing with the Sage...\u0022 The voice fell silent for a moment. \u0022The story - our story - would be enough by itself but with Jonton telling it...\u0022 Enely\u0027s ears pricked up. \u0022Television is the nearest I can get to it - except you\u0027re right there in the picture, smelling the fish and salt air, feeling what it was like to really be there. Sometimes I could almost feel the cobbles under my feet, the wind on my face...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHesitantly, Enely approached the group. \u0022Um, excuse me.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other spun round to face him, raising his eyebrows at the darker skinned, weather-beaten figure in front of him. \u0022Can I help you...?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Enely. I\u0027m sorry to intrude but I couldn\u0027t help overhearing. Did you say you were on the way to see Jonton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well not in so many words but yes. Yes we are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You mentioned a Sage,\u0022 said Enely carefully. \u0022Is that the same person as Jonton?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other kerbal looked at him quizzically. \u0022That\u0027s right. Jonton Kermol, otherwise known as the Sage of Barkton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded. \u0022I think I\u0027m looking for him too. Do you know where I might find him?\u0022 He saw the curious looks around him. \u0022A friend told me I should meet him but he\u0027s not from around here and his directions were rather vague. \u0022 He smiled, \u0022I am fortunate to find others going the same way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re not the first lost pilgrim we\u0027ve met along the way,\u0022 came the cheerful reply. \u0022Fairly got a name for himself, Jonton has - we\u0027ve met all kinds on the road this year.\u0022 He looked at Enely frankly. \u0022You\u0027ve come quite a ways too, if I\u0027m any judge of accents. Southern Wakiran?\u0022 He stuck his hand out. \u0022But I\u0027m forgetting myself. Calfrey Kerman - call me Cal!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely shook hands. \u0022It is good to meet you, Cal. You were nearly right about my accent too. I\u0027m from mid-Wakira originally - a small Grove on the edge of the Hazachi desert.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalfrey whistled. \u0022Your folks sure picked a tough row to hoe there.\u0022 He settled his pack onto his shoulders. \u0022Day\u0027s a wasting though. We can show you to the bus stop if you like, though you\u0027d be welcome to join us. It\u0027s a couple of days walk to Jonton\u0027s Grove but I don\u0027t reckon a little walking is going to worry a Hazachim.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No,\u0022 agreed Enely. \u0022And that would be most kind - thank you.\u0022 He picked up his own pack. \u0022I\u0027m ready when you are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, Enely - what on Kerbin do you farm next to a desert? Can\u0027t think much of anything would grow well there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely watched a pair of birds flitting over the river. \u0022Cacti mainly,\u0022 he said. \u0022Malkaball is our staple crop but we grow pepper cactus too, as well as kerbahusk and a couple of others. Although if we could eat speargrass then we\u0027d never lack for food - it\u0027s all our Kerm can do to keep it out of the fields. It\u0027s not even any good for brewing.\u0022 He looked at Cal solemnly \u0022If you really want to go blind of course, it\u0027s up to you. But there are many quicker and less painful ways of doing it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal laughed. \u0022Something must eat it. Have to admit though, I never thought of farming cacti. Guess I\u0027ve seen too many films - I always think of two, maybe three cacti in the middle of a load of sand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh no,\u0022 said Enely, \u0022You should see the malkaball fields when they\u0027re ready for harvest. Hundreds of brown balls all lined up in rows. Looking very much like the real thing but neater.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The real thing?\u0022 said Cal curiously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely stared at his feet, flushing slightly. \u0022It works better in the Hazachim dialect,\u0022 he explained. \u0022You know about mallek of course. Four legs, humps, bad temper. Malka is our word for bad tempered, so most of the time we just call the mallek, malka.\u0022 He glanced at Cal\u0027s puzzled expression.\u0022So a malkaball is a small brown ball that...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal hastily covered his mouth, stifling laughter behind a cough. \u0022Sounds appetising,\u0022 he said at last. \u0022Do they taste as good as they look?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Much better than they look,\u0022 said Enely. \u0022Bake them in a sand pit with the right spices and they\u0027re actually quite sathy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sathy?\u0022 asked Cal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely frowned. \u0022How to explain?\u0022 He scratched his neck, working a finger under his poncho. \u0022It\u0027s like the word Kerm. Lots of different meanings depending on how and when you say it. He tugged at his backpack straps letting a trace of irony creep into his voice. \u0022This pack is sathy, especially in this heat. The meal I had on the train was quite sathy all things considered. And this view,\u0022 he swept out his arm. \u0022All the green, no sand, or mallek in sight. That is definitely sathy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well then,\u0022 said Cal, \u0022That gravel spur looks like a sathy enough place for lunch. What do you reckon folks?\u0022 he called.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone agreed that the spur would indeed be a fine place to stop for a, much overdue, lunch. Packs were doffed, blankets and towels spread out on the ground and parcels and bottles unearthed. In short order, a party of hungry kerbals were sprawled companionably by the river, making serious inroads into their provisions. Enely sat cross-legged on his towel, munching a greenleaf roll and staring at the river banks in fascination. Clouds of insects hovered by the water\u0027s edge, to the obvious delight of the tiny iridescent birds that darted back and forth, eating their fill.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA green lump, which Enely had assumed to be a rock suddenly fired out a long sticky tongue that snapped back into its mouth coated with dark specks. Other creatures hooted and squawked, hidden amongst the trees. A large hairy something, poked its nose out of the undergrowth, seemed to sniff disapprovingly at the green skinned figures sitting on the gravel and retreated amidst a crackling of disturbed foliage. Enely sighed contentedly and took another bite of greenleaf. He was startled from his reverie by a sudden splash and a shouted \u0022Come on in - the water\u0027s lovely!\u0022 Two more of his companions threw themselves into the river after their friend and set to splashing as much water over her as they could. Sparkling droplets filled the air, scattered through with the green and blue wings of the bolder birds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You joining us, Enely?\u0022 Cal stood over him, wearing nothing but an eye-watering pair of shorts that somehow managed to clash with everything else around them. He saw Enely\u0027s hesitant expression. \u0022How about a paddle then - bit of cold water is right sathy on the feet.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely laughed. \u0022You\u0027re getting the hang of it,\u0022 he said, \u0022but what is \u0027paddling\u0027?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal looked at him nonplussed. \u0022What\u0027s paddling? Well, I guess you wouldn\u0027t get much of a chance on the edge of a desert.\u0022 He pointed at his feet. \u0022It\u0027s this - walking in the water. Nothing like it after a hard morning\u0027s walk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely nodded slowly. \u0022I can imagine that. I\u0027m afraid I didn\u0027t bring any paddling shorts though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was Cal\u0027s turn to laugh. \u0022Oh these are just for swimming later. Just take your boots and socks off, maybe hitch up that poncho a little - you\u0027ll be fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInwardly, Enely shrugged. He unlaced his boots and arranged them neatly by his towel with his socks stuffed in the tops. From long ingrained habit he quickly glanced round to fix his position, then followed Cal into the river shallows. The gravel crunched underfoot, pleasantly massaging the soles of his feet and, he decided, Cal was quite right - the cold water was most sathy on the feet. He waded out up to his knees, feeling the slow-moving river gradually washing the aches and tension out of his legs. Then he stopped and turned to watch the others cavorting in the deeper water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coin for them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely jumped, the sudden movement splashing water over the hem of his poncho. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, Cal - you startled me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You did have a real thousand metre stare going there,\u0022 said Cal quietly. \u0022Everything alright, Enely?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely sighed. \u0022Not really,\u0022 he replied, \u0022but they\u0027re better than they have been for a long time. Thank you, Cal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not sure what I did but you\u0027re very welcome to it,\u0022 said Cal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s the point I think,\u0022 said Enely. \u0022You didn\u0027t need to do anything but you did.\u0022 He looked at Cal. \u0022Wakira is not a quiet place at the moment. Too many borders and too little trust. My Grove got caught up in the fighting.\u0022 He saw Cal wince in sympathy. \u0022Things happened that I don\u0027t really want to talk about - and probably shouldn\u0027t talk about if I did - but, if you\u0027ll excuse the expression, there\u0027s nothing left for me there now. As I told you, a friend suggested that Jonton might be able to help although I don\u0027t know how.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely dragged his toes through a patch of mud. \u0022I like Kolus. It is a strange place and a wonderfully alive place after my Grove. But it is not home.\u0022 He took a deep breath. \u0022Which is why it is good to be reminded that there are still good and kindhearted kerbals in this world, even in such times as these.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal stared awkwardly at his feet.\u0022I think we mostly are still,\u0022 he said. \u0022Kerbals, that is. \u00A0Somebody would have helped you at that railway station if we hadn\u0027t happened by.\u0022 He looked at Enely nervously. \u0022Anyhow - this paddling is something you need to work up to. Time we were getting back on the road.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun threw shadows from their feet as Enely\u0027s tired but excited group of companions approached the marquee field. Enely noted the overflowing strips of flowers around its edges, their colours muted in the lambent afternoon light. But before he could ask Cal or Tivie about them they were greeted by a cheerfully no-nonsense kerbal, who quickly sized them up, and her young son.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good evening and welcome to our Grove! Marquees only tonight, I\u0027m afraid - our spare rooms are all taken. They\u0027re not much but they\u0027ll keep the rain off your head and we can give you your own bit of space, privacy screen if any of you need one, and a bite to eat or drink. Moss rooms are round the back under the square tents if you need to freshen up. For anything else, just speak to anyone in a straw hat and tell them Meleny told \u0027em to sort you out!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal stepped forward with a smile. \u0022Canvas over our heads and a space to stretch out will do us fine, Meleny. Anything after that\u0027ll be yellow clover on the stew. I\u0027m Cal by the way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pleased to meet you, Cal. Head on in and make yourselves at home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, Meleny. Come on folks - lets go find ourselves a space.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, the marquee was pleasantly dusky, lit only by a handful of portable electric lanterns. Enely\u0027s nose twitched at the scents of old canvas and woodsmoke, the fainter resinous tang of newly sawn timber catching in the back of his throat. A row of pallets stretched down either side of the enclosure, each with a pillow, a folded blanket and a small trunk at its foot. A small group of kerbals sat in the central space, a Tiles set laid out between them. Others lay on their pallets reading by lantern-light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s take the far end,\u0022 said Cal softly, \u0022Half of us one one side, the rest on the other. There\u0027s a bite to eat out the back once we\u0027re unpacked, unless my nose is lying to me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely waited for the others to take a pallet before shrugging out of his pack and choosing a space for himself. He emptied his possessions onto his bed and set about re-folding his clothes and placing them carefully into the trunk. A minimal wash bag and mess kit followed them. A few treasured or items were taken out, inspected and stowed away inside his poncho, along with a leather coin purse, then Enely stood up, finger combing his hair into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Light traveller huh,\u0022 said Cal, closing the lid on his own trunk. \u0022C\u0027mon - lets go find that bite to eat. Rest of the unpacking will go easier with a full stomach.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we\u0027re lucky, he\u0027ll be just about done by the time we\u0027re leaving,\u0022 said Tivie, standing up herself. \u0022My partner is the world\u0027s worst packer,\u0022 she explained to Enely, ignoring Cal\u0027s mock-wounded look. \u0022Takes forever and he always manages to forget something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well it\u0027s a good thing that I always go hiking with the world\u0027s most organised kerbal then,\u0022 said Cal cheerfully, slipping his arm around her waist and steering her deftly towards the marquee opening. Outside a camp kitchen had been set up under an awning and Enely\u0027s stomach rumbled at the smell rising from a large pot. He looked around in embarrassment but Cal and Tivie had already joined the dinner queue and were waiting, bowls in hand, by a long table. \u00A0Enely went over to join them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA smiling kerbal took his bowl and filled it with a generous ladleful of thick stew before sprinkling it with small yellow leaves and adding a hunk of dark bread. Enely thanked him politely, looking around for his friends. A radio chattered away in the background, Enely caught snatches of conversation about parachutes and welcoming somebody home, much to the evident and noisy relief of a large group sitting around a nearby table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah yes - the Munwalkers,\u0022 said Cal. \u0022Saw the launch on television before we set off - incredible sight, just incredible. Forgot they were coming home today but it sounds like they\u0027re back in one piece. Wonder if they\u0027ll be going to Duna too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably,\u0022 said Enely, inspecting his dinner. The stew seemed to consist of some kind of white bean, mashed up and mixed with sliced mushrooms and shredded green vegetables, and topped with yellow leaves. He shrugged and picked up his spoon, eyes widening slightly as he took his first mouthful. \u0022This is...very good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal swallowed his own mouthful. \u0022Yep. Good old white bean stew. Can\u0027t go wrong with it.\u0022 He tore off a piece of bread, scooping up more stew with it. \u0022The Kolan Klassic, my mother used to call it.\u0022 He chewed his bread approvingly. \u0022Whoever baked this, Mum wouldn\u0027t have kicked them out of the kitchen either. \u0027Spect we\u0027ll be waiting a day or sobefore seeing the Sage but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to be much of a hardship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe boat rode at anchor off the coast of Firesvar; no harbour in sight but close enough to shore for protection from the worst of the ocean swells. Its crew moved with quiet purpose, filling backpacks with supplies, taking inventories of tents, camping gear and other materials and lowering them into the waiting dinghies. Finally, all was ready. The Captain nodded at his chosen companions and, one by one, they scrambled over the side into the dinghies, the fabric swaddled tools - and weapons - on their backs thudding dully against one another. Ropes slipped free, gloved hands shoved hard against varnished planks and the landing craft edged away from the larger boat, waves slapping softly against inflated rubberised fabric.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand signal and four pairs of oars dipped into the water with barely a splash. The vessels glided soundlessly through the night, the scant sound from the oars hidden by the noise of wind and wave and occasional lonely seabird.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden gust of rotting seaweed and the rattle and hiss of wave-dragged shingle marked their distance to the shoreline. A last powerful stroke from the rowers and both dinghies hit the beach with a crunch of pebbles against fabric. Their crews leapt clear, seizing grab handles and carrying their now cumbersome craft swiftly up the beach towards the waiting caves. The narrow entrance to one hid a much larger interior and the Captain quietly ordered them to leave the dinghies there. He trekked a short distance along the beach, checking that the cave mouth was sufficient to hide its contents from casually prying eyes, before rejoining the rest and leading them inland at a jog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time they reached the trees, the sky was beginning to lighten, the trills and whistles from unfamiliar birds greeting them as they plunged into the forest. The first crimson fingers of dawn found them in a clearing, quietly putting down their burdens. The Captain pulled a white insulated box from his pack, the circular design on its lid cast into sharp, cerise-tinged relief as he set it on the ground. Reverently, one of the waiting kerbals unwound the blanket from the spade he was carrying and handed it to her leader.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorking swiftly, the Captain dug a hole, measuring its depth against the spade handle. He opened the box and gently lifted out a small fibrous gourd, releasing a puff of chilly, cinnamon laced vapour into the morning air.
