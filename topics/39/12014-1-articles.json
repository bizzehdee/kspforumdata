Well, try to contain yourself, instead, you can contribute positively by using constructive criticism. For the unaware, this basically means that you correct someone without making them aware that you believe they are horrible and that they should feel bad about it. Good criticism will in most cases be used for learning rather than discarded as insults, which in the end goes a long way in helping along those that still have much to learn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDisclaimer\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis board and what it contains is not in any way canon with the game itself, hence why it is the fan-works board. Squad could technically decide themselves to use any of the content in here, but that is out of our hands entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
