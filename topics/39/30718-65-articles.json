Wedging his feet under a pair of convenient restraints, he hooked it up to the nearest vacuum hose, checked the seal, then flipped a pair of wall-mounted switches.

Leaving the gloves floating in front of him, he slipped a finger under the upper band of his communications headcap and scratched his forehead, before settling the cap into a more comfortable position. Then he pulled his bubble helmet over his head and twisted it to the half-lock position on his neck ring. Finally, he wormed his hands into his suit gloves and locked them onto the wrist collars on his suit. Flexing his fingers, he turned to face Calley. \u0022Check me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalley nodded, inspecting his suit seals and fittings. \u0022You\u0027re good.\u0022 By the time she\u0027d donned her own helmet and gloves, James was ready to inspect them in turn, before attending to his own suit.

Calley waited for him to get clear before turning upside down herself and, pausing briefly for one last look at Kerbin from the bridge windows, disappeared after him.\u00A0 James glanced across at the Systems status board and nodded in satisfaction before switching off the bridge lights and following his crew to the main airlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEve 3\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s docking tunnel felt almost claustrophobic after Tenacity\u0027s spacious interior and James was glad to get to his seat without bumping into anything.

With a small smile, he toggled his microphone. \u201CWe\u2019re going to take five up here, Flight and make sure nothing\u2019s floating loose before we orient for the deorbit burn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill looked around the scrupulously tidy cabin and frowned.

We\u2019re all squared away up here and orienting for retrofire.

Deft bursts of thruster fire rolled them upright to a vista of the oceans and continents of their homeworld unrolling beneath their spacecraft and out of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLined up and ready, Flight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CCopy, Three.

Mark.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the minutes ticked away, the\u003Cem\u003E Eve 3\u003C/em\u003E crew checked and rechecked their spacecraft systems, Bill keeping a watchful eye on the service module engine readouts all the while. James tightened his couch straps, watching Bill and Calley do the same from the corner of his eye. Then the familiar blue light glowed on the instrument panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGo at sixty.\u201D Calley pushed the PROCEED button, handing control over to the flight computer. A series of jolts pushed the crew into their seats, a burst from the service module thrusters followed, precisely on schedule, by a short burn from the main engine. The thrusters fired again, then everything went quiet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CResiduals nulled, periapsis on the nose. Orienting to jettison attitude.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\u2019s hands moved across the instrument panel. \u201CRe-entry batteries online. External life-support and power OFF, SPS valves closed, SM gimbals locked.\u201D He flicked a pair of switches. \u201CDecoupler armed, backup pyros armed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis is going to kick,\u201D James noted. \u201CWhenever you\u2019re ready, Bill.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill nodded and flipped back the guard from the SM-JETT button. \u201CJettisoning.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe command module rocked and then steadied amidst a clatter of solenoids from the reaction control system. James nudged his hand controllers, yawing Eve 3 back onto a retrograde orientation. Freed from the bulky service module, the capsule\u2019s movements were quick and precise. Calley turned to her side window, craning her neck as she searched for the service module. \u201CGot it! Good separation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJames toggled his microphone. \u201CFlight, Three. Clean burn, service module clear.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CWe concur, Three. Punch a hole in the sky for us.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sky outside Calley\u2019s window suddenly brightened as the computer rolled Eve 3 into a face-down attitude for re-entry. Far below, she caught glimpses of blue and green through the clouds, Kerbin expanding to fill her side window as the capsule curved out of orbit. Then the g-meter chimed in her ear and the view outside began to take on a hazy, luminescent glow. Beside her, Bill and James stared calmly at the instrument panel as the g-forces climbed and the sky outside shifted to yellow and then a fiery orange, shot through with streaks of flame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI guess this is a walk in the park compared to coming home from the M\u00FCn or flying a tin-can capsule strapped to a set of home-made solid boosters.\u003C/em\u003E She forced herself to concentrate on her breathing as the weight on her chest steadily increased. Incandescent flecks shot past the window and the capsule began to vibrate as it ploughed through ever-thickening air. Calley closed her eyes and held on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt last, the crushing forces began to recede, the fires outside fading to a dull red and then replaced by clear blue sky. Calley checked the altimeter and braced herself. With a loud crack from outside, the plummeting capsule began to slow. A second crack marked the departure of the drogues, followed moments later by a heavy thump as the main parachutes shot off their rails.

A handful of controllers sat behind them, filling out their mission logs and keeping a watchful eye on the telemetry feeds from Tenacity. Nelton sat behind the flight director\u2019s console typing up her own report, when a muted jangle broke her concentration.

Any false statements, whether purposeful or inadvertent, shall constitute a betrayal of this Council of Twelve Pillars; punishable, consecutively, to the fullest possible extent by law, in each of the six Regionalities of Kerbin. Is this clearly understood by all present?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorsen made a brief notation on his pad, watching and listening as each of the four indicated their assent, then looked up at the President. \u201CI, Corsen Kerman, aide to the Presidency of Kolus, do hereby confirm the understanding of all present.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery well,\u201D Obrick folded his hands in front of him. \u201CKolus thanks Lodan Kerman, director of the Kerbin Space Agency; Ademone Kerman, company manager, Rockomax Corporation, and Geneney Kerman, Flight Director, Kerbin Space Agency, for their written reports. Kolus recognises the attendance, as ordered, of Jebediah Kerman, non-executive director of the White Cross Company, former owner and company manager of the Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Company.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals, the business before this Council concerns a potential abuse of executive authority in the management and oversight of recent Kerbin Space Agency activities. The Council has formed a preliminary opinion on this matter based on the aforementioned written reports. You have each been separately summoned to these chambers to provide a verbal testimony of the events surrounding the suspected abuse, which testimony shall be added to those reports.\u201D Obrick turned to face Corsen. \u201CIf you would bring them in, please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course, Mr President.\u201D Corsen set down his pad and crossed the office, shutting the door to the anteroom behind him with a quiet but definite sounding click. He returned with four soberly dressed office staffers, each of whom remained carefully expressionless at the sight of the four figures sitting in front of Obrick\u2019s desk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf you would follow me please, sir.\u201D The first staffer led Lodan out of the room.

He followed the staffer out of President Obrick\u2019s office and along a corridor to a plainly furnished meeting room. A jug of water and three glasses, along with a tape recorder, rested on a nondescript laminate table next to a tape recorder. Another kerbal sat at the far end, pen and stenography pad at the ready. Jeb eyed the minimalist office chairs with resignation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTake a seat please, Mr Jebediah. Can I offer you a coffee or a\u003Cem\u003E djeng \u003C/em\u003Ebefore we start?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E please,\u201D Jeb answered. He turned his head a fraction, half expecting the interview clerk to be making a note on his pad. The other favoured him with a professionally neutral look before setting his pen to one side. Jeb sighed inwardly and stared at the tape recorder; hands folded on his knees. The frosty silence was broken by the return of Obrick\u2019s staffer with two mugs of steaming djeng. She set one mug down in front of the clerk and the other in front of Jeb, who sipped it cautiously. His eyebrows rose and he took a longer drink, before setting the mug aside and sitting up straighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis interviewer reached under the table for her briefcase and pulled out a slim sheaf of papers, stapled together at one corner. She glanced at the topmost sheet before slotting a cassette into the recorder. After introducing herself, Jeb and the clerk for the record, she sat back in her chair and stared at the veteran kerbonaut for a second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s start at the beginning,\u201D she said at last. \u201CWhen were you first made aware of Director Lodan\u2019s intentions?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought for a moment before reeling off a date. \u201CIt was the day after Geneney and I communed with Guardian Elton.\u201D He saw a flicker of something cross his interviewer\u2019s face. \u201CAre you\u2026?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. We\u2019re aware of who \u2013 and what \u2013 Guardian Elton is. Please continue, Mr Jebediah.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded. \u201CWe were summoned to an urgent meeting at the Kerbin Space Agency\u2019s Alpha site. Director Lodan asked me to summarise our Communion with Elton and then presented his plan \u2013 although by his own admission it was more of an idea at that stage\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026and did Director Lodan indicate whether there was any legal basis for his plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney took a sip of coffee. \u201CHe did. He advised us that Special Orders 41 and 42 were still in force. Everyone at the meeting was aware of those Special Orders from a previous meeting with the Director, so we knew what they implied.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd how did Director Lodan know that the Special Orders hadn\u2019t been rescinded?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe mentioned a contact in President Obrick\u2019s office although he never told us the name of his contact\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t he tell us?\u201D Ademone looked at her interviewer levelly. \u201CIn case we ever found ourselves in this very situation, I expect. Director Lodan was very clear that the responsibility for his actions was his alone and he did not want them to jeopardise the Kerbin Space Agency in any way.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut if he was acting under two lawful Special Orders then surely acting on those orders would not jeopardise anything?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Ademone agreed. \u201CHowever, Director Lodan advised us that, as a practical matter, his authority to execute them was extremely limited, particularly on the scale required to restart Project Starseed\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Very well.\u201D Geneney looked uncomfortable. \u201CTo the best of my recollection, his exact words were: \u201CIf anyone chose to dispute it, I strongly suspect that both Special Orders would be annulled and the KSA Director would find himself behind bars for the rest of his natural life.\u201D\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd did this concern you?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course it did.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen why did you choose to continue working with Director Lodan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause it was clear that he was well aware of the legal risks and intended to do his utmost to keep the KSA on the right side of the law\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gave his interviewer an incredulous look. \u201CI don\u2019t believe that Director Lodan has ever been reckless in his entire life.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou said that he was risking spending the rest of his life behind bars? One might characterise that as recklessness.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe was taking a risk, yes. He wasn\u2019t being reckless.\u201D Jeb paused. \u201CIf you\u2019ll excuse the obvious analogy from a former kerbonaut, spaceflight is a risk but we don\u2019t do it recklessly. We train, we plan ahead, we try and limit the risks as far as we can.\u201D His face clouded over. \u201CAlthough we don\u2019t always see them before it\u2019s too late\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026no, he certainly wasn\u2019t reckless. He never is.\u201D Ademone\u2019s face was impassive. \u201CI\u2019m not a legalist but I believe that Director Lodan knew he would be acting within the letter of the law but was concerned that he may not be seen to be acting within the spirit of the law. That was a risk he wanted to avoid if all possible.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBecause I don\u2019t think he wanted anything to stand in the way of Project Starseed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interviewer turned over a page of his notes. \u201CSo, he started a grassroots campaign?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA volunteer movement inspired by the original Kerbin Interplanetary Society.\u201D Ademone steepled her fingers in front of her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDidn\u2019t that seem a rather far-fetched plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNelton \u2013 my head of flight operations \u2013 certainly thought so. But, as Director Lodan pointed out, the Kerbin Interplanetary Society managed to parlay one successful suborbital flight into an audacious enterprise which managed to put the first kerbals into orbit. That enterprise only worked because it was able to attract considerable numbers of skilled volunteers for little more than food, lodgings and the chance to fly into space\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026we all build them; we all fly them. It was our old motto.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut in this case, food was the key element of Director Lodan\u2019s plan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CYes. It was a simple proposition at heart. The Kerm crisis had left most of the KSA\u2019s subcontractors with spare capacity. We offered to help them get back to full production by ensuring that their workers were fed and helping to smooth out their logistics. In return, they would set aside some of that new \u2013 and otherwise un-needed \u2013 capacity to help restart Project Starseed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd were you aware that your larger subcontractors were also engaged on government contracts?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe suspected that they were from the additional security on their premises but we understood that they wouldn\u2019t be able to confirm or deny anything.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd you didn\u2019t foresee that your plan might create a conflict of interest for your subcontractors?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sipped his coffee. \u201CWe didn\u2019t want to interfere in any ongoing contracts, which is why we only asked that they set aside un-needed capacity\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026that\u2019s correct. It was obvious that they were contracting for the government but naturally they couldn\u2019t say anything about it, so we didn\u2019t press them. However, it was just as obvious that they had a lot of spare capacity \u2013 when I asked, I was told they were only fully operational for three days a week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat would you have done if they had been at full production?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb spread his hands on the table. \u201CI honestly don\u2019t know. Stratus were a key link to the rest of our supply chains. We would have found a way eventually I hope, but it would be been a lot harder and a lot slower.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI see.\u201D The interviewer made a note. \u201CLet\u2019s move on to the White Cross Company\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026not involved directly but yes, it was set up by Director Lodan, Jebediah and a number of his former Interplanetary Society colleagues, to provide an independent seed checking service for farmers and agricultural companies.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs a volunteer only service?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt grew very fast for a volunteer service.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey were providing a valuable service for free.\u201D Ademone kept her expression carefully neutral. \u201CI understand that they also managed to tap into popular sentiment amongst the kermol, many of whom were only too glad to be helping with Project Starseed\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026and so, you\u2019ve started building a new space station?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney rubbed his eyes. \u201CThat\u2019s correct. It\u2019s constructed entirely from test modules for Starseed and is providing an invaluable testbed for the orbital construction techniques that we\u2019ll need to build the real colony ships.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI see.\u201D The interviewer stacked his notes together and glanced over at the stenographer before turning back to Geneney. \u201CThank you for your testimony, Mr Geneney. Before we conclude, do you have any further comments you wish to add to the public record?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do.\u201D Geneney leaned forward. \u201CI mentioned that Jebediah and I had communed with Guardian Elton. He made a personal pledge to us that when kerbals make the voyage to Duna, we will take with us the knowledge of turning desert to soil fit for growing Kerm.\u201D The veteran flight director took a deep breath. \u201CI do not wish to second-guess Elton but it was clear to me that he is a firm supporter of Starseed. Maybe we should try and find out whether any other Kerm feel the same way\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do.\u201D Ademone\u2019s face lost its carefully neutral cast. \u201CThe KSA, led by Director Lodan, has managed not only to alleviate a considerable amount of hardship caused by the war but to unite kerman and kermol behind Project Starseed. If we are ever to get to Duna, we will need all the unity we can get\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do.\u201D Jeb looked his interviewer in the eye. \u201CDirector Lodan and I have had our differences in the past but I can say right now that if he was a kerbonaut, I would be glad to fly with him. If he ever became a flight director, I would trust him as far as I trust Geneney and for the same reasons. If we\u2019re to find a way out of the Kerm crisis, we will need such beacons of the kerbal spirit as Lodan Kerman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI believe you\u2019re the last one to arrive, sir.\u201D Corsen held the door open. \u201CPlease take a seat.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded and followed him into the anteroom. Morning sunlight poured in through the windows, illuminating three figures sitting in a row. Lodan looked up, gave him a brief nod before returning to his contemplation of the far wall. Jeb noted the KSA director\u2019s clean-shaven chin and freshly pressed suit and felt himself relax fractionally. Beside him, Ademone looked tired but unruffled, hands folded in her lap. Only Geneney showed any signs of strain; the bags under his eyes and the dishevelled hair at his temples, telling their tale of a sleepless night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clock on the wall chimed and the door to Obrick\u2019s office opened, the Kolan President framed in the doorway. \u201CGood morning.

We found them consistent with the written submissions of Director Lodan Kerman, Ademone Kerman and Geneney Kerman. It was noted that the testimonies of Ademone Kerman, Geneney Kerman and Jebediah Kerman were found to be broadly consistent although there was disagreement over some precise details. The short Council deemed the discrepancies to be minor and indicative of independent recollections of the same events.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick surveyed the impassive figures in front of him. \u201CThe Council finds the detailed KSA accounts provided by Director Lodan Kerman to be scrupulous and thorough. The Council also finds that Director Lodan\u2019s actions pursuant to Special Orders 41 and 42 to be proportionate and reasonable. The Council therefore voted unanimously that neither Special Order shall be rescinded at this time, subject to the continued good judgement and transparent reporting of Director Lodan Kerman, who is hereby cleared of any allegations of executive misconduct or abuse of authority.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Mr President.\u201D The KSA director\u2019s imperturbable expression was given away by the suddenly relaxed set of his shoulders. \u201COn behalf of the Kerbin Space Agency, I would be grateful if you could convey my appreciation to Council for their prompt review of our case.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CConsider it done.\u201D Only a long career in political negotiations kept Obrick from smiling at the looks of naked relief from Jeb and Geneney. \u201CAs you will be aware, the Wakiran Pillars have tendered their resignations following the Site D incident. Until such time as their replacements can be elected or appointed, the Council will be unable to take a definitive decision regarding Project Starseed. However, the Pillars of Doren, Wakira and Kolus consider the ongoing construction of Space Station Tenacity to be prudent and reasonable. This office will be in contact with Director Lodan\u2019s office to discuss budgetary matters and other considerations.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrick regarded them over the rims of his spectacles before standing up. \u201CWe look forward to seeing further progress on Tenacity. Until then, good day to you, good kerbals. Corsen will be able to assist with travel arrangements for your return journeys.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb jerked awake and peered blearily through the windscreen of Geneney\u2019s car, the stress of their Twelve Pillars hearing and nearly a week of travel, finally catching up with him. He retrieved a flask from the footwell, unscrewed its cap and grunted at the trickle of lukewarm coffee that dribbled into his cup. Outside, the outskirts of Barkton were just coming into view. \u201CWe should give Elton the news when we get a minute.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney signalled left and pulled off onto the exit ramp. \u201CWe should. After the thousand and one other things on the list.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYep.\u201D Jeb yawned hugely. \u201CKerm. The first thing on that list needs to be a good two nights of sleep.\u201D He downed the tepid coffee with a grimace and glanced at the sleeping bags and box of supplies on the back seat. \u201CHope it doesn\u2019t come down to camping in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E \u2013 that\u2019s one piece of nostalgia I could do without right now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m just glad to be going home. The rest of it hasn\u2019t really sunk in yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb glanced at his friend. \u201CNo,\u201D he agreed. \u201CMe neither.\u201D He squirmed in his seat, trying to find a comfortable position, as Geneney drove them through the old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E suburbs, past the rows of slightly worn looking wood-and-brick housing, their gardens now unkempt and overrun with weeds, and through to the squarer, industrial buildings that marked the beginnings of the Space Centre proper. He yawned again as they pulled up outside the gates, blinking in surprise at the sight of his keys still hanging from the handles. Then his eyes suddenly narrowed. \u201CLooks like we\u2019ve got company.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney eyed the brightly lit museum windows. \u201CYes,\u201D he said tightly. \u201CKerm, I could really do without this tonight.\u201D He opened the car door and climbed out, Jeb following closely behind. Shoving the gates open, he stalked down the path to the museum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CH-hold it right there!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney froze at the sight of the rifle barrel swinging towards him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CT-this is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E property. You\u2019d better leave now before we call the authorities.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe heard a snort beside him and Jeb stepped out of the shadows. \u201CYes, it is \u2013 and I should know. Who in the name of the\u2026\u201D?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb?\u201D The voice sounded startled. \u201CPillars preserve me it is! Put the gun down you fool \u2013 they\u2019re back!\u201D The museum door crashed open and figures piled out. \u201CGeneney too! Great Kerm above \u2013 they are back!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CHold it, hold it!\u201D Jeb raised his hands for silence. \u201CFirst things first \u2013 who on Kerbin are you good people and what in the name of my mother\u2019s Grove are you doing here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA burly, heavyset kerbal stepped forward, rifle pointed out the ground. \u201CEldrin Kerman at your service.\u201D He gestured at the group standing around him. \u201CAnd we\u2019re the rocket-spotters \u2013 or what\u2019s left of us, with the war and everything.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked at him. \u201CEldrin\u2026 Eldrin. You used to be a regular down at Jorfurt\u2019s, yes?\u201D He snapped his fingers. \u201CYou were waiting outside the medical centre after Pioneer 4.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite himself, Eldrin beamed. \u201CI surely was and I\u2019ve still got the signed poster in the den.\u201D The smile disappeared. \u201CWe spotted your keys on the gate not long after you left. Thought we\u2019d just keep an eye on the place for you but then we found your museum and\u2026 well you\u2019d better come inside.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure. Lead on.\u201D Jeb followed Eldrin, Geneney and the rest of the rocket-spotters close behind them. He glanced at the displays still arranged just as they\u2019d left them, and then he stopped dead in his tracks, seeing the spotlessly clean signboards and exhibits for the first time. The glass fronted display cabinets with their collections of spacesuits and other equipment gleaming in the light. The floor had been swept and even the walls looked freshly scrubbed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe don\u2019t get many folks stopping by,\u201D Eldrin noted. \u201CBut we try to keep the place in good shape for those that do.\u201D He ducked his head, flushing slightly. \u201CKeeping the faith, you could say.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb blinked, for once, lost for words. \u201CI\u2026I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI do.\u201D Geneney stepped forward. \u201CWas anyone here ever a member of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEldrin shook his head. \u201CNo, sir. Most of us aren\u2019t that technically minded \u2013 never thought we could offer much.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThings have changed a bit since the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E days.\u201D Geneney\u2019s gaze swept across the assembled rocket-spotters. \u201CI can\u2019t tell you the work will be glamorous - I can\u2019t even promise you that you\u2019ll get anywhere near a rocket \u2013 but right now we need all the help we can get.\u201D He swept his arms out, flicking his fingers at the meticulously clean museum around them. \u201CAnd it\u2019s plain that nobody here is afraid of hard work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe can promise you one thing though,\u201D Jeb added. \u201CWe\u2019re keeping a book of everyone who helps us out. Doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re trucking beans, mopping floors and making coffee, or bending metal for Starseed modules \u2013 everyone\u2019s name goes in. And that book will be on the first flight out to Duna, if we ever get that far.\u201D He snapped his fingers again. \u201CI\u2019ll be right back.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stood back by the door, letting the rocket-spotters talk things over amongst themselves without being overheard. Then Jeb rushed in, clutching a sheet of yellowing paper. \u201CLooks like these good folks stopped anyone from looting the offices.\u201D He walked over to the \u003Cem\u003EEve 1\u003C/em\u003E exhibit and smoothed out the paper over the capsule hull. With a shock, Geneney saw his name and seven others scribbled at the top of the sheet:\u00A0 Jeb, Gene, Bob, Bill, Wernher, Lucan, Richlin and Ornie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve got the sign-up sheet right here, good kerbals.

Judging from the rows of filled-in holes in the wall, the room had been full of shelving at some point but was now occupied by a row of bunks, each fitted with an olive-green footlocker and made up with brown woollen blankets. Opposite the bunks, sack chairs were arranged around a low table and a bookshelf sporting a collection of paperbacks and a Tiles set, stood in one corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFridge, cooker, coffee pot\u2026actual coffee, \u003Ci\u003Edjeng\u003C/i\u003E, sapwood bars, bread.

A public telephone, less its coinbox, lay on a nearby cart. Joemy winced and waited for the noise to subside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019ll be handy for phoning ahead whenever a truck goes out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019ll be nice in the evening too,\u201D the shift leader answered. \u201CI miss my little Samely \u2013 and his father too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoemy gave her an embarrassed look. \u201CI should have thought of that. Anyone with a family gets to use the phone first of course.\u201D He eyed the line of trucks already queuing up to get into the inspection post, searching for a white van amongst them. \u201CAh \u2013 looks like first shift are on time.

Nodding politely to the various operations managers already in their seats, he popped the top off his bottle and studied his copy of the agenda. The boardroom doors opened and Halnie and Shervin walked in, talking quietly. They each poured themselves a coffee and took their places at opposite ends of the table. Shervin took a slim folder out of his briefcase and cleared his throat for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s make a start. Sig, what have you got for us?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan listened as Sig and then the other operations managers summarised their teams\u2019 work for the month. Over half of them finished with a washup report on their particular project and Lucan frowned slightly, mentally adding up the freed-up production lines and workers. Shervin saw his frown and inclined his head briefly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Sean. Lucan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTransport links to Foxham and the northwest have opened up considerably in the last few weeks mostly due to faster turnaround times at the major inspection posts and improved communications between posts. However, we are starting to see our trusted trader network taking root which we expect to lead to substantial further improvements.\u201D Lucan took a sip of his drink. \u201CFor those that aren\u2019t aware, under the trusted trader scheme, a White Cross employee travels with his or her shipment of goods and verifies its clean seed status at any other inspection post on the network, without the need for a second inspection. It\u2019s taking time for individual posts to buy into the idea so it\u2019s fair to say that the network is rather patchy at the moment but we are seeing signs of progress.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan glanced around the table. \u201CWe\u2019re also starting to roll out a tiered inspection service. Foodstuffs, essentials, war relief supplies and, naturally, Starseed shipments are still inspected for free, but we\u2019re starting to charge a fee for any luxury or non-essential goods. As you can imagine, we\u2019re being fairly cautious with our pricing and any revenues are being ploughed straight back into our inspection facilities, for example, setting up dedicated sleeping and catering areas at the inspection post for White Cross personnel.\u201D He paused at the sight of one operations manager\u2019s upraised finger. \u201CYes, Sean?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere were they sleeping before?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan looked at him. \u201CMostly on camp beds or air mattresses wherever they could find space. Some of them chose to stay at home and drive in every day but it\u2019s hardly a fun commute.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I can imagine. Thank you.\u201D Sean scribbled a note on his pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLast but not least,\u201D Lucan continued, \u201CWe\u2019re seeing quite a sizeable uptick in government spending on civilian inspection infrastructure which is having a useful knock-on effect on our catering logistics here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. Thank you, Lucan.\u201D Shervin stood up. \u201CWhat Lucan has been good enough not to tell you, is that we\u2019re also seeing a sizeable uptick in new government orders for Stratus hardware.\u201D He offered his managers a faint smile. \u201CWhich is why I\u2019m pleased to hear quite so many washup reports this afternoon. I\u2019ve prepared a summary of those orders, if you good kerbals could pass them around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven knowing what to expect, Lucan sucked in his breath at the length of the order sheets. He clenched his fist under the table, listening to the sudden commotion around him. A loud knock from the other end of the table interrupted the hubbub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, Shervin, but these look a lot like spacecraft parts to me?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey should do,\u201D Shervin agreed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn fact, they look a lot like some of the space station parts we built for Jeb\u2019s outfit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI believe that\u2019s the general idea, yes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the government is paying for them?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what the purchase orders say.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe manager\u2019s face split open in a sudden grin. \u201CWell, finally!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was answered by a half grin from his vice-chairman. \u201CIndeed. Halnie?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalnie got to her feet. \u201CThank you, Shervin.\u201D She waited until everyone was paying attention. \u201CThe Portable Systems Division has also received a substantial order for our new construction fabrics and a heads-of-terms from Director Lodan\u2019s office for a manufacturing and technology transfer contract. We\u2019re still reviewing those terms but, essentially, the KSA are requesting a full-size demonstration article for our inflatable spoke concept, with a flight test article to follow. Assuming that all goes to plan, Director Lodan suggested that an additional sixteen flight articles would be required.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShervin walked over to the corner of the boardroom and returned with a roll of laminated paper and a set of carved geode paperweights. \u201CIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, Lucan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot at all.\u201D Lucan helped to unroll the laminate and weigh it down at the corners, revealing a cutaway diagram of \u003Ci\u003ETenacity\u003C/i\u003E. He looked at Shervin, who inclined his head. \u201COkay, this is the Tenacity space station \u2013 or what it will look like when its finished. As you\u2019ll know, we have two modules on orbit, the Bridge module here,\u201D Lucan jabbed a finger at the diagram, \u201Cdocked to the Hub module here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone huddled together to get a better look as Lucan continued. \u201CEach of these spoke modules consists of two lattice girders section linked by a knuckle module in the middle and capped with an outer knuckle here. The midpoint knuckles provide windows and attachment points for Halnie\u2019s inflatable modules here and here, and two of them will have auxiliary docking points to help with construction. The endcap knuckles will anchor the spokes to the rim sections. Eight spokes at two inflatable modules a pop equals sixteen in total.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd more along the octagon edges?\u201D one of the managers asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan shook his head. \u201CNo. They will be for Starseed but Tenacity will just have more girder sections which will serve as testbeds for experimenting with different cargo modules and how best to attach them.\u201D He pointed at the Hub module. \u201CAs you\u2019ve already noticed, most of the parts we\u2019re ordering from Stratus are duplicates of previous KSA orders. We\u2019ll be using them to finish outfitting the second Bridge module which will attach to the Hub here for extra living space and for balance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBalance?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan grinned. \u201CBalance. It\u2019s a long way to Duna and a long time to spend in zero-g and still be fully functional when you get there. So, we\u2019re going to be running some artificial gravity experiments aboard Tenacity.\u201D He pointed at the cutaway diagram. \u201CThese parts here, here, here, and here are basically scaled up versions of our standard reaction control thrusters, complete with the same monoprop tanks that we\u2019ve been ordering from you since the start of the space program. All four of them together should be plenty to set Tenacity into a nice, controlled spin.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt least we\u2019re not starting from scratch this time around.\u201D Jeb leaned back in his chair. \u201CSome new faces for sure but far more old faces than I was expecting too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney put down his mug. \u201CNot to mention the fully tooled-up production line under the dust sheets. The LV-T20 line should be up and running by the end of the week, we\u2019ll be started on a set of laterals by the end of next week.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the capsule? Bill?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs James would say, that\u2019s the long pole right now.\u201D Bill scratched his head. \u201CWe pulled the pressure hull for Pioneer 8 out of storage, so we\u2019re not quite starting from the beginning, but most of the subsystem components are still sitting in a warehouse somewhere, the location of which is presumably a closely guarded secret.\u201D Bill couldn\u2019t quite conceal the curl of his lip. \u201CI spoke to Lodan about it and he\u2019s doing what he can.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded. \u201CDid you manage to give any more thought to the expanded seating arrangements?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt should be reasonably straightforward although I\u2019d like to run through the calculations again with Ribory.\u201D Bill inspected his glass of iced \u003Ci\u003Edjeng\u003C/i\u003E. \u201CIf we strip out the sanitation facilities and cut the storage lockers down to a minimum, we shouldn\u2019t have any problems fitting in a fourth couch. We \u003Ci\u003Emight\u003C/i\u003E,\u201D Bill waggled his hand from side to side, \u201Cbe able to fit in a fifth but it would be tight and I\u2019m not too happy about what it would do to the centre of mass.\u201D He raised an eyebrow at Geneney. \u201CI\u2019d prefer not to touch the entry and descent code if I can possibly avoid it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood point,\u201D Geneney agreed. \u201CCan we put together a crash team to look at this before Eve 4?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill winced. \u201CI never did like that expression. If we can, we should, given that we\u2019re starting from a bare pressure hull anyway.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBob is going to be too busy training,\u201D Jeb noted, ticking the names off on his fingers. \u201CLowise is overseeing the tankage line recommissioning, Ribory is filling in for Bob back at Foxham.\u201D He thought for a moment. \u201CSeanan?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust the kerb for the job.\u201D Geneney jotted down Seanan\u2019s name on his notepad, drew a circle round it and added \u2018Capsule 2.5\u2019 underneath.\u201D He looked up at Jeb, throat constricting around his next words. \u201CI don\u2019t suppose\u2026Wernher?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his head. \u201CNot yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow is he?\u201D Bill asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPhysically, he\u2019s fine. Mentally \u2013 he\u2019s about where I was, I think.\u201D Jeb leaned forward. \u201CI haven\u2019t forgotten about taking him to meet Elton and I still think that\u2019s a good idea - goodness knows it was for me. But not quite yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf he wants to talk about anything\u2026?\u201D The question hung in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled. \u201CHe already knows. Maybe we\u2019ll take an evening out and do what we used to do back in the old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E days. Find some tyres to sit on, grab some cans from the fridge,\u201D Jeb jerked a thumb at his desk, \u201Cand swap crazy ideas whilst the sun goes down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToralba International Airport, Camrie thought, was almost as misleading a name as Balcabar International Airport, given their size and the minimal facilities at either. Minimal civilian facilities she corrected herself; for all the months since the ceasefire, there had still been a disconcerting number of fighter aircraft and military transports at Balcabar.\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe tapped her foot, waiting for her travel case to drop into the collection rack. Around her, the handful of passengers who\u2019d braved the flight stood waiting for their luggage, some concealing their impatience better than others. \u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EA tan leather suitcase dropped into the rack to her left with a thump and an elderly, balding kerbal stepped forward to collect it, a sober-looking business suit visible under his fur trimmed overcoat. Camrie gave him a curious glance before a thump from the rack in front of her caught her attention. She retrieved her case and headed for Arrivals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter having her papers checked by two of the Wakiran Border Security soldiers at the security gate, Camrie emerged into a small, and slightly worn around the edges, arrivals lounge and stopped to get her bearings. The placard bearing her name under the White Cross Company logo was the first thing to catch her eye, closely followed by the cheerful looking kerbal holding it in one hand and waving to her with the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCamrie! You made it!\u201D Sigbin dropped the placard and hugged her. \u201CHow was the flight?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTiring but I got here in the end.\u201D Camrie looked around the lounge. \u201CAre we in a hurry?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot at all. I\u2019m parked in short stay rather than pickup.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn that case, if you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I could do with freshening up.\u201D Camrie disappeared in the direction of the moss room and emerged damp around the collar but looking noticeably less rumpled\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI suppose a coffee would be a stretch?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks like it. This place could definitely do with freshening up too.\u201D Sigbin wrinkled her nose. \u201CWe\u2019ll get you one back at the office.\u201D She propped the placard over one shoulder. \u201CLet me take that bag.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTraffic around the airport and seed inspection post was light and it wasn\u2019t long before Sigbin\u2019s runabout was purring along the main lakeside road towards Toralba, with the rugged Lorelan mountains providing a spectacular backdrop against the afternoon sky. Toralba itself nestled between two great lakes; the two waters, from which it took its name. As they approached the outskirts of town, billboards began to appear along the sides of the road, emblazoned with political slogans and the names and faces of the three Wakiran presidential candidates. Camrie was unsurprised, but still disappointed, to see that few of the slogans had anything to say about Project Starseed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe traffic began to get heavier and Sigbin clucked her tongue in annoyance. \u201CKerm \u2013 I\u2019d forgotten all about the rally. We\u2019d be better off taking the side-roads I think.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie eyed the \u2018Wilbeth for Wakira\u2019 pennants flapping from the cars in front. \u201CA candidate Wilbeth rally I take it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately.\u201D Sigbin veered off up a slip road before turning right at the next junction. \u201CPompous windbag makes all the right noises but doesn\u2019t have an original thought in her perfectly coiffured head. Luckily her opponents are more progressive.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie stared at the clumps of placards adorning the roadside and the posters in the windows as they drove through a residential area. \u201CThat doesn\u2019t seem to be putting many people off.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo.\u201D Sigbin made a face. \u201CFeels like this campaign has been going on forever. I know we didn\u2019t have much choice but, Kerm there\u2019s a lot of time and energy being spent on electioneering that could be put to better uses. Still, only another two months and a bit to go.\u201D She turned off into a modern looking office park and pulled up in front of a modestly sized building. \u201CAnd here we are. Afternoon shifts aren\u2019t due back for another half an hour, so we\u2019ll have time for a coffee first.\u201D She led Camrie in through the main entrance and up a flight of stairs into an open-plan office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamrie glanced over the wall maps and scattered whiteboards with lists of names and schedules scribbled on them, before coming up short at a large signboard sporting a handful of cardboard cut-out spacecraft components. Sigbin nodded to herself and went over to join her. \u201CThose ones were sitting in a warehouse throughout the war \u2013 it was only last month that freight restrictions to Kolus eased up enough that they could get shipped out to Foxham.\u201D She straightened one cut-out and stepped back from the wall. \u201CBut just you wait. We\u2019ve got plenty more cards cut out and ready to put up once we get confirmation from Rockomax. The real deals will be going up on the next rocket.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe payload mounting frame, its cargo of \u003Ci\u003ETenacity \u003C/i\u003Espoke module sections already secured in place, stood in the centre of the factory floor between the two halves of its payload fairing. Joebal Kerman, Rockomax\u2019s head of electrical and environmental systems, stepped back to survey his team\u2019s work and nodded in satisfaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019ll do it. We\u2019d better fence them off though in case the President wants to go poking around. Mr Lanrick would have known better but I don\u2019t know what this new fellow will be like. Especially after he\u2019s spent today down at Barkton getting the hands-on VIP tour from Jeb and his crew.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis assistant nodded agreement. \u201CI\u2019ll have some signboards made up; \u2018actual flight hardware\u2019 or something similar. I\u2019ll put the latest shipment of parts from Wakira out on display too. I\u2019m not sure how much they\u2019ll mean to him but they should look impressive and Ademone is keen to emphasise Wakira\u2019s contribution to the programme.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat makes sense. If we get a move on, we can have that ready by the time she gets back from the test stand.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeart in her mouth, Ademone watched the crane lower the massive thrust assembly into place, the oversized bell nozzles of the five SK2-M Mainsail engines pointing squarely into an equally oversized flame trench and water suppression system. Hanbal\u2019s team went to work securing the assembly to its test stand and disconnecting it from the crane, whilst the head of propulsion systems himself looked on. She shivered, picturing the rest of the colossal booster assembled on top: five Skipper engines in the second stage with a single, comparatively puny SK1-G \u2018Poodle\u2019 engine for the final boost to orbit and on-orbit manoeuvring of the vast quantity of construction materials the Type 7 was designed to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen, her head of structural engineering saw the shiver and nodded. \u201CIf she gets off the pad, she\u2019ll be quite the sight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal snorted. \u201CIf we manage to light off all five of those beasts together on the stand, it\u2019ll be quite the sight too.\u201D He turned to face Ademone. \u201CWhich isn\u2019t going to happen by tomorrow, new Wakiran President or not.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone gestured at the test stand. \u201CI\u2019m sure that will be quite impressive enough, especially if we show President Dunlock the pad side footage of a Type 6 launch for comparison.\u201D She raised an eyebrow at Hanbal. \u201CAnd I quite agree that we should keep the initial test-fires private in case anything untoward happens.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen chuckled. \u201CYou\u2019ll have quite a job keeping those tests private.
