When I get everything up and running I will post a link to my channel. I will be releasing episodes on a Monday on a fortnightly basis, so that way I get more time to work on the episodes because I am still in school. I will also be posting any news (like why an episode is late if it ever happens) but I am also open to suggestions concerning the videos and that is why I have created this thread, and I will also be posting the mods list here as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQ9iS_EJaVaeMz1KUZ8PZw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQ9iS_EJaVaeMz1KUZ8PZw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy the videos and happy flying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackground info:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
