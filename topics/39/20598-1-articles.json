One of the most important discoveries was the sighting of a whole new continent on the dark side of the planet.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E Whilst some argue that there is no dark side of the planet, and that everyone has known about the other continent for hundreds of years, it nevertheless sparked a new industry in aerospace manufacturing. This new industry is based around mass transport, something recently aided in local areas by the invention of the wheel, except with one major exception \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 aeroplanes. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E Kerbals have, through time, built plenty of flying machines. Many did not work exactly as intended, but the new Kerbal Aerospace Company has bought a lot of designs from different people and has come up with a series of aircraft designed to carry Kerbals around.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E With success in this area, the Kerbal Aerospace Company is also branching into high performance aircraft, designed to give those certain thrill seeking Kerbals a chance to fly around in style. Some have argued that our \u0027high performance jets are, in fact, highly dangerous death-traps\u0027 and that \u0027you don\u0027t fly so much as lurch uncontrollably through the air\u0027. Well, to these certain nay-sayers, we invite them to please go and stick their heads in a bin.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E One of our latest lines of aeroplane, the Longprobe, was used in a research experiment by the Kerbal Space Program to try and get to the North Pole. The Longprobe failed, and they sent a rocket instead. However, the Longprobe did carry three Kerbonoughts at once, and was remarked by the Mission Commander Jebediah Kerman to be \u0027quite comfortable\u0027! \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E The North Pole mission gave the Kerbal Aerospace Company a great deal of cash to play around with, enabling us to modify the Longprobe and create a commercial version, complete with a 70% cargo capacity increase. Some have noted that the Longprobe Commercial is \u0027dangerously underpowered\u0027 and \u0027liable to snap in half on landing\u0027. Well, to these niggling complaints, we note that the removal of one of the engines has pushed down the cost an awful lot. Also, you use half as much fuel as using two engines, which is cheaper. The latter comment is nullified by the fact that we tested the Commercial quite a lot, and it never snapped in half for us. Ever.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E As for the performance jets we mentioned earlier, one is already out there and on the proverbial shelves \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the Deltacraft MkII! This super-high agility jet has been shown to be able to literally tear itself apart with insane manoeuvres. The turn speed is astronomical, but since we haven\u0027t worked out a way to measure it you\u0027ll just have to take our word for it. The single-seat MkI Cockpit is great for being able to see out of the aircraft (looking behind not inclusive), and the Basic Jet Engine is perfectly simple for those Kerbals who don\u0027t like fiddling around with complicated things like variable-pitch rotors and electric bits and stuff. On a completely different note, if you see a MkI Deltacraft, report it to us immediately and don\u0027t try to fly it (the MkI hasn\u0027t got any windows to see out of). Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Inc. has seen fit to provide us with a shipment of R-8 manoeuvring surfaces, so that now you can turn the MkII in any direction you see fit!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E Also available is the Kerboplane MkI, arguably the simplest and easiest to fly aeroplane ever. And it\u0027s quite cheap.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E Kerbal Aerospace Company would like to thank the following organisations for support, engineers and parts:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E- Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Inc.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E- Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E- C7 Aerospace Division\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E- The Rockomax Conglomerate\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E- And the roads, by which we found some parts.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EM.Kerman, CEO Kerbal Aerospace Company\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E Happy flying, Kerbals!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sorry if I copied anyone by accident or something!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
