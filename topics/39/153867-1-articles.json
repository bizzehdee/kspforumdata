Four Juno engines pinched the wings on the back of the fuselage.\u00A0A Reliant rocket engine stuck out of the tail. Gus walked up with a clipboard tucked under one arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay,\u201D he said. \u201CThis is the two seat variant of the Hopper. She\u2019s also been stretched a bit to give her enough fuel for two hops to angels 25.\u201D He looked at Jebediah. \u201CThough some of you may try for a single hop to fifty. She ain\u2019t rated for it. Not that it\u2019ll stop you.\u201D He took out the clipboard. \u201CEncal you\u2019re up in the rotation, so you get first flight. Khenry will be your REO on this one. Nothing fancy, just a couple of hops up and back down staying in local airspace. The reps from the factory will be waiting to talk to you after you land. Take-off is in two hours.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood luck, Encal,\u201D Jebediah said. \u201CShe looks like she\u2019ll need a bit of a hand on the stick.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D Encal said. \u201CShe\u2019ll soar like a dream.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo days later Valentina looked up from her typewriter after hearing a cough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMa\u2019am,\u201D it was one of the technicians, simulation section she thought. \u201CSorry to bother you. But we have a problem, and we\u2019re hoping up can help us with it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe recognized the tone and words.\u00A0It meant they wanted to solve things\u00A0quietly and unofficially, before they\u00A0have to become\u00A0official.\u00A0She looked over at the other pilots\u2019 desks. Neither had been touched in two days.\u00A0 She knew why one of them hadn\u2019t been. Now she knew why the other hadn\u2019t. She stood up and followed the tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the simulation room her foot glanced off an empty ration tin. It looked like the contents had been eaten cold. She looked at the settings on the console of the simulator and frowned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey haven\u2019t changed in the past two days,\u201D the tech said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGet the doctor down here,\u201D Valentina said. \u201CI\u2019ll get him out. After the doc gets here, get these cleaned up,\u201D she gestured\u00A0at the tins on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, ma\u2019am,\u201D the tech said, and rushed to a phone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simulator bucked and trembled, as if it wanted to go one way and it was being dragged the other. She watched it until the doctor arrived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBe ready to sedate him, if needed.\u201D She said to the doctor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe just crooked an eyebrow and prepped a syringe. When he nodded she pulled the abort lever. The simulator returned to its rest state.\u00A0 Valentina walked over to the hatch. The doctor followed and stayed out of the line of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah stomped out. \u201CWho the kell\u2026\u201C He looked around wild eyed. \u201CVal did you? Turn it back on Val!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina backed up a couple of steps. \u201CNo Jeb,\u201D she said calmly. \u201CYou\u2019ve got to get some sleep, and eat some real food.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, Val,\u201D Jebediah said. \u201CNot until I\u2019m done.\u201D He wobbled slightly, but quickly caught himself. \u201CTurn it back on Val.\u201D He took a heavy step forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe took another step back. \u201CNo, Jeb.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe doctor stood ready to put the loaded syringe in Jebediah. A can clanged off a far wall. Jebediah spun around. Valentina and the doctor both moved at the same time. She grabbed him in a bear hug and held him tightly. The doctor pushed the syringe into Jebediah\u2019s arm.\u00A0 He struggled against Valentina. She relaxed her grip as he weakened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou don\u2019t need to be better than everyone, Jeb.\u201D She said softly. \u201CThere wasn\u2019t anything you could have done.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo Val,\u201D Jebediah said, his words slurred as the drugs took effect. \u201CNot everyone Val. Just better\u2026 Just better \u2018an\u2026\u00A0 \u2018an the frames.\u00A0 Just the frames Val\u2026 \u00A0the frames, Val.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah slumped against Valentina unconscious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-15T15:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2017 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
