The point at which I cut off is where it spikes to something more dramatic, so bigger crafts, cooler camera work, and general higher order of badassery is required right there and it does that twice. I\u0027ve already figured out one of them, I\u0027m still not 100% sure on the first, but I definitely know what it feels like should be there so I\u0027ll be doing several more action shots and bigger, cooler crafts, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
