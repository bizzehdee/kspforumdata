The only thing I really have to note is the fact that both \u0027continent 2\u0027 and \u0027continent 3\u0027 are subject HIGHLY to polar stretching. This basically means that by making a 3d sphere into a 2d map the north and south poles become distorted slightly and therefore seem larger than they actually are. Also, the border between \u0027continent 4\u0027 and \u00275\u0027, while over land, is suitable as there is a mountain range in that area that acts as a convenient separator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LbisX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LbisX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis second suggestion includes the addition of splitting \u0027continent 3\u0027 into two in order to create a sixth continent. This does divide up the land nicely, however my reasons against it are as follows. The border between \u0027continents 3 and 6\u0027 is over a large stretch of land (there is no convenient separator there) as opposed to the others bar one, and makes a sixth continent that\\\u0027s very small- especially in comparison to \u0027continent 2\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEDIT: This proposal is a bad idea guys, there\\\u0027s I reason why I haven\\\u0027t chosen it.
