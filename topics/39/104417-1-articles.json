I don\u0027t think I use a water mod. Do you mean like visual mods? My vid card is a bit crap (550 I think, years old) so i don\u0027t have any of those, but I did try to record/render in fairly hi-def (for 720p anyway). I mainly have parts mods and things like DRE, FAR, engineer, TAC life support.\n\nI have another much shorter KSP vid on my channel (I don\u0027t have a link at the moment) you should check it out if you liked this one! It\u0027s much shorter, the explosions are more concentrated!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T19:45:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rufledt**"}]}
