In addition I think it is important to realize space exploration is by definition and challenging and risky enterprise. To not want these risk is to not want a space program, which would be a mayor setback our nation, science and kerbalkind.

The program wide safety review allows the identification of certain trends and common shortcomings in procedure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplicating the investigation does not keep is the almost complete any records on flights so most information has been gathered through interviews and no hard numbers can be presented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly the majority of mayor accidents, well over 50% according to interviewees, occur at the launch pad before or within seconds after launch. Although there is a wide variety of causes two categories stand out specifically:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Insufficient structural integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe number one reason for failures on the launch pad and failures overall is an insufficient structural strenght of the system involved to endure the stresses applied on it. For obvious reasons this problem tends is isolated with new launch vehicles. Interviewees made clear it wasn\u0027t uncommon for it to take three or more launch attempts before a new type of combination was structurally sound enough to stand motionless on the launch pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrangely most interviewees did not seem to be bothered by this in the slightest even though these incidents usually lead to the complete destruction of the launcher and loss of live. A common response of interviewees when sufficiently pressed with this bleak picture was that they lacked the ability to determine whether or not a certain structural part would be able to cope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it is indeed true the space program does not have access to refined modeling equipment the auditor would assume it would be quite easy to predict a sole 1.25 meter ring would not be able to support the weight of a 7.5 by 20 meter structure filled to the top with rocket fuel. To this most interviewees had no comprehensive reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Incorrect staging of the ground supports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular recurrent type of incident involves the an incorrect staging which causes the ground support launch stabilizer to release the launcher without simultaneously activating the engines to propel it towards the sky, causing the vehicle to instead fall towards the ground which, again, usually leads to the complete destruction of the launcher and loss of crew. Interviewees point out ground support is usually added to the design just before launch and in the rush of it all this aspect is often overlooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface to orbit flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInsufficient structural integrity remains the primary cause for failure throughout the atmospheric flight to orbit since this stage brings the highest stresses on the launcher. According to personnel the occurrence of the problem tends to correlate with new designs and the so called \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cheavy lifters.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMayor incidents in this part of the flight do become less deadly as any crew present is often able to use their reentry vehicle to escape the exploding and burning wreckage of their spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast operations in space are comparatively safe with the explicit emphasis on \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomparatively\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany incidents still occur during landing attempts on our moons.

Many Duna Landers have been torn apart by parachutes on descent, and at least two pilots have died due to careless jetpacking. Only one Mun rescue has ever taken place, the crew of the Judy Peak Expedition, where publicity required a safe return of the Kerbals piloting the Honored mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Modern times Space tends to be much safer, except in the case of the Asteroid Redirect Training, wherein a paper mache asteroid was placed in orbit around Kerbin.

The findings are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-----\u003Cp\u003E1. Rocket launches in recent years have proven to be non-fatal. No Kerbals have been lost during lift-off at all for a long time. To be fair to MSI, the launches have never really been hazardous to life, and the rockets that do disintegrate have a tendency to leave command modules intact. Heavier launch vehicles will explode more often, but the widely-used Vulcan IV Heavy rocket has proven to be very reliable. Wrap-around launch designs that see the payload surrounded by heavy rockets are more commonly destroyed due to structural instability, but this technique is seeing less use nowadays. One noticeable problem that occasionally springs up is the firing of the launch clamps before ignition due to mis-staging. The problem is usually non-fatal and quickly rectified. Launch Escape Systems are simplistic, however, more often than not decoupling the command module from a malfunctioning rocket whilst simultaneously firing the parachutes. This has proven dangerous in the past, but there has been no reason to escape from a launch recently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Reaching orbit is rarely problematic. Payloads are launched on rockets of appropriate configuration, usually resulting in fuel to spare, which has proven useful on many interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Very few problems have been noted with vehicle instability in orbit. The most catastrophic failure was many years ago, but no fatalities were incurred in that incident, merely a considerable debris field that has since been dealt with. The orbital environment is debris-free, hence resulting in no collisions. All fatalities in orbit are attributed to combat, primarily from the Kraken War.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Exploration of celestial bodies is inherently dangerous business, but MSI has proven to have a good track record, with extensive planning going into every mission. Mun was initially a hotspot of non-fatal crash landings back in the 13th age (0.13.3) during which Jebediah Kerman, Bill Kerman, and Bob Kerman were repeatedly stranded on the surface of our closest celestial neighbour. However, since then, MSI has improved drastically, and landings on Mun and Minmus are mostly safe, provided the crews are attentive (which they usually are). Missions to other planets in the system are extensively thought out to ensure that the crews who fly out to Duna or Jool, for example, can return home, and have adequate supplies and accommodation. Only one known fatality has been incurred relatively recently on the surface of Duna during the third mission of the Venturer Program; Franklin Kerman is believed KIA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Most vehicles have manned and unmanned flight capability in order to maximise safety potential. Interplanetary landers tend to display this trait more so than Kerbin system landers. The inclusion of automated systems on manned vehicles is generally looked upon favourably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. SSTO Spaceplanes. Rarely used other than as proof-of-concept. SSTO spaceplanes have proven to be hazardous, with two problems being prevalent; unequal engine flameout in-atmosphere, and centre-of-lift instability. The former has been helped with the recent development of the R.A.P.I.E.R. while the latter has been rectified through experience. Even so, pilots are often found in the middle of nowhere on Kerbin after failing to make orbit, with minimal supplies. Unmanned flight testing would be better here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Aircraft are, nowadays, proving to be alright. The occasional test flight will go awry, but tried and tested planes are reliable. Most of MSI\u0027s fatalities occur in this field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as it is a basic right for all Kerbals, snacks are provided in abundance for the most part, which is what a lot of other programs fall down on.

Launch failures are mainly the result of poor payload strutting inside fairings, or a lack of separatrons on boosters.

In addition, specialised software allowing for updates to staging setups during flight has significantly reduced casualties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Flight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery little atmospheric rocket flight is performed by BWI pilots anymore, as their supercomputer codenamed \u0027Mech-Jeb\u0027 has had a remarkably higher success rate. However, especially with the aforementioned heavier launchers this is not fool-proof, with fairings and drives firing early and the occasional complete failure to control the machine-often preceded by what ground crews call \u0027the jelly effect\u0027, a wobbling that shakes lower stages to bits, often resulting in collision with crew capsules or upper stage tanks. Again, simpler lower stages have massively increased reliability in this area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings rarely go wrong with a single vessel in space as Mechjeb is especially reliable here. However, larger machines assembled in space don\u0027t tend to go far, as they too are affected by the jelly effect. While more struts seem to be the answer, the BWI rarely build this type of vessel. What (sadly) is more common are casualties caused in re-entry, especially returning from the mun/minmus as their often underbuilt munar vehicles don\u0027t have the required fuel to slow down to a safe speed, and entire heatsheilds melt before all the ablator can even burn off. Since BWI interest is almost entirely based around kerbin and LKO this is rarely an issue though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Planes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe BWI\u0027s record is mixed here. Their aircraft are (mostly) well built and reliable even on their first flight, with special mention to the \u0027Sky pirate-Brute\u0027, a seemingly crude but extremely manoeuvrable bi-plane which in over ten unmanned crash tests only ever destroyed it\u0027s cockpit once, and several times landed on only one of it\u0027s four wings. However, while BWI pilots are also good, they are overconfident, and often attempt to push their planes to the limits before promptly overdoing it. Many a plane has smashed into the VAB or Space plane hanger tower while over stressing a turn in some way. In addition, the occasional plane will have landing gear too tall or unstable, not often causing a problem on take-off but straight up crashing it on landing. Attempts at building larger aircraft almost all end in utter disaster, and the BWI has only constructed one SSTO that managed to reach space-which ran out of fuel attempting to circularise, and killed it\u0027s pilot on re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, the BWI stinks at Mun landings. The landers that don\u0027t simply smash into the ground have only recently started using the so called \u0027Apollo technique\u0027 and before this, almost none made it home, running out of fuel long before reaching Kerbin, often on the ascent. They are improving, but more work is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood points: The BWI is, despite the report, fairly competent when it comes to safety, or at least no worse than the average. Their rockets have come on leaps and bounds, and their smaller aircraft have proven themselves time and time again-it is almost always pilot error that causes issues. Staging errors are infrequent, and it\u0027s very rare that a rocket doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to launch properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad points: Their record with large aircraft is, with two exceptions, a disaster with most failing to lift off at all. SRB\u0027s on complex stages often collide rather destructively with fuel tanks during stage separation and return missions to other planets have an (at best) poor record.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, this space program has simultaneously come a long way, yet not been far with so many missions stuck at kerbin.
