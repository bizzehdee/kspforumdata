The Fuel Plant was full. All of his staff was working tonight. The crowd was rowdy, but well behaved. Everyone knew the cost of misbehaving at the Plant. Ox and Toad would enforce it if needed. The two of them had brought a couple of their friends to help with the crowd. It would be a good night once the till was counted. It would more than balance the quiet of the next three days. Though, it didn\u2019t seem that it would be worth the effort right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe watched Walt step up on the stage at the other end of the room. The disc jockey faded the volume of the music. A few kerbals looked up at the stage, most did not notice. Walt seemed nervous. But, if you had the job of putting a good face on a total mission failure, you\u2019d be nervous too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019d been accidents before, and would be again. The black and silver glasses along the top of the back wall of the bar were testament to that. He wondered if he would have to add three more in a few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalt rang the bell at the back of the stage. Its low note cut through the conversation like a scythe. Walt walked back to the front of the stage. He raised a glass. Everyone else in the bar stood up and raised a glass as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe live in the brown,\u201D Walt said. \u201CWe fly the blue. We travel the black.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKamn straight we\u2019re coming back,\u201D everyone said together. They all drained their glasses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah, Valentina, and Cordos stepped up on the stage after Walt left. They each carried a bottle of liquor. Bobory raised an eyebrow at Jebediah\u2019s choice. They placed the bottles on a chair that had been placed on the stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGus,\u201D Jebediah said. \u201CWhen I got here you promised me the stamp. You\u2019ve delivered. With this bird you and your crew will deliver again.\u201D He picked up his bottle again. \u201CWe\u2019ll split these with you when we get back.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobory felt a chill at the unspoken, unthought, known statement\u00A0that could have followed. You always pretended you were coming back. Even if you knew you were not. He looked up at the black and silver glasses again. Especially, if you knew you were not coming back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUgh,\u201D Gus called out from the crowd. \u201CThat stuff will kill you. When you get back I\u2019ll get you a real drink.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd laughed. The conversation and music started again as the trio left the stage. Ox waded through the crowd carrying the three bottles. He sniffed as he handed them over the bar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBobory looked at the one bottle. \u201CIt\u2019s not bad stuff. But, it is an acquired taste.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOx nodded his head towards the\u00A0large clock counting down on the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll do last call about an hour short of it. You remember what happened last time,\u201D Bobory said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOx rolled his shoulders and rolled his head around. The joints cracked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, and you still ended up with bruises over half your face and sewn up in a couple of spots,\u201D Bobory said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOx raised an eyebrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry. The prairie will by dry at T minus 3 days.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
