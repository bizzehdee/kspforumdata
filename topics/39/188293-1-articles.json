I allowed myself the luxury of a stretch before a shout shook me from my lethargic state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CArky!

Mum\u2019s there in her eye-searingly yellow exercise stretchfit- looking mutinous with a bowl of Kerb-O\u2019s in her right hand. I slide into the bench seat behind the table and Mum plonks the bowl in front of me; the impact is so hard it splashes milk into my face.\u00A0 I spoon the multi-coloured rings into my mouth at a rate that should be impossible by anatomical standards, Mum shaking her head half in annoyance, half in mirth: the quirks of her mouth betraying her stony facade. The Kerb-O\u2019s are the cheapest cereal on the market, delivered almost solely in fluoro-green boxes that smack of cheapness and flimsiness. Mum briefs me on this morning\u2019s routine as I finish off my sweet, crunchy breakfast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CRight, Arky, you\u2019ve got yourself a big day today. Home race at the Speedway, and the talent scouts will be out in full force. You\u2019ve gotta impress- your underdog status might give you a bit of sentimental value, but that\u2019ll only take you so far. First, your daily jog to the cemetery and back- bring these flowers for the grave, please- then sim training, lunch and off to the race.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nI nod, concentrating on the wood fiber walls. Today was gonna be tough.

Our modest bungalow was made of two types of wood- a beachy yellow tinge, and blue foundation planks. It was only five minutes from the Thomasville Speedway, and another ten from the center of town- a modern-ish city of 60,000 kerbs, nestled on the shores of the Equatorial Ocean. A prickle of tears formed in my eye- salty and stinging. I blinked them away and began to jog: after half an hour, I\u2019d reached Thomasville Rural Cemetery, flowers in hand. Debris littered the overgrown grass, from chipped stones, silent as the, well, grave. I hurried forward, my shoes crunching debris into pebble-y rubbish, my emotions a wet, heavy lump of recurring sadness, my throat a tightly coiled, painful blockage. I place the flowers down, disturbing the gray dust that seems to settle at the foot of every gravestone. I hurry away; I really don\u2019t want anything to do with this place, no matter what my heart tells my head. Nope.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nThen, a shaft of bright, sharp pain as my world spins around me: I\u2019d tripped over a chunk of stone. Cursing my luck and uncomfortably aware of the tiny, sharp pieces of gravel stabbing into my cheek, I realized, with an internal groan, that running away from my past was literally sending me into the dirt. And as a racer, the last place you want to be is in the dirt, wheels snapped, nose cone mangled into the fence, dreams of victory behind you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nAn hour later, I\u2019m booting up the TV and simulator. Mum\u2019s cooking lunch: I\u2019ve got maybe half an hour before I have to, sit at the table. Opening the case of my favorite game K1 2036, I\u2019m reminded of how much I train by the spine of the disc case being bent and damaged from so much use- not a great look, to be honest. I slide the disc in, press start and navigate the options menu. Selecting Formula K and the Ozitec Circuit, I move to car and driver selection. After a moment\u2019s deliberation, spurred on by my pride, I select OTech GP, then my own virtual recreation- it gets me every time, seeing my name in a popular sim-game. The game loads, and I switch off all the assists, the HUD and tweak up all the settings to their hardest levels. Driving like this is ridiculously difficult, probably harder than real life. And believe me- I\u2019d know. Meanwhile the game starts and I grab the controller wheel. The Ozitec circuit, located in the sands of Shadab, is my favorite- last year\u2019s race there had been my rookie year, first race on the circuit, and I\u2019d loved everything, from the glittering sands to the glass skyscrapers, not to mention the huge glass dome section hosting the famous Quantic Chicane. It had been the race where I\u2019d gotten my first top five: fifth place. That year I finished ninth out of twenty-two in the championship- this year I was fourth after three races. A fourth in Marcolo and my second place in Aptur had been followed by a dismal eighth in Eradica- I was hoping to get back on form for my home race.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nMeanwhile, the ingame equivalent of Rinno Kerman runs me into the gravel trap. I smile inwardly at the unexpectedly accurate portrayal of Rinno\u2019s driving- a little older and a hell of a lot stupider than me, Rinno was on tenterhooks with his team, Radical Supersport. A promising second place at Marcolo had turned into a tyre blowout and huge collision at the Apturian SP- dead last. After a mechanical failure and collision with another driver put him in eighteenth in Eradica, Radical have been pretty closed-off regarding Rinno\u2019s future with the team. A collision jerks me back to the game- Rinno\u2019s virtual car had rebounded into the track, colliding with a Plutonia Engineering car and causing a Centurion driver to fly into the air. I winced- my car had a flat tyre, preventing me from rejoining. I restart, trying to suppress a giggle at the flying mess of cars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nA second attempt goes better- I manages to last nine laps before a stupid mistake sends me off into the grass at 250 kerblometers per hour, pretty close to the top speed of about 280. The car spins in a 180 before burying its rear-end in the barrier, still traveling at roughly 160 k. The car flips over and rebounds into the path of two cars, prompting heavy braking and a safety car. Finally on my third attempt, I finish all thirty-one laps, crossing the finish in second. A last-lap overtake around Quantic probably was the cause; the pit strategy that saved me nearly 30 seconds probably helped, too. Louis from Ferram Manor Racing had won, of course- he was in his fourth year in Formula K, and rumors were abound that he\u2019d be moving to Ferram\u2019s K1 team mid-season if he kept up his form- winning at Marcolo, fourth in Aptur and second in Eradica. He was easily my biggest rival, but the worst thing about having him as a rival was the fact that he was simply too hard to hate- super-nice and friends with everyone, except yours truly and probably the rookies, Louis was the definition of \u2018cool guy\u2019. He was my biggest motivation to win, to show everyone that I could be just as good as him, and not just the scrappy underdog. Switching off the sim and heading into the kitchen, I thought to myself, \u003Cem\u003EWell, maybe if I win, the stupid grin is gonna die on Louis\u2019 face.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nOne sandwich later, and we were off to the Speedway. Formula K races are obviously less famous than the several K1 Grand Prix dotted all over Kerbin- anything less than half a million spectators was seen as a poor showing there. While Formula K races still were less popular, the number of spectators was growing each year as cheaper tickets and more hectic racing appealed to more people. Thomasville was unique in that it was the only \u2018speedway\u2019 oval track in both Formula K and K1 (no ovals in K1, leave that to the boxercars). Most people wanted it gone from the roster, mostly racing purists who thought ovals were boring. I disagreed: taking the banking at 260 k and slipstreaming other cars was both a challenge and fun, not to mention that Vertica didn\u2019t have a K1 track yet- I had to support my home, after all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nArriving in the pre-race room, I glanced at the race order. Having already qualified seventh, with teammate Saul (an older, semi-retired GP Course racer) in thirteenth, I was feeling pretty good. My best performances had all come from mid-pack or back-of-the-pack situations- I\u2019d qualified ninth in Aptur to finish second, and fourteenth in Ozitec to finish fifth. I recognized a few faces- Dre, fresh off his win in Eradica, Melcan, who\u2019d battled from a last-place puncture in Marcolo and battled up to tenth and of course, Louis (with his stupid, glittery smile) who fist-bumps me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHow\u2019s it going, bro!\u201D Louis grins when he sees me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EShut up.

Louis narrows his eyes and raises his hands in surrender. I want to punch him, but he\u2019d fall on Carlos. Hoping to distract me, Carlos gets between us and says:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHey, I heard through the sunfruit vine that Jebediah Kerman will show up with the talent scouts.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nThis sparks a good twenty minutes of idle chatter about Jeb- we\u2019ve all been fans of the way his skilled driving got him the 2036 championship and his success story. Charles- the quiet-spoken rookie in his first year- says that his lucky helmet was signed by Jeb himself, and we all crowd round to read the signature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nFly high Charles- Jeb Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI was wearing it the day I got sixth in Aptur, and tenth in Eradica when I dodged that huge wreck on lap 17. Guess Jeb guided me through that one.\u201D He shrugs, and I pat him on the back. Charles is obviously new to the scene- him and Brendon being the only rookies in Formula K at the moment- but he\u2019ll hopefully mature as a driver.

Meanwhile, Kantor is round Turn 2, limping as his damaged back wing holds up his car\u2019s progress. I\u2019m locked on like a heat-seeking missile, gaining so fast on the straight that it almost seems like a cartoon. The first group of leaders has crossed the line; with a groan, I see that Louis has won by just half a car length ahead of Hansibald. Gritting my teeth, I fly into the outside on Turn 3, my tires screeching as I fly into the turn about forty kerblometers per hour faster than was necessary.

Today is a strategic day in the championship- mid-points results from Arcazon Kerman, despite being some of the season\u2019s best drives, have done nothing to help his championship standings. His championship hopes could be in real danger. Meanwhile, Louis Kerman leads the championship by a record amount, beating Phil Kerman\u2019s record of 128 points by Round 6. Arcazon Kerman starts sixth on the grid, ahead of Konstantin Kerman in the HRM car, while Louis Kerman sits on pole with teammate Melcan locking out the front row. Charles and Brendon Kerman will be the ones to watch, with Brendon in tenth and Charles thirteenth. Could we see a battle for the lower points positions?

Two other cars are involved, and both of them are out, a Vernier Motorsport car with a buckled front wheel, and a Carillo car on its side, driver shaking his head dazedly.. I\u2019ve got minor damage to my rear wing, but my rear right tire has kerb scarring- I hit it backwards, at the wrong angle, at 130 kph.

If the comms weren\u2019t muted, Teddy would definitely be telling me how the engine was being wrecked and exactly however much a brand spanking-new engine was.

If done right, it could make history, win a race, save a car even. But if you failed, it could mean fighting for something else, something altogether more sobering- your own life. To psyche out another driver, you had to unnerve them enough so that they make a mistake and you pass. However, for 99% of drivers, you had to also balance this with aggressive overtaking and obeying regulation rules. I keep all this in mind as I swerve acoss Louis into Turn 9, setting up a fake \u2018overtaking move\u2019 for Turn 10. Louis throws up his hand in frustration,but it\u2019s all too close and too rapid to make out anything but a small, shimmery motion of Louis\u2019 racing glove. I dive down into Turn 10 then let him back through with a \u2018wheel lockup\u2019. Feinting left and right into Turns 11 and 12, I see Louis start to crack. His car becomes slower, his movements more erratic. Paddy, OTech boss, makes a rare appearance. I squawk awkwardly at him: \u201CGonna send it.\u201D Then, suddenly, Louis brakes way too late for Turn 14.

I apologise. Although you might want to wash your shirt.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShut up, Jim. Now, the Aquarian circuit is home to some of the most compacted turns in modern motorsport, with 25 corners spread along its 2.3 mile length. We\u2019ve had some incredible battles here; one can\u2019t forget Murray Kerman holding off Jenson Kerman for sixteen laps back in 2021, or Phil Kerman\u2019s dominant race win in 2030, where he beat second place by almost a minute.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COf course, Jeremy, this weekend is no different. We\u2019ve got Arcazon Kerman, whose brilliant podium from fourteenth on the grid in the last race in Bradley raised more than a few eyebrows from the more established teams, whereas Dre Kerman\u2019s win in Owlia brings him within four points of Louis Kerman, who finished a dismal fourth after a problem in the pits and a huge mistake on the final corner of the last lap, which allowed Arcazon Kerman to take the last podium spot.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIndeed, Jim: today we\u2019re going to see who sets quickest times in preparation for the qualifying effort tomorrow.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s all well and good talking about close racing, Jeremy, but mind you don\u2019t get too close to me; or indeed anything else apart from a good shower.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSHUT UP, JIM!

I revved the engine up to 12,500 rpm, then released the clutch and pulled out of the garage, settling in behind a Vernier Motorsport car on my way to the pit exit\u2019s white line. The tortured roar of a car gunning it down the home straight echoes off my eardrums as a silver blur rockets past. The black and blue Vernier car passes the pit line and screams as its driver takes off the pit limiter and shoots off in a cloud of burned rubber and tyre smoke. I pass the limiter, shift up and grin maniacally as the acceleration pins me back in my seat and the raucous wail of my now-freed engine fills my ears.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow this is why I get out of bed in the morning, I grinned to myself as the car flies downhill towards the apex of Turn 1, and around the kerb before slingshotting away around the exit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nThe car feels amazing as I use up all the space exiting the second turn and hammer away down the straight. My head instinctively tilts in preparation for the hard braking into Turn 3, and the car\u2019s carbon ceramic brakes glow as I twist the steering wheel into the apex, then pinning the throttle wide open, a tortured scream echoing from the engine and a cheer from the thin crowd braving the heat to watch the less expensive practice sessions. The slight kink of Turn 4 looms under the home straight bridge. The sonorous roar of the high revving Formula K engine echoes, multifaceted, off the walls off the softly lit tunnel. Passing through Turn 4, I emerge into bright daylight and right into the entry of a sharp, near-180-degree, low speed hairpin: Turn 5. I kick the back end out slightly and judder across the inside kerb, small stones becoming dislodged and scattering in the car\u2019s wake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nI twist the wheel 180 degrees and hunker down through the right-left-right complex of turns 6,7 and 8. It\u2019s another long straight, ringed with spectator stands and enclosed spectator bridges arching over the track. I scream under the four consecutive loops, readying myself for Turn 9. Turn\u00A0 is a vicious hairpin, in which the fastest cars can pull 3 to 4 G\u2019s speeding through the apex. I brake hard and late, feeling my eyes straining against the deacceleration from 280 kph to barely 50 kph in just under two and a half seconds. I redline the engine, and the rear wheels smoke up as the car exits the turn, accelerating like a stone out of a sling.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy brake management sees me getting a brilliant run into Turn 10, then out in a screaming blur of tyre smoke and blue and white. Turns 11 and 12 pass in a blur of kerbing; before I know it, I\u2019m flying up out of 13 towards the fast right hander of Turn 14, and down the home stretch. The paddles flick up gears at the tiniest response from my fingers, my eyesight seems muddied and blurred, spots of light dance across the track as the car shoots under the wide boughed willow trees. I shift down, take my foot off the accelerator slightly and shoot straight through the S-bends of Turn 15 and 16, then another long straight before Turn 17 and 18. I\u2019m glad I told the guys to be absolutely silent during the first lap; really gets me in the zone. No distractions. Just me, my car, and the track! I brake late into 17 and lock up, barely keeping off the grass as I fishtail through the fast three turn complex of 18, 19 and 20, somehow maintaining the drift. Stupid rookie mistake, I chide myself. Watch the circuit. Don\u2019t lose your braking line. I conservatively take the outside line through Turns 21, 22,and 23, leaving me to attack the kerb on Turn 24\u2019s apex and giving me a perfect exit onto the straight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI begin to pass the braking boards and slam on the anchors into the final corner, Turn 25. It\u2019s a sharp and nasty turn where many a driver has misjudged his braking point and slid into the gravel. It\u2019s not getting me today, though; the deceleration rattles my teeth as I slide beautifully into the apex, roaring out and flipping open the DRS. As I pass the start line, Teddy breaks his no-speaking vow and shouts into the comms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ve burned up the rears, your engine is over revving and you\u2019re forcing the car too much into the turns. Please, take it easy!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI roll my eyes exasperatedly. Some things never change.

Flanked by Teddy and some scary, mute Securidado personnel from the circuit\u2019s staff, we cut a swath through the intrusive journalists until we find the voice\u2019s origin; unsurprisingly, it\u2019s Aisling, the female reporter from earlier. I flash her a quick smile. \u201CHey.\u201D She looks at me, businesslike but with the fastest traces of a smirk playing around her lips. She shouts back to a harried gaggle of camera kerbals loading a shot rig into a truck.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAny of the Interview Rooms open?\u201D she shouts. A silver haired female kerbal turns and shouts back: \u201CYep, Interview Room Two is all set up and ready.\u201D Aisling nods and jogs around to a squat modern building, ushering me to follow. I walk over the faded pavement and through a white, windowed door, following Aisling.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nInside, there\u2019s absolute pandemonium. Lights blare down in a blue-carpeted corridor as journalists shuffle, coffee is spilled and orders are shouted. I duck and weave, following the cornflower blue of Aisling\u2019s dress through the maze of kerbals, desks and paper stacks, all the while feeling the heavy blast of an industrial aircon. Finally, after many muffled apologies and one spilled sunfruit juice, I reach the end of the corridor and push open the plain grey door- indistinguishable from the others except for the golden number 2 screwed just above the doorknob. Pushing it gently open, I\u2019m greeted with a pleasantly open space, filled by the soft glow of studio lights and ringed in cushy seats; Aisling already has her camerakerb aiming at her, she\u2019s sitting on a maroon sofa. I sit casually at the other end. She turns to me and whispers:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ve done this before: just some quick questions, a goodbye and a wrap.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nI smirk. \u201CDoes this include more awkward questions and kissing?\u201D She chuckles quietly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt might do if you behave. Now shut up and smile for the cameras.\u201D She turns to the camerakerb.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLester, take it from a soft 37 and a pan. Zoom 4 then focus on me at timestamp 2-38. Got it?\u201D Lester the camerakerb gives a silent thumbs up and switches a red light to orange, counting down with his fingers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFive, four, three, two, one- the light goes green, I affix my face into a relaxed smile, and Aisling launches into a well-rehearsed introduction.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHello, Carthia! This is Aisling Kerman, here in sunny Aquaria with Arcazon Kerman, who has just finished driving in the practice session for the Formula K Aquarian Superprix! Arcazon, how was the drive?\u201D She points the microphone at me and I clear my throat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, it was great to be back in Aquaria today; the circuit\u2019s always been a favorite of mine and I\u2019m so glad to be back. The car felt great- that\u2019s all down to Teddy, Joe and all the boys in the garage. They\u2019re up working on this amazing machine to ensure it performs at its peak: I\u2019m just the guy who turns up and drives it at the end of the day.\u201D Polite chuckles from Aisling and Lester bolster my goofy grin. Aisling, more serious now, jabs the microphone back at me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWas sixth place an accurate representation of your qualifying pace for tomorrow?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nI put on a diplomatic smile. \u201CI\u2019m just getting used to the track; obviously we\u2019d have liked to have placed higher but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll show our true pace tomorrow for the qualifying session.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAisling smiles, pleased with the neutral answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat about your championship battle with Melcan Kerman? You\u2019re only thirteen points behind after leapfrogging Hansibald in the standings with your podium in Owlia. Do you think you can catch him?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nI shrug. \u201CMelcan is a fantastic racer and he\u2019s incredibly consistent, showing the benefit of several seasons\u2019 experience. I can\u2019t honestly say whether I\u2019ll catch him or not; but anything can happen, and we\u2019ve got to focus on these next races.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAisling nods. \u201COne final question: what do you think about your chances of landing a K1 seat for 2039?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe question momentarily stuns me: after a moment\u2019s hesitation, I jump in with an answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s too early to say. Some would argue another year in Formula to hone my skills would be the best bet, but I reckon if I keep up my good form, I could be contending for a seat at OTech next year.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nAisling turns to Lester.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThank you, Arcazon.

Back to Kyle in the studio!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAisling whoops with the kind of joy I can only imagine comes from a successful live interview. I\u2019m getting to my feet and smiling- I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t enjoy an interesting interview in a quiet, secluded room- better than talking to the media vultures out there. My train of thought is interrupted by a hug from Aisling. Startled, I instinctively return the hug. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Lester gaping as he returns his equipment to the bag. I shoot him a death glare and he looks down, sheepish. Aisling\u2019s hair smells of prickle berries and freshly cut grass: a wonderful shampoo, no doubt. She lets go and grins.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou did great! Oh, I\u2019m so looking forward to qualifying!\u201D she enthuses wildly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSee you there?\u201D I smile back. \u201CWho knows, I might even get a top 3!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe smirks, her enthusiam infectious. \u201CI hope so. Catch you later, hotshot.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wink back as I head for the door. \u201CIn a while, reporter extraordinaire.\u201D She grins as I wave goodbye, and push back through the corridor. I\u2019m already preparing myself for qualifying: I\u2019ve got to keep showing OTech I\u2019m worthy of a future in K1, and it all starts here in Aquaria.

Secondly, what are your predictions for the qualifying?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, Jim, seeing as your career as an aspiring comedian hasn\u2019t worked out yet, I suppose I\u2019m resigned to telling you what I think, if your tiny brain can comprehend it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCareful, Jeremy, if you want to put people to sleep you\u2019d better stop using big words and start using chloroform-\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately they\u2019ve stopped me from using it, or you wouldn\u2019t be talking right now, Jim.

After a predictably rapid time put Louis Kerman at the top of the timesheets in Free Practice, and given the Aquarian circuit\u2019s suitability to the Ferram car, he\u2019s the red hot favorite to qualify on pole. Melcan and Dre Kerman round out the top three on the timesheets, with Velocity Motorsport\u2019s George Kerman as an outside prospect in fourth. Arcazon Kerman takes the OTech to sixth, behind Carlos Kerman in fifth. Jim, what are your predictions for today\u2019s qualifying?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, Jeremy, it\u2019s clear for all to see that despite some spirited advances by Melcan and Dre, Louis Kerman is still faster than a greased ferret with a lit firework up its-\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShut it, Jim!

However, the rest of the grid is looking as changeable as a roulette table spinning on a knifepoint, with strong lap times from rookies George and Arcazon Kerman, not to mention veterans Carlos, Dre and Melcan putting in some very solid laps. Of course, the bright glare from your clearly whitened teeth might put them off-\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI HAVE NOT HAD MY TEETH WHITENED, YOU-\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe rest of this message has been censored by Acuario Televisio.

Cars are roaring in their pit boxes as a last minute check, and the sharp blares of car horns and screams from fans mingle with the whirr of wrenches, chatter from commentary boxes and the raw throated screams of cars flying past. The sun blazes down on the thousands of eager spectators, faded national flags and gleaming Formula K cars. I grin, in spite of the trials ahead.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is where I belong.

The sun blinds me momentarily, like a heat lamp flicked on in a dark room. I squint against the glare and roll towards the pit exit. This race could make or break my hopes of staying with OTech, and the enormity of this situation crouches on my shoulders, breathing down my neck. I disengage the pit limiter, and the chirrup of cold tires gripping on to sunbaked tarmac revitalises my poor mood.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis has to be it. You need to pull it off here, or we might never make it to K1.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe raucous wail of the engine vibrates my luridly-helmeted head as I pin the accelerator downhill towards Turn One, brushing the apex lightly before the cold rear tyres squirm and squeal in protest. Teddy bursts onto the radio with all the subtlety of a rabid and slightly cross bear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CArcazon, you idiot! Those tyres are supposed to be warmed, not torn to shreds before the flaming lap starts!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nI grit my teeth, choosing not to reply, and instead gripping the wheel with both hands and clenching as I swing wide into Turn 2.

Radio silence guys, please.\u201D I responded. To tell you the honest truth, I\u2019d driven like a complete lousefest. I was currently sitting tenth, four places below my expected target of sixth. It was starting to look a bit hopeless. But Dad always said, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. As I switched the car into rich revs and short shifted into Turn 1, the angry rev of the redlining engine brought me crashing back to reality. Maybe it was hopeless. \u003Cem\u003EMaybe I wouldn\u2019t make into K1\u003C/em\u003E, I considered as I slingshotted my car through the inside of Turn 2, \u003Cem\u003Ebut I\u2019d sure as hell die trying.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nI brake hard into Turn 3 and mount the kerb, carrying my speed onto the tunnel straight and barely slowing down for the kink of Turn 4. Flying out from under the bridge, I rapidly shift down and stamp both the accelerator and brake, acting on instinct. The rear starts sliding, but I counteract it with a flick of my wrist in the opposite direction, sending the car howling towards Turns 6, 7 and 8. Careful light pulls on the wheel send the car straight through the bends without breaking a sweat. Going into Turn 9, I brake aggressively late and swing the car across the apex of the hairpin, almost hitting the wall. Before I have time to chide myself, I\u2019ve flown through Turns 10 and 11 and am halfway through Turn 12, my body operating on autopilot and weirdly separated from my mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nI lock up slightly into 13, missing the inside line and sending an acrid cloud of blue tinted smoke up into the stands. Fans are clapping and some joker is blaring an airhorn in the stands somewhere. I ignore them and instead upshift massively into Turn 14. The engine yowls like a scolded cat, and I slingshot out of T14 down the home stretch, hitting 305 kph before ramming the brakes and mounting the kerbs at the Turn 15-16 S-bend. A perfect exit sends me with a brilliant run down to turn 17. I nail a perfect apex and manage not to repeat my mistakes from practice, avoiding lock-up.Spinning the wheel left and right impossibly quickly as I round the technical triple corner series of 18, 19 and 20 nearly distracts me, but I hold on through the conflicting lateral g-forces. Pinning the accelerator down, I savagely attack the kerbs on turns 21 to 24- no conservative lines. It\u2019s a good lap, maybe even top 3 material. The strangled screech of the tires as I brake heavily into Turn 25 seems like razors to my ears, sharpening my focus and intensifying my resolve as I fly out of the inside of T25 and down the straight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe engine whines as I cross the line; nearly starved of fuel, it auto-shifts into reserve fuel mode.

That has to be at least top 5, right?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot top 5, son.\u201D says Teddy.

WAAAHAHAHAHOOOOOOO!\u201D I scream into the microphone, doubtlessly deafening everything in a two-mile radius of the OTech pit box. At this point, I pull to the outside absent-mindedly, letting fast-lapping cars through as I coast on momentum down the straight from the Turn 14 exit. I\u2019m so wrapped up in the news of the provisional pole that I don\u2019t notice a backmarker car- the Virtuolli Motors of Antonio Kerman- directly behind, presumably trying to catch a tow from my slower car. I turn slowly, going quite wide into 15, when-\u003Cbr\u003E\nCRUNCH.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rear spins out and I\u2019m engulfed in a cloud of smoke: while not as dramatic as a fully under-braking collision, even a slight bump at those low speeds can cause major damage to the car\u2019s internals. I take my hands away from the wheel and allow the car to roll into the gravel. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Antonio\u2019s tattered car rolling back on track and out of sight. The fans are booing- something\u2019s happened to their hometown hero. I radio in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTeddy, what the hell was that! Did Antonio ram me or something?\u201D I say, trying to keep myself calm.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe hit you going into 15- you didn\u2019t see him, so you weren\u2019t quite wide enough to allow him through the inside. His front wing hit your rear, and judging from the tatters it\u2019s hanging in, it\u2019s not looking good for his hotlap.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCrap. I crashed into the home hero driver on his hotlap. Keeping my thoughts practical, I ask quietly: \u201CHow\u2019s the car looking, guys?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNot great,\u201D says Stuart from engineering. \u201CThe right support beam on your rear wing is toast, and your rear right suspension has taken a small bump. Nothing we can\u2019t handle mate, bring her in nice and gentle for us.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that.\u201D I reply tersely, and coast the car back to the pits on what I can only assume is condensed fuel on the inside walls of the fuel tank. As I cruise back into pit lane, I hear shouting and vaguely familiar Aquarian words. Translating with my admittedly poor grasp of Aquarian, I shudder.\u003Cem\u003E Not good at all.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPulling the car to a gentle stop, I lever myself out of the cockpit with the car parked in the outer bay- a common practise for angry drivers. The team back off as I put my head in my hands and hobble unsteadily a few steps away.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAntonio\u2019s going to press a penalty, and I\u2019m going to lose the only pole I\u2019ve ever had. Without looking at the team, I sigh: \u201CDid we get pole?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA quiet voice I recognize as Barzon the fuel technician pipes up. \u201CWe did, by 0.064 seconds.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nI chuckle derisively and walk a few steps further away. Suddenly, Teddy\u2019s voice shouts across at me.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201CArcazon!

I crash to the ground, holding the left side of my head and dimly registering a luridly patterned helmet, loud voices and the angry face of Antonio Kerman, who now occupied the #1 spot of Who Hates Arcazon The Most Right Now list, dethroning Louis from a surprisingly long stint at the top. His screamed Aquarian was a mess of swearwords and abuse, but I managed to catch the most important bits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u201C\u00BFCrees que puedes echarme de la carrera, gilipollas? \u00BFVos si?\u00A0 \u00BFCabr\u00F3n?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAh.
