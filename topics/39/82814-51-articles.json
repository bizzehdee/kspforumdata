I felt a lot of pressure to deliver and I suppose it just lead me to keep the series on hold for a while. The plan from here is to work on and release the series regularly, with a slight step back from time consuming one-off special effects/cinematics and to use a recurring yet high quality formula that will enable me to tell the story consistently. I\u0027ve also made the first episode from a collection of remasterings of the old KS episodes, I\u0027ll be releasing that tomorrow.
