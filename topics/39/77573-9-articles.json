The first stage launches vertically, the second stage continues firing to bring time-to Ap up. The Booster has to be switched to before it hits 30km, or it will unload. I switch to it and I fire backwards until the path leads to KSC. Then I switch to the second stage and circularize the orbit. I rarely end up with maneuvering fuel to spare, and sometimes I don\u0027t make orbit.
