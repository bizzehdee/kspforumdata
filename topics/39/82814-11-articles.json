Missile defense system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new update to BD Armory, you can make crafts enter a guard mode. This mode allows players to fight against AI\u0027s sort of like the skillful mod. However, players can make crafts attack two different types of targets. Normally they would attack the craft itself but with the simple click of a button, you can make the AI only target missiles fired from enemy crafts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where the laser comes in. What you can do is set up crafts with lasers to defend key areas like an base or something. And because the laser is so powerful and so accurate they are perfect for the job. That being said, any craft launching a missile at a target will be surprised to find lasers simply shooting their missile out of the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the laser defense system has two weaknesses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
