If you noticed that your craft was taking heat in your 3rd stage.. it\u0027s because you were exceeding the terminal velocity of the vehicle. I\u0027m not sure which rockomax you had on the back of it, but mainsail or skipper regardless, you had about a thrust to weight ratio of 3\u002B (likely higher with the massive increase in velocity) I\u0027m going to guess so you could end up getting more bang for your buck in that stage by throttling down and still maintaining upward velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T21:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip, ill appreciate it! Id love if you have more tips, id like to make my rockets fly higher. Also, some rockets start flipping over at a certain high altitude, which causes me to lose control. Could you help me with that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
