Jerfun\u0027s shoulders throbbed with the effort of keeping its blade level, his hands aching with cold and vibration even through his thickly padded gloves. He switched off the saw and slipped it carefully out of the trunk, before fitting two slim wedges into the cut and driving them home with practiced blows from his hammer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe resinous scent of freshly sawn wood blended with the sharp nip of frost in the air as Jerfun slotted a felling bar into place, picked up his chainsaw with a grunt and set to work finishing the cut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELast one of the day, thank the Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong habit and careful routine made him take one last look to the sides and two looks down the drop line. Quickly, he stepped back and sideways, keeping one eye on the poised trunk, then took hold of the felling bar with both hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dropping!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, majestically, the tree began to topple, spindly branches tilting against the leaden sky. The last sliver of wood holding the trunk together gave way with a resounding crack and seconds later it thudded into the forest floor amidst a great snapping and tearing of undergrowth. Jerfun picked up his loppers and began trimming. By the time Bureny arrived on her kaya, he\u0027d reduced the bottlebrush tree to a single long log and a respectable bundle of firewood. The enormous woolly animal snorted as Bureny backed it up to the log, the warm, wet smell of fermented lichens on its breath overpowering the scents of sap and crushed bottlebrush needles. Bureny tossed a towline to Jerfun, who lashed it around the log and tied on the bundle of branches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMove on ya!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kaya lumbered forward up the steep forest trail, oblivious to the extra weight. Jerfun plodded along behind, one eye on the path and one eye on the tip of the log bumping over the frozen ground in front of him. As they crested the rise and stepped out onto the main road, Jerfun was breathing hard and the waiting lumber truck, grapple at the ready, was a welcome sight. He unhitched Bureny\u0027s mount from its load, heaved the bundle of branches onto the back of the truck and clambered thankfully into the warm, oily fug of its cabin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLumber trucks, Jerfun decided, represented the best of his people. Hard wearing, hard working and built for practicality not sentiment. \u003Cem\u003EAnd just like many a good northern Wakiran, they can also be an honest-to-Kerm pain in the ass.\u003C/em\u003E His teeth snapped together as the truck jolted over yet another pothole and lurched to a stop. The driver swore, shifted into reverse and slowly backed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trailer sprang free, its suddenly shifting weight causing the truck to fishtail violently, one wheel lifting off the ground. Automatically, Jerfun slid across the back seat, throwing his meagre weight against the tilt. Calmly, the driver spun his wheel, the back of the truck swinging out in response and thudding back on to the road. He shoved the gear lever forward with a crunch, engine screaming in protest as it took up the load. The truck slowed, logs thudding ominously against the trailer and then began to creep forward around the pothole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther into the hills, the ride began to smoothen out and heaps of chippings began to appear by the side of the road, half buried in the snow. The road itself was a pitted patchwork of fill-ins and craters, gravel and hard-packed earth providing a temporary surface. Red striped marker poles stood out brightly against a landscape of whites and greys. As the road wound down through a cleft in the snow-capped hills, it was joined by a foaming, iron-grey brook. Jerfun nodded in satisfaction. \u003Cem\u003E Fresh water, good defensible territory and it\u0027s on \u003C/em\u003Eour\u003Cem\u003E side of the border. We\u0027ll take the high ground here \u003C/em\u003Eand\u003Cem\u003E in Conclave.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if to mark his words, the truck grumbled to a halt with a squeal of hydraulics, belching a cloud of sooty smoke from its exhaust stack. The heavy, gated log palisade blocking their way was tall enough that the two kerbals standing guard on its parapet could comfortably look down into the exhaust stack if they felt so inclined, and thick enough to give the driver of most vehicles pause for thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot, thought Jerfun, eying the guards, that they would get that far. The rough-and-ready barricade they were guarding stood in stark contrast to their conspicuously carried and thoroughly modern hunting rifles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAnd anything that can put a charging scallan down cold will have no trouble with a set of tyres. Truly, we need more than logs to protect them but until the thaw starts logs will have to do.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third guard peered through the cab window, nodded as she recognised Jerfun and waved them on. The truck rumbled smoothly through the gates and out into the wider valley beyond. Beside them, the stream burbled through a tunnel cut into the log walls and wound away out of sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA partially completed watchtower stood atop the hill on either side of the palisade. Jerfun watched a distant team of kayas dragging sleds of supplies and building materials up to one of them, leaving a broad swathe of trodden down snow and the occasional heap of dung in their wake a work gang of kerbals were busily digging out the compacted snow and marking out the boundaries of a new trail with wooden planks. The dung went on to a nearby trailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA similarly industrious scene greeted them when they finally pulled up at the new village site. Another gang of kerbals were methodically packing rounded stream-bed stones into a newly dug out road bed and filling in the gaps with gravel to create a crude but serviceable cobbled crossroad. A pair of broad, low slung log cabins faced each other across the street, each with an attached outhouse. Next door to one of them, a workshop spilled soft yellow light and paler yellow drifts of sawdust onto the cobbles. Jerfun nodded approvingly at the row of neatly turned and carved porch rails propped against the workshop wall. \u003Cem\u003EPleasing to see a touch of civilisation in this back end of nowhere.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther up the street and well away from the cabins, half a dozen lugubrious kaya stood by their paddock rail, backs into the wind; heavy, horned heads foraging under the snow, indifferent to the activity going on around them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe driver\u0027s door slammed, the truck rocking as the driver clambered up behind the cab. Machinery whined to life, followed by the rattling of chains and the distinctive clunk of the grapple closing around a log. Jerfun watched it swing past the cabin door before setting its load down neatly by the workshop. He rapped sharply on the rear window of the cab, opened the door and jumped down, grabbing his rifle from behind his seat as he went. As he slammed the door shut and sprinted clear of the truck, he heard the grapple starting up again behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small, brick building with a galvanised sheet iron roof stood on a concrete plinth at the very centre of the crossroads. Jerfun unloaded his weapon, dropping the clip into his pocket. He reached under his jacket for his key, unlocked the heavy steel door and stepped inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cloying scent of gun oil in a confined space assaulted his nostrils as he scanned the wall-to-wall gun racks for a space. \u003Cem\u003EHardly enough room in here but I\u0027m Blighted if we\u0027re spending more time hauling cement and steel until the thaw.\u003C/em\u003E He stowed his rifle on the nearest rack with a grunt and dropped his clip into its storage box. \u003Cem\u003EThen again, don\u0027t expect the Kerm is going to be doing much in this weather either. Should have this place locked down tight by the time it gets round to Seeding.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRain beat against Lemdan\u0027s oilskins and trickled over his boots. Runnels of water ran this way and that over the heaving deck, glistening on the heavily varnished planks. In the distance, the Crater beacons gleamed in the dark, the square windows of the nearest ones shining against the night sky, the furthest ones twinkling like stars in the distance. Lemdan crouched by the binnacle, sighting the two brightest beacons across his compass. He grunted, checked the anchor line was still sliding freely in its blocks and retreated under the cabin roof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhilst it\u0027s name had changed numerous times over the centuries, the Crater had been a favourite port of call for seafaring kerbals since the Age of Sail and possibly long before. Historically, the enormous natural harbours afforded by it\u0027s forbiddingly jagged walls, had been the economic force responsible for cementing a loose alliance of Wakiran city states into Kerbin\u0027s pre-eminent maritime trading nation and eventually, Regionality. At it\u0027s height, the wealth and power of Wakira had rivalled even that of Doren, providing a crucial political counterbalance within the young Council of Twelve Pillars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModern day Wakira was still a political and economic force to be reckoned with although its influence had declined since the Age of Sail, especially with the advent of air travel. Nevertheless the Crater harbours remained the busiest seaport in the world, their network of radar stations watching over the constant traffic of hundreds of, predominantly sail-driven, merchant vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the southernmost tip of the Crater wall, rain spattered off the windows of one station, the ceaseless drumming unnoticed by the three kerbals inside. Two of them sat in front of a large radar screen, their faces lit from beneath by its soft green glow. The Harbourmaster stood at the back of the room listening intently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCourse I\u0027m in the right place! Yer think I can\u0027t take a bearing on a pair o\u0027 beacons?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not doubting you, Captain,\u0022\u00A0replied Edbur wearily, \u201Cit\u0027s just that we can\u0027t see you from here either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou want mebbe I should point my torch at yeh? Pretty sure I could find yeh, even if you cannot find me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt might just come to that, Captain,\u0022 sighed Edbur, \u201Cbut please could we try one more observation before we call it a night?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf yeh think I\u0027m getting any closer to these cliffs at night, lad, yeh\u0027ve got another think coming!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CActually, Captain, we\u0027re thinking that you might be too close to the cliffs already. If you wouldn\u0027t mind, please could you sail one kilometre further west and heave to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe voice on the other end of the radio sounded suddenly amused. \u201CNo need for heaving to, lad - I\u0027m not in my sailing hauler tonight, nor my raft for that matter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other radar operator turned to look at Edbur, eyebrows raised. \u201CCome on, Ed - he\u0027s not going to be in our shadow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdbur rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. \u201CHe\u0027s not,\u0022 he said, \u201Cbut I want to get him out of all that surface clutter around the cliffs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s not going to help much in this weather.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdbur counted to three under his breath. \u201CI \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E that Gil but I\u0027m starting to run out of ideas here. \u0022He gestured at the shifting patterns of speckles on the radar screen. \u201CIf we can at least get rid of the rock returns, we might just have a chance of picking him out of the rest of that junk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last metre of chain clinked dully against the fibreglass hull. Lemgan hauled the anchor over the side, folded it and stowed it neatly under a bench with the coiled anchor line. He took his place behind the wheel, glancing distastefully at the idling diesel motor mounted on the stern. Swinging the wheel hard over, he opened the throttle, wincing as the motor roared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENoisy damn things. Wouldn\u0027t want to be runnin\u0027 out of battery on a night like this though and least this weather is keepin\u0027 the reek away.\u003C/em\u003E Lemgan glanced at his compass. \u003Cem\u003ENot too shoddy. Got a while till the tide turns and I\u0027m doubtin\u0027 they\u0027ll need me exactly due west anyway. Right, that should do it.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemgan eased the throttle back, locked his wheel and made his way forward. Cleating the line securely, he unfolded the anchor again and dropped it over the side, paying it out hand over hand. Easing the boat into reverse, he rested his hand on the line for a moment then, satisfied that nothing was dragging, switched off the motor. For a minute he stared entranced at the ragged, phosphorescent wake trailing back towards the cliffs. Hordes of tiny nightfish dove in and out of the froth, feeding on the churned up plankton; their scales glinting in the luminous glow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReluctantly he went back to the cockpit and picked up his microphone. \u201CLemgan here. Anchor set - any sign of me yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot yet, Captain,\u0022 Edbur replied. \u201CNot even with your wake to point the way.\u0022 He sighed. \u201CMaybe that\u0027s the answer. Forget about the radar, build a chain of watchtowers and have their crews look out for wakes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWouldn\u0027t work,\u0022 said Lemgan. \u201CIf I was that dead set on smuggling Kerm seeds, I\u0027d charter a boat, give it a reason to be close to shore so yer watchers are expectin\u0027 it, then row a dinghy in after dusk. Wouldn\u0027t work around these parts but if the coast was kinder and ah was really desperate, ah\u0027d swim. Either way there\u0027s be no wake givin\u0027 me away.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI suppose so,\u0022\u00A0said Edbur. \u201CI think we\u0027re done for tonight, Captain. The Harbourmaster conveys his thanks and bids you safe seas on the way home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood,\u0022 Lemgan replied. \u201CSigning off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStatic poured out of the speaker. Silently, Gilbin leaned over and switched off the radio. \u201CWell so much for that idea,\u0022 he said. \u201CIf the powers-that-be want a coastal surveillance system it\u0027s gonna cost them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Harbourmaster cleared his throat. \u201CAre you suggesting that we could use some other sensors?\u0022 he said. \u201CInfra-red perhaps?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot a bad idea,\u0022\u00A0said Gilbin, \u201Cbut radar will do jus\u0027\u00A0fine. Pickin\u0027 out a small target is easy enough in good weather and can even be done in this muck.\u0022He gestured dismissively at the window. \u201CProblem number one is that yer standard traffic management antenna isn\u0027t built for the high gain, narrow beamwidth system that yer need for the job and problem number two is that a narrow beamwidth antenna isn\u0027t exactly set up for scannin\u0027 large areas. Which means a lot of expensive new stations if yer want to watch the whole coast.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe glanced at Edbur. \u201CWhich is a waste of time in my not-so-humble opinion. Tryin\u0027 to watch the whole coastline to stop one kerbal in a rowin\u0027 boat?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdbur stirred. \u201CIt\u0027s not the single seed carrying kerbal we should be looking for,\u0022 he agreed. \u201Cbut everything else you need to start a new Grove. Any ship big enough to carry that would be easy enough to spot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnless, as the good Captain pointed out, it was there for wholly legitimate reasons,\u0022 said the Harbourmaster heavily. He threw up his hands resignedly. \u201CEven so - unofficially - I\u0027m inclined to agree with you. Nevertheless, the powers-that-be have not so politely requested that I investigate all options.\u0022 He looked at Gilbin. \u201CI would be much obliged if you could draw up an engineering summary of your high gain system. Equipment requirements, numbers of stations - everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden stared out to sea, elbows resting on the newly poured harbour wall. Below, a similarly clean, concrete jetty slashed an angular weal across the incoming tide, the blocky new buildings strewn across the wharf speaking more to urgent need and raw functionality than any kind of aesthetic sense. A squad of converted coastal cutters rode at anchor, deck guns reflecting the cloudy sky in sullen gunmetal grey. Across the bay, the old lifeboat station nestled into the cliffside, its launch ramp stained in shades of algae, rust and trailing seaweeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CApproaching target zone. Weapon hot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, Vanguard. Clear for release.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeilbin shivered at the matter-of-fact radio chatter. He raised his binoculars to his eyes, settling his gaze on the dark bulk on the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft banked hard, dropping into a spiralling dive before pulling out into a series of sluggish S-turns. It rolled wings-level, a glinting speck falling away from its belly as it raced towards the ship, then pulled up and commenced a slow, wide circle of its target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fountain of spray erupted, completely obscuring Neilbin\u0027s view. He twisted the focus dial on his binoculars, trying to see through the turbulent whiteness. The spray smashed down, scattering debris across the waves and obscuring what remained of the ship. He scanned the wreckage, trying to piece together what had just happened, when the radio crackled again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CClean release and tracking. Weapon impacted amidships.\u0022 Neilbin thought he heard the pilot\u0027s voice shake. \u201CHull is gone, repeat gone. Nothing left on the surface but flotsam and precious little of that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolemnly, he lowered his binoculars and looked soberly at Gusden. \u201CA successful test I\u0027d say, Commander. I presume it was a realistic one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden shook his head. \u201CNot really - in fact we went out of our way to make it as unrealistic as possible. Extra reinforcement on the hull, fuel tanks drained so that they couldn\u0027t contribute to the blast. It was a stationary target of course but we don\u0027t have any way of steering it remotely and I\u0027m not in the habit of shooting live ordnance at my own troops. Besides the manoeuvrability tests were mostly successful, once we\u0027d worked the kinks out of the guidance system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeilbin raised his eyebrows. \u201CGo on?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo his surprise, Gusden grinned. \u201CA \u003Cem\u003EWavedancer\u003C/em\u003E class racing dinghy makes a fine test target. We did trials with diesel motors to begin with, then electrics. Doesn\u0027t make a lot of difference actually, the acoustic sensors can pick up propeller noise almost as well as engine. We\u0027re still working on sailboats but between you and me, I think that\u0027s just the research team showing off. I can\u0027t think of anything wind powered that could out-run or out-manoeuvre a Mark II fingrillin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeilbin blinked. \u0022One with a dummy warhead I presume?\u0022 he said dryly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course,\u0022 said Gusden, affronted. \u0022Dye cannister with a - very small - explosive charge to rupture it.\u0022 He grinned again. \u0022The pilots set up a leaderboard at one point; seeing how long they could last before getting a faceful of dye turned into quite a competition.\u0022 He caught Neilbin\u0027s expression. \u0022And yes - safety goggles \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E mandatory for all test runs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go on then,\u0022 said Neilbin neutrally, \u0022Who was your paint-torpedo racing champion?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027ll get to meet her in a few minutes,\u0022 said Gusden, pointing over Neilbin\u0027s shoulder. \u0022She\u0027s just coming in to land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the two kerbals reached the airstrip, the small single-seater spotter plane was parked neatly by its hangar, wheels chocked and jet engine powered down.

Even if they were, I wouldn\u0027t take large bets on being able to \u003Cem\u003Ehit\u003C/em\u003E that site reliably.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked at him wearily. \u201CI know, I know. And Gene\u0027s right too - stagin\u0027\u00A0anything that close to the M\u00FCn is just adding\u00A0its own lot of problems to a busy checklist. I\u0027d just feel a lot happier if we weren\u0027t resting the \u003Cem\u003EMunar landing\u003C/em\u003E on a design that we borrowed from an old lawn sprinkler.\u0022 He glanced at the engine indicators. \u201CIt wasn\u0027t even the latest model sprinkler for Kerm\u0027s sake!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s mouth twitched. \u201CIt doesn\u0027t sound very promising when you put it like that,\u0022 he conceded, \u201Cand I certainly wouldn\u0027t want to build anything bigger than the 909 around a conical impingement injector.\u0022 He gestured at the roaring test stand behind its blast shields and shrugged.\u00A0\u201CBut it does work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo far,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie. There was a long silence. \u201COK, coming up to pitch-over. Throttling down in three...two...one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine noise dropped to merely very loud, rather than deafening. Wernher stayed tactfully silent as he watched his deputy\u0027s hands reaching for non-existent switches and buttons, unfocused eyes staring past the test stand at a private vista.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAuto-one holding, good radar return, delta-H nominal,\u0022\u00A0Ornie murmured to himself. He shook his head, deliberately resting his hands on the edge of the console with a small, embarrassed grin. \u201CSorry, boss - kilometres away.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNearly four hundred thousand kilometres I make it,\u0022 Wernher said gently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbout that,\u0022 said Ornie. He reached for the engine controls. \u201CReady for the abort to orbit test?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded. Ornie threw a switch. \u201CThrottle to manual...\u0022 He jammed a lever forward and the engine responded with a willing bellow. Wernher watched the simulated propellant level readouts drop to zero and right on cue, the engine coughed and fell silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAscent engine armed...abort stage...ignition.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher raised his eyebrows at Ornie\u0027s astonished look. Ornie opened his mouth to speak, thought better of it and then burst out laughing. \u201CI tell you what, boss - let\u0027s scrounge some simulator time once the Booth Crew have \u0027em set up properly - and get this piloting stuff out of \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E our systems.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBetter not get it too far out in case you end up being picked,\u0022\u00A0said Wernher checking his watch. \u201CSpeaking of which, Jeb should have found that wastepaper basket by now. And I don\u0027t care whether you\u0027re picked or not - I\u0027m still going to want a hand stripping down that engine afterwards.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E-----------------\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb unfolded the piece of paper and looked up at the assembled - and impatiently waiting - Kerbin Interplanetary Society.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll do this the traditional way round,\u0022 he announced. \u0022The bad news is that Genie\u0027s just lost one of his best Guidance controllers for Pioneer 2. The good news is that she\u0027s gonna be right up there, running the guidance systems in person. Congratulations, Neling!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney glanced at Bob. A flicker of disappointment crossed the other kerbal\u0027s features, as he watched Jeb dip his hand into the drift of paper slips at the bottom of his wastepaper basket and drew out two neatly folded squares.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The first crewmember for Pioneer 3 is...Seanan. And for Pioneer 4, I give you...Malmy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeanan blinked shyly at the rest of the capsule and life support team. \u0022Guess somebody else is going to be doing the evaporator redesign,\u0022 he murmured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood timing there, Malm!\u0022\u00A0Ornie called out. \u201CWe\u0027ve got your descent engine all shined up for you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned. \u201CWe\u0027re gonna need more of those lawn sprinklers.\u0022 he said cheerfully. \u201CGene and I have been talking with Ademone and it seems that Rockomax are in for a couple more flights than we thought!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob sucked his breath in sharply. Geneney crossed his fingers silently behind his back. The babble of excited voices rose to a clamour as Jeb lifted his hands for silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo if you lot\u0027ll let me get a word in edgeways, we\u0027ve got another three kerbonauts to pick!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clamour subsided to a buzzing anticipation as Jeb\u0027s hand dropped towards the basket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe first crewmember for Pioneer 5 is...Lucan! And for Pioneer 6 it\u0027s gonna be...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb unfolded the small square of paper and smiled. Geneney saw his friend relax minutely and uncrossed his fingers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBob.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe warehouse exploded. Bill grabbed the younger kerbal round the waist and hugged him, much to Bob\u0027s astonishment and the astonishment of everyone else around them. The jostling, raucous crowd of well-wishers parted to let Geneney, Wernher and Lucan through. Jeb clenched his fist exultantly under the table. Beaming, he lifted the basket high over his head and rattled it for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd last - but hopefully not for long - the first crewmember for Pioneer 7 is...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s eyes narrowed fractionally. \u003Cem\u003EWhat in the...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E He glanced up and saw Geneney staring steadily back at him. \u003Cem\u003EOh.\u003C/em\u003E He dipped his head respectfully and cleared his throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201Cis Bill! We\u0027ll have a bottle of \u002778 citrus waiting for you when you get back, old friend!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gathered up the remaining paper slips and stacked them on the table in front of him. The clamour of enthusiastic voices died away, replaced by a steady ripping of paper as he methodically tore a sheet of paper into twelve pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike Gene said right at the start,\u0022he said quietly, \u201Cwe we need experience for these flights so we\u0027re picking commanders from all the kerbonauts who have already flown.\u0022 Jeb gathered the ragged slips of paper together and laid them down in a second, much smaller stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwelve slips for twelve pilots,\u0022 he said. \u201CYou all know who you are, \u003Cem\u003Ewe \u003C/em\u003Eall know who you are and I\u0027m betting that I could walk out of here, speak to any two kerbals on Barkton high street and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E would know who you are.\u0022 Jeb paused. \u201CSo none of you have anything to prove. You, more than anyone, know the risks and if you decide that the M\u00FCn is a risk too far - well I for one wouldn\u0027t blame you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb pointed at the smaller stack of paper on the table. \u201CSo I\u0027m gonna ask you all to get in line and sign one of those. If anyone doesn\u0027t want to go, all they need to do is write \u0022no\u0022\u00A0on their paper. Once we\u0027re done, I\u0027m gonna burn all the slips so that nobody - me included - will ever know if you chose not to go or if you were just unlucky.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb dropped his name into the basket and joined the rest of the crowd. Everyone watched solemnly as, one by one, eleven kerbonauts approached the table, wrote something on one of the slips and dropped it into Jeb\u0027s basket. Finally, it was Wilford\u0027s turn. He thought for a moment, nodded resolutely and wrote a single, short word on his paper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you everybody.\u0022 Jeb shook the basket vigorously, closed his eyes and pulled out the first slip. His eyebrows rose as he read it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDon\u0027t remember signing my name in block capitals. Whoever wrote this - I appreciate the sentiment but...\u0022 Jeb drew another name from the basket and his eyebrows climbed past his hairline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COhhh-kay. Looks like we\u0027ve got a sudden outbreak of Jebs on our hands. He cleared his throat. \u201CThis is...generous of everyone but I\u0027m just gonna keep drawing these till I find a real name.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWilford glanced surreptitiously at his fellow pilots. Ornie\u0027s shoulders were shaking, Ribory had her hand over her mouth and the rest were unsuccessfully to keep a straight face. He raised his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUh, boss. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to find anything \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E Jebs in there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie\u0027s guffaw startled a pair of roosting swifts from the upper reaches of the warehouse roof. He cuffed Richlin on the shoulder. \u201CYou too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin\u0027s face cracked into a broad grin. \u201CYup. You, me and everyone else by the looks of it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStubbornly, amidst mounting laughter, Jeb pulled one slip of paper after another out of the basket. For a long minute he stared at twelve copies of his name in twelve different scripts, before lifting his head to face the eleven kerbonauts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t get it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher sighed. \u201CFor a smart kerbal you can be amazingly dense at times, Jeb,\u0022 he said. He gave the kerbonauts a lopsided grin. \u201COK folks - if you think we\u0027re building three M\u00FCn rockets for this dunce to fly, I suggest you think again. Which flight did you want to send him on?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can\u0027t speak for the rest of \u0027em,\u0022 said Ornie, \u201Cbut Pioneer 4 was the one I had in mind.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin and Wilford nodded vigorously. The other kerbonauts murmured their assent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher looked slightly taken aback. \u201CPioneer \u003Cem\u003E4\u003C/em\u003E. The first...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLanding attempt?\u0022 Ornie interrupted. \u201CYep - sounds about right.\u0022He turned to face a flabbergasted Jeb. \u201CClose your mouth, son, or you\u0027ll be catchin\u0027 flies as my mother used to say. You see boss, everyone builds \u0027em and everyone flies \u0027em is a fine system - couldn\u0027t ask for a better one if y\u0027askin me - but there\u0027s one thing you\u0027re forgetting. Someone had to \u003Cem\u003Estart\u003C/em\u003E building them before \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E could fly \u0027em.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked Jeb squarely in the eye.\u0022I\u0027m remembering me and Richlin sharing a beer with six crazy characters who\u0027d just finished sinking most everything they had in the world into their first halfway proper rocket.\u0022\u00A0Ornie jabbed a thumb over his shoulder at Bill, Bob and Lucan. \u201CAnd I\u0027m mighty glad to see them finally getting their chance to fly a real one! But even back then one especially crazy character was jabbering on about landing on the M\u00FCn - seems only right that he should get the first chance to do just that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s jaw hung open. \u201CI...I don\u0027t know what to say,\u0022 he mumbled hoarsely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd that\u0027s another first right there,\u0022 added Geneney, rolling his eyes. \u0022More likely you\u0027re just gonna be flying another lander around Kerbin for a week, Jeb. If you ask really, really nicely, I might trust you to dock it too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb summoned up a feeble grin. \u0022Suits me, Gene.\u0022 The grin faded, replaced by a familiar determined expression. \u0022But if I do get the chance, I won\u0027t let you down. Anyway - enough of me - we\u0027ve got another two commanders to pick!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E-----------------\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lingering smell of charred paper followed the rest of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society out of the warehouse door. Jeb stared at the guttering flames in the bottom of his wastepaper basket, rolling a tiny, tightly wound tube of paper between his fingers. \u003Cem\u003EGood decision, Gene - nobody\u0027s gonna be concentrating on precision work after all that. Afternoon on the beach is the best plan.\u003C/em\u003E He sighed, unrolled the tube and read it again:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob \u0026gt; Lucan \u0026gt; Bill \u0026gt; Geneney\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECalzer and Neling, Ribory and Bob. Couldn\u0027t ask for better Munar crews if we\u0027d picked them by hand, old friend. Not to mention Malmy. But if we do find a way to launch another set of Pioneers, you\u0027ll get to fly one of them - I promise you that.\u003C/em\u003E Jeb touched the curl of paper to the fire and watched silently as it burned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E-----------------\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well they did say we couldn\u0027t miss it,\u0022 Tommal commented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel watched the oversized signboard roll past. \u0022No,\u0022 she agreed. \u0022Big enough to make the marketing team blush. Except maybe for Hadcott - I don\u0027t think that kerbal has any shame. Relax, Tom - this road looks too new to have any lumps or bumps in it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal\u0027s eyes flicked back and forth to the road surface. \u201CProbably,\u0022 he agreed, \u0022but after driving all this way I\u0027d be grumpy if we broke anything with only three kilometres to go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWith the amount of padding James wrapped them in?\u0022 said Sherfel. \u201CWe could have dropped them in by parachute and they\u0027d have been fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal shrugged. \u201CEven so. Hey - that\u0027s more like it!\u0022 He pointed through the windscreen. \u201CWill you look at the size of that thing!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel stared at the giant radio telescope on the hillside, before lowering her gaze to the main administration building surrounded by its carefully maintained grounds and clusters of outbuildings. Antennas twinkled in the sunlight and as they drove closer she could make out dozens of kerbals bustling from building to building. They pulled up at a set of bollards that blocked their way and Tommal wound down the window to confer with a serious looking kerbal in a gleaming white booth. The smell of fresh paint drifted through the open window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood afternoon. Tommal Kerman from the Rockomax Corporation - we were told you\u0027d be expecting us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe security guard consulted a clipboard.\u201CSpecial delivery for Probodyne?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal nodded. \u201CThat\u0027s right.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCarry on past the main car park, sir. Probodyne is the second unit on the left - you won\u0027t miss it.\u0022The guard thumbed a button on the booth wall and the bollards sank smoothly into the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you.\u0022\u00A0Tommal wound up his window and cautiously drove forward over their steel rimmed sockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI think we could have found our way here without any help \u003C/em\u003E Sherfel thought to herself. The Probodyne buildings had quite obviously been built to the same design as the other outbuildings - and it was equally obvious that Probodyne had outgrown them some time ago. A row of large temporary cabins surrounded the largest building on two sides, each with a bundle of cables snaking out of one wall. The cables plugged into yellow and black striped .junction boxes, ruler-straight lines of earth marking the buried cables that linked them to the central building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA huge steel scaffold stood between two of the smaller buildings. Fully ten metres high and twice as long, it towered over a surreal concrete sculpture of plateaus, steps and angled ramps. Spindly frameworks of different designs, adorned with varying numbers of articulated legs, hung underneath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal\u0027s eyes lit up. \u0022There it is! Or the engineering model anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA giant four-legged metal beetle squatted on a bed of sand and gravel in front of the scaffold. Antennas and clusters of sensors protruded from its matt grey carapace and a long jointed proboscis sniffed at the ground in front of it. The yellow-hatted kerbal standing next to it hurried over to greet them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi - I\u0027m Sidbo! You must be from Rockomax? Come on in and meet the team!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommal and Sherfel followed the enthusiastically chattering Sidbo towards the main building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We thought we\u0027d be trying the Hope probes out at Duna first but the transfer windows didn\u0027t work so we built them for a Laythe mission instead. Nothing like aiming high, right? The flight profile isn\u0027t what we\u0027d hoped for either - not enough delta-V for the perturbation at Jool \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E orbital insertion at Laythe - not with an off-the-shelf launcher. Which is why we needed you to make a thicker heatshield for the aeroshell because this baby will be coming in \u003Cem\u003Ehot\u003C/em\u003E! Shame about the orbiter but we should still get some good data on the fly-by. Anyway, here we are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo kerbals were waiting for them in the foyer. Cartoon bedecked partition walls divided the sides of the room into open cubicles stuffed with computer screens, electronic test stands and other equipment that Sherfel couldn\u0027t begin to recognise. The central space was strewn with sack chairs and low tables, each overflowing with catalogues, scientific journals and other technical publications. Framed papers from various journals decorated the far wall, including a poster sized article from \u003Cem\u003EAstronomical Proceedings\u003C/em\u003E. Sherfel\u0027s eyebrows rose as she read the title:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Composition and dynamics of the \u003Cem\u003EMinmusian\u003C/em\u003E atmosphere?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Preliminary dynamics naturally,\u0022 said the taller of the two kerbals, \u0022although from the spectroscopy data, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d venture to suggest that the composition is a settled question.\u0022 He rubbed his hands together, \u0022We\u0027re rather hoping to write a follow up on the Laythian atmosphere in a year or so, if all my clever colleagues manage to butter up their computers the right way! I\u0027m Dunney by the way and this is Jernie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel smiled. \u0022I know, Professor. It\u0027s a privilege to meet you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney waved his hand. \u0022Did you all hear that? A privilege no less and this from a M\u00FCn voyaging kerbonaut! Our good friends at Rockomax must be going up in the world if they can afford to employ couriers such as these.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSherfel laughed. \u0022We were heading to Barkton in any case, Professor - it was the least we could do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s Dunney if you please - and they\u0027re surely not sending you to the M\u00FCn again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, it\u0027s Tom\u0027s turn this time,\u0022 Sherfel answered, gesturing at her colleague. \u201CI\u0027m just sneaking in a visit to a couple of friends before helping out with the simulations.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pioneer 2 is only going to Kerbin orbit anyway,\u0022 said Tommas, \u0022Flight testing the Munar lander, squeezing any problems out of the vehicle assembly sequence, that kind of thing.\u0022 He turned to a wide eyed Sidbo and smiled. =\u201CWe\u0027re not the ones going to Jool and Duna.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022An excellent point, \u0022 said Dunney. \u0022Why don\u0027t we go and unload the heat shields that our distinguished guests have so kindly brought us and then we can do the guided tour if they have time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can make time,\u0022 said Tommas, \u0022I don\u0027t know about Sherfel but I\u0027m itching to get a closer look at that Laythe lander you\u0027ve got outside!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Geneney! Jeb!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb spun on his heel to see a pair of smartly dressed kerbals crossing the road behind him. He frowned. \u0022Nelton? \u003Cem\u003EAdemone\u003C/em\u003E? What on Kerbin are you doing here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone raised her eyebrows. \u0022It\u0027s good to see you too, Jeb. Hello, Geneney - has the good Director summoned you too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Summoned is a good word for it,\u0022 said Geneney equably. \u0022I don\u0027t suppose you have any idea what this is all about?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone shook her head. \u0022No. Although it\u0027s obviously more significant than we thought if yourself and Jebediah are here as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton\u0027s scowl matched Jeb\u0027s. \u0022It had better be,\u0022 she said. \u0022There are many, many things I could usefully be doing right now and almost none of them involve sitting in a meeting room.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney held the door open for everyone. \u0022It would have been nice to say hello to Sherf and Tommal before we left, \u0022 he agreed. \u0022Do you think they\u0027ve invited anybody else?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just the four of you, Geneney.\u0022 Lodan stepped forward, hand extended in greeting. \u0022If you could come this way please - we have a lot to discuss and I don\u0027t intend to take up more of your valuable time than I can help.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked around approvingly at the plainly painted corridor and minimalist, institutional green carpet tiles. Briskly, Lodan led them up an echoing, white stairwell, along another, equally austere, section of corridor and stopped outside his office door. Geneney squinted at the small, brass nameplate fixed to one corner, catching a glimpse of neat black lettering before being ushered inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe welcoming aromas of fresh coffee and hot snacks greeted them. Geneney sniffed appreciatively. \u0022Doreni Blue, Director?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan looked at him in surprise. \u0022Indeed. I have lemon, anise or bru...\u0022 He saw the hastily masked expression on Geneney\u0027s face. \u0022Ahh. Black, I presume?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded and poured himself a cup. \u0022Mountain spring water shouldn\u0027t need lemon to make it drinkable,\u0022 he said, \u0022and I wouldn\u0027t dare sully your Doreni porcelain anyway.\u0022 He closed his eyes and raised the cup to his mouth, inhaling the bitter, slightly spicy steam before taking a tiny sip and blissfully rolling the hot black liquid around his mouth. His eyes snapped open to find Jeb, Nelton and Ademone staring at him dumbfounded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSuperb. If you go anywhere \u003Cem\u003Enear\u003C/em\u003E this with the anise, Jeb, you\u0027re walking home. It\u0027d be like drinking one of Jorfurt\u0027s brews with ice.\u0022 Geneney looked at Lodan, who was looking slightly taken aback. \u201CHow on Kerbin did you move the cups without disturbing the glaze?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan smiled faintly. \u201CBoiled raf husk,\u0022 he said, \u201CThe only thing I could find that was soft, odourless and resilient enough. Even then, I didn\u00C3\u0027t risk transporting them until the road was finished - but perhaps we should discuss this later.\u0022 He gestured at the chairs set around the fireplace. \u201CI propose a working lunch. Please help yourselves to refreshment and we\u0027ll make a start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan waited until everybody had filled their plates before tapping the table for attention. \u201CI\u0027ll get straight to the point,\u0022 he said. \u201CUnder Special Order 41 of the Council of Twelve Pillars, the Kerbin Space Agency will be tasked with overseeing a far-reaching expansion of all spaceflight activities. Under Special Order 42, the Director of the Kerbin Space Agency has been granted requisition powers on any necessary resources or personnel to enable that expansion.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was silence as everyone absorbed Lodan\u0027s matter-of-fact announcement. Then Ademone saw Jeb\u0027s face darken and hastily stepped in. \u201CTwo Special Orders together is...unusual,\u0022 she said carefully. Beside her, Geneney nodded agreement. \u201CIn fact,\u0022 she continued, \u201CI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ve ever heard of such a thing before. Would you care to explain, Director?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcross the table, Nelton winced but Lodan was either oblivious to Ademone\u0027s tone of voice or choosing to ignore it. \u201CCertainly. I trust you will all remember the Capital News bulletin the evening before the Pioneer 1 launch?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour heads nodded slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNothing about that story was remotely new. In fact - for reasons I\u0027ll come on to - the link between Kerm and Blight had been known for some time...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy understanding is that the Council are still debating the necessity for Part 3 and that a significant minority is still hoping for a result from the Berelgan. But if we are ordered to go ahead, then we\u0027ll have whatever resources and funding we need. Which is cold comfort since we will \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have anything like the time we need. Nevertheless, as failure will manifestly not be an option either, we will all do what we must.\u0022 Lodan rolled up his maps and nodded politely at Ademone. =\u201CDoes that answer your question?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook his head in disbelief. \u201CWell thank the Kerm for Ambassador Jerfun! Or were the great-and-wise Council actually planning to tell the rest of us mere kerbals about any of this?\u0022 He glanced at Geneney. \u201CBetter check the fine print on this one, Gene, because I\u0027m betting that\u0027s gonna stink too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe Council,\u0022 Lodan said evenly, \u201Cwere planning to do exactly the right thing. Evaluate the evidence, make a plan and implement it. All that... idiot Ambassador has managed to achieve is to stir up a global panic and make everyone\u0027s job far harder than it needed to be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd what a wonderful idea that turned out to be!\u0022 retorted Jeb, \u201CEven if the Council had managed to keep everything quiet until they had a plan - which was never going to happen - did they seriously expect everyone to meekly follow their plan and \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E to panic?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan\u0027s eyelid twitched. \u0022Of course not,\u0022 he said, \u201Conly the rational majority. And better that than an irrational, \u003Cem\u003Euninformed\u003C/em\u003E majority clamouring for answers that nobody could give!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd still can\u0027t!\u0022 said Jeb, \u201CI don\u0027t suppose it occurred to anyone to ask the \u0027uninformed majority\u0027 or their ideas?\u0022 He snorted.\u00A0\u201COf course not. So all that patronising prevarication has got us exactly nowhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With respect,\u0022 said Lodan tightly, \u201Cthe Council has sought opinion from all over Kerbin. The foremost experts on Kerm...\u0022 The expression on Jeb\u0027s face brought him up short.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExperts,\u0022 said Jeb sardonically, \u201Cdon\u0027t cope well with challenges to their expertise.\u0022 He leaned forward. \u201CThe Institute was so stuffed full of experts that it could barely move. Exactly one of them had the vision to see past the inside of his own head - and he\u0027s just flown back from the M\u00FCn in a spacecraft that he designed and built himself!\u0022 Jeb jabbed a finger at Lodan. \u201CGo ask the \u0022experts\u0022about your precious Part 3 - I guarantee that none of them will give you answer worth half a...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why there\u0027s a conspicuous lack of Institute staff here today,\u0022 snapped Lodan. \u201CIn case you hadn\u0027t noticed!\u0022 He leaned forward and knocked Jeb\u00C3\u0027s finger to one side. \u201CSo why don\u0027t you sit down, shut up and saw that chip off your shoulder before it tips you over!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what do you think, Ademone?\u0022 asked Geneney quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone shrugged. \u201CPart 1 is a stop-gap and Part 3 is desperation. I think we\u0027d better hope for some answers from the Berelgan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney nodded. \u201CLikewise. But if they don\u0027t - or can\u0027t - find them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen Part 3 will be the least worst option,\u0022 said Ademone heavily. \u201CAlthough I\u0027m not convinced that the Council knows quite what it\u0027s asking for.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb and Lodan scowled at each other before pointedly sitting back in their seats and turning to face the others. Geneney reached for a \u003Cem\u003Edjan\u003C/em\u003E and crunched it thoughtfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about those requisition powers?\u0022 he said at last \u0022Will your Board go for that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA Special Order wouldn\u0027t give them much choice,\u0022 Ademone pointed out, \u201CBut they would certainly question the need for such a drastic measure when a perfectly ordinary subcontract might have the same effect.\u0022\u00A0She looked at Lodan. \u201CIs there any particular reason why the KSA feels the need to have quite that level of oversight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan gripped the edge of the table. \u201CBecause,\u0022 he said, \u201CPart 3 is too big for the KSA to risk having its subcontractors indulge in such pointlessly dangerous stunts as \u003Cem\u003Esending prototype crewed spacecraft around the M\u00FCn.\u003C/em\u003E I had hoped that Rockomax could temper that kind of foolishness from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E but apparently not.\u0022 Lodan glared at Ademone. \u201CFor Kerm\u0027s sake - what were you thinking?! Strand those kerbonauts around the M\u00FCn and all the public enthusiasm for your space program would have vanished like Spierkan mist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shot Jeb a warning look. \u0022We didn\u0027t though, did we. Strand them I mean. And thanks to KBS News, our public support is running at an all time high.\u0022 He spread his hands. \u0022It was a calculated risk, Director but one that all three kerbonauts and \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E mission control teams were willing to take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Small risks too, compared to anything we\u0027ll need to take for Part 3,\u0022 said Nelton soberly. \u0022Real-time flight control teams will work for Munar missions and Minmus missions but for anything further afield, the crew will effectively be on their own for most of the flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan absorbed her words unblinkingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For now,\u0022 added Geneney, \u0022we have a sequence of test flights planned intended to minimise the risks of the eventual Munar landing.\u0022 He ticked off the flights on his fingers. \u0022Pioneer 2 - Kerbin orbit test of the complete Pioneer spacecraft, lander included. Pioneer 3 - full flight test up to Munar descent orbit including emergency abort options. If - and only if - we complete our test objectives for \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E flights, then we make the first landing attempt with Pioneer 4.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And which lucky kerbonaut gets to fly that,\u0022 muttered Lodan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jondun, Malmy and Jeb,\u0022 answered Geneney. He held up a finger. \u0022And before we go any further, Director, you should know that the eleven other candidates for the commander\u0027s seat all independently voted to give the flight to Jeb. You might want to think about that for a moment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jondun is one of our most experienced test pilots, \u0022 said Ademone quietly, \u0022and my Head of Propulsion has been very impressed with Malmy throughout the lander development program.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We know the risks, Director,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022so let \u003Cem\u003Eus\u003C/em\u003E take them for you. If our Munar program is successful then you can present Part 3 as not only feasible but \u003Cem\u003Einevitable.\u003C/em\u003E And if we fail then the KSA stays clear of any public backlash. Frankly, Director, the very last thing I would do right now is exercise Special Order 42.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan looked at him thoughtfully. \u0022I\u0027m waiting for the other M\u00FCn boot to drop, Geneney. What does the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E expect to get in return?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Independence,\u0022 said Geneney frankly. \u0022All or nothing, Director. If the KSA is going to requisition us, it requisitions us the way we are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And keeps the meddling government out of Jebediah\u0027s hair,\u0022 said Lodan dryly. \u0022Even if they are bankrolling his dreams.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Exactly,\u0022 said Geneney unperturbed, \u0022We get to dream and the KSA gets half of their crewed spaceflight division at a stroke. If I could make a bold suggestion, Director, I would also venture that Rockomax\u0027s crewed program, would make an eminently sensible and highly complementary second half, under a similar arrangement.\u0022 He smiled. \u0022Much as it would pain Wernher to admit it, Rockomax are the premier space engineering company on Kerbin at this time, particularly for heavy lift. They have the experience, the facilities and the organisational structures already in place...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So why fix what isn\u0027t broken,\u0022 interrupted Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan favoured him with a wintry smile. \u0022Indeed. In which case, why do I also need the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because we\u0027re not broken either,\u0022 said Geneney, \u0022And we work well with Rockomax. On our own we managed to compete with them - we launched a satellite and Rockomax launched a bigger one. We launched a kerbal into space, Rockomax launched two at once. Rockomax sent a probe to the M\u00FCn but we put one into Munar orbit. And so on.\u0022 Geneney paused. \u201CBut working together we sent \u003Cem\u003Ekerbals\u003C/em\u003E to the \u003Cem\u003EM\u00FCn.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And much as it pains \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E to admit it,\u0022 said Ademone, \u0022I think the KSA would be... ill advised to break up a media friendly team of volunteers with such an obvious track record. Even if they also managed to turn one of our best kerbonauts into a drilling fool.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton grinned at Geneney and Jeb\u0027s suddenly bewildered expressions. \u0022The heat shields for Hope 1 and Hope 2,\u0022 she told Lodan. \u0022For various reasons the fabrication team was short staffed, so James volunteered to help. Made a fine job of them too but got a reputation for being happiest when he was drilling out defective cells.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney laughed. \u0022I\u0027ll be sure to let Ribory know,\u0022 he said, \u0022She\u0027ll be delighted to hear it.\u0022 He turned to a stony-faced Lodan. \u201CWe all build them - we all fly them. It\u0027s our motto, Director and it\u0027s also the literal truth. When Sherfel and James were training for the Pioneer 1 flight, they had the good grace to go along with it. Sherfel ended up coordinating our multi-site training simulations, James ended up building sizeable pieces of the heat shields for Pioneer 2.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sipped his coffee. \u201CEvery single one of our kerbonauts - and every single member of their flight control teams, myself and Jeb included - had a part to play in building and designing their spacecraft. More importantly, they had a part to play in building their colleagues\u0027 and more often than not, their \u003Cem\u003Efriends\u0027\u003C/em\u003E spacecraft.

The Kerbal 1 and 2 and the Kerbin 1 and 2, okay, I can sorta see those being done by a group of enthusiasts using lots of volunteer labour, free parts from the junkyard, and probably a pretty hefty portion of Jeb\u0027s personal income. But the later stuff? The Mohos? Just building the command bunker would be, conservatively, in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sure, lots of volunteers to keep costs down, and probably some public donations - but it\u0027s really straining suspension of disbelief that they could keep going like that without some sort of public support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERokomax, on the other hand, could do what they were doing, if you make some hefty assumptions about how large a corporation they are.

The first few launches, for publicity, would be reasonable, but they keep pouring money into it with \u003Cem\u003Enil\u003C/em\u003E prospect of a return on investment. Sure, they might be planning to sell satellite launch services in the future, once the space economy kicks in - but you don\u0027t show anything suggesting they are thinking about that. And even if they were, they\u0027ve gone pretty deep in the hole for a very long-term and uncertain return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, both parties are acting more like public projects, which have budgets, rather than private concerns, which need \u003Cem\u003Eincome\u003C/em\u003E.

I expect night soil is used as fertiliser but otherwise there\u0027s no real need for pesticides, herbicides or artificial fertilisers. So quantity of food is not a problem and much of the environmental degradation associated with intensive agriculture is avoided too, so clean water isn\u0027t so much of an issue either. I\u0027ve also tried to paint the kerbals as being pretty environmentally aware (again because of their history with the Kerm), so kerbal overpopulation is at least implied to be a non-issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESocial mobility between kerman and kermol is high, not least because all kerbals necessarily go kermol for a short time if they wish to reproduce and (as touched on in \u0027Echoes of Time\u0027) relationships between the two castes are cordial, which makes food distribution quite fair and efficient. So any individual kerbal will normally have easy access to the basics of civilised life - food, water, shelter, the company of other kerbals - and any kerman who\u0027s seriously down on his or her luck can go kermol without fear of stigma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Kerbin is a nice place to live but it\u0027s also far from perfect. The various Regionalities are at peace but operate on a \u0027trust but cut the cards\u0027 level. I recall mentioning in one chapter that the Doreni in particular had something of a political reputation. The kerbal government (as mentioned on a number of occasions) is seen as slow and bureaucratic, which leads to frustrations and ill-advised courses of action arising from those frustrations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything other than the basics needs to be paid for of course and so the kerbals do have companies, corporations and a market economy. However the social safety net provided by the Kerm tends to moderate the gross excesses of a market economy. At the end of the day, kerbals choose to work to buy nice things - they don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to work to put bread on the table. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they have a lot more free time to volunteer for \u0027rule of cool\u0027 projects such as a junkyard space program. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also means that any kerbal captains of industry who consistently pay themselves a large and undeserved bonus are likely to come in the next morning and find that half of their workforce have gone kermol overnight. As a result, the kerbal economy includes a much higher percentage of non-profits and partnerships than the human economy - if a company is paying it\u0027s bills and paying its employees it\u0027s seen as doing well. If it\u0027s making a modest profit on top of that, it\u0027s doing very well. And remember that good pay for a kerbal can be relatively low since it doesn\u0027t have to be a \u003Cem\u003Eliving\u003C/em\u003E wage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENet result, wage costs on Kerbin are a lot lower and so the cost of doing business on Kerbin is also lot lower. Combine that with modest profit expectations (and relatively restrained shareholder expectations (if such exist) ) and kerbal companies can be much more a vehicle for organising large numbers of kerbals to do something amazing rather than a vehicle for making vast amounts of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, the KIS and Rockomax will need funding as you point out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockomax funding largely comes from their satellite business, where they have government and corporate customers. I tried to imply this with references to new communication satellites and during the CORDS negotiations, Ademone revealed that they\u0027d received a government contract to launch a Melvey Belt mapping probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS funding is more precarious and comes from a grab bag of sponsorship deals, Space Centre rents (it makes for an extremely prestigious conference centre, especially if the KIS can provide a couple of tame kerbonauts for your event), entry fees on launch days, commercial rents on launch days, sundry other enterprises such as their spaceflight museum, and private donations. They do also enjoy a high level of public support (which helps to generate those private donations), the kerbals in general have sustained a much higher interest in their space program than humans managed to - witness the kermol village gathering around its TV set to see the first images of the Mun, and all the KIS pennants etc. on display when James and Sherfel came to Barkton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL: DR - My version of Kerbin is probably more idealistic than realistic but I have tried to avoid making them too Space Elvish.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T08:02:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe actually thought this through.
