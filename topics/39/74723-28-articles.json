TP could just be converted BP, for exampe i have 1 planet that gives me 2BP per tick for the first 10 ticks, then say I go and capture another planet, this means I now get 4BP per tick, but I have to keep control of the planet so I convert 1 BP to TP, this means I have 2 planets under my control and 3BP total. Anyways, just a suggestion along the lines of planet developmnet (PS, I wrote this in my room which is at normal temperature but I have dodgy hands so they are numb, so my spelling is atrocious XD)\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason for having the markers is that it gives the defender a chance to respond and, allows him to utilise his fleet by not having to post a fleet at every planet, which is resource intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETicks, turns, they are all the same.

You will still earn more BP for controlling more Planets, but it curves off the BP per turn curve a bit and should help keep the two corps more in balance. Maybe even just a 1% overall penalty for every planet you control, but that builds up overtime.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"littlecmb","CreatedById":136122,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T16:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecan you add a mod that adds more planets otherwise it will be like attack 37 of lythe phoenix ninji war and more intrasting ground battle sorry for misspellings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrahmDude","CreatedById":112637,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T21:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022littlecmb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022littlecmb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecan you add a mod that adds more planets otherwise it will be like attack 37 of lythe phoenix ninja war and more interesting ground battle sorry for misspellings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand what you mean.
