Shortly thereafter, my laptop began to develop a heating problem. I ordered a Dell XPS 17 with a GeForce GT550M and an i7 quad-core @2.20GHz so I saw it coming, but tried to ignore the inevitable for almost 2 years. A week ago (at the time of writing this), I ordered and built my own desktop optimized for hardcore gaming. This marks an end to my heating problems as the desktop main fan actually outputs BELOW room temperature at low stress operation such as browsing the forums or watching youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith hardware no longer problematic, I asked myself what I wanted to do with it in the coming year. I wanted to do something wonderful, something that would bring people together and entertain them. Many ideas crossed my mind. Higher graphical fidelity meant that youtube content was a solid contender. Campus internet also is vastly superior to my home and it too was a solid contender. Then I thought about KSP, which I had not played since my heating problems began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith January coming up and the year ending, New Year\u0027s Resolutions have become a popular topic of conversation. I\u0027ve never once made one of significance but the thought stuck with me. I\u0027ve since made my first meaningful resolution in the form of a challenge. This challenge was to complete a mission or part of a mission in KSP at least once a day. I couldn\u0027t leave it there. Something like that cannot be kept to one\u0027s self. This needs to be shared and published for the enjoyment of all, and so here I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Challenge:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo execute, at minimum, a mission or a part of a mission each day for an entire year.

That explains the reasons behind but but the TL;DR is that I had my eyes opened and that K365 is, in the long term, detrimental to what I really am out to achieve here. This thread and the challenge is here to stay but I made the lock request on it so that people here to follow me know that I\u0027m moving on.

Ugh. Does it still count as a mission? I did it, but then lost connection to it. Also, I lost connection to SpaceStationOne, and I can\u0027t open the only docking port available on the station, a shielded docking port. Why, RemoteTech.. why. I have at least 30 long range antennas on the station, it\u0027s in perfect view of KSC, and I still can\u0027t control it. It has full power as well. The Korion MPCV is literally just orbiting 30 meters from it, waiting until I can open it. TAC Life Support is also in play, so I have to either dock them soon or bring them back down, otherwise they\u0027ll run out of supplies. Why is this so complicated..
