Maybe I\u0027ll support that new Kerbal Space Center. I guess I\u0027d better read up on this whole \u0022Rocketry\u0022 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog#2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got my little brother Bob to help me with the rocketry, cause he\u0027s kind of a nerd. He says rockets are just explosions that happen at the same rate constantly, so I just got some boom from the south and stuck it in a trash bin, and it went pretty well. I got the explosion part right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog#3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that famous rocket scientist Wernher Von Kerman did a lecture on rocketry, and I snuck in. Turns out it needs to happen slowly. I\u0027ve built a test stand out of assorted junk and a force gauge, and rolled the RT-2 Solid Fuel Rocket onto the stand. After ignition, the rocket fired steadily at 200 kilonewtons of thrust until T\u002B01:02, when the vehicle blew up, destroying the test stand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog#4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027m publishing these logs after this one. Maybe some other rocket scientists at the Kerbal Space Center can give me a little help. Anything guys?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog#4.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously guys I need some help with this rocket problem. Any tips would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog#5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it turns out I forgot to detach the rocket from the test stand. And guess what? RT-3 was a success! Well, kinda. Bill says perhaps adding some kind of heat radiator might help the rocket from exploding. Bob says the whole flipping the F out problem might be helped by adding wings. Those ideas could be added together to make a better rocket, because the wings could radiate heat away. RT-4 will have these additions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELog#6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT-4 and RT-5 launches are going to be supervised by the KSP. I hope this goes well. I\u0027ve hired by brothers Bill and Bob, and they will be sitting at launch control. The launch went off without a hitch, but the rocket fell back down right on top of the scaffolding that was used for building a Vehicle Assembly Building. Gene Kerman yelled at me, but not for the scaffolding problem. He said \u0022We don\u0027t want a puny little launch vehicle! We want a rocket that can help us build bigger launch vehicles! Get that rocket to work without wings!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I got Bob and Wernher to help me go back to the drawing board. The final determination has shown that the only way to recover the booster, have it not explode, and STILL have control was if the rocket was actually \u003Cem\u003Econtrolled\u003C/em\u003E. This meant we\u0027d need a control pod for a test pilot to sit in. Me, Bill, and Bob are all test pilots, so I\u0027ve volunteered to launch first. Kerlington Model Rockets have sent us a full-scale demonstration mock-up to place on the vehicle as a test weight. I\u0027ve also designed a series of O-Rings and inline radiators to keep the rocket from exploding. RT-6 will launch soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-02T13:17:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2014 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weegee","CreatedById":72084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T00:22:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*Jebediah \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking good so far, I like the origin story type fan-fictions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T00:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been spelling Jebediah wrong for over a year?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDataMiner","CreatedById":45648,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T00:25:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...that title seems oddly familiar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-02T00:32:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2014 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TheDataMiner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T00:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat? naah.
