So far I\u0027ve managed to bodge together an altimeter, as a proof of concept and to test my codebase.

I now have access to a 3d printer all the time, so as soon as I get this finalised I should be ready to print and do a test fit. With Christmas coming up I\u0027m hoping that I can get the motors required, so that will no longer be an issue as well. Finally, I have been looking into human interface devices in order to connect the final device to my pc - it seems excessive to have an ardunio doing something as simple as reading serial information and moving some motors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022V85eds3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V85eds3.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fdai12_300.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.space1.com/Artifacts/Apollo_Artifacts/FDAI/fdai12_300.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
