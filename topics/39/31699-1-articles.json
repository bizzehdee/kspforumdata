Their anatomy appears nearly indestructible, with joints and limbs able to flex at almost any angle. Their skeletal structure appears similar to a form of non-Newtonian fluid, as it can go limp when required and re-solidify into a sturdy structure afterwards, allowing Kerbals to survive great trauma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals appear capable of both ingestion of food and photosynthesis. When deprived of normal food, a Kerbal can use photosynthesis to survive, but they will suffer chronic fatigue and a temporary drop in IQ. When ingesting food normally, a Kerbal is capable of functioning quite effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso odd is their psychology. While many Kerbals who fly in space (Kerbonauts) appear absolutely terrified during a flight, there are several who will positively beam, even if their vessel is going through a phase of rapid unplanned disassembly. What causes this extreme polarization is unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir internal organs, like their skeletal structure, appear near-invincible. A Kerbal can survive an impact with a solid object at extreme velocity, and at least once there has been a report of a Kerbal surviving a fall from planetary orbit. Even more astonishing is that this Kerbal was actually able to walk and even speak coherently afterwards. To quote one of my lab assistants, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIs this a thing?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal technology is also odd. While their rockets and spacecraft appear very primitive and prone to unplanned disassembly and what is known as Chronic Booster Syndrome, their \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCTT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, or Consciousness Transfer Technology, allows them to move the aware mind of any Kerbal from it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s current body (normally dead, dying, or floating in space) and shift it into a clone. This means that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C(technically) the space program has never has any fatalities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECheeky buggers.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DJEN","CreatedById":61378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T10:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazing, indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"comicbstudeo","CreatedById":29256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T18:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBlashemy.
