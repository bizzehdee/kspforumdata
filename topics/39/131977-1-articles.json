The company has grown exponentially over the past 50 years; fully funding the nations air force, produces 5000 aircraft a year through factories all over the country, and arms at least 5 air forces across the globe with state of the art prop and newer gas-turbine powered pursuit, strike, bomber and trainer aircraft. They have also supplied numerous airlines with highly advanced, turbine\u00A0powered commercial airliners that have ferried passengers across the planet at heights and speeds never achieved before.\u00A0The company is a success story that has been felt all over the world.

The aircraft took off and went into a steep climb. However, an aerodynamic anomaly\u00A0occurred and the \u0027plane went into a flat spin. As it plummeted into the ground, the oil pipes in the cockpit tore from the G-level - a common problem with the aircraft. Newnand Kerman survived the initial crash, but soon perished as the oil tank which is located directly underneath the pilot\u0027s seat exploded. The aircraft was rebuilt, and is now on display at the same facility.
