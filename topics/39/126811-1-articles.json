For centuries, its lands\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere split up into many small city-states, where people lived a simple, if poor life.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, as technology progressed and kerbal leaders began noticing the vast tracts of\u003Cbr\u003E\nland owned by their neighbours, more and more cities began carving out empires for\u003Cbr\u003E\nthemselves. Eventually, the entire planet was dominated by empires.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis imperialistic worldview eventually led to a massive, planet-wide war. Tiny border\u003Cbr\u003E\nskirmishes snowballed into horrendous conflicts which left vast swaths of land\u003Cbr\u003E\nuninhabited. The global war culminated in a nuclear strike terrible enough to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncollectively awaken all to the futility of continuing the fighting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, for many, it was too late. Like shattered glass, the world\u2019s great empires\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrumbled. The only governments strong enough to pull together these broken realms\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere the United South Kolus Kerbals (USKK) and the Confederacy of Kolus and\u003Cbr\u003E\nFiresvar Nations (CFKN). The rest of the planet is made up of tiny, independent, poor\u003Cbr\u003E\ncity-states. These want nothing to do with either of the big nations, as they are\u003Cbr\u003E\ninherently distrustful of any large nations since the war.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe following map is a rough layout of the two empires, and their locations on Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe red dots indicate the positions of their rocket test sites, both of which will play a\u003Cbr\u003E\nmajor part in the upcoming story. (This game is called Kerbal Space Program, after all,\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot Kerbal World History Lesson)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nEach nation does not trust the other to keep Kerbin peaceful and free, so they have each\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuilt up arsenals of weapons to dissuade one another from trying anything. However,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis buildup of military forces has led to a \u2018cold war\u2019 of sorts (or as the students of\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin like to spell it, \u2018Kold War\u2019, much to the annoyance of teachers).\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince neither side wishes to enter full-scale open warfare against the other, each side\u003Cbr\u003E\ninstead relies on propaganda to ensure that the people remain faithful to their home\u003Cbr\u003E\ncountry. Misinformation is the name of the game, with each side believing that the other\u003Cbr\u003E\nis an evil dictatorship, bent on world conquest. Neither country allows their citizens to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncommunicate with the other nation, perpetrating this belief. However,\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately after the war, millions of kerbals were left without homes or places to go,\u003Cbr\u003E\nparticularly some very prominent scientists. Recognizing an opportunity, the USKK put\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto motion Operation Stapler, a plan to put those scientists to work for the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngovernment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd it is now, some years after the end of the war, that this plan bears fruit. The\u003Cbr\u003E\nvenerable Werhner von Kerman, a master of theoretical physics and rocket design, has\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiscovered a new dimension. He realizes it could change the entire course of history,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand rushes to share it with the world\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCHAPTER I:\u003Cbr\u003E\nFIRST STEPS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome back to the United News Network! Tonight\u2019s top story: Werhner Von Kerman, genius\u003Cbr\u003E\nscientist, has just discovered conclusive proof of a fourth dimension! This is only another\u003Cbr\u003E\nexample of our great nation\u2019s scientific advancements over the CKFN!\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoin us tonight, as we interview this genius for more details on his incredible discovery!\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd we\u2019re back, I\u2019m Erdan Kerman, interviewing the scientist Werhner von Kerman. So\u003Cbr\u003E\nWerhner, can you give us an overview of your discovery? Personally, I don\u2019t understand much\u003Cbr\u003E\nof this trans-dimensional travel and technologies mumbo-jumbo.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt is actually simpler zen you tink. Ve haf seen evidence of zis new dimension for quite some\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime, and it is only now zat ve have developed ze level of technology required to fully comprehend\u003Cbr\u003E\nits existence.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd what do you mean by that?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVell, ve\u2019ve learned zat passing an object into zis dimension results in ze object returning to its\u003Cbr\u003E\nstarting position immediately aftervards. A curious example, which has been noticed, but not\u003Cbr\u003E\nfully understood, throughout history. My discovery explains zis effect very vell.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI see. And you think that this new dimension could allow faster modes of communication and\u003Cbr\u003E\ntravel?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes. Travelling in zis fourth dimension will achieve velocities unimaginable to standard\u003Cbr\u003E\nvehicles. Ve have even begun researching ship designs vhich can explore it. Vhile much of ze\u003Cbr\u003E\nresearch is of course, classified, I can say zat the results have been very promising so far.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRemarkable! So how will this new dimension fit into our current three?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs you know, ve have had two space dimensions and a single time dimension before zis. Ze\u003Cbr\u003E\ndimension I discovered is another space dimension, and will join zhose two. I have consulted\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith my colleagues and come up with suitable directional names. Ze direction pointing towards\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin\u2019s core will be named \u2018down\u2019, and ze direction pointing away from Kerbin will be named\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2018up\u2019.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUp\u2026 It has a nice ring to it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CZank you, ve\u2019re very proud of it. It is zis direction which is the focus of much of our research\u003Cbr\u003E\ncurrently, and shows great promise!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd what say you to the rumours that the Mun exists in this new dimension, and that this\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiscovery will allow kerbals to reach it one day?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWerhner leaned closer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVell, I don\u2019t want to raise any false hopes in your audience, but I personally believe zat ze\u003Cbr\u003E\nchances are very good.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIncredible! Well, that\u2019s all of our time we have left folks. Thanks for joining us on the United\u003Cbr\u003E\nNews Network, I\u2019ve been your host, Erdan Kerman, and this has been Werhner von Kerman, a\u003Cbr\u003E\nshining example of the calibre of scientists the USKK has to offer!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe remote clicked, and the monitor turned off. General Geoffnard Kerman, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSupreme Commander of the CKFN military, spoke angrily.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is the television feed our spies intercepted from the USKK capital. A new\u003Cbr\u003E\ndimension? Are these more lies, boasting of their \u2018superior technological achievements\u2019?\u003Cbr\u003E\nOur electronic systems are ten times\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me sir, but while they may not have our level of electronic technology, their\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge in terms of nuclear power is unsurpassed,\u201D a small, bespectacled kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\ninterjected.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBilfrod. You\u2019re the official Scientific Advisor. Care to explain why your team hasn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\ncome up with a new dimension yet?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, before today, the Werhner Hypothesis was dismissed as ludicrous, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nexperimental evidence does show that surprisingly, he was completely correct. My\u003Cbr\u003E\nteam is investigating further.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas Kerman, the Communications and Economics Advisor (known as the\u003Cbr\u003E\nPropaganda Officer behind his back) spoke up. \u201CI have to ask, why was Werhner not\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecruited into your team, Bilfrod? He hails from one of the districts inside the\u003Cbr\u003E\nConfederacy.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nRather than the kerbal who the question was directed at, it was the General who\u003Cbr\u003E\nanswered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBecause the blasted USKK stole him, and every other notable scientist in the years\u003Cbr\u003E\nfollowing the War with their \u2018Operation Stapler\u2019. I can\u2019t believe the Special Forces\u003Cbr\u003E\ndivision at the time allowed such an act. If I was in charge back then, why\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s enough, Geoffnard,\u201D the tall kerbal at the head of the table finally spoke up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe General immediately stopped. \u201CYes sir, Mr. President!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe President of the CKFN continued. \u201CWhat happened twenty years ago is no concern\u003Cbr\u003E\nof ours. What does matter is the events occurring now. Without action on our part, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK could develop fourth-dimensional technology sufficient to break the uneasy\u003Cbr\u003E\ntruce we\u2019ve established over the past years. This could pose a serious threat to our\u003Cbr\u003E\nnation. Therefore, we need to build technology of our own, and surpass whatever\u003Cbr\u003E\nefforts the USKK may attempt. Besides, the people need a new cause to rally behind, or\u003Cbr\u003E\nso Bilcas tells me.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Propaganda Officer began nodding furiously. Pretending not to notice, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresident continued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBilfrod, has your team come up with anything?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell sir, as General Geoffnard continuously points out, the best scientists were all\u003Cbr\u003E\nsnapped up by the USKK at the end of the War. While we have produced a few\u003Cbr\u003E\nprodigies like myself (at this, there were several coughs from around the table) in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nintervening years, the fact remains that the cream of the crop remains in the USKK.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately, even back then, it was recognized that we should gather a team of our\u003Cbr\u003E\nown. So instead of going after the scientists, we focused on gathering the best engineers\u003Cbr\u003E\nand technical workers available at the time, and we\u2019ve continued recruiting from the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncity-states around us ever since. As such, we have available to us an unrivalled\u003Cbr\u003E\nmanufacturing and design capacity, which will enable us to build the best hardware\u003Cbr\u003E\npossible to explore this new dimension.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. I want you to begin research on vehicles which can travel into this fourth\u003Cbr\u003E\ndimension immediately. Anyone else have any comments? No? Very well. I believe that\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrings today\u2019s meeting to a close. See you gentlemen next week.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSKK: UNN Broadcasting Studio\u003Cbr\u003E\nSix Months Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nWelcome back to the United News Network! Merely half a year after the discovery of the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndirection known as \u2018up\u2019, we have come to understand our place in the universe. Now it is our\u003Cbr\u003E\nturn to explore what lies above. Kerbals from around our great nation have gathered together to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbegin launching rockets up to learn what it is that comprises this \u2018outer space\u2019. To learn more\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout the USKK\u2019s space program, we interview its founder, Jebediah Kerman.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah followed Erdan Kerman onto the set. He had never really liked the media\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\naggressive nationalism, but felt it was a necessary evil one had to put up in order to\u003Cbr\u003E\ninform the public. The only reason he was even here was because of Bob. While\u003Cbr\u003E\nnormally the timid kerbal never spoke up or forced his opinion on anyone without\u003Cbr\u003E\nprompting, he was quite vocal on matters of national security and passing knowledge\u003Cbr\u003E\nonto the people. It was Bob\u2019s idea to schedule this interview, and explain the goals and\u003Cbr\u003E\nintent of the USKK\u2019s space program, to raise awareness of the imminent launch. It\u2019s not\u003Cbr\u003E\nas if it needs much explaining, Jeb thought to himself, the population is ecstatic about the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprogram. Ah well, it should make this interview easier then.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll right, we\u2019re on in twenty seconds. Are you ready, Jeb\u2014may I call you Jeb?\u201D Erdan\u003Cbr\u003E\nasked, settling into his seat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely, and I\u2019m as ready as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201D Jebediah responded, taking a deep breath\u003Cbr\u003E\nand attempting to project an air of excitement and good cheer. While it had only been\u003Cbr\u003E\nsix months since he\u2019d begun this crazy venture, it felt more like six years.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re live in five! Four! Three! Two! One!\u201D The cameraman\u2019s countdown reminded Jeb\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the ground-breaking launch tomorrow, and this served to cheer him up more than\u003Cbr\u003E\nany number of breathing exercises.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood evening, and welcome to the United News Network! My name is Erdan Kerman,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand today I have a very special guest on the show, Jebediah Kerman, founder and\u003Cbr\u003E\ndirector of the USKK\u2019s space program!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb looked towards the camera, and gave a little wave, only to stop when he saw the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncameraman shaking his head at him. It appeared that there was a specific etiquette to\u003Cbr\u003E\nfollow when appearing on camera. Another reason to dislike this interview, he thought,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaking a mental note to get Bob back for this somehow.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo Jeb, what prompted you to found the space program? Why divert our resources\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto space travel, when so much more economic opportunities exist in conventional air\u003Cbr\u003E\ntraffic?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb had prepared for this question, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be the first off the bat. This\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas going to be a long interview.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell Erdan, it\u2019s not that the economic opportunities don\u2019t exist, but we simply haven\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiscovered them yet. No machine nor kerbal has ever even been to outer space, let alone\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplored it for any meaningful amount of time. We\u2019ve looked outwards with telescopes,\u003Cbr\u003E\nsure, but we still know very little about what lies beyond our atmosphere.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well-reasoned, I for one am sure that there are plentiful ways we can learn new\u003Cbr\u003E\nthings from the great beyond. Now, can you give us any more details on how you\u003Cbr\u003E\nfounded the space program? Where is the launch site located?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s an interesting story. You see, originally the space program was going to be a\u003Cbr\u003E\nmilitary project. You know what that means, everything classified, nobody would be\u003Cbr\u003E\nallowed to see the launches, that sort of thing. However, a very generous grant from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprivate sector allowed us to buy an old research and development base off the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngovernment and set up shop there. We\u2019ve built rocket construction facilities, crew\u003Cbr\u003E\ntraining grounds, and even an aircraft hangar on the premises! I\u2019ve some pictures here,\u003Cbr\u003E\nactually!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHere I am; this was taken by Bob when we first drove out to the space centre\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBob took this as I walked towards the main building. We were both so excited to be\u003Cbr\u003E\ntouring the premises, I swear he went through at least three rolls of film!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAh, and here\u2019s an image of one of the Tracking Station dishes. I believe I was getting\u003Cbr\u003E\nacquainted with the facilities and crew around this time, so Bob was free to wander\u003Cbr\u003E\naround and take pictures.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHere\u2019s a shot from the Launchpad. Right now it\u2019s getting all set up for the launch\u003Cbr\u003E\ntomorrow.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBob was really proud of this one; he managed to get a shot of the Mun next to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK flag flying at the space centre.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMy, you have quite the nice place there! And an ocean view too! This sure beats my\u003Cbr\u003E\napartment, ha ha ha!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nKnowing full well that the newscaster possessed a seaside mansion a couple of\u003Cbr\u003E\nkilometres from the studio, Jeb neglected to comment. After a moment, Erdan\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontinued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you mentioned that the launches will be public, and I hear that the launch site\u003Cbr\u003E\nalready has plenty of kerbals camping out, ready for tomorrow\u2019s launch! What has got\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe public so interested in your vision?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, I have learned that if you mention going to the Mun, suddenly you\u2019ve got half\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe nation wanting to tag along!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSpeaking of \u2018tagging along\u2019. Which kerbals has the space program selected? I certainly\u003Cbr\u003E\nhope you aren\u2019t just going to grab any old kerbal off the street!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDefinitely not. Since we still know so little about the effects of the zone beyond our\u003Cbr\u003E\natmosphere, we have elected to send unmanned probes before kerbals. They will allow\u003Cbr\u003E\nus to gather valuable data about the effects of outer space so that we can plan\u003Cbr\u003E\nsubsequent missions accordingly.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you aren\u2019t going to be launching a kerbal tomorrow?\u201D Erdan seemed disappointed,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand Jeb suspected that many of the kerbals watching would be as well. He decided to\u003Cbr\u003E\ndivert their attention, quickly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately, no. But kerbals are being trained as we speak for the eventual manned\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission. It shouldn\u2019t take long before we are ready to launch kerballed craft, we just\u003Cbr\u003E\nneed to analyse the probe data first.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs for these kerbals in training, are you one of them? Actually, are you even allowed\u003Cbr\u003E\nto share that information with our audience?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Jebediah chuckled. Erdan had evidently covered highly-classified stories in the\u003Cbr\u003E\npast. \u201CYes, I am allowed to share who these kerbals will be. In fact, I even have pictures\u003Cbr\u003E\nof them here! Now first of all, as the director of the program, there\u2019s no chance I\u2019ll ever\u003Cbr\u003E\nget to fly a mission; I simply have too much to do! Fortunately, the kerbals we\u2019ve\u003Cbr\u003E\nchosen are excellent candidates. Here we have Rondred, Erdrin, Jorfred, and Donnand\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerman,\u201D Jeb said, revealing a few remaining photos to the camera.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy, my, Jeb, these look like excellent candidates to go to space! I was told that you also\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrought along two colleagues to help run the program. Are they not training to become\u003Cbr\u003E\nastronauts too?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, Bill and Bob? Are you kidding? Bill\u2019s pushing about 60 now, and Bob is too much\u003Cbr\u003E\nof a scaredy-cat to even approach a rocket, let alone fly one into orbit! As you see in this\u003Cbr\u003E\npicture, while they\u2019re wearing USKK-certified flight suits, it\u2019s simply for safety, as\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019re inspecting a fuel storage tank out on the grounds.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo to answer your question, Erdan, no, they\u2019re simply good friends of mine who share\u003Cbr\u003E\nmy passion for space, and want to see the USKK become a great, space-faring nation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSpeaking of our great country, what are your thoughts on the rumours that the CFKN\u003Cbr\u003E\nhas stolen our technology and begun a space program of their very own?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb\u2019s heart sank, and his smile became a little fixed. He\u2019d hoped to avoid the topic of\u003Cbr\u003E\nnation vs. nation entirely, but it appeared that Erdan was more persistent than he first\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad assumed. Jeb had managed to sidestep the topic when he answered the first\u003Cbr\u003E\nquestion, but it seemed Erdan really wanted to get an opinion out of him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, Erdan, I would be cautious when saying that the CFKN stole our technology.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rocket engines and fuel tanks are surprisingly simple in design. In fact, we found\u003Cbr\u003E\nour first set of prototypes lying by the side of the road!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan\u2019s eyes widened and he looked like he was going to say something.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThough of course, we have manufactured completely new parts for the launch\u003Cbr\u003E\ntomorrow,\u201D Jeb added quickly, and not entirely truthfully. \u201CBut as I was saying, while\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe base technology for space exploration is simple, our plans are anything but. I am\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfident that tomorrow\u2019s launch will be completely successful, and not even the sky is\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe limit after that!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSimply fantastic, Jeb! I can tell you that I will definitely tune in for the launch\u003Cbr\u003E\ntomorrow! Our glorious USKK is about to enter a glorious new age of exploration and\u003Cbr\u003E\ndevelopment, all under your capable guidance! I do have one last question before you\u003Cbr\u003E\ngo, though. Do you ever feel pressured, with this enormous amount of responsibility\u003Cbr\u003E\nhanging over your head?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI have to say, Erdan, I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of responsibility over the years, and I feel like\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis is just another small step for me. Besides, I have the excellent Bill and Bob to help\u003Cbr\u003E\nme along; they take over the tasks I can\u2019t manage.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI see. Well, it has been an honour talking to you, Jeb, and I wish you the best of luck for\u003Cbr\u003E\ntomorrow\u2019s launch! I\u2019ve been Erdan Kerman interviewing the great Director of our\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace program, Jebediah Kerman, and this is the United News Network!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd we\u2019re clear!\u201D shouted the cameraman. A low buzz began to envelop the\u003Cbr\u003E\nnewsroom as kerbals began to go about their various tasks. Jebediah shook Erdan\u2019s and\u003Cbr\u003E\nmany of the crew\u2019s hands, then took his leave of the newsroom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob was waiting for Jeb outside in his car. \u201CHow did the interview go? I wasn\u2019t able to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncatch it on the radio. Thanks again for doing this, I know you don\u2019t like to associate\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch with the media.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb sighed. \u201CTo tell the truth, it wasn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019m just anxious to get back to the Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nCenter, there are still so many things to be done before the launch.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t you worry; Bill has it all under control. I drove by on my way here, and it looked\u003Cbr\u003E\nlike they were already erecting Aether 7 on the Launchpad.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlready? Wow, I suppose he really is on top of things! You guys have been great,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthanks for agreeing to this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know it\u2019s no problem, we would have joined the program regardless of your\u003Cbr\u003E\ninvolvement. Pushing the limits of what\u2019s possible, that\u2019s the USKK way!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb chuckled. \u201CSure it is.\u201D and the two drove off towards the Space Centre.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCKFN: Facility for Space Research\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree months ago\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs this it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean, \u2018is this it\u2019?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGusbin and Matdun Kerman, two newly-selected kerbonauts, were standing on the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngrounds of the CKFN Facility for Space Research.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI mean exactly what I said, Matt. Is this the result of all that time and money? Two old\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuildings and a launch pad?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, hey, not so loud, Gus!\u201D Matdun said quickly, eying a few construction staff who\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere giving them dirty looks. \u201COkay, the buildings aren\u2019t really brand-new but these\u003Cbr\u003E\nguys equipped them with all the rocket construction facilities and tracking hardware\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe could need.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy couldn\u2019t we have gotten something like the USKK\u2019s entire Space Centre? Maybe\u003Cbr\u003E\nat least a research and development building? They\u2019ve even got a runway, for devs\u003Cbr\u003E\nsake!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on, Gus, our plan is to go to space, not to stay in the atmosphere! Besides, all\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe aircraft I\u2019ve seen flying so far seem to crash a lot; I\u2019d rather them stay away from\u003Cbr\u003E\nme. Besides, this should be all we need.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGusbin sighed. \u201CI guess you\u2019re right. If it lets us get into space, I wouldn\u2019t even mind\u003Cbr\u003E\nworking out of somebody\u2019s garage. I guess this will have to do.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, then you\u2019ll pleased to hear where our R\u0026amp;D centre is located; Jenfry was kind\u003Cbr\u003E\nenough to donate his to the cause!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh good grief\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCKFN: Jenfry Kerman\u2019s House\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresent Day\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford Kerman, Flight Director for the CKFN\u2019s space program walked up to the front\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoor and knocked. Jenfry Kerman was quick to open it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy good morning, Mr. Danford, sir! How\u2019s the rocket coming along? Have you\u003Cbr\u003E\npicked a name yet?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHi, Jenfry. The rocket is actually mostly complete; we\u2019re just lacking a payload for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, I need to talk to Bilfrod.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, he\u2019s right this way, down in the garage.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJenfry\u2019s garage had been converted into a small, but surprisingly well-equipped\u003Cbr\u003E\nresearch lab. Harried techs rushed around, analyzing spreadsheets and testing\u003Cbr\u003E\nprototypes. In the centre of it all stood Bilfrod Kerman, who as Chief Scientific Advisor\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the CKFN had been tasked to help get the space program\u2019s research off the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBilfrod, you\u2019ve got to give me something, the boys at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E are getting impatient.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhere\u2019s our payload?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, we hammered out a working prototype, but unfortunately we\u2019re not going to be\u003Cbr\u003E\nable to launch it,\u201D responded Bilfrod.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? I thought the probe core performed admirably when we tested it on the ground!\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s quite frustrating, actually. We launched a sounding rocket the other day with a test\u003Cbr\u003E\nplatform, just to check that the systems will work when we launch for real. However,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe found that when the electronics reach the upper atmosphere, the increased radiation\u003Cbr\u003E\ncooks their systems. Right now we\u2019ve been focused on hardening our electronic\u003Cbr\u003E\nsystems, but it is taking a while.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRadiation, you say? Can\u2019t you just stick a some shielding onto the probe and call it at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s not as simple as that; with all the countermeasures we have to put in, we\u2019ll either\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave to totally redesign all our hardware, or end up with a box that has so much\u003Cbr\u003E\nshielding it would be kerbal-rated.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHuh. \u2026Which of these two approaches would take less time?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNormally I would recommend the new tech, but it just so happens that one of my\u003Cbr\u003E\ninterns built a mock-up of a manned rocket, and with minimal effort we could modify it\u003Cbr\u003E\nso that a kerbal could survive the trip. However, it would be far heavier than the probe\u003Cbr\u003E\ncore we were planning to send up.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry about the weight, the boys at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E are itching for something to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuilding a rocket which can take this capsule into orbit will be just the project they\u003Cbr\u003E\nneed. How long will it take to rad-proof this capsule?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019d say maybe a week or two. We still need to vacuum-test it, make sure it can survive\u003Cbr\u003E\nlong-term exposure to outer space.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDamn, the USKK is launching tomorrow. And this is compared to how long for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nredesigned tech?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, that would take months. I\u2019ll get one of the interns on it though, we\u2019ll eventually\u003Cbr\u003E\nwant to send probes up there, won\u2019t we?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDefinitely. Okay, thanks Bilfrod. I\u2019ll get back to you soon.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford exited the garage, dodging a kerbal with his hands full of batteries. I guess\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe\u2019re not going to launch before the USKK after all, he thought to himself. The President\u003Cbr\u003E\nwon\u2019t be happy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree hours later, back in the capital, Danford had just finished giving his report to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdvisory Council. However, the response he received caught him off guard. \u201CThe\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresident is doing WHAT?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs I said, administrative duties of the space program will be taken over his advisors,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral Geoffnard repeated, somewhat annoyed. \u201CHe said your methods just aren\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\ngetting results. Managing an entire space program\u2019s policy as well as check up on\u003Cbr\u003E\nindividual teams is far too much for one kerbal to handle.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed heavily. \u201CHe is right about that; I\u2019ve been a nervous wreck ever since\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe started. But let me promote some members of my own staff at the space facility; I\u003Cbr\u003E\nknow some great people who would be perfect for managing the program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Dan. I can\u2019t let you do that,\u201D said the General, \u201CThe President said you\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrilliant at managing the space centre, and commends you for the performance of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nteams so far. However, even the best-run program will fall apart without a clear goal in\u003Cbr\u003E\nmind. And besides getting a rocket to space, you don\u2019t seem to have one.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, uh, I\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPrecisely. He\u2019s not happy that the engineers are scrapping the ship they just built and\u003Cbr\u003E\nare constructing another rocket, and says you need someone to keep a watch over your\u003Cbr\u003E\nspending. Bilcas Kerman, the Economics Advisor, is just the kerbal for the job. You\u2019ve\u003Cbr\u003E\nalready got Bilfrod working on research and development, and I,\u201D The General\u003Cbr\u003E\nthumped his chest proudly. \u201CI will keep an eye on the USKK and shape our program\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoals to match and exceed theirs.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe President had evidently given this plan a lot of thought, and try as he might,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford couldn\u2019t disagree with the General. The last few months had taken their toll on\u003Cbr\u003E\nhim; having expert kerbals take care of administrative tasks and cut through red tape\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould simplify his life immensely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFine. I can see his logic behind this decision, and I can\u2019t really think of a better\u003Cbr\u003E\nsolution,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t you worry; this is for the best. You\u2019ll be able to spend more time doing the\u003Cbr\u003E\nthings you are good at, and we\u2019ll be able to get a leg up on the USKK at last! Speaking\u003Cbr\u003E\nof which, their launch is tomorrow. The President wants to know when our rocket can\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe launched?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid not for another three weeks, but we will launch a kerbal when we do.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, the General gave a double-take. \u201CYou\u2019re sending someone up there? My people\u003Cbr\u003E\ntell me the USKK hasn\u2019t even considered a kerballed launch yet! Are you sure it\u2019s safe?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely. My engineers have been able to get nearly one hundred percent reliability\u003Cbr\u003E\nout of their engines, and their designs keep getting better and better. We might not beat\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe USKK into space, but the first kerbal up there will be from the CKFN.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI see\u2026 I congratulate you on your ingenuity, but in the future, you should keep the\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresident or myself in the loop when deciding on our payloads. That reminds me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u2019ll need to attend our next staff meeting, Thursday at noon. Now that the Advisory\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommittee is part of the Space Program, we need to be brought up to speed, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nproperly informed about\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford tuned the General out as he began listing protocol and meeting times. Having\u003Cbr\u003E\nincreased government control over the space program wasn\u2019t ideal, but it certainly\u003Cbr\u003E\nwasn\u2019t the end of the world. Maybe now that he had more of the President\u2019s ear, he\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould push for an increased budget, and maybe expand the Space Program\u2019s facilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWho knows, maybe this could be a good thing after all\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCHAPTER II:\u003Cbr\u003E\nTOUCHING THE SKY\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSKK: Space Centre Launchpad\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne week later\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFuel lines, check. Mooring cables, check. Engine ignitors, check.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sun had not yet risen at the USKK\u2019s space centre, but the work of the ground\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol team had already been going on for hours. Aether 7 was nearly ready for liftoff\u003Cbr\u003E\nthough, and the crowd gathered outside the Space Centre was bustling with excitement,\u003Cbr\u003E\ndespite the early hour.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene Kerman, Flight Director, stood at the centre of the chaos that was Mission Control,\u003Cbr\u003E\nyelling into his radio headset.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo, tell the ground crew not to load the fuel yet. If the welding team drops a torch\u003Cbr\u003E\nagain, there\u2019ll be a fireball large enough to toast our audience. We load half an hour\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore the launch, no sooner. What do you mean, the payload isn\u2019t in the rocket yet?\u003Cbr\u003E\nTell the R\u0026amp;D team to quit poking at it and shove it in there! I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s only\u003Cbr\u003E\nshowing an 86% reliability with receiving signals, it isn\u2019t going to have to do anything\u003Cbr\u003E\nfancy. The main goal of this operation is to launch something into space and please the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrowd out there. Speaking of which, how many are there? Three thousand? That\u2019s more\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan the turnout to most headball matches! If we screw this one up\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, Gene. You\u2019re not going to screw up,\u201D a calm voice reassured the frantic\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThank the devs you\u2019re here, Bill! Things are insane over here. Half the Mission Control\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechs aren\u2019t even here yet, the rocket is still under construction, and this crowd is\u003Cbr\u003E\ndriving us all crazy! I thought we weren\u2019t supposed to launch until Tuesday!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat was the plan. Unfortunately, Jeb let slip our most optimistic launch schedule\u003Cbr\u003E\nestimate on live television, so we\u2019ve got an audience earlier than we anticipated. It\u2019s not\u003Cbr\u003E\nas if we can just tell them to go home, can we?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI suppose not\u2026That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t try, right?\u201D Gene flipped on the exterior\u003Cbr\u003E\nPA systems and prepared to speak.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill quickly turned it off. \u201CNot so fast. Don\u2019t give up before you\u2019ve even tried! Give the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrews some credit. They may not be the best in the world, but they definitely won\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nscrew up anything major, yesterday\u2019s incident taught them quite the explosive lesson.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI guess you\u2019re right. Why couldn\u2019t you have taken my position? I\u2019m lousy at it; my\u003Cbr\u003E\nnerves are shot and we haven\u2019t even launched yet!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get used to it quickly. I\u2019ve had enough of management for a\u003Cbr\u003E\nlifetime; I\u2019m here just to support Jebediah, and give you a hand. Besides, you\u2019re doing\u003Cbr\u003E\nbetter than I did on my first time. At least nothing\u2019s on fire!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe day\u2019s not over yet, Bill. But it looks like you\u2019re right, I\u2019ve got confirmation that the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket is just about ready for payload installation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat did I tell you? How\u2019s the payload coming along?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COne second\u2026\u201D Gene\u2019s expression widened into one of amazement as he consulted\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith the labs via his headset. \u201CI can\u2019t believe it. R\u0026amp;D actually managed to get the\u003Cbr\u003E\npayload to work! It\u2019s on its way to Aether now!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIn that case, restart the countdown, Gene.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRight-o, Bill!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know Donnand, why couldn\u2019t this have been a kerballed launch?\u201D Rondred\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerman said to the kerbal sitting next to him. With their daily training suspended due\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the impending launch, the two kerbonauts found themselves without much to do. At\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe moment, they were wandering around the Space Centre, speculating about the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfuture of the space program.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know very well why not; the rocket isn\u2019t big enough to lift your fat butt into\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey now,\u201D said Rondred, giving a nearby vending machine several practised knocks,\u003Cbr\u003E\ndispensing a free snack. \u201CThe flight controller said I was within acceptable weight\u003Cbr\u003E\nlimits. Besides, couldn\u2019t they have just built a bigger rocket than that tiny thing?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe construction team had enough difficulties with that one; it\u2019s going to take them a\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhile before they feel confident enough to build anything bigger. I say let them practice\u003Cbr\u003E\non small rockets. Besides, the bigwigs who lead this space program are concerned about\u003Cbr\u003E\nsafety, they say that having a kerbal go up on untested hardware is dangerous.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanger? Who cares about danger? We\u2019ve all risked our lives before, and we can do it\u003Cbr\u003E\nagain, if it means getting to go into space!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t you worry, Ron. You\u2019ll get to go to space eventually, we just need to find out\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat\u2019s up there first.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood, I joined this space program for one reason only: I want to see Kerbin from\u003Cbr\u003E\nabove! I wonder what it looks like?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf the launch goes well, the probe will take pictures of the view. I wonder how we\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nget to take a look? Say, the guys down in Mission Control will probably get to see them\u003Cbr\u003E\nfirst, won\u2019t they?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s right! Instead of waiting for the pictures to be posted publicly, why don\u2019t we\u003Cbr\u003E\njust see them ourselves?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou mean break into the Mission Control room? Not even our passes will get us in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm, you\u2019re right. Security is pretty tight.\u201D At this, Donnand sat back, clearly\u003Cbr\u003E\nthinking hard. \u201CI\u2019ve got it! We just need to get ourselves a pair of blue polo shirts!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPolos? How would that\u2014ahh, I see what you\u2019re getting at!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll we have to do is sneak into the control room with all the other techs, then just\u003Cbr\u003E\nstand at the back of the room when the rocket is launched! I heard from one of the techs\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat there are always extras just standing around; we won\u2019t have to do a thing but\u003Cbr\u003E\nwatch!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon, I don\u2019t know why you became a kerbonaut. I think you\u2019re smarter than Werhner\u003Cbr\u003E\nvon Kerman himself!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAw shucks, you\u2019re making me blush! Now let\u2019s get moving. The laundry room\u2019s over\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis way\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThirty minutes later, the two stood in the control room, watching Gene speak loudly to\u003Cbr\u003E\nall those assembled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCountdown is now at T minus ten minutes. Repeat, ten minutes until liftoff.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nRondred and Donnand were standing at the back of Mission Control, clad in the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncharacteristic light blue polo shirts that its technicians wore.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is seriously the best idea you\u2019ve ever had, Don. Just look at those giant monitors, I\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan\u2019t believe we\u2019re really here!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSomething\u2019s not right though. The room doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s as packed as I\u2019ve heard it\u003Cbr\u003E\nnormally is.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuddenly, a very harried Gene Kerman stopped before them. Ron and Don exchanged\u003Cbr\u003E\nworried looks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, thank the devs you\u2019re here! There\u2019s been a pileup on the highway, and the last few\u003Cbr\u003E\nmembers of the team aren\u2019t going to make it! You\u2019re the backup control techs, right?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot knowing what the punishment for sneaking into the Mission Control room\u003Cbr\u003E\nimmediately before launch was, but knowing it was nothing good, the two kerbonauts\u003Cbr\u003E\nnodded carefully.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir, that is, ah, definitely us. Uh, where do you want us to go?\u201D asked Donnand.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright, you go here, next to Barfnal. He\u2019s the Lead Telemetry Controller. He\u2019ll let you\u003Cbr\u003E\nknow what to do. You, on the other hand, are going to be Range Safety Officer. Activate\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe sequence if\u2014Squad forbid\u2014the command is given.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonnand shuffled over and queried Barfnal as to what his job would be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGreat, another newbie. You know, I\u2019ve got a job to do here, I can\u2019t be telling all these\u003Cbr\u003E\nguys how to watch their consoles! What you\u2019re going to be doing is monitoring the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntemperature and pressure of the payload. You see gauge X7-42b here? If it goes critical,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake sure to notify me, so I can pass the information onto Gene. However, it may be\u003Cbr\u003E\njust a fault in the system, so you have to consult the manual here and make sure that the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfuses haven\u2019t blown. If they have, then you need to\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHead spinning, Don prayed that the payload would be fine so that he would not have\u003Cbr\u003E\nto run through the increasingly-complicated procedure Barfnal was going over.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRondred, on the other hand, had a very simple control panel in front of him. A single\u003Cbr\u003E\nBig Red Button, covered by a plastic safety case, lay in front of him. Now, most other\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbals would be able to handle this position. They would await the launch and enjoy\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe show, only pressing the button if they were told. Not Rondred. For his entire life, he\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad been pushing buttons, whether the metaphorical buttons of his parents and\u003Cbr\u003E\nteachers, or physical buttons in vehicle pits. He loved pushing buttons. As such, when\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfronted with such a Big Red Button that was just begging to be pressed, Rondred\u003Cbr\u003E\nfaced a very difficult decision. Should he press the Button, feel the satisfaction, and deal\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith whatever consequences resulted? Or should he leave the Button be, and forever\u003Cbr\u003E\nwonder what it did? A difficult choice even at the calmest of moments, and this\u003Cbr\u003E\nmoment was anything but calm. Rondred struggled to recall exactly what the job of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nRange Safety Officer was, but was unable to remember specifics. Did it have something\u003Cbr\u003E\nto do with large explosions? Then again, given by how many explosions came from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nVehicle Assembly Building these days, it seemed like explosions and rockets went\u003Cbr\u003E\nhand-in-hand. Still, the Button awaited, in all its infinitely pressable glory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright people, this is it!\u201D Finally, Gene Kerman\u2019s voice rang out throughout the room.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe are ready to launch Kerbin\u2019s first satellite! All stations, report in.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAttitude, go!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPower, go\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTelemetry, go,\u201D Barfnal stated. Donnand Kerman, worriedly staring at his massive\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol board, certainly did not feel like all systems were go, as he peered at gauge X6-\u003Cbr\u003E\n48c (or was that X8-49a?).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCommunications, go\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so the list went on, subsystem after subsystem reporting readiness, when\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuddenly, a pause came. Gene spoke up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRange Safety? Range Safety, are you ready?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnamoured by the Button, Rondred Kerman snapped out of his daze when he realized\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene was speaking directly to him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh, yes! Yes, yes, for sure, everything\u2019s ready here! Um, go?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. Well, gentlemen, all stations are online and we are go for launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommencing the final countdown.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTen\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNine\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonnand tried to recall exactly which gauge Barfnal had told him to watch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEight\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSeven\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Button remained, stoic as ever. Ron couldn\u2019t take his eyes off it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSix\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFive\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurely it was gauge XF-47b. Or was that X4-F7b?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFour\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThree\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Button suddenly began to blink. Eyes widening, Rondred started to sweat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTwo\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COne\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLiftoff, we have liftoff of the Aether 7 orbital probe!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSay Jorfred, why was the ship called Aether 7?\u201D Erdrin Kerman said to the final\u003Cbr\u003E\nmember of the USKK kerbonaut team, as they watched the rocket lift off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, who knows why they chose the name Aether, but I believe that the \u20187\u2019 moniker\u003Cbr\u003E\ncame from the fact that this is the seventh rocket we\u2019ve launched. The first six were just\u003Cbr\u003E\nsounding rockets built to test the technology.\u201D replied Jorfred.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHuh, isn\u2019t that funny,\u201D she mused, watching the rocket streak skywards on a column\u003Cbr\u003E\nof flame and smoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIn my favourite board game, Human Space Program, the United States\u2019 story mode\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nmanned rocket launch was called the Freedom 7. I forget why it was called that though.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHuh, maybe one of the higher-ups is a fan of that game? Though it could be just a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncoincidence.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nAether 7 did not care as to what it was named after. It merely rose towards the heavens\u003Cbr\u003E\nbearing the collection of electronics which would ultimately orbit the planet. The probe\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas nothing fancy, it would simply receive radio signals transmitted to it and emit a\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponse, but as no other object had ever been to orbit before it, this probe was very\u003Cbr\u003E\nspecial.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTransmissions originating from the Mission Control station, relayed through the three\u003Cbr\u003E\nmassive dishes of the Tracking Station, found the little rocket and commanded it to\u003Cbr\u003E\npitch itself over forty-five degrees relative to the horizon. A few moments later, the first\u003Cbr\u003E\nstage engine used up the last few drops of fuel and promptly flamed out. In response,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarefully-placed pyrotechnics (the engineering team found out first-hand what happens\u003Cbr\u003E\nif one fails to use caution when placing them the preceding day) detonated and the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsecond stage engine was exposed to the thin air of Kerbin\u2019s upper atmosphere. With\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly a second\u2019s delay, it fired up, and Aether 7 continued on its journey skyward.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonnand Kerman was not having a good day. Not only had the X8-67 gauge gone red,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut the X3-DF8 gauge too, and the X7-56a gauge as well! In fact, his entire control panel\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas flashing red. Donnand was on the verge of telling Barfnal this, but realized that no\u003Cbr\u003E\none else in the control room seemed to be reacting to alerts on their control panels. In\u003Cbr\u003E\nfact, the catastrophic failure seemed to be localized to only his panel. Recalling\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomething Barfnal had said, he ducked underneath the console, where the acrid smell of\u003Cbr\u003E\nburnt plastic met him. The main fuse had burnt out, and by the looks (and smell) of it,\u003Cbr\u003E\nsome of the insulation along the wire had been scarred as it did so. Donnand yanked\u003Cbr\u003E\nout the burnt fuse, grabbed a replacement from its box, then shoved it into place. With\u003Cbr\u003E\ngreat relief, he noted that all the gauges had returned to normal. He certainly hoped\u003Cbr\u003E\nRondred was having a less stressful time at his console.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry as he might, Rondred could not ignore the button. Besides it being his job (or what\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene thought was his job), the Button was the most pressable button he had ever\u003Cbr\u003E\nencountered in his life. Big, flashing, and smack-dab in the middle of the console, this\u003Cbr\u003E\nButton needed to be pressed. Who would ever find out? he thought to himself. Gene\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot looking this way, just go ahead and give it a push! And so push it he did, carefully\u003Cbr\u003E\neasing back the cover and depressing the large, round Button. He was not disappointed;\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Button emitted a massively satisfying ka-thunk as he pushed it, activating the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndelicate electronics hidden inside his console.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRadio waves propagate at the speed of light, a speed far greater than a mind can\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomprehend. As such, the following series of events took place in much less than the\u003Cbr\u003E\nblink of an eye. As Rondred pushed the Button, a signal was sent through his console,\u003Cbr\u003E\noff to the tracking station, and off in the general direction of the rocket, via one of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nradio dishes. Upon arrival, the signal was quickly decoded, the rocket understanding its\u003Cbr\u003E\nmessage: SELF DESTRUCT. This information prompted the very rudimentary\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomputer on board to send an electronic pulse through a very specific wire, on its way\u003Cbr\u003E\nto another carefully-placed series of explosives. Unlike the decoupler, these would\u003Cbr\u003E\nprecisely tear the ship apart, leaving nothing but dust in their wake.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026so then I said to him: \u2018How hard can rocket science be, anyway?\u201D said Gregbro\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerman, one of the Vehicle Assembly Building\u2019s rocket construction workers, as he was\u003Cbr\u003E\nworking on the fuselage of Aether 7, several hours prior to the ship\u2019s launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHahaha, you\u2019re hilarious, Greg!\u201D howled his partner, who was holding Gregbro\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nwelding gear. \u201CYou ought to quit your day job and become a professional comedian!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know, I considered that for a couple of years. That actually reminds me of a\u003Cbr\u003E\nstory\u2026\u201D Greg responded, turning away from the rocket to look at the other kerbal,\u003Cbr\u003E\ninadvertently letting the welding torch stray towards a sensitive portion of the rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood Squad, Greg! Look out!\u201D yelled his partner.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGregbro quickly turned back to the job at hand, and he yanked his torch back from a\u003Cbr\u003E\nportion of the hull which was endowed with more warning labels than any other.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell\u2026that was close,\u201D he said, quickly turning off the torch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThank the devs, three centimetres to the right and you might have set off the Range\u003Cbr\u003E\nSafety explosives!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou don\u2019t need to tell me\u2013the explosion would have been huge! Well, it doesn\u2019t look\u003Cbr\u003E\nlike anything was damaged, so let\u2019s patch up the hull, and go do something else for a\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhile! Say, wanna see me juggle decouplers?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have to ask me twice! Bet you can\u2019t get more than five up at once this time!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, just watch me\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nLittle did Gregbro nor his partner know, as they headed towards an explosive incident\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich would live on in infamy, but the unsupervised welding torch had done more\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan give both kerbals a scare and leave a blackened streak across the hull. The\u003Cbr\u003E\ninsulation of wire upon which the self-destruct signal would travel had been\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompletely melted off, exposing the inner wire. This bare copper now touched the outer\u003Cbr\u003E\nhull of the rocket, which had been connected to the negative terminal of the onboard\u003Cbr\u003E\nbattery. Much like how a lightning strike travels through the charged air to get to\u003Cbr\u003E\nground, so would any current meant to trigger the self-destruct, bypassing its intended\u003Cbr\u003E\ndestination.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo Rondred in the present day, however, it simply appeared that the Button did\u003Cbr\u003E\nnothing. No change that he could see occurred, whether on the monitors or on any\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurrounding consoles. Slightly annoyed at the Button\u2019s lack of function, he pressed it\u003Cbr\u003E\nagain. And again. And once more, for good measure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKa-thunk\u003Cbr\u003E\nKa-thunk\u003Cbr\u003E\nKa-thunk\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree more times, the signal made its route from the console below Rondred\u2019s fingers,\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the Tracking Station, and finally to the rocket. And three more times it was redirected\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the wire to the hull to the ground terminal of the battery, ending its journey\u003Cbr\u003E\nprematurely.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProfoundly disappointed, Rondred quickly replaced the plastic cover as Gene walked\u003Cbr\u003E\nby, then for the first time since noticing the button, glanced up at the large monitor at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe front of the room. Wow! The rocket sure got high up quickly! he thought.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTime flies when one is preoccupied with a Button.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nRondred was indeed accurate, the rocket was setting new altitude records, flying\u003Cbr\u003E\nfarther than any kerbal-made object had before.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe previous sounding rockets had only made it to the outer layers of Kerbin\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\natmosphere; this ship would be the first kerbal-made object to enter outer space. Before\u003Cbr\u003E\nit reached that boundary though, the fuel reserves in the upper stage\u2019s fuel tank\u003Cbr\u003E\ndepleted, causing the engine\u2019s flames to sputter and die. At this point, the rocket had an\u003Cbr\u003E\napoapsis of roughly 200 km, which the flight planners had deemed as an excellent\u003Cbr\u003E\ntarget altitude. As such, the rocket jettisoned its fairings to reveal the satellite.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis probe was nothing special, it was simply designed to confirm that it had made\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit and take a few pictures. It didn\u2019t even have its own energy generation on board,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeaning that once the power ran out of the onboard batteries, the probe would simply\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe a silent piece of metal travelling around Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe probe did possess a sunshield though, as the scientists on the ground were worried\u003Cbr\u003E\nof whether the unfiltered light from the Sun would be enough to melt parts of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobe. Fortunately, no temperature alarms blared, but Donnand was more concerned\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout the acrid smell emanating from his console.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite being neither aerodynamic nor possessing wings, the satellite flew silently\u003Cbr\u003E\ntowards apoapsis. It possessed a tiny orbital operations motor, which it used to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncircularize itself when it reached the highest point in its orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnceremoniously, the rocket\u2019s motor activated and circularized its orbit, catapulting the\u003Cbr\u003E\nplanet Kerbin into a new era: The Space Age. Despite such a monumental achievement,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmost of the kerbals involved were distracted with other things. Donnand was still\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrying to get his instrument panel to work; he had inserted the wrong fuse and now\u003Cbr\u003E\nthick black smoke was emerging from all the gauges. Rondred had let his attention slip\u003Cbr\u003E\nback to the Button; he gave it one last ka-thunk before sadly giving up. Gene was\u003Cbr\u003E\nviciously chewing on his nails as he stalked around the room, inspecting everyone\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nconsoles. The kerbals out on the lawn of the Space Centre were packing up their things,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe show was over, and most had already left, minds consumed with more mundane\u003Cbr\u003E\nthings than the flight of Kerbin\u2019s first orbital probe.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat probe would function perfectly for the remainder of its short life, regardless of\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhether the thoughts of its creators were upon it. Its engine restarted smoothly to place\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe payload in the desired orbit, and all transmissions came through loud and clear,\u003Cbr\u003E\neliciting a loud cheer from the Control Room. Ron and Don took the opportunity to slip\u003Cbr\u003E\naway amidst the chaos, forgetting the reason they had snuck in the first place. Upon\u003Cbr\u003E\nreturning to the other two kerbonauts, they had nothing much to say about the launch\u003Cbr\u003E\nexcept \u2018it was nice\u2019.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, while the media switched into overdrive speculating about the next launch,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat the CKFN would do in response, and even the question of putting a kerbal up\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere eventually, no one paid attention to the fact that Kerbin\u2019s skies had gained a single\u003Cbr\u003E\nnew star. It was the evening after the launch, when a little kerbal was walking home\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith her mother.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLook, ma! That star\u2019s moving!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was before the advent of air travel, remember (the kerbals were still figuring out\u003Cbr\u003E\nexactly how wings worked, they preferred to stick with rocket-propelled vehicles for\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow), so the constant movement of lights across the sky modern day humans have\u003Cbr\u003E\ncome to know did not exist yet. Besides, this star was no plane. Moving across the sky at\u003Cbr\u003E\na rate no aircraft could ever hope to match, it indeed looked like one of the stars above\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad come loose and was moving in a perfectly straight line, from west to east.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe kerbal\u2019s mother, arms full of groceries, didn\u2019t even bother to look up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t be silly, dear. Stars can\u2019t move! Now can you give me a hand with this door?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe little kerbal rushed forward to help her mother, but not before glancing back at the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmysterious star, now nearly at the horizon, chasing the recently-set sun. She made a\u003Cbr\u003E\nsilent promise to herself, to find out what could make a star move like that, and some\u003Cbr\u003E\nday chase down the tiny point of light in the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN: Advisory Council Meeting\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne Day Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford shifted uneasily in his seat. This meeting had dragged on for hours, yet Bilcas\u003Cbr\u003E\nstill hadn\u2019t reached the topic that was on everyone\u2019s minds: yesterday\u2019s rocket launch\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the USKK.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking around the table, he saw that his fellow council members were nowhere near\u003Cbr\u003E\nas agitated as he. Bilfrod was idly doodling on a pad of paper, the President was\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwirling a pen in his fingers, and it even looked like General Geoffnard had nodded off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford rubbed his eyes, wishing he\u2019d had more than one cup of coffee this morning,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthen leaned back in his seat. Bilcas\u2019 next words made him sit right back up, however.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow that the cabbage legislation is taken care of, it\u2019s time to move on. Danford, I\u003Cbr\u003E\nbelieve this will concern you especially: yesterday\u2019s USKK rocket launch.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the launch? Do you want details of the launch, specifications of their\u003Cbr\u003E\nsatellite, rocket designs?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI want to know why we were not able to launch before them.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed before he began his response. Anything but this. \u201CAs I have stated\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore, our unmanned technology is severely underpowered in comparison to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK. As such, they were able to test, and launch their space probe on a much shorter\u003Cbr\u003E\ntimeframe than we were able to.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI know about the probe issues, but earlier this week you were telling us the advantages\u003Cbr\u003E\nof sending a kerbal into space. Why, may I ask, have you not accomplished that yet?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou are dramatically underestimating the timeframe in which our work is done in. It\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot like simply jumping into a car and going on a road trip. Researching the technology,\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesigning proper stages, fabricating the ship properly, training crew\u2014these take weeks!\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe only really shifted focus towards a manned mission a few days ago.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas did not respond, his face unreadable. Danford continued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLooking at our most optimistic schedules, I\u2019d say that we\u2019ll be ready to go within two\u003Cbr\u003E\nweeks at the very most.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon hearing this, the President halted his twirling pen. \u201CTwo weeks? Is there no way\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe can launch sooner?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot without cutting corners and putting our kerbal\u2019s life at risk. This isn\u2019t like a probe,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhere in a failed launch the only casualty is money. I will not allow a kerbal to be sent\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto a scenario where he or she may die,\u201D Danford responded, a hint of colour rising to\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis cheeks.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWithout opening his eyes, the General spoke: \u201CWell said. For once, I find myself\u003Cbr\u003E\nagreeing with Danford. I say we let his team take their time, from what I hear, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK hasn\u2019t scheduled another launch for the next month.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood to have your opinion, Geoffnard,\u201D the President responded. \u201CWhat say you,\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilfrod?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm? What? Uh\u2026\u201D the bespectacled kerbal said, blinking in confusion as he looked\u003Cbr\u003E\nup from his doodling, which was starting to resemble a rocket engine. \u201CThe payload is\u003Cbr\u003E\nmostly complete, we just need to finalize the lifter and attach the two. We need the time\u003Cbr\u003E\nto make sure that all systems are working correctly.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood to know, thanks Bilfrod. Well Bilcas, looks like that\u2019s everyone. Do you want to\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake a rebuttal?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know; it would look bad if we managed to get a kerbal killed on our first flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFine. I agree, give Danford his extra time.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford rocked back in his seat with surprise. It was truly a rare occasion when Bilcas\u003Cbr\u003E\nchanged his mind so quickly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood to know everyone is in agreement, then,\u201D the President said. \u201CThat appears to be\u003Cbr\u003E\neverything for today, I\u2019ll let you all go. Have a good night.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford set off with a determined expression. With a lot of hard work and a little luck,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey could make history.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CStand by, lowering the capsule into position now,\u201D the PA blared.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford Kerman was pleased. Almost a month after the USKK\u2019s launch, his crew was\u003Cbr\u003E\nfinally ready for a chance at making orbit themselves. Built from the finest materials\u003Cbr\u003E\nacross the CKFN, Latona 1 was nearly ready for liftoff. However, while Bilvin had\u003Cbr\u003E\nagreed to let Danford go ahead with the launch, he had shrunk the space program\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nbudget in response, leading to delays in the manufacturing and testing process. To\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake a long story short, this extended Danford\u2019s original estimate of two weeks quite\u003Cbr\u003E\nsignificantly. Still, the rocket was complete, even though it felt like he\u2019d had to negotiate\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor every last nut and bolt on the thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow are you doing, Bilvin?\u201D he asked over the radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAbout as fine as it can be expected, I\u2019ve been sitting here in this tiny room for three hours\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow,\u201D she replied grumpily, speaking from her location in the rocket\u2019s launch tower.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe capsule is being secured onto the rocket as we speak, you\u2019ll be out of there in no\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd there\u2019s nothing in here,\u201D she continued, seemingly oblivious to his words. \u201CI mean,\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou could have put a couple of magazines, or a TV, but it is completely empty. At least I\u2019ve got a\u003Cbr\u003E\nchair.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh, Bilvin? Do you copy?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI read you. Just offering you some suggestions so that the next poor sap who has to wait here\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoesn\u2019t die of boredom,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that. I\u2019m getting the \u2018all clear\u2019 now, you\u2019re free to board the rocket. I\u2019m sending\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomeone to help you into the capsule; it may be a bit of a tight fit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t mind how cramped it is, if it\u2019s getting me to space, you can\u2019t keep me away! Besides, I\u2019ll\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake a tight fit over dying of boredom any day.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJust remember, the room is necessary, we can\u2019t have you wandering around the launch\u003Cbr\u003E\nsite and encountering falling debris, you\u2019re a very important kerbal after all!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on, that was once! And it wasn\u2019t even my fault!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwenty minutes later, Danford stood inside the Facility\u2019s small Tracking Station, in\u003Cbr\u003E\nfront of his mission control team.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright. All systems are go. We are ready to finalize the countdown. Bilvin, what\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nyour status?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201DHatch secure, boss\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, how are we looking?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll systems are nominal, stand by for final countdown sequence,\u201D one of the kerbals in\u003Cbr\u003E\nfront of Dan said, eyes on his console readings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger. We\u2019re live in ten.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNine\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEight\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSeven\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite his cool exterior, Danford was actually quite nervous. This launch needed to go\u003Cbr\u003E\nperfectly, otherwise the CKFN risked looking like idiots who couldn\u2019t even get a\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft off the ground. Besides, a kerbal\u2019s life was in the balance. *No. *He had been\u003Cbr\u003E\npreparing for this moment for months, it would go off as planned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSix\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFive\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFour\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThree\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nPalms sweating, Danford adjusted his radio\u2019s microphone and glanced over his\u003Cbr\u003E\nclipboard. This was it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTwo\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COne\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo turning back now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026so I was saying, \u2018What do you mean, that was 7 g? I didn\u2019t even feel half of that!\u2019 But\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore you go thinking I\u2019m some sort of iron kerbal, it turns out the centrifuge was\u003Cbr\u003E\nmalfunctioning and giving strange readings. Apparently, the next time they tested it,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe pod separated from the main body and smashed through the roof! It\u2019s a lucky thing\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wasn\u2019t in it at the time!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJenfry Kerman was telling another of his stories from his experiences in basic training to\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe other CKFN kerbonauts. Suddenly, a bright glow lit up the window of the viewing\u003Cbr\u003E\nroom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh no, did we miss the countdown?\u201D asked Gusbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLooks like it,\u201D replied Matdun. \u201CAnyway, we can catch the comm chatter of liftoff\u201D She\u003Cbr\u003E\nflicked on the communicator.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd we have liftoff! Liftoff of the Latona 1 rocket, carrying Bilvin Kerman on its flight to\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit!\u201D Danford\u2019s voice came over the speaker.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWoohoo! Go Bilvin!\u201D cheered Jenfry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know, I always wondered why our rocket has a \u20181\u2019 at the end of its name, rather\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan the USKK\u2019s \u20187\u2019,\u201D Matdun spoke up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI believe it\u2019s because the USKK included their sounding rocket tests in their name,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplained Gusbin. \u201CSince we had so many failures with the probes we tried to send up,\u003Cbr\u003E\nit was decided to just start at 1 for our orbital flights.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, that reminds me of when I nearly got hit by one of those sounding rockets, it\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nquite the story,\u201D began Jenfry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun cut him off. \u201CNot now! I want to listen to the commentary!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLatona 1 has now reached seven thousand metres, beginning gravity turn now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGravity turn successful. We have now reached fifteen thousand metres.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEverything looks good so far, how\u2019s Bilvin doing?\u201D Gusbin asked. As if in response,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe communicator crackled to life.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, this is Bilvin, gravity turn was nominal, the rocket handles very well. Fuel is draining\u003Cbr\u003E\nas expected, preparing to drop first stage.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI read you, Bilvin, we\u2019ve observed the first stage engine burn out. You may fire the second stage\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen ready.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDecoupling now. Control, do you read a clean separation?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAffirmative, you are clear to fire your second stage engine.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CActivating engine now, fuel flow nominal.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CStand by to jettison escape tower, Latona 1.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger, jettisoning tower.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nA few minutes later, Bilvin\u2019s voice came over the radio once more. \u201CControl, I\u2019m reading\u003Cbr\u003E\na second stage burnout. Can you give me visual confirmation?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a negative, you\u2019ve just disappeared over the horizon. We\u2019re relaying comms through an\u003Cbr\u003E\neastern radio dish, so communications may be a little spotty.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger, I\u2019m using the rear camera to confirm the separation now. And\u2026confirmed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFiring orbital operations motor.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLatona 1, telemetry has confirmed that your trajectory is on target for a 100 km orbit.

This is ground-breaking history right\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere!\u201D cheered Jenfry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t celebrate prematurely. She still needs to restart the orbital engine. If it doesn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nlight, the rocket will re-enter on the opposite side of Kerbin!\u201D worried Gusbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRelax, Gus. I personally know the lead kerbal who worked on the LV-909 engine, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe reassured me that his team has tweaked it so that it can restart essentially infinitely,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nreassured Matdun. \u201CI trust his work.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, the engineering boys are the best there are at what they do; it\u2019ll work,\u201D chimed\u003Cbr\u003E\nin Jenfry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust then, the radio squawked into life once more: \u201CThis is the CKFN destroyer Admiral\u003Cbr\u003E\nDunfry. We\u2019re currently seven hundred kilometres south of your position and just received your\u003Cbr\u003E\ntelemetry, Mission Control. We\u2019ve established communications with Latona 1 and patching you\u003Cbr\u003E\nthrough now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl? Do you read me? Repeat, Control?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, Latona, we read you loud and clear.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. I\u2019m reading about thirty seconds to apoapsis, and am preparing to fire the main\u003Cbr\u003E\nengine for circularization burn.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou are all clear, everything looks nominal from down here\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFiring now\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBurn complete!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCongratulations Bilvin, you are officially the first kerbal to orbit Kerbin!\u201D The sound of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncheering could be heard in the background as Danford spoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTold you it would work!\u201D said Matdun triumphantly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt never hurts to be cautious,\u201D Gusbin responded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBack in the control room, Danford reopened communications. \u201CHow are you doing,\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilvin?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFantastic, the view is amazing! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMake sure to get pictures to share with us when you return! Now, your capsule only\u003Cbr\u003E\nhas enough supplies for one orbit, so we\u2019re on a tight schedule here. You will need to\u003Cbr\u003E\nperform some experiments before re-entering.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CReceiving you loud and clear, boss. Activating the experiments now. Bilfrod really wanted data,\u003Cbr\u003E\nhuh?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CApologies about making you do all the hard work, but as you know our probes don\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nexactly work well outside the atmosphere. Speaking of which, what\u2019s the radiation\u003Cbr\u003E\nlevel?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not reading much more than a standard background dose at sea level. The guys who built\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis capsule did good work!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI will pass your thanks onto them. Alright, we\u2019re getting the data back from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nscientific packages now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, what\u2019s next?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe now begin Phase One of the physiological testing. Heartbeat, blood pressure,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrainwaves, Bilfrod wants it all!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne orbit, thirty minutes, and numerous scientific experiments later, Bilvin finally\u003Cbr\u003E\nclicked off the instruments. It\u2019s nice to finally have a chance to enjoy the view. For the sights\u003Cbr\u003E\nto be seen outside the window of the tiny spacecraft were truly breathtaking.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe pensive moment did not last long, for Bilvin had to deorbit, jettison the orbital\u003Cbr\u003E\nmotor and orient herself properly before the heat from re-entry overwhelmed the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, this is Latona 1. I\u2019m commencing the deorbit burn now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe throaty roar which had suffused the ship at liftoff was gone now, all that was left to\u003Cbr\u003E\nremind Bilvin that an engine was firing was a slight vibration and a small force pushing\u003Cbr\u003E\nher back into the seat. The burn complete, she throttled down and informed Mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nControl of this event. Latona would hold onto the deorbit engine until it hit the\u003Cbr\u003E\natmosphere, in case an emergency course correction was required. Fortunately, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nefficient LV-909 engine meant that there was still plenty of fuel left in the tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLatona, you\u2019ve now entered the outer layer of Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere. Jettison your\u003Cbr\u003E\norbital stage and be sure to orient yourself tail-first.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, Control. See you on the other side.\u201D Hitting the necessary button on the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol panel, a smooth ka-thunk reverberated through the capsule as the trusty engine\u003Cbr\u003E\nand attached fuel tank floated away. Firing up the reaction wheels, Bilvin rotated the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfinal piece of Latona 1 into position for re-entry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe hated the pause between jettisoning the engine and feeling the re-entry burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimulations had prepared her for this, but the feeling of falling towards Kerbin\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurface at more than two kilometres per second unnerved her. Strangely enough, when\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe bright flames began enveloping the capsule and the g-forces pushed her back in her\u003Cbr\u003E\nseat, she felt more at ease. Now at least she was slowing down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhen do you think we\u2019ll be able to see it?\u201D asked Matdun, waving her flashlight\u003Cbr\u003E\naround. The sun had set during Bilvin\u2019s flight, and the grounded kerbonauts had\u003Cbr\u003E\nmoved outside shortly after Latona 1\u2019s orbital burn completed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAny minute now, she\u2019s just coming over the horizon,\u201D responded Gusbin, with a radio\u003Cbr\u003E\nheadset held up to his ear. \u201CIt sounds like the re-entry burn has just begun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere she is now!\u201D pointed Jenfry, as a bright star-like object rose slowly over the\u003Cbr\u003E\nhorizon. As it climbed higher in the sky, it quickly became apparent that this was no\u003Cbr\u003E\ncelestial body. A tail of fire reached out from the rear of the hypersonic projectile, and it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas quite the sight for the trio as it streaked overhead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s on target for a landing,\u201D Gusbin said, with palpable relief. \u201CWait a second; a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrosswind is blowing the capsule into the mountains!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy do you listen to that, Gus? It\u2019s just going to raise your blood pressure! She\u2019ll be\u003Cbr\u003E\nfine, come watch the capsule!\u201D urged Jenfry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford did not share Jenfry\u2019s placid attitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLatona 1, do you copy? Stand by for emergency parachute deployment.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C**###**rad***##no***###tact***###\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBlast! We\u2019re still getting too much interference! We\u2019d better hope the auto-deployment\u003Cbr\u003E\nmechanism works.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGround control, do you read me? The re-entry flames appear to have died out and\u2013MOTHER\u003Cbr\u003E\nOF HARV!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBilvin? Bilvin? Are you alright?\u201D Danford spoke, with more than a touch of worry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe parachute just deployed!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CApologies, we added the auto-deploy mechanism at the last moment. It registers when the air\u003Cbr\u003E\npressure was sufficient to deploy the parachute and deployed it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI thought the parachute was my job?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s mainly for emergencies, like when the capsule gets too close to the ground\u2014like now!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CToo close? I thought I was still several kilometres up.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLook out your window.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe mountains? I must be really off course!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJust by a few kilometres, don\u2019t worry. The recovery vessels are on their way.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger, hope you don\u2019t mind if I get out and stretch my legs while I wait; it was a tight fit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a negative, pressure levels are too low up there. You\u2019d have to be wearing a full pressure\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuit to be able to breathe.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll have to work on getting me one of those for next time, then.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCopy that Bilvin, see you shortly.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nOblivious to the drama unfolding via radio waves, Jenfry and Matdun both saw a tail of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncanvas and string grow to replace the one of fire and smoke and let out a cheer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood chute! Bilvin\u2019s coming home safely!\u201D said Matdun. Even Gusbin cracked a smile,\u003Cbr\u003E\nas the recovery helicopters thundered overhead, chasing the gently falling capsule.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford Kerman swallowed. It was several hours after Latona I\u2019s successful landing,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand he was currently present at yet another Advisory Council meeting, mainly to\u003Cbr\u003E\npresent the news on how that flight went. Unfortunately, the President was too busy to\u003Cbr\u003E\nattend this time, and without his leadership, the Advisors had a tendency to start\u003Cbr\u003E\nsquabbling and end up wasting hours of the meeting time. (It turned out that the sale of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncabbage was a particularly sore subject with the General). Fortunately, the news he had\u003Cbr\u003E\nto share was good, so this meeting ought to go smoothly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo as you can see from my report, we achieved the first kerballed flight in history,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeating the USKK, and did quite a lot of science along the way!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilfrod had a massive smile on his face. \u201CThe data you\u2019ve provided is exemplary; I have\u003Cbr\u003E\nplans for experiments for the next ten flights!\u201D General Geoffnard spoke up. \u201CSo I see,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford. I must say, I am impressed with what your team was able to accomplish. I\u003Cbr\u003E\nadmit that I was doubtful when I first saw the erm, facilities you were working out of,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut the results are exemplary!\u201D He leaned back, a gruff smile on his face.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIndeed, Danford, this is quite the accomplishment. However, I noted that you\u003Cbr\u003E\nsubmitted a request for an increase in your budget. We\u2019ve been over this, the money\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou\u2019ve been allotted is more than sufficient,\u201D Bilcas Kerman, Economics and\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommunications Minister stated, looking up from his papers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford frowned. \u201CWe wouldn\u2019t have to work out of Jenfry\u2019s house, nor utilize a\u003Cbr\u003E\ndecades-old military base if we had some more funding for the program. Based upon\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis mission, is there room within the CKFN\u2019s budget for an expansion of\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again! The CKFN is undergoing far too many projects\u003Cbr\u003E\nat the moment for something as trivial as this space program to be economically\u003Cbr\u003E\nworthwhile!\u201D Bilcas was generally fairly docile, but his temper tended to flare when the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN\u2019s budget was mentioned. \u201CThe money we\u2019ve given you ought to be sufficient.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBesides, you\u2019ve accomplished this much on the budget so far, just keep doing what you\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave been doing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford was momentarily struck dumb, searching madly for a reply that explained that\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey couldn\u2019t just keep sending one-kerbal pods into space forever, that expanding the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace program was the only logical next step, but unfortunately, Bilcas took his silence\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor agreement. \u201CVery well. That should be enough for today, meeting adjourned.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the other council members filed out, Danford remained in his seat and let out a sigh.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe launch went perfectly, it gathered important scientific data, as well as proved that\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey could match and exceed the USKK\u2019s achievements. So why was he not happy? It\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nbecause of Bilcas, he thought to himself. If we don\u2019t get more money, then the space program\u003Cbr\u003E\nwill stagnate. He resolved to talk to the kerbal and see if he could perhaps persuade him\u003Cbr\u003E\nto be a little less stingy in the future. Still, now was not the time to brood, it was time to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncelebrate! He jumped out of his chair and left the building.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: Administration Facility\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe next day\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CA kerbal? In space?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah was dumbfounded by the announcement. Bob was too, but over a different\u003Cbr\u003E\nissue.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe CKFN accomplished this before us? How is this possible? I thought they couldn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\neven get a probe past the upper atmosphere?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill Kerman, the kerbal who had delivered the news, expanded on it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFrom what I read, the issues they had with their probes drove them to desperation,\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunching a capsule aboard a beefed-up rocket. They build very nice ships, so I\u2019m not\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurprised it went off well.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve got to match their achievement. Do we have a rocket which could lift a kerbal?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponded Jeb, still half in shock.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTheoretically, we have a heavy-lift vehicle designed for a large probe, but it would\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake some time to be ready to fly. Besides, we can\u2019t just throw away our plans for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobe exploration program. You and I spent weeks hammering out that schedule!\u201D Bill\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb\u2019s right, Bill,\u201D Bob cut in. \u201CWe have to beat the CFKN at any cost. If they have the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapacity to launch payloads as heavy as a kerbal, they can launch weapons and drop\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem on our defenseless nation!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on, Bob, you\u2019ve been listening to too many \u2018Blue Threat\u2019 broadcasts again,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN is not a threat!\u201D exclaimed Bill, throwing his hands in the air.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou can never be sure,\u201D Bob folded his arms and leaned back in his chair. Jeb, on the\u003Cbr\u003E\nother hand, jumped out of his seat and began scribbling on a blackboard. \u201CMaybe if we\u003Cbr\u003E\nlengthen Aether\u2019s body, attach side boosters, we don\u2019t have to design a whole new\u003Cbr\u003E\ncraft\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re missing the point, Jeb. We\u2019ve got a warehouse of probe parts and scientific\u003Cbr\u003E\ninstruments designed for them. We had a schedule!\u201D Bill said, annoyed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe schedule be damned! We have a race to win! If they get kerbals to the Mun while\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe\u2019re still messing around with probes in orbit, we might as well not even be trying,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nshot back Jeb. \u201CIt might be challenging, but we\u2019ll discover so much along the way!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI still don\u2019t like it,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLet Jeb decide, Bill, he\u2019s the Director of the Space Program, after all,\u201D Bob pointed out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t like to pull rank on you guys, but we have to do something. We have the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnology, and the brains behind it. We can do this!\u201D said Jeb, still excitedly scribbling\u003Cbr\u003E\naway on the chalkboard.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFine. You\u2019re right, we won\u2019t develop much new tech in Low Kerbin Orbit. But I still\u003Cbr\u003E\ndon\u2019t feel right about this. Aether 7 was pushing the limits of the engineers\u2019 capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow on Kerbin will they build a bigger version?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it, Bill. You\u2019re the one who keeps telling Gene how the crews are\u003Cbr\u003E\nbetter than he gives them credit for.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMaybe you\u2019re right. We\u2019ll have to keep an eye on them though; we can\u2019t have any\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore incidents like Danbro dropping those decouplers again. This includes during\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch, too! I don\u2019t like the number of our sounding rockets that exploded mid-flight!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh relax, Bill. We\u2019ll sort it out. Besides, it was only the first couple of ships that\u003Cbr\u003E\nexploded, we fixed that issue for the last batch. Alright, I\u2019ll inform the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, let\u2019s start\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuilding a rocket!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill caught Bob\u2019s arm as he was leaving the room. Jeb had already rushed off to\u003Cbr\u003E\nWerhner von Kerman\u2019s lab, his arms full of rocket sketches.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow did you find out about the CKFN\u2019s difficulty with probes? Last I heard, it was\u003Cbr\u003E\nstill classified, both by our government and theirs. They don\u2019t even release the full\u003Cbr\u003E\ndetails of their launches to their citizens, for devs\u2019 sake!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, well gee, I was told about it, because I\u2019m, you know, part of the space program,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nOutside of Jeb\u2019s presence, Bob became a much timider kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t think you understand exactly how secret this is. The number of hoops I had to\u003Cbr\u003E\njump through to discover it was staggering. The USKK government is keeping their\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge of the CKFN space program very, very highly classified. Now, I don\u2019t know\u003Cbr\u003E\nif you overheard this while Jeb and I were talking or something, but you\u2019ve got to be\u003Cbr\u003E\ncareful. There\u2019s no telling what might happen to you if you\u2019re discovered with\u003Cbr\u003E\nknowledge beyond your position. I think you\u2019re a good kerbal, and have been a real\u003Cbr\u003E\nhelp to the space program so far, so don\u2019t go trying to hear things that aren\u2019t meant for\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou. Got it?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CY-y-yes sir.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGreat. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201D Bill left, leaving Bob standing in the middle of the room.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, as Bill turned away, Bob\u2019s expression changed from a look of fear to one of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsmug superiority. After the older kerbal walked out the door, Bob let out a low chuckle,\u003Cbr\u003E\na slow smile spreading over his face.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCHAPTER III:\u003Cbr\u003E\nGROWING PAINS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCKFN: Capital City, Danford Kerman\u2019s favourite supermarket\u003Cbr\u003E\nSix Months Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Danford Kerman walked out of the supermarket, his thoughts were light and\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarefree, reflected by the casual smile he wore as he carried his bag of groceries. That\u003Cbr\u003E\nchanged to a frown of confusion, quickly to a wide-eyed moment of terror as he spotted\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe large semicircle of reporters and television cameras arrayed around the exit of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nstore. Less than a second passed before he was swarmed with reporters shouting\u003Cbr\u003E\nquestions, cameras flashing, and cameramen sticking their equipment in awkward\u003Cbr\u003E\nplaces. As Danford was slowly engulfed by a growing pile of kerbals, a newscaster\u003Cbr\u003E\nappeared in the foreground, and began speaking.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWelcome back to Firesvar News. In the recent turn of events following the declassification of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN Space Program, the previously little-known leader of the program, Danford Kerman, has\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen propelled into the spotlight. We have yet to find out what his plans are in response to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecent USKK manned missions,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, the broadcast cut back to the studio, where a well-dressed kerbal began\u003Cbr\u003E\nnarrating.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMerely three weeks after the launch of Latona I, the USKK launched a kerbal of their own into\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit, presumably aboard a modified version of their Aether 7 launch vehicle. While our space\u003Cbr\u003E\nprogram did strike back, launching Jenfry Kerman aboard Latona II, within the past three weeks\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere have been no less than two kerballed launches from the USKK. Not only that, the rival\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace program has expanded their base of operations, renovating their Space Centre, as well as\u003Cbr\u003E\nconstructing additional launch sites across their country. Now, with the declassification of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace program, we can finally ask the Director of Operations himself the question which has been\u003Cbr\u003E\non everyone\u2019s minds: What does his program plan for a response? When will the CKFN see a\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket launch? We now return to our reporter on the street, to see if Danford is available for\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the chaos on the street had not abated much. The news cameras still showed\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford struggling through the raging tide of newscasters. It seemed like every news\u003Cbr\u003E\nchannel in the CKFN was here in this tiny grocery store\u2019s parking lot. Fortunately, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nFiresvar News reporter was more acrobatic than most in the industry, vaulting over a\u003Cbr\u003E\npair of independent studios attempting to get a wide angle of Danford, who were then\u003Cbr\u003E\nbowled over as the Firesvar cameraman pushed through to follow.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanford! Danford! Can you comment on the USKK\u2019s recent launches? Can you state when\u003Cbr\u003E\nand how your program will respond? What are your plans for future exploration? Who will be\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe next kerbal in space?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford managed to shrug off these questions, and as a gap in the wall of newscasters\u003Cbr\u003E\nopened up in front of him, he made a mad dash to his car, still clutching his battered\u003Cbr\u003E\nbag of groceries. Reaching his vehicle, he wasted no time in getting in, even as the\u003Cbr\u003E\nreporters banged on the sides like creatures from a horror film. Even as he drove away,\u003Cbr\u003E\nseveral reporters tried to chase him on foot.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that their story had escaped, the reporters began gathering up their equipment,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand the view switched back to the studio, where the reporter began speculating on\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford\u2019s refusal to comment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurning off the TV screen, the three present members of the Advisory Council leaned\u003Cbr\u003E\nback in their chairs and started chatting among themselves, mostly about the newscast\u003Cbr\u003E\nand this turn of events. However, within a matter of minutes they were interrupted by\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe door to their room being kicked in.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBAM\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford Kerman stood there, his hair a mess, clothing rumpled and torn, and his\u003Cbr\u003E\nbattered bag of groceries still clutched in his left hand. He had eyes for only one kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the room, Bilcas Kerman. Without even a pause for breath, he began shouting as he\u003Cbr\u003E\nstalked over to the Communications Minister.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COnly one kerbal on Kerbin could possibly declassify the program and have the gall to\u003Cbr\u003E\nneglect to tell me. Why did you do this, Bilcas? Why? You know I don\u2019t like this sort of\u003Cbr\u003E\npublic attention, in fact half the reason I agreed to take this job was because it was\u003Cbr\u003E\nclassified! I\u2019ve got a job to do, I can\u2019t constantly be giving interviews, or have the media\u003Cbr\u003E\nfollowing me around all the time! Do you know how hard it was to find a store which\u003Cbr\u003E\nsold my favourite snacks? THEY WERE ON SALE, BILCAS. ON SALE.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford continued this rant for an impressively long time without drawing breath (he\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas part of choir in high school), but eventually he needed to pause, otherwise risk\u003Cbr\u003E\npassing out. Bilcas took full advantage of this momentary respite to respond. \u201CTake it\u003Cbr\u003E\neasy Danford. Declassifying the entire space program was unexpected, I know, but it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas costing us a fair amount of money to keep secret, and honestly, your rockets aren\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch different than the USKK\u2019s. Besides, they share details of their space program with\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir citizens and its worked out fine for them so far.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut the media\u2026Bilcas, you just painted a target on my head. They\u2019re bloodthirsty;\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019re all going to want interviews, guest appearances, answering every little question\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey care to ask\u2013I don\u2019t have time for that, I\u2019m trying to run a space program!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral Geoffnard, who until now had been sitting in stunned silence at Danford\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ntirade, spoke up. \u201CDo what I do, just give \u2018em a couple of good interviews, then just\u003Cbr\u003E\nsend a subordinate out to answer any further questions they have. They generally are\u003Cbr\u003E\npretty happy with that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas continued. \u201CThe General speaks the truth, Danford. And while the increased\u003Cbr\u003E\nmedia coverage may not be the easiest thing to live with, it should increase inspire\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbals to support their country, increasing national pride, as well as popular opinion\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout the space program, once you show them your lovely pictures!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford, recognizing that Bilcas was not backing down, sank into a chair, burying his\u003Cbr\u003E\nhead in his hands. \u201CTell me the truth, Bilcas. Did you do this just to spite me? And\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhere\u2019s the President? I\u2019d like to get his take on this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat an absurd accusation, Danford! Everything I do, is for the good of the people of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN!\u201D responded Bilcas haughtily, but his eyes spoke a message much different\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan his words. \u201CThe President is away in West Jhazi, apparently there is a bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nof\u2026concern regarding the recent cabbage legislation. Not to worry, I already spoke\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith him about the declassification and he\u2019s all for it. Anyway, the budget has a\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurplus, since we\u2019re no longer keeping the program under wraps. I might be able to add\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat to your salary\u2014it would make you a very wealthy kerbal.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo this is Bilcas\u2019 game, thought Danford. Trying to bribe me into submission. He was having\u003Cbr\u003E\nnone of that. \u201CNo Bilcas. Add the surplus to the space program\u2019s budget. The rockets\u003Cbr\u003E\nneed the money a lot more than I do.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHeh. Maybe that will finally be enough for the program to start making progress.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately for Bilcas, this was exactly the wrong thing to say. Danford erupted in\u003Cbr\u003E\nrage again. \u201CProgress? You want to see progress?\u201D he shouted, leaping from his chair,\u003Cbr\u003E\nstartling the General and Bilfrod (who had been sitting in terrified silence ever since\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford had stormed in). \u201CSchedule a press conference, at the Space Facility. I\u2019m going\u003Cbr\u003E\nto show you progress, more progress than you\u2019ve ever seen!\u201D Danford stormed out of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe room, as sudden as he had entered, closing the door violently behind him.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSLAM\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn hour and a half later, Danford watched reporters swarm to the Space Facility like\u003Cbr\u003E\nchildren to an ice cream truck. He marvelled at the fact that there appeared to be even\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore than had been at the grocery store. While he most definitely disliked the kerbal,\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas certainly knew how to get things done.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the crowd gathered, Danford led them into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. While small in size compared\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the USKK\u2019s, it was still larger than most buildings in the CKFN, and more than\u003Cbr\u003E\nsufficient to build the Aether line of rockets. A pair of technicians\u2019 eyes widened at the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsheer number of kerbals approaching, and they quickly scuttled away. Danford had\u003Cbr\u003E\nfirmly told the reporters that he would not be answering any questions until they had\u003Cbr\u003E\nreached their destination, which made the journey mercifully quiet, if a bit awkward. At\u003Cbr\u003E\nlast, they arrived at the main chamber of the building, where all the rockets were\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesigned, built, and tested.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngineers, scientists, technicians, and ground control staff were everywhere within this\u003Cbr\u003E\nmassive room. Some were building what looked like the lower half of a rocket, others\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere testing responses of aerodynamic fins, still more were assembling a large rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\nengine, some were cutting away at sheet metal, and at least six kerbals were napping, in\u003Cbr\u003E\nspecifically-chosen noise-free positions. The room almost seemed to characterize chaos\u003Cbr\u003E\nitself, but as Danford\u2019s group entered, the various hammering, sawing, machining, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nsnoring gradually came to a halt. Silence filled the great room, as the space program\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nstaff stared at the CKFN\u2019s entire news industry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClearing his throat, Danford spoke. \u201CGreetings all. I trust you\u2019ve had plenty of time to\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeculate about the future of the CKFN\u2019s space program, and as to what our response to\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe recent USKK launches will be. I\u2019m here to throw all that speculation away, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nshow you our plan for yourselves.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, he gestured to the largest knot of staff in the centre of the room. They stood\u003Cbr\u003E\nback, revealing the project they had been working on, a small capsule, roughly the size\u003Cbr\u003E\nof a minivan.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe reporters seemed almost taken aback as they all rushed to take pictures and video\u003Cbr\u003E\nof this spacecraft. Evidently, none of them had expected Danford to actually have\u003Cbr\u003E\nanything in response to the USKK.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne reporter asked Danford a question, much less pointed than the ones that he had\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen receiving recently. \u201CDanford, can you tell us exactly what we\u2019re looking at here?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat is this spacecraft you\u2019ve been working on?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis here is the next logical step in space exploration. Our first two flights of Aether\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere certainly productive and yielded a great deal of science and information, but we\u003Cbr\u003E\nran into difficulty when communicating with the pilot, and having him or her perform\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe experiments. With this two-kerbal design, we should be able to include a kerbonaut\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith scientific training to do experiments, while the pilot flies the spacecraft.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIncredible! And how long will this stay in space for?\u201D asked another kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve dramatically increased the life support functionality on this version of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft,\u201D responded Danford. \u201CShe should be able to remain in space for about a\u003Cbr\u003E\nweek, with both kerbals living comfortably on board. It is unlikely that we\u2019ll ever need\u003Cbr\u003E\nto perform a mission of that length, but it is good to have the ability to last that long.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy now, the reporters had gotten over their initial shock at seeing the spacecraft, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere beginning to bombard Danford with questions again. \u201CWill your current rockets\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe able to lift the capsule?\u201D \u201CWhat is the expected range of the spacecraft?\u201D \u201CWhat do\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou plan to accomplish with it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe capsule will be heavier than the Aether spacecraft, this much is certain. However,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe have extended the body of the rocket used to lift that ship, as well as added more\u003Cbr\u003E\npower to the engines. This will allow us to easily lift the spacecraft into Kerbin orbit,\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing higher than any spacecraft has ever gone before. It possesses an integrated\u003Cbr\u003E\npropulsion system, which runs off four smaller engines, rather than the single LV-909\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe were using on the Aether spacecraft. This allows us to retain the engines upon re-\u003Cbr\u003E\nentry, giving us the ability to prevent the capsule from being blown off-course on\u003Cbr\u003E\nlanding, like the Aether was, on both occasions it flew.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou mentioned advanced life support. What steps have you taken to avoid its systems\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeing fried by the same radiation that messes with your probes?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Danford grimaced. Evidently, Bilcas had declassified all of the space program\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nreports. Fortunately, he had an answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSince kerbals tend to be vulnerable to radiation too, we have thoroughly rad-proofed\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe entire spacecraft. This allowed us to place our most advanced computers onboard,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich lets us perform even more data collection and analysis while on-orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditionally, it helps our pilot out, as attempting to gauge angular velocity by using a\u003Cbr\u003E\nsextant is apparently quite difficult. (the crowd chuckled at this) We intend to use this\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft as a stepping stone on the eventual journey to reach the Mun, by researching\u003Cbr\u003E\nand testing the technology and hardware required to make that journey.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe assembly of reporters broke into applause, their questions momentarily forgotten,\u003Cbr\u003E\nor rendered obsolete by this new announcement of the CKFN Space Program\u2019s target:\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mun!\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the reporter from Firesvar News had one last query. Stepping forward, they\u003Cbr\u003E\nasked Danford, \u201CAnd what is the name of this spacecraft?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford answered simply. \u201CCaelus.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter this speech, the media dispersed. Their questions were answered, and they all\u003Cbr\u003E\nwished to return to their respective studios so that they could broadcast the news to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nentire CKFN.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sat in his office, utterly exhausted. He had attempted eating one of the apples\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe\u2019d purchased earlier in the day, but found it to be bruised all over. Still, he had\u003Cbr\u003E\naccomplished something he\u2019d previously thought impossible: sating the media\u2019s desire\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor information.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReading a report on the reception of this surprise broadcast from the Space Facility,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford realized that the people of the CKFN supported the space program as much as,\u003Cbr\u003E\nor even more so than the USKK\u2019s population. He\u2019d already seen interviews of random\u003Cbr\u003E\ncitizens expressing their approval of the Caelus spacecraft, as well as his policy towards\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe exploration of space so far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe Bilcas was right, but not in the way he intended. Danford mused, watching the sun\u003Cbr\u003E\nset. The people do need an ideal to look up to, but that ideal isn\u2019t a faceless government telling\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem what they should believe, but perhaps it needs to be a vision for exploration, a call to\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiscover what lies beyond our tiny planet. Maybe this space program can inspire the people of\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin to do great things.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: Jebediah Kerman\u2019s Personal Retreat\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwenty Minutes Earlier\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah jogged towards his plane. Being the Director of an entire Space Program sure\u003Cbr\u003E\ndid have its perks, a private jet was only one of them. This launch facility had been\u003Cbr\u003E\nconstructed as a backup to the main Space Centre while renovations were underway.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that they were complete and main operations had been moved back south, Jeb had\u003Cbr\u003E\ndecided to make this base his own special getaway, where he could plan the future of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Space Program, meet with important bigwigs, and most importantly, get some\u003Cbr\u003E\nflying in once in a while.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the moment, he was indeed indulging in the latter, as the launch of the USKK\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nnewest kerballed mission was about to commence and he needed to get down to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Centre quickly!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nClimbing the ladder, Jeb gave a thumbs-up to the ground crew. As the cockpit glass slid\u003Cbr\u003E\nshut over his head, he powered on the instruments and began the pre-flight checklist.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the jet engine spooled up, he pulled on his helmet. This was always his favourite\u003Cbr\u003E\npart of the launch; the vibration of the plane gently increased in frequency, whispering\u003Cbr\u003E\nto him of the journey ahead.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlight! To think that barely a year ago, kerbals could only stare up at the sky wistfully,\u003Cbr\u003E\ndreaming of touching the Mun and the stars. He marvelled at the ability of the scientists\u003Cbr\u003E\nand engineers that had made this all possible, not to mention the others. The entire\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Program would have been nothing but a tiny government-run sideshow (much\u003Cbr\u003E\nlike the CKFN\u2019s) if the large corporations of the USKK hadn\u2019t pooled their resources\u003Cbr\u003E\nand funded his dream.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA crackle in his earpiece brought him out of his reverie.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou ready to fly, Jeb?\u201D asked the ground controller.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, Tower. All systems are green, and engines are spooled up,\u201D he responded.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon receiving clearance to head out, Jeb disengaged the brakes, taxied down the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrunway, and took off into the clear blue skies.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBig J to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-1, Big J to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-1, do you read me, over?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHi Jeb.\u201D The tired voice of the ever-suffering Gene came over Jeb\u2019s headset.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb? Who is this Jeb? On the radio, you have to refer to me as \u2018Big J\u2019, remember?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nreplied Jeb, trying to get a rise out of the kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, sure. \u2018Big J\u2019, what\u2019s your status?\u201D Gene responded, somehow pronouncing the\u003Cbr\u003E\nquotation marks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo glad you asked, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-1, I\u2019m flying high and fast, it\u2019s a beautiful day for a launch!\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow\u2019s Jorfred doing?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, I can put you through to him personally.\u201D Some static came over the radio, \u201CThere you are,\u003Cbr\u003E\nFred.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CD-director Jebediah! It is a pleasure to speak with y-you, sir!\u201D The kerbonaut sounded quite\u003Cbr\u003E\nnervous, though whether for the launch or simply the opportunity to talk with the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace program\u2019s Director, Jeb wasn\u2019t sure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s no need to call me \u2018sir\u2019, just call me Jeb. How are you feeling?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m doing well, sir Jeb! I\u2019m all set to head into space. It\u2019s going to be my first time up there, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019m worried I\u2019m not going to do a good job!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, Jorfred. You\u2019ll do fine. Gene, what\u2019s the status on the rocket?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s ready to launch, the countdown stands at ten minutes, and we\u2019re ready to proceed as soon\u003Cbr\u003E\nas you get here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPerfect. Keep me updated.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nFive minutes out from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, Jeb\u2019s earpiece crackled to life again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s up Gene?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026you\u2019re going to want to see this, boss.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSee what? What\u2019s going on? Is Kaether IV still operational?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, the rocket\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s\u2026well\u2026we picked up a CKFN news broadcast.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo? They\u2019re always covering useless stuff. Like cabbage sales! Who cares about\u003Cbr\u003E\ncabbages anyway?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis time it\u2019s different. They\u2019re covering footage from their space program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTheir space program? But it\u2019s a secret government project. The only way they could be\u003Cbr\u003E\ncovering footage is if\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey declassified the program. Somebody in the CKFN wants attention.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll say. They must be getting desperate for funding. So what\u2019s the subject?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure. Right now the Director of their space program is leading the news crews into their\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHeh, he\u2019s probably trying to pass off whatever collection of junk they\u2019re working on as\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir next rocket!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHa-ha, judging by the state of that place, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re too far off! Wait, they\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nfocusing on some sort of capsule\u2026what\u2019s this?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGene?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt can\u2019t be\u2026oh good SQUAD it is. They\u2019re working on a spacecraft- - -that can carry two\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbals!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? Two kerbals?\u201D Jeb sat back in his seat, letting the full enormity of this piece of\u003Cbr\u003E\nnews wash over him. Having a second kerbal on a mission would enable tremendous\u003Cbr\u003E\nnew opportunities for missions. The second pair of hands could operate experiments,\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake pictures, even pilot the spacecraft while the first kerbonaut was busy. The idea had\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen tossed around by his scientists and engineers, but no one had dared build such a\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesign, as the current generation of rockets was barely powerful enough to lift one\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGathering his wits, Jeb reactivated the comm. \u201CWhen are they expecting to launch?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWithin the month. What should we do, boss?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmmm, give me a minute, Gene.\u201D Jeb pondered his options. On one hand, he could\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch Jorfred right now, and claim a total of four kerballed missions to space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, launching a single pod right after the CKFN had announced their larger,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore advanced model smacked of ignorance and failure. On the other hand, he could\u003Cbr\u003E\nhold off launching until they had developed a two-kerbal capsule of their own, but that\u003Cbr\u003E\nmight take too much time. What to do?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBoss, the boys in Mission Control are getting anxious. They want to know how we\u2019ll proceed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Gene\u2019s voice entered his ear, Jeb dropped below the clouds, seeing the Space Centre\u003Cbr\u003E\ndirectly beneath him, with Kaether IV sitting on the launchpad, Jorfred secured away\u003Cbr\u003E\ninside.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking at the rocket, Jeb was struck with an idea. Coming to a decision, Jeb spoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re scrubbing the launch. Get Jorfred out of the ship, but don\u2019t dismantle it just\u003Cbr\u003E\nyet\u2026I have a plan.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo weeks later, things were as hectic as ever in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, as the countdown ticked\u003Cbr\u003E\nonce more towards launch. Gene Kerman strode through a knot of scientists inspecting\u003Cbr\u003E\ngauges and readouts plugged into the rocket, which had been wheeled back into the\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Approaching the Lead Engineer, Gene spoke up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanbro! How are the systems coming along? You said they\u2019d be done by this\u003Cbr\u003E\nmorning!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurning around, Danbro replied. \u201CNot a problem, bro. We\u2019re just having a bit of\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifficulty with the electric systems, the added pod draws too much power. Burmy here\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas suggesting we just add more batteries,\u201D he gestured to the kerbal to his immediate\u003Cbr\u003E\nright, whose suggestion evidently was popular, by the amount of nodding and thumbs\u003Cbr\u003E\nup given by the surrounding crowd.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo tell the truth, Gene neither knew nor cared how the rocket worked. It was his job to\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake sure they got into the sky, nothing more. So it was with feigned knowledge he\u003Cbr\u003E\nreplied: \u201CSure, sure, that would work well. Attach those batteries and make sure we are\u003Cbr\u003E\ngood to launch before 3. I want this ship in space before dark.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, bud!\u201D Danbro said with a smile. Turning back to his group of engineers, he\u003Cbr\u003E\nmotioned them into work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene continued along, looking up at the rocket. Fundamentally, it was not much\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifferent from its original model, the Kaether IV. While most of the systems hadn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nchanged, the most striking addition was the welding of an additional pod upside-down\u003Cbr\u003E\non top of the original. More changes were the boosters along the bottom of the ship,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich widened its base significantly. Spotting Bill, along with another couple engineers\u003Cbr\u003E\nnext to one of the boosters, Gene rushed over, checking his clipboard. It was Jebediah\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nidea to add larger, higher thrust boosters to the original Kaether rocket in order to lift\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe additional pod. These newly-designed \u2018Solid Rocket Boosters\u2019 suited his plans very\u003Cbr\u003E\nnicely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the status on the SRBs, Bill?\u201D Gene asked, feeling proud that he knew the\u003Cbr\u003E\nacronym for the boosters. Knowing the lingo for parts was very important for if he was\u003Cbr\u003E\nto appear knowledgeable about rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHi Gene. They\u2019re good to go, but Desdan here wants to add more struts to make sure\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019re properly secured to the rocket on liftoff. I say that the decouplers are more than\u003Cbr\u003E\nstrong enough, and besides, we\u2019re dumping them about ninety seconds into flight, so\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey won\u2019t have much time to vibrate loose. What\u2019s your opinion?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore policy choices! What did people think he was, a rocket scientist? \u201CUh, how long\u003Cbr\u003E\nwill attaching the struts take?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnywhere from two to six days. We don\u2019t have the necessary parts on hand, so we\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave to order them specially.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile Gene did not understand much about rockets, timetables were his forte. \u201CNope.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u2019s too much of a delay. We\u2019re already behind schedule enough as it is. Bill\u2019s right,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdan.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdan looked crestfallen, but Bill was thrilled. \u201CPerfect! Once Danbro finishes with the\u003Cbr\u003E\nelectrical systems, we should be ready to roll the rocket out to the launchpad!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven as he spoke, Danbro\u2019s posse advanced towards the rocket, with AAAA batteries\u003Cbr\u003E\nand what looked suspiciously like duct tape in hand.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree hours later, Gene wore a satisfied smile. From his usual position in Mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nControl, he noted that the rocket had been rolled out ahead of schedule, and all systems\u003Cbr\u003E\nchecked out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJorfred, Erdrin, what\u2019s your status?\u201D he asked, toggling the comms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that Control, we\u2019re strapped in and systems are reading good\u201D came the voice of\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdrin, the kerbal sitting in the lower pod.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent, all systems are go on this end, preparing to restart the countdown.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe big countdown timer at the front of the room restarted from its position at 5:00:00,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand it was at this moment when Jebediah walked into the room, still in his flight suit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe had evidently just returned from his private island.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo glad you could make the launch,\u201D said Gene, with perhaps more than just a touch\u003Cbr\u003E\nof sarcasm.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSorry!\u201D Jeb responded, with his usual enthusiasm. \u201CA couple of CEOs from our\u003Cbr\u003E\nsponsorship group wanted to talk. They were saying something about \u2018increasing\u003Cbr\u003E\npublic visibility\u2019 and \u2018profit margins\u2019, but it\u2019s not important right now. We\u2019ve got a\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket to launch!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat we do,\u201D said Gene, turning back to the staff in Mission Control. \u201CAlright people,\u003Cbr\u003E\ndouble and triple-check those systems! We\u2019re now at three minutes to launch!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nJorfred switched on his internal communicator and radioed his partner.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSay, Erdrin, how are you doing?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood, I\u2019m excited to go back to space! How about you? You sound nervous.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026nope, I\u2019m just excited too!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJorfred quickly turned off the comm. To tell the truth, he was nervous, but didn\u2019t want\u003Cbr\u003E\nto reveal it to his partner, or Harv forbid, the Ground Control team. They might take\u003Cbr\u003E\nhim off this mission! He\u2019d already been denied that chance once before, and he was\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing to space today, yessiree. However, sitting in the upper capsule was not much fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince Erdrin scored lower than he in the centrifuge, he\u2019d be riding upside-down the\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhole way up, and thus taking more negative g forces.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u2019d asked around, questioning kerbals who had also experienced negative g\u2019s what it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas like. Unfortunately, the experiences were universally negative. One kerbal had\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplained in excruciating detail the discomfort you felt as you were dragged out of your\u003Cbr\u003E\nseat, the straps digging into you as if an invisible hand was attempting to pluck you\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom your capsule. And Jorfred would have to endure this for the whole way up!\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlready he was getting sore from sitting upside-down in the 1 g of Kerbin\u2019s gravity. He\u003Cbr\u003E\ncouldn\u2019t imagine what the launch would be like. As the radio informed them that one\u003Cbr\u003E\nminute remained on the countdown, he began cursing the engineers and scientists who\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad decided to place the pod this way. \u2018Increased protection upon re-entry,\u2019 they had\u003Cbr\u003E\nsaid. \u2018It just looks nicer,\u2019 they said (Indeed, Danbro had commented at length on the\u003Cbr\u003E\nimportance of a good hourglass figure). Jorfred knew that if they\u2019d taken extra time to\u003Cbr\u003E\nrefit the interior so that he was sitting right-side-up, it would have resulted in the CKFN\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunching their twin-kerbal pod first, and that certainly couldn\u2019t be allowed. Though it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas quite difficult to feel very patriotic when sitting upside-down in a tiny capsule,\u003Cbr\u003E\nstraps digging into one\u2019s chest.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen came the crackle of the radio Jorfred dreaded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTwenty seconds until launch\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, at least he was going to space. From the stories the others told, as well as the\u003Cbr\u003E\npictures they brought back, it ought to be incredible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFifteen\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, he wished he was at least facing the right way up, though in zero-g he wouldn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave to worry about that, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTen. All systems nominal\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was glad that he didn\u2019t have to worry about piloting the ship, Erdrin was taking\u003Cbr\u003E\nover that job since she\u2019d had more experience flying rockets. She\u2019d actually been in orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwice in the last two months, and was the natural choice for piloting an as-of-yet\u003Cbr\u003E\nuntested rocket. All he had to do was grin and bear it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFive\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFour\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThree\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJorfred squeezed his eyes shut.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTwo\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COne\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis world erupted into one of noise, vibration, and pain. The shaking alone was nearly\u003Cbr\u003E\nunbearable, it caused his headset to start vibrating its way around his helmet. Not that\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe paid much attention to what was being said over it; the deep bass rumble from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket engines combined with the endless shaking served to drown out all other noise.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut this all paled in comparison to the sheer pressure being applied to his back. Forget\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe invisible hand, this felt like a hydraulic ram forcing him forwards in his seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOpening his eyes did not improve the situation. The interior of the capsule was a blur;\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe vibrations of the main engine prevented him from focusing on any one point inside\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis eyes feeling like they were about to escape his skull certainly did not help his\u003Cbr\u003E\nvision. More worryingly, though, Jorfred began seeing black spots encroach upon his\u003Cbr\u003E\nfield of view. His vision slowly darkened, as it became more and more difficult to draw\u003Cbr\u003E\nbreath. The straps keeping him in his seats were like twin brands burning across his\u003Cbr\u003E\nchest, but even that pain began to dull as his vision faded. His last thoughts as he\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrifted away were worries about whether he\u2019d ever get to see Kerbin from space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nJorfred was floating in the ocean. No wind, no waves, just bobbing along gently, so\u003Cbr\u003E\ngently. Save for the occasional squawk of an annoying seabird in his ear, that is. As his\u003Cbr\u003E\nmind slowly began to come back to reality, he realized that he was in fact not doing the\u003Cbr\u003E\nbackfloat on a sunny Kerbin afternoon, but instead in a cramped, dark capsule,\u003Cbr\u003E\nhovering above his seat. Wait\u2026where were his straps? In a daze, he fumbled around,\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly to find that one was still looped over his shoulder, but the other had snapped\u003Cbr\u003E\ncleanly away from where it joined with the capsule. Lousy engineers, he grumbled to\u003Cbr\u003E\nhimself. Now that he was more awake, he did a quick once-over of himself. He was still\u003Cbr\u003E\nclad within his flight suit, rated for only high-altitude flight, not the hard vacuum on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe other side of his capsule\u2019s walls. While the suit looked fine, his body did not feel\u003Cbr\u003E\nwell at all. He ached all over, and his eyes wouldn\u2019t focus right. He had a killer\u003Cbr\u003E\nheadache, to match the two pains down his front where the straps had been. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nwouldn\u2019t be surprised if he found himself sporting bruises for a very long time after\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe\u2019d landed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking through the window, he spotted the planet Kerbin. He\u2019d seen the pictures, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey always lacked a certain\u2026something. The yellow-spotted dark blue curve outside\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis window was magnificent, made more so by being the only home he, and indeed\u003Cbr\u003E\nevery other kerbal throughout history had ever known. Despite knowing that pictures\u003Cbr\u003E\nwouldn\u2019t fully capture the sight of the planet, he began searching for his camera\u2026only\u003Cbr\u003E\nto be met with a stabbing pain in his side. He\u2019d only been given a basic first aid course\u003Cbr\u003E\nat the Kerbonaut Training Centre, but he knew enough to self-diagnose a broken rib.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGreat. Just great, he thought to himself. But before he could get to patching himself up,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe calls of his partner reached him over his headset, the \u2018annoying seabird\u2019 of earlier.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCalling all frequencies, this is Erdrin Kerman aboard the Uranus I. My crewmate is not\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponding, and am out of contact with my ground station. Repeat, this is\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CErdrin, don\u2019t worry! I\u2019m fine!\u201D reassured Jorfred, slightly hoarsely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThank Squad you\u2019re alright! You\u2019ve only been out for about ten minutes, but I didn\u2019t realize it\u003Cbr\u003E\nuntil we had passed out of range of Ground Control. I don\u2019t blame you for passing out though;\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat takeoff was much rougher than usual!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, other than a few bruises and a headache, I survived!\u201D Jorfred purposely\u003Cbr\u003E\nneglected to mention his other injuries, just in case she and Control decided to end the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission early. He was going to tough this mission out! Who knew when he\u2019d get\u003Cbr\u003E\nanother shot at this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s good to hear. Anyway, we should be about fifteen minutes away from passing back over\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK territory, we should be able to get a signal then. Did you receive much of a briefing of\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat we\u2019re supposed to be doing up here? I think somebody stuck a thermometer or something on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe side.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNursing his side, Jorfred tried to recall. He\u2019d been too excited to pay much attention at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe time. \u201CUh\u2026not that I can remember, no. I think this mission was planned just to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeat the CKFN\u2019s launch. It\u2019s pretty much the Kaether V with an extra capsule thrown on\u003Cbr\u003E\ntop. I\u2019m glad they decided to change the name though.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CReally? I liked how they added a \u2018k\u2019 to the front of the Aether\u2019s name, it was a clever\u003Cbr\u003E\ntouch; it showed that it\u2019s a kerballed version of the Aether probe!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTrue, but now it seems people are starting to add \u2018k\u2019s to every single word out there. I even saw\u003Cbr\u003E\nan ad for \u2018kerbowling\u2019 the other day!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, if it keeps people interested in the Space Program, I don\u2019t mind. At least we don\u2019t have to\u003Cbr\u003E\nresort to press conferences like the CKFN did!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI agree, that looked like a madhouse.\u201D Jorfred realized they were passing over that\u003Cbr\u003E\nvery nation right now. Despite being over one hundred kilometres away, he still felt\u003Cbr\u003E\nuncomfortable talking about it, fearing those newskerbals may be listening in. \u201CI\u003Cbr\u003E\nwonder if\u2013ow!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn Jorfred\u2019s efforts to look for his first aid kit, he had inadvertently and very painfully\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiscovered that he had also damaged his left knee in some way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong, Fred?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CErr\u2026nothing. Just banged my head on the side of the capsule.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWow, you\u2019re out of your straps already? I didn\u2019t even unbuckle until my second mission\u2013I was\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoo scared.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHeh\u2026it was sort of a spur of the moment thing, y\u2019know?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTotally, being out of your seat is amazing. You can\u2019t manoeuvre much in these capsules, but it\u003Cbr\u003E\nfeels like flying!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026It\u2014it sure does,\u201D Jorfred certainly did not feel like he was flying. He\u2019d braced\u003Cbr\u003E\nhimself in his seat to prevent any aggravation of his injuries. Fortunately, the rest of him\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas undamaged, his vision had improved, and even his headache was starting to fade.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe did see the truth in Erdrin\u2019s words, though. Up here, far above the clouds, above the\u003Cbr\u003E\npetty squabbling of nations, one felt truly free. He gazed at the lights of cities below,\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrying to imagine each individual kerbal going about his or her daily life. Did they even\u003Cbr\u003E\npay attention to the skies above? Did they see the stars through the clouds, or even dare\u003Cbr\u003E\nto dream of visiting them one day? Based on his past experiences, he estimated that the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmajority did not, but there were a certain few who put all logic aside and looked up\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith a passion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJorfred had always been one of those few kerbals, and look where he was now! The\u003Cbr\u003E\njourney had certainly been hard, long, and painful (most especially so recently), but it\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad most certainly been worth it. As the Space Centre came back into range of their\u003Cbr\u003E\nantenna and communication began in earnest again, he gazed out the window one more\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime and stared at the endless vista of stars.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCKFN: Facility for Space Research\u003Cbr\u003E\nFive hours later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford Kerman wandered through the halls of the space facility. He was still in shock\u003Cbr\u003E\nat the speed at which the USKK managed to get a two kerballed spacecraft launched.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Caelus was still at least a couple of weeks away from launching! By C7\u2019s beard, how\u003Cbr\u003E\ndid they get a ship together that quickly? He would have to push the engineers extra\u003Cbr\u003E\nhard to get their capsule ready for launch. Maybe they could cut a few corners on\u003Cbr\u003E\nproduction, or reduce the number of unmanned tests. After all, the rockets launched so\u003Cbr\u003E\nfar were very well-built, and maybe the extensive testing was just slowing the program\u003Cbr\u003E\ndown? He\u2019d have to talk to his engineers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs luck would have it, as he walked by the break room, Danford saw a bunch of\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers sitting around, watching TV and drinking coffee. He was about to speak up\u003Cbr\u003E\nand let them know of his decision, then he saw what they were watching. He\u2019d seen the\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch of the USKK\u2019s rocket earlier, and realized he was now looking at the landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus I had evidently orbited for a few hours before re-entering.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nComing closer, he overheard what the engineers were saying to one another.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMe? I\u2019m surprised the ship even got up there in the first place. Using SRBs on a\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerballed launch? It\u2019s insane! Unless you\u2019re really clever, your thrust to weight ratio is\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing to be all wonky.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYep, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E leads straight to the g-forces on the pilots. Judging by how fast that thing\u003Cbr\u003E\nwent up, I\u2019d say they experienced about ten at max Q.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTen gees? No way, they couldn\u2019t have pulled more than seven.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI recorded the footage then measured the rocket\u2019s acceleration. It definitely hit over\u003Cbr\u003E\none hundred metres per second per second.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDilbrett, only you would record our rival\u2019s rocket takeoff footage, then measure the\u003Cbr\u003E\nscreen to figure out its acceleration profile.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, I was curious! Besides, you know what they say about \u2018knowing thine enemy\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\nand all that\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CQuiet you two! The capsule just landed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPff, they didn\u2019t even position the parachutes correctly. Look, the whole thing just fell\u003Cbr\u003E\nover!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd look at that weld! It looks like they just strapped another capsule and SRBs to\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir original \u2018Kaether\u2019 design. Amateurs.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExplains how they managed to launch so quickly.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m more concerned for the kerbal inside. I mean, surely they didn\u2019t just weld a stock\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule on, upside-down, to their original design?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe camera zoomed in on the spacecraft, and one could very clearly see that the kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\ninside was inverted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, I\u2019ll be\u2026\u201D said the engineer who had just spoke, in astonishment. The other\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers began talking quickly among themselves.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHas anyone even thought of doing an upside-down launch?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNever, the negative gee forces would be too much, and that\u2019s with a standard launch\u003Cbr\u003E\nvehicle.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMinus ten gees\u2026ouch.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, that kerbal\u2019s never going to fly again.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile the screen showed that both hatches had opened on the capsule, only one of the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwo kerbals had emerged. The upper kerbonaut still remained inside the capsule. The\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecovery team\u2019s expressions shifted from smiles at the safe return of the spacecraft to\u003Cbr\u003E\nconcern, as they swarmed around the kerbal, lifting him out of the capsule and onto a\u003Cbr\u003E\nstretcher. The news camera appeared to be too far from the landed capsule to see much\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore of their actions. A hush fell over the CKFN engineers as they watched.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe lead engineer, Dilbrett Kerman, spotted Danford, and made his way over to him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanford! It\u2019s good to see you! I was actually going to head on over to your office with\u003Cbr\u003E\nmy opinions on the Uranus! To make a long story short, the USKK\u2019s rocket quality is\u003Cbr\u003E\ncertainly not improving.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford was shocked. \u201CWhat? They\u2019ve launched nearly double the amount of missions\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe\u2019ve managed to! And in case you didn\u2019t notice, they just beat us at our own game!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh ah ah, I said quality, not quantity, and that makes all the difference. To be frank,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe USKK builds terrible rockets, and this one is no exception.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt looks pretty capable to me\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFine. Relatively terrible is a better way to describe it. Basically, while their rockets do\u003Cbr\u003E\nwork, they just don\u2019t have the engineering skill to get them working well. To be fair,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis hasn\u2019t mattered so far; the current rockets are pretty much glorified fireworks. But\u003Cbr\u003E\nas the rockets edge into Project Jupiter-sized vessels, I guarantee to you that things like\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoday are going to go wrong.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI told you, the Advisory Council will never approve Project Jupiter. It\u2019s best to just\u003Cbr\u003E\nforget about it for now.\u201D Despite his dismissive words, Danford was interested what\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett was saying.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, yes, but my point still stands. We can\u2019t keep launching these small ships into\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit. Besides, the USKK is still having issues. You may not have bothered to check, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nI listened to the communications from the capsule, and there were a number of other\u003Cbr\u003E\nthings going wrong with the spacecraft.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLike wha\u2014wait a minute. Only the USKK ground control can listen to those\u003Cbr\u003E\nbroadcasts. How in Harv\u2019s name did you manage that?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf the ship\u2019s passing overhead and you know what frequency band to listen at, it\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrivial. But that\u2019s not important right now. The kerbonauts on board reported flickering\u003Cbr\u003E\nlights, fuses repeatedly blowing, that sort of thing. While it may seem like a minor issue,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand was dismissed as such by USKK ground control, there is actually a more insidious\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplanation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Dilbrett held up a black-and-white photo, showing the interior of the USKK\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, where a team of engineers was installing a pair of batteries. Danford wasn\u2019t even\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing to ask where his Head Engineer had obtained this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs you can see, they\u2019re just sticking these batteries inside without any real care to\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhere they go. I know you\u2019re not an electrical engineer, but let me just say that doing\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat is bad. Really bad.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo their problem is that they stick batteries in places randomly?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTheir problem is that they have no idea what they\u2019re doing. One can very clearly see\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom their very first rockets, that they build something, launch it, see what went wrong,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthen fix that problem.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford was confused. \u201CHow is that a problem? It seems like it\u2019s a perfectly valid\u003Cbr\u003E\napproach.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIndeed, for small, inexpensive prototypes, like their initial sounding rockets. It\u2019s fast,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncheap, and gives concrete results. However, for larger ships, if you rely on your main\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesign to do your testing for you, let\u2019s just say you\u2019re going to have a bad time.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry Dilbrett. I see where you\u2019re coming from, but I don\u2019t understand how this\u003Cbr\u003E\nrelates to the CKFN. From what you\u2019re saying, the USKK is just going to have more\u003Cbr\u003E\nproblems like today. I can\u2019t do anything about that. Likewise, you seem to have all this\u003Cbr\u003E\nfigured out. Just keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing, it\u2019s been working well so far!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou have more power than you realize, Danford. You\u2019ve got the President\u2019s ear, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave made a major mark on this nation so far. But you have to realize that we are forced\u003Cbr\u003E\nto go where he tells us to. Rumour has it that the President wants to move up the first\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch of the Caelus because of what happened today. We\u2019re still two weeks off from\u003Cbr\u003E\nour first unmanned test; please do all you can to give us that time. If we\u2019re forced to\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch earlier, kerbals will die.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf his head engineer\u2019s earlier words hadn\u2019t convinced Danford, it was this frank\u003Cbr\u003E\nstatement, combined with the silent plea within Dilbrett\u2019s eyes, which won the kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nover.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll do my best, Brett. But you\u2019ve got to give me results.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Dilbrett\u2019s sombre expression changed to a broad smile.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, don\u2019t you worry sir. I\u2019ll give you the show of a lifetime.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: Kolus City General Hospital\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeveral Days Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe large brick walls of the hospital loomed large over Bill. A nurse gave him directions\u003Cbr\u003E\nand he eventually found himself at room 426C. Opening the door, he felt a pang of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsympathy for the kerbal lying on the bed, bandages over his eyes. He spoke up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHi Jorfred, it\u2019s Bill here, from the Space Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Jorfred turned around in excitement, Bill was relieved to see that the kerbal turned\u003Cbr\u003E\neasily, and excitedly. Seeing the kerbal\u2019s smile told him far more than a thousand\u003Cbr\u003E\nmedical files could.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBill Kerman? Thank you so much for coming, sir; it\u2019s an honour to meet you!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s no trouble at all, I wanted to make sure you were alright. Jeb would have been here\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoo, but he\u2019s dealing with matters back at the Space Centre.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI only wish I could stand up and shake your hand, but the nurse says I shouldn\u2019t get\u003Cbr\u003E\nout of bed. I\u2019m still healing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAbout that\u2026how are your eyes? I\u2019d heard that you were\u2026\u201D Bill trailed off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry! I can still see. The doctors did good work; I\u2019ve just got these bandages on\u003Cbr\u003E\nmy eyes so I don\u2019t strain them. Nurse\u2019s orders.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m glad your optimism has survived intact. Listen, I\u2019m so sorry about the accident. An\u003Cbr\u003E\ninvestigation is underway at the Space Centre right now, and I can assure you that no\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore kerbals will be hurt like you. My only regret is that this had to happen to open\u003Cbr\u003E\neveryone\u2019s eyes to the danger of space travel.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t be sorry; this whole thing was my fault.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill was momentarily speechless. \u201CWhat?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m so sorry about all this. I shouldn\u2019t have gone on the mission\u2026I\u2026I was scared, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nthought I would be removed if I\u2019d admitted it. I really wanted to go to space\u2026a-and see\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CListen, Fred\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJorfred continued. \u201CAnd you know what? That view\u2026to see the curve of our planet\u2026it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas worth it, Bill. It was so, so worth it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill reached over and touched Jorfred\u2019s shoulder, words failing him. Then, the invalid\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal caught him by surprise.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBill, will I still be able to fly? I mean, my kneecap\u2019s busted, I punctured a lung, and my\u003Cbr\u003E\nvision will never really be the same.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill swallowed. This was the part he\u2019d been dreading. Having to tell this young, bright-\u003Cbr\u003E\neyed kerbal the news. (Well, Bill assumed he was bright-eyed at least, as the bandages\u003Cbr\u003E\nobscured that region of his face). In a small voice, Bill responded. \u201CNo. You\u2019d be\u003Cbr\u003E\nineligible on the knee alone.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThanks Bill. I-I guess I just wanted to hear it from you, rather than reading it on a\u003Cbr\u003E\nletter, or from some faceless government agent.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, Bill said nothing. What could he say?\u003Cbr\u003E\nRon and Don were overlooking the Space Centre grounds, discussing recent events.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, how about that investigation that\u2019s been making the rounds? I hear they already\u003Cbr\u003E\ngot to you. How was it? Any advice?\u201D asked Ron.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, that. What a pain. It\u2019s sort of like a TV interview. They\u2019ve got a camera and an\u003Cbr\u003E\ninterviewer asking me all these questions about our training and the rockets. Just\u003Cbr\u003E\nanswer all their questions and they should be satisfied. I hear they\u2019re more interested in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe engineers, anyway.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWho\u2019s running this show, again? Seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few\u003Cbr\u003E\nquestions. Don\u2019t they already know what the problem was, anyway?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI think it\u2019s Director Jeb. Apparently he wants to make sure that there are no more\u003Cbr\u003E\nproblems, though I hear Bill was pretty instrumental in getting that pushed through.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u2019s really serious about making sure this space program is safe.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAfter poor Jorfred, who\u2019d blame him? How is Fred, by the way?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CApparently he\u2019s doing really well! He should be out of the hospital by the end of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nweek.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s great news! Is he going to fly the next mission?\u201D Ron asked excitedly; he\u2019d been\u003Cbr\u003E\nworried about\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo. I talked to Bill, and he\u2019s unfit to fly. I think it\u2019s his leg, or maybe his vision. I don\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nknow.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? But what about the Space Program? How will we keep up with only three\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbonauts?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CApparently Jeb wants to hire more kerbals. We\u2019ve been needing more, with the two\u003Cbr\u003E\nseats in the Uranus. Gotta fill out those backup crews!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI guess you\u2019re right. Still, it\u2019s going to be weird with all of those new faces; I don\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nthink I\u2019ll be able to keep track of them all!\u201D Ron was terrible with names.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, there won\u2019t be more than three or four newbies that\u2019ll make it through\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe selection process. You\u2019ll make do.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, what can you tell us about the Uranus I mission, Mr. Danbro?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe investigation team sat in a small room with the USKK Lead Engineer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, not all that much, really. It was a normal build, launch, etc. I guess the only\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifference is that we added some more batteries to the main capsule\u2026oh, and those\u003Cbr\u003E\nSRBs we attached at the last minute.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe head investigator leaned forward, removing his glasses as he did so.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThose SRBs\u2026 Can you tell me why they were attached so late in development?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, we were thinking that the extra pod on top would be too heavy for the liquid\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines to lift. So we strapped on a couple of SRBs and she took off like a charm!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m looking at the flight data here, and apparently the rocket sustained accelerations of\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore than 10 g on ascent.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanbro let out a low whistle. \u201CGotta love SRBs.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat kerbal in the hospital would beg to differ. Now, I\u2019m certainly no rocket scientist,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut I\u2019d think that adding more engines would be something one would do with plenty\u003Cbr\u003E\nof notice, correct?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, I talked about it with the crew, they said \u2018sure\u2019, so we stuck them on. No\u003Cbr\u003E\npaperwork necessary!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWait\u2026Are you telling me you don\u2019t fill out the required requisition forms?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHa ha, no way! I usually get an intern to do \u2018em. Or I just don\u2019t complete \u2018em at all!\u003Cbr\u003E\nNobody minds, as long as the rockets get up there!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, the interviewer paused, speechless.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh\u2026Well\u2026I see. You may go, Danbro.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre you sure? Don\u2019t you have more questions? I can tell you more about the rocket!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo, no. That\u2019s quite alright, thank you.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a slightly confused look, Danbro left the room.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFire Danbro.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe head investigator had only one recommendation for Jeb. Sighing, the Director\u003Cbr\u003E\nlooked up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd why would I do that?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe kerbal\u2019s interview itself is nothing. I interviewed countless engineers and staff, all\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhom report his behaviour as reckless, dangerous, and more often than not, plain\u003Cbr\u003E\nstupid!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou can\u2019t deny that he gets results. He\u2019s made all sorts of things fly!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExactly. He\u2019s made things fly which shouldn\u2019t fly, and when they decide not to fly\u003Cbr\u003E\nagain, the kerbals riding in them are going to have a very bad day.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s my Lead Engineer! Who will replace him?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, pick any engineer. Even an intern could do a better job than he\u2019s been\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd if I decide to ignore your recommendation?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThen the Board of Directors will revoke your funding. In their words: \u2018Dead kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\naren\u2019t profitable.\u2019\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb sat back. \u201CWhat if I appointed an assistant to Danbro? Promoted an intern, or\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomeone who knew what they were doing, to add a voice of reason to his work? Would\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Board be satisfied?\u201D The investigator paused. \u201CI\u2019ll discuss it with them. Why are you\u003Cbr\u003E\nso insistent on keeping this kerbal, Jeb?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s just say that I learned a long time ago that you can\u2019t always do things by the\u003Cbr\u003E\nbook, and having someone who\u2019s not afraid to think outside the box on your side is\u003Cbr\u003E\ninvaluable.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA low chuckle came from the investigator\u2019s throat. \u201CAnd we don\u2019t have enough of that\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith you?\u201D He sighed. \u201CVery well. I\u2019ll talk to the Board, and see what we can do.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGoodnight Jeb.\u201D And he was gone, leaving Jeb alone in his office.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nA day later, Jebediah was speaking to the media, who had been anxious for news ever\u003Cbr\u003E\nsince hearing of the investigation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026so ultimately due to a variety of factors, the regrettable Uranus I incident was\u003Cbr\u003E\nallowed to happen. Fortunately, we have identified the issues, and are working to\u003Cbr\u003E\nrectify them. Unfortunately, the head of our engineering department was responsible\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor several of these errors.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Danbro stood up and walked over to the microphone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat can I say? I\u2019m only kerbal!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis prompted quite the chuckle from the assembled media. Jeb continued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs he has proven to be a substantial asset to the Space Program thus far, I am\u003Cbr\u003E\nappointing an assistant to Danbro to assist him with the complicated decisions he must\u003Cbr\u003E\nface every day, as well as provide an additional error checking step in the process our\u003Cbr\u003E\nrockets undergo before launch. Doodbro, would you please stand up?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe kerbal sitting next to Danbro rose.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2018sup?\u201D he said, joining Jeb at the microphone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAhem\u2026yes, as you can see, Doodbro is a prime example of the knowledgeable and\u003Cbr\u003E\nprofessional staff we at the USKK Space Centre employ on a daily basis.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, dude, is this gonna last much longer? I gotta split in about ten.\u201D Doodbro asked\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb, seemingly forgetting that the microphone was still on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs I said, knowledgeable and professional,\u201D Jeb said, his smile becoming a bit fixed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately, Danbro was there to break the awkward moment. A joke, and describing\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe USKK\u2019s next few missions sated the media\u2019s appetite soon enough, and the crowd\u003Cbr\u003E\nshortly dispersed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut which none of the three kerbals realized was that something had been born that\u003Cbr\u003E\nday. Kerbals, like humans, are brought together by shared experiences, and nearly\u003Cbr\u003E\neveryone in the USKK had been watching that broadcast. As such, everyone had seen\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanbro respond with: \u2018I\u2019m only kerbal,\u2019 and slowly that quote turned itself into a new\u003Cbr\u003E\ncatchphrase. Whenever a kerbal screwed up, they\u2019d utter those words, and all around\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem would share a laugh. As time went on, the phrase shortened itself (as these things\u003Cbr\u003E\ndo), until it became only one word: kerbal. Used as an adjective, one would call\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomething \u2018kerbal\u2019 if it worked, but not as originally intended, and more times than not,\u003Cbr\u003E\nunsafely. Did your tailpipe come off your car? Why bother with a mechanic, just duct\u003Cbr\u003E\ntape it back on! That\u2019s such a kerbal solution! Even the space program got caught up in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe craze; their solutions (like just strapping more boosters to a rocket) were\u003Cbr\u003E\npopularized as being \u2018kerbal\u2019 by the general public, bringing even more attention to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprogram.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN: Facility for Space Research\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch Day, One Week Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe massive door of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E slowly ground open. Despite not having been used in\u003Cbr\u003E\nseveral months, it rose without complaint, and the fading daylight shone onto Caelus I,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompleted at last. There had been some renovations since then; the Space Facility was\u003Cbr\u003E\nstarting to become a major transport hub. No longer were trucks sufficient to carry the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket parts and fuel from where they were manufactured, but rather newly-built\u003Cbr\u003E\naircraft had been pressed into service; some designs could carry ten times as much and\u003Cbr\u003E\ntravel twenty times as fast when compared to their wheeled rivals. As such, the Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nFacility looked more like an Air Facility, with all the runways and service equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, even with the fancy new additions, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E remained untouched, which the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers grumbled about daily. The rockets they we rebuilding were starting to reach\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe facility\u2019s size constraints, and the fabrication equipment on hand was beginning to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbecome inadequate for the task. Simply adding onto the existing buildings wouldn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nsolve all Danford\u2019s problems though; as the mission planners whined about how far\u003Cbr\u003E\nnorth they were. The USKK\u2019s Space Centre was located directly on the equator,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeaning landing back at the Centre was a breeze, and missions to locations beyond\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E required no extra delta-v expenditure, unlike the CKFN\u2019s situation. Danford put\u003Cbr\u003E\nall that out of his mind though, and focused more upon the issues facing him today.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMuch to the media\u2019s disappointment, Danford had made the decision to launch this\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket without kerbals on board. The engineers had said that more work was needed to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe certain that the life support systems were stable. Caelus was sporadically exhibiting a\u003Cbr\u003E\nglitch which had resulted in the premature retirement of half a dozen crash test\u003Cbr\u003E\ndummies during testing. Since fixing that issue would take at least an additional week,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford had elected to launch this vessel unkerballed. The engineers still struggled to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuild probes which lasted long outside the atmosphere, however. While probe\u003Cbr\u003E\nshielding had progressed far enough to not fizzle out as soon as it left the atmosphere,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe engineers had now hit a power supply issue. The multiple redundant systems and\u003Cbr\u003E\nfail safes made the probe stable, but chewed through power at a disturbing rate. Since\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe spacecraft had no way of recharging its onboard batteries once it had left the\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunchpad, it would promptly shut down approximately two hours after launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to this, Caelus I\u2019s mission was simple: launch into a highly eccentric orbit, gather\u003Cbr\u003E\ndata on the deep space environment, then re-enter at high speeds. Ground control\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould stay in contact with the spacecraft for most of the way until apoapsis, at which\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime the onboard batteries would run dry, cutting off contact. While some other\u003Cbr\u003E\nmanagers would declare the mission over at this point, Danford\u2019s crazy idea was to\u003Cbr\u003E\nplace the spacecraft on a specific trajectory, then properly orient it so that the ship\u003Cbr\u003E\nwouldn\u2019t burn up in the atmosphere and survive to a soft landing somewhere in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN. This would provide a lot of excellent extra data about the hazards and\u003Cbr\u003E\nphenomena of deep space, and whether the heat shield was sufficiently tough enough\u003Cbr\u003E\nto survive a high-speed re-entry. If the CKFN ever hoped to reach the Mun, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers needed a lot more data on both of these hazards.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford spoke into his headset. \u201CAlright people, we\u2019re at tee minus one hour to launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGet Caelus onto the pad and fueled up!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ground crew performed their duties flawlessly, and one hour later, Caelus I blasted\u003Cbr\u003E\noff right on schedule.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re getting good readings from the rocket, everything is nominal,\u201D one of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nGround Control techs said.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReally, with the amount of test-fires and simulations, this rocket was incredibly reliable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford would have bet good money on it reaching orbit without a single mishap (and\u003Cbr\u003E\napparently some engineers had been trolling the local bars, doing exactly that)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was the CKFN\u2019s first rocket with more than one engine on the lower stage. As\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaelus was found to be too heavy for a single LV-T30 to lift, the decision was made to\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch the capsule with two engines, rather than follow the USKK\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E path. While\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis extra engine took a bit more work to engineer into the design, its performance more\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan made up for it. Caelus I flew easily.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, that extra engine did use up more fuel, and the rocket found itself dropping\u003Cbr\u003E\nits lower stage earlier than ships with lighter payloads. There was talk about extending\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis lower stage, but the rocket\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was perfect with this amount of weight, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nnobody wanted to screw that up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe decision had been made to hold off on extending the tank until this mission had\u003Cbr\u003E\nflown. So far, the results were promising, as the upper stage easily carried Caelus above\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe clouds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, that stage burned out as well, and the time came for Caelus to separate from its\u003Cbr\u003E\nlifter. The Ground Control team waited with baited breath as they sent the command;\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhile Caelus had performed well on the ground, its engines had never before been used\u003Cbr\u003E\non an actual rocket. Anything could happen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately, that \u2018anything\u2019 was that the engines fired a short burst to move it away\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the upper stage, then shut down to coast to apoapsis, exactly as planned. The sigh\u003Cbr\u003E\nof relief which ran through the control room was quite audible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBased on the telemetry data, Caelus had left the atmosphere and arrived at apoapsis.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile conventional kerballed missions only require a short burst from the spacecraft\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines to put it into a stable orbit, this mission was neither conventional nor kerballed,\u003Cbr\u003E\nso the throttle was increased to full, and the spacecraft raised its orbit to roughly 1 000\u003Cbr\u003E\nkilometres above the surface of Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter the spacecraft had confirmed that the burn was complete, the job of Ground\u003Cbr\u003E\nControl was to settle in and wait for the ship to arrive.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen Caelus reached apoapsis three hours later, Danford wasn\u2019t even in the control\u003Cbr\u003E\nroom, as another matter had come up. His presence wasn\u2019t required though; the job he\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad given the technicians was simple: gather the data Caelus collected, make sure it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwouldn\u2019t hit the ocean nor the USKK when it came down, then orient it retrograde.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHardly even rocket science.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so the spacecraft responded to their commands, first transmitting the data from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nscientific instruments its capsules were filled with, then pointing along a specific vector,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand using the last of its fuel in a course correction which would put it in the middle of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN. Finally, it rotated so that the heat shield would impact the atmosphere\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore the comparatively more fragile command pods.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, the techs sat back and watched as the onboard battery, taxed by the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntransmissions and commands, finally gave up the ghost and died. All contact with\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaelus had been lost. Now, all they could do was wait.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTen minutes later, a recovery helicopter flew through the night. Danford was aboard,\u003Cbr\u003E\nalong with a full team of technicians. According to telemetry data, Caelus had re-entered\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe atmosphere not long ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPilot! Do you have the capsule on your radar?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CY-yes sir Mr. Danford, we\u2019re heading right towards it!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre you sure? We just ended up chasing a flock of pigeons for longer than I care to\u003Cbr\u003E\nadmit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CN\u2014no sir, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the capsule\u2026I\u2019ve locked onto its transponder signal.\u201D He\u003Cbr\u003E\npointed at the screen, showing a steadily falling dot. Just as Danford looked over at the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndisplay, the dot chose that moment to disappear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMother of Harv\u2026 We have to get there. Now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, Director, sir. We\u2019re not more than two kilometres out.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe helicopter came to a gentle landing, perching on the on the ground like a large,\u003Cbr\u003E\noddly-shaped bird. Danford immediately leaped out, fearing the worst. Climbing\u003Cbr\u003E\ntowards the capsule, he let out a gasp. Caelus sat in the middle of a blackened crater in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe ground. The capsule itself had been breached; it\u2019s internal components lay\u003Cbr\u003E\neverywhere. Taking a closer look, Danford wasn\u2019t surprised that they\u2019d lost contact;\u003Cbr\u003E\nmost of the instruments had been wrecked by the impact.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s a pity,\u201D one of the technicians remarked, drawing level with Danford. \u201CWe could\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave pulled so much more data if the thing actually landed in one piece.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t give up yet, the instruments have already transmitted their data, so you can\u003Cbr\u003E\naccess that, plus I\u2019m sure you want to see how the materials of the spacecraft reacted to\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe deep space environment,\u201D Danford reassured him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s true. But why did it crash like that? I thought the plan was to soft-land it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CA very good question. See if you can find the other two parachutes. I only see one that\u003Cbr\u003E\nopened, but *Caelus *had three.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThree? The ship that launched only had one.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? How did we expect to soft-land it then?\u201D Danford exclaimed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSomebody said that we\u2019d get more delta-v out of the thing if we left off the side-\u003Cbr\u003E\nmounted parachutes, and instead just slowed the capsule at the last second with the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDidn\u2019t they realize that the ship would be uncontrollable by then? Why didn\u2019t anyone\u003Cbr\u003E\ntell me?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know sir; all I know was that\u2019s how it happened.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed. \u201CI suppose we can\u2019t do anything about that problem now. Though I\u2019ll\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave a very serious talk to the engineers when we get back. Let\u2019s work on salvaging\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat we can of the ship.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd indeed, after gathering the parts together and analysing the data, the mission was\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeclared to be a success. Improvements were immediately made to Caelus to take into\u003Cbr\u003E\naccount the deep-space environment and the extra parachutes were reattached, as extra\u003Cbr\u003E\ninsurance when landing. On top of all that, the engineers got an excellent lesson on\u003Cbr\u003E\ncommunication, via a three-hour rant delivered by Danford describing the many\u003Cbr\u003E\nhorrible things that would happen if they deviated from the design specifications again\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithout letting him know. All in all, the CKFN space program was in good shape.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow they just had to do it all over again, this time with kerbals on-board.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: Administration Facility\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo Days Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill walked into Jebediah\u2019s plush, wood-trimmed office and sat down with Bob in front\u003Cbr\u003E\nof Jeb\u2019s desk. Once again, they were to discuss the state of the USKK space program.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRecalling the intel given to him by the USKK government, he started the meeting off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, it finally happened. The CKFN launched Caelus.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, this was hardly top-secret information. Anyone with a halfway decent\u003Cbr\u003E\nantenna could pickup the television signals coming from across the water. Really, the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeclassification of the CKFN\u2019s space program had accomplished more for the covert\u003Cbr\u003E\noperations department of the USKK than ten years\u2019 worth of surveillance could have.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWho did they send up?\u201D asked Jebediah, who, like always, had not read the intel\u003Cbr\u003E\nahead of time. As such, he wasted everyone\u2019s time asking questions they ought to have\u003Cbr\u003E\nknown from the start. Bill sighed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs the report stated, this mission was an unkerballed launch. Apparently due to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nuntested nature of the capsule and new launcher, the risk was considered too high to\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch a kerbal.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob spoke up. \u201CIt\u2019s a good thing they waited; it gives us more time to launch more\u003Cbr\u003E\nships. We had a mission planned for next week, right?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely,\u201D Jeb stated. \u201CThe rocket is built, and the capsule is nearly ready! I\u2019d say\u003Cbr\u003E\nanother three or four days of hard work, and we can launch Uranus II.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre you sure that we\u2019re ready to launch so soon after Uranus I?\u201D Bill cautioned,\u003Cbr\u003E\nalways the voice of reason. Somebody had to be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COf course! Danbro decided to scale back the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust, we\u2019ve flipped the capsule\u003Cbr\u003E\ninterior around, provided extra cushions for the pilots, what else is needed?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI just feel like we aren\u2019t giving the engineers enough time to perfect their designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey\u2019re already overworked as it is; we demand new rockets every few weeks.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Bob jumped in. \u201CNonsense, I was just down in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and they\u2019re really\u003Cbr\u003E\nstarting to hit their stride. Since we always ask for the same rocket, they simply build a\u003Cbr\u003E\nbunch of copies of the Uranus launcher, then tweak the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E thrust for the desired\u003Cbr\u003E\npayload,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CInteresting. Whose idea was this?\u201D Bill asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDoodbro\u2019s. Apparently he\u2019s quite the talented engineer. Excellent selection, Jeb.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor his credit, Jebediah did not display any external signs of uncertainty. However, Bill\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad known the kerbal for nearly twenty years now, and by watching Jeb\u2019s face\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarefully, he understood that Jeb was just as surprised as Bill was about Doodbro\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompetence. As Bill had correctly assumed when first watching the footage of\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoodbro\u2019s promotion, Jeb had just used the \u2018engineering assistant\u2019 story to confuse the\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoard, and make sure that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E would continue building rockets unabated, unlike\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe ghost town it would become if Danbro were to be fired.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s why I chose him,\u201D Jeb said with a smile.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob, who hadn\u2019t been with Jeb for as long, appeared satisfied with that explanation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurning his attention away from Jeb, Bob continued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow, the CFKN launched their unmanned version of Caelus (or simply Caelus I)\u003Cbr\u003E\nexactly forty-six hours ago. While the USKK still leads in terms of total launches, our\u003Cbr\u003E\nfirst next-gen spacecraft was a high-profile failure. While the mission itself completed\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuccessfully, we had an injured kerbal, an internal investigation slowing things down,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand the media reporting every story to come out of here that they can find!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, he pulled out a newspaper clipping from his pocket and slid it across the table.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill unfolded it. \u201C\u2018Space Centre Cafeteria Serves Subpar Snacks\u2019? Really?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CReally. All of these factors combined means that the public is no longer quite as\u003Cbr\u003E\nenthusiastic about the space program as before. Reduced public enthusiasm then means\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat the Board is unwilling to provide as many funds for the program in the future. As\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuch, we need to build public approval for the program again, and show the CKFN that\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe are better.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd how are we going to do that?\u201D asked Bill. This nationalistic space race satisfied\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe media, but he found that constantly trying to one-up your neighbour often\u003Cbr\u003E\ndistracted one\u2019s self from focusing on the project at hand and why you were even trying\u003Cbr\u003E\nto accomplish it in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI may have a couple ideas,\u201D said Jeb slowly. He picked up his desk phone. \u201CWerhner,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan you meet us in my office? What? No, you\u2019re\u2014 Yes, I\u2014 Okay, thanks. Yes. I said,\u003Cbr\u003E\nyes! \u2026 Just come on over here,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA couple minutes later, Werhner Von Kerman walked through the door. \u201CHellooo!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh Werhner, you\u2019ve arrived! Excellent. Now, can you tell Bill and Bob about the new\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnology you\u2019re developing?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, of course! Vell, you see, eet all started back vhen I first vatched ze CKFN\u003Cbr\u003E\nbroadcast. Zey discussed ze issue of power management in ze spacecraft. Zheir ships\u003Cbr\u003E\nuse batteries to stay acteeve. Now, batteries are very heavy, so I vas thinking ve could\u003Cbr\u003E\ngenerate our power in space, rather zan having to worry about carrying enough to last\u003Cbr\u003E\nall ze way through our mission.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGenerate power in space? You don\u2019t mean lugging a coal plant (or bac9 forbid, an\u003Cbr\u003E\natomic plant) up there?\u201D Bill was incredulous. \u201CYou realize that you\u2019d have to bring a\u003Cbr\u003E\nsupply of oxygen for the coal to even burn, right?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, yes, I know. Ze standart methods of generation do not work vell in space. Besides,\u003Cbr\u003E\nour rockets aren\u2019t powerful eenough yet!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026yet?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CErr\u2026I\u2019ve been vorking on some ozzer designs; I can show\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s keep on track Werhner,\u201D Jeb interrupted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRight, sorry! Vell, as I vas saying, ve don\u2019t have ze capacity to generate a lot of power\u003Cbr\u003E\neen space. Fortunately, ve don\u2019t need a lot of energy; ve just need to sustain eet for long\u003Cbr\u003E\nperiods of time. So I thought to myself, vhat on Kerbeen generates a good amount of\u003Cbr\u003E\npower, ees reliable, yet light, and vould vork in space?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill wasn\u2019t quite sure if it was a rhetorical question or not; Werhner\u2019s accent made it\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifficult to fully understand the kerbal\u2019s meaning. Fortunately, Werhner answered it\u003Cbr\u003E\nhimself, saving Bill from having to think up an entirely new method of power\u003Cbr\u003E\ngeneration.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSolar power! Ze sun alvays shines in space, and zhere is no clouds to block zem! Eet\u003Cbr\u003E\nees ein perfect system!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that Bill thought about it, solar power would be a very useful method of\u003Cbr\u003E\ngenerating power while in orbit. Panels were relatively light, cheap, yet could still\u003Cbr\u003E\nprovide enough power to control a probe core, or even a spacecraft\u2019s attitude control\u003Cbr\u003E\nsystems. Bob didn\u2019t seem completely convinced though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDo you have a model we can attach to a spacecraft? All the solar panels I\u2019ve seen in my\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime are much too large to fit on Uranus.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh yes! I do, een fact! I\u2019ve been vorking on a folding panel vhich vould easily fit on ze\u003Cbr\u003E\nside of ze spacecraft. And Bill, your idea of atomic energy ees close to vhat I have\u003Cbr\u003E\nplanned for my next deesign!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood Squad, you\u2019re not actually going to launch a reactor?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNoo, nooo, I vill use ze radioacteeve decay of certain elements to run a heat engine,\u003Cbr\u003E\ngenerating steady power even vhen the sun ees behind ze planet!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell. That certainly was a much better idea. Bill was impressed; he knew the stories of\u003Cbr\u003E\nhow smart Werhner was (he\u2019d single-handedly launched Kerbin into this rush for\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace), but seeing his ideas firsthand was incredible. The kerbal certainly knew his stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo what do you guys think?\u201D asked Jeb, who had clearly heard these ideas before.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t think of anything wrong with having power generation capabilities onboard\u003Cbr\u003E\nour next spacecraft; go ahead and install them on Uranus II,\u201D said Bob, who looked\u003Cbr\u003E\nimpressed with Werhner as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, all three kerbals looked at Bill, waiting for him to speak. He still wasn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompletely satisfied with the pace at which they were proceeding, but this new\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnology heartened him. Perhaps the ships could stay in space for longer, and do\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore research on the effects of space travel on a kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill smiled. \u201CLet\u2019s do this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nCFKN: Facility for Space Research\u003Cbr\u003E\nSix Weeks Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, at least they added magazines,\u201D commented Matdun dryly. Bilvin looked up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlong with the other kerbal, she was sitting in the small white room again, one step\u003Cbr\u003E\nremoved from finally entering her spacecraft after weeks of preparing for this mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, Matdun\u2019s words did not satisfy her. \u201CThey\u2019re all fifteen-year-old\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnical manuals on the finer points of spacecraft orientation! We didn\u2019t even have\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft back then! Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan of rocket science as much as\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe next kerbal, but seven hundred pages of spin rates and matrix transformations is not\u003Cbr\u003E\nmy idea of light reading material. When I get my hands on Danford\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou had better wait until after the launch. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been sleeping these last\u003Cbr\u003E\nfew days. He really wants this mission to go well.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, it can\u2019t go any worse than the Uranus I, eh?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun\u2019s unamused glare reminded Bilvin that there were indeed some lines that one\u003Cbr\u003E\nShould Not Cross.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAt least the kerbal was alright, but apparently he\u2019s left the USKK\u2019s space program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s left? That leaves them with only three kerbals. Are they going to hire more?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CApparently they already have. Just before Uranus III launched, they brought four new\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecruits into the program. It was glossed over at the time, given what happened during\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat flight, but I managed to find an article.\u201D Matdun pulled a newspaper from a pocket\u003Cbr\u003E\nin her flight suit and unfolded it. (Bilvin made a mental note to remember to pack a\u003Cbr\u003E\nnovel or something for next time) \u201CLet\u2019s see\u2026blah blah, fast-paced training, recruitment\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom several civilian rocketry clubs, oh! They\u2019ve got pictures.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesperate for some form of reading material that didn\u2019t involve endless lines of text,\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilvin leapt from her chair.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm, they look pretty competent. But I can\u2019t imagine that they have the same\u003Cbr\u003E\nexperience as us veteran kerbonauts, eh?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t call us veterans yet. This is only your second mission. The USKK definitely\u003Cbr\u003E\nhas the advantage in their rapid launch cycles.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, we make up for it for all our simulations. I\u2019m so used to that simulator now, I\u003Cbr\u003E\neven found a place to store my snacks!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun stared. \u201CThat was you?! Do you know how many simulations I\u2019ve had to abort\u003Cbr\u003E\nbecause wrappers kept falling out of the overhead compartments?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh, two?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEleven! How many snacks did you stuff in there? I told Danford to confiscate them\u003Cbr\u003E\nall.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on, don\u2019t be a narc; don\u2019t you ever get hungry during a long simulator\u003Cbr\u003E\nsession?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun\u2019s angry retort was cut short by Danford\u2019s disembodied voice. \u201CHow\u2019s it going in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere, you two? The rocket\u2019s nearly ready.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh, we had a slight disagreement, but uh\u2026 everything\u2019s perfectly all right now. We\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nfine. We\u2019re all fine here now, thank you. How are you?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI hope Dilbrett came through with the reading material; I told him to put his favourite\u003Cbr\u003E\nmagazines in there.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYep\u2026they\u2019re, ah, they\u2019re real page turners\u2026\u201D Bilvin responded while eying the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmassive books laying on the table.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnyways, what\u2019s the status on the rocket? ETA until boarding?\u201D Matdun asked,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmatter-of-factly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re just fueling it up now, so you should be able to board in about ten minutes.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that. We\u2019ll be ready.\u201D She turned off her microphone, then glared at Bilvin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright people, sound off. We\u2019ve got a tight launch window. There\u2019s a storm moving\u003Cbr\u003E\nin from the northwest, and I don\u2019t want to test the structural integrity of Caelus that\u003Cbr\u003E\nrigorously just yet.\u201D Danford strode through Mission Control, or at least what passed\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor it. There were a bunch of employee stations set up underneath the little antenna at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Space Facility.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCommunications, go\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCAPCOM, go\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSpacecraft systems, go\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so on, until the moment they\u2019d all been waiting for.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFive seconds until liftoff!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFour\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThree\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTwo, main engine start!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COne\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA low rumble engulfed the small room. Even though they\u2019d been doing this for a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncouple of years now, some techs still didn\u2019t make sure their coffee mugs were secure,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand some fell over the edges of tables, soaking laps with lukewarm caffeinated\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeverage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven though they had a perfect view of the rocket on the monitors, Danford preferred\u003Cbr\u003E\nto look out of the window. He\u2019d found that if he stood in a certain spot, he had an\u003Cbr\u003E\nexcellent view of the launchpad, and it made him look like he was standing where he\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould see all the techs and monitor their progress. Caelus II stood upon a column of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsmoke and steam as it reached for the heavens, a bright orange tongue of flame\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderneath. The sight always gave him pause. The fact that his group built that\u003Cbr\u003E\nmagnificent machine to travel beyond the clutches of Kerbin itself was remarkable. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas shortly brought back to reality by the chatter of ground control.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRocket has cleared the tower; we\u2019re reading perfect separation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAttitude holding steady, engines are performing nominally.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGee levels holding steady at 1.5\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re hitting max Q in twenty seconds, be advised.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBegin rollover program\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m getting an anomalous reading from one of the thermometers. Capsule, please\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfirm.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a negative, Thermo Sensor 2-1-b is reading normally. I will keep an eye on it, though.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun responded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve reached 10 km, begin gravity turn. Pitch over by 35 degrees, acknowledge.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilvin\u2019s cheery voice came through. \u201CRoger that, boss!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThrust curves looking nominal. Throttle down a touch to avoid losing too much delta-\u003Cbr\u003E\nv to the atmosphere.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C15 km altitude, pitch down another 20 degrees.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFirst stage nearing burnout, prep decoupler.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDecoupler primed.\u201D Matdun was as businesslike as ever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m reading a loss of thrust caused by burnout. Fire second stage.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFirst stage away, and second stage engine ignited on schedule\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIgnition confirmed. Throttle main engine up, you\u2019ve cleared the worst of the\u003Cbr\u003E\natmosphere.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford leaned back, satisfied. Another flawless launch. While plenty could still go\u003Cbr\u003E\nwrong, he felt a little better knowing that the rocket had made it to orbit. Now, the main\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission could begin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, Matdun,\u201D came the chirpy voice over the intercom. Matdun did not respond right\u003Cbr\u003E\naway, knowing what was coming.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMatdun\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMaaaatdun\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe could take it no longer. \u201CWHAT?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGot any snacks?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, I somehow managed to visit a store on Kerbin, buy some snacks, haul them all the\u003Cbr\u003E\nway up here, and not tell you about it in the five minutes since you last asked!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you do have snacks!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn disgust, Matdun turned off the internal intercom. She normally tolerated Bilvin and\u003Cbr\u003E\nher antics, but today\u2019s mission was eating into her stores of patience. This capsule\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould be farther from Kerbin than any kerbal from the CKFN had ever been. Of course,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey weren\u2019t breaking any records here. The USKK\u2019s Uranus II mission had already\u003Cbr\u003E\nachieved an apoapsis of 3000 kilometres, something Caelus couldn\u2019t even dare attempt\u003Cbr\u003E\nto match. Rather, the goal for this mission was to maintain a stable orbit at this altitude\u003Cbr\u003E\nand test the shielding and equipment outside the safety of Low Kerbin Orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe was glad that the kerbals had separate capsules, a holdover from the spacecraft\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaelus was a derived from. Otherwise Bilvin may have found herself undergoing an\u003Cbr\u003E\nExtra-Vehicular Activity, sans spacesuit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOtherwise, things had been going well, but the mission was not over yet, and they still\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad to return. Re-entry from these heights was no joke, while certainly less intense than\u003Cbr\u003E\na Munar return would be, it still could mean certain doom for those in the capsule if\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey didn\u2019t manage it correctly. Still, the view was nice. Matdun snapped a couple of\u003Cbr\u003E\npictures of the disk of Kerbin. Those Flat-Kerbin Society nitwits should be up here; the\u003Cbr\u003E\nevidence against their case was pretty damning.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe radio crackled into life. \u201CMatdun, we\u2019re coming back into radio communication. How are\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe readings looking?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re all looking nominal; the engineers did good work when building the capsule.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u2019re getting excellent data from the scientific experiments as well.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFantastic. If we continue getting results as good as this, we should be able to bring you back\u003Cbr\u003E\ndown after a couple more orbits.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent. Any further orders?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CActually, there was. Bilvin was asking if you could inspect the upper right-side compartment.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFor the last time! There are no snacks on my side of the spacecraft!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe slammed her fist down on the \u2018off\u2019 button violently, accidently jarring open the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompartment mentioned.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun sighed as a contingent of snacks floated by her face, ejected from their hidden\u003Cbr\u003E\nhome in the compartment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n*\u00A0 * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey Matdun\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat now?\u201D She replied through gritted teeth. The fires of re-entry were increasing, a\u003Cbr\u003E\ndull roar reverberating through the capsule. Bilvin had been mostly silent up to the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeorbit burn, but then she had begun pestering Matdun once again. It was Matdun\u2019s job\u003Cbr\u003E\nto guide the capsule into a safe landing on the Space Facility\u2019s grounds, and she didn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nwant to screw it up. This was the first time any capsule had attempted such a pin-point\u003Cbr\u003E\nlanding,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRemember how the first Caelus capsule landed? Don\u2019t do that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShut\u2026up\u2026\u201D The capsule hit a pocket of turbulence, starting to spin. Matdun hit the\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E override and corrected this spin. Only 30 000 metres to go\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe spin was back, Matdun\u2019s efforts weren\u2019t enough to arrest it entirely. Bilvin\u2019s voice\u003Cbr\u003E\nchirped through the internal intercom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, I can see my house from here!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow the kerbal remained so calm was a mystery to Matdun, who would have been\u003Cbr\u003E\nscreaming in terror if not for the concentration required to keep the rapidly descending\u003Cbr\u003E\ncraft on target. The plan was to make a soft landing on the rocket engines back at the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Facility, and this high in the atmosphere, even small changes to their attitude\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould result in missing the landing site by many kilometres. She didn\u2019t want a repeat\u003Cbr\u003E\nof Latona I, which Bilvin nearly smashed open on a mountainside.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBilvin, tell me our current trajectory.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIncredibly, the other kerbal sounded almost bored while reading back the numbers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun made a mental note to ask Danford to send Bilvin on the next long-duration\u003Cbr\u003E\nscience mission. Preferably past Minmus. Maybe to another planet. Perhaps the Sun?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis thought cheered her.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWHUMP\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat was a big shock. Re-entry was tricky, the smallest pockets of turbulence became\u003Cbr\u003E\nhuge problems when travelling at twice the speed of sound. She checked the readouts,\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrying to discern if any damage had been done to the spacecraft. She couldn\u2019t see\u003Cbr\u003E\nanything, and by the sounds of it, the ship was beginning to enter the lower\u003Cbr\u003E\natmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilvin\u2019s voice, finally sounding a bit perturbed, came through the intercom. \u201CUh, I\u2019ve got\u003Cbr\u003E\na bit of a problem here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m getting a \u2018system failure\u2019 warning light. It looks like one of our thrusters is acting up.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger, prepping parachutes for deployment.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, that\u2019s a negative, the auxiliary parachutes have been put out of commission as well. We\u2019ve\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly got the ventral chute remaining.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRemember what I was saying about the first Caelus?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, we all know how that turned out.\u201D Though her voice projected annoyance,\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun was actually terrified. Nobody had anticipated both a parachute and engine\u003Cbr\u003E\nfailure. She\u2019d trained for hours in landing on rockets and landing on parachutes (the\u003Cbr\u003E\nlatter was infinitely easier, by the way), but had never even considered having to land\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithout either. She wondered if they could bail out of the spacecraft right before impact\u003Cbr\u003E\nand hope the shockwave would slow them down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCan you transfer full attitude control to me? I have an idea.\u201D Bilvin\u2019s voice sounded more\u003Cbr\u003E\ndetermined than ever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? There\u2019s no way you can operate both systems at once!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTrust me.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnder most circumstances, Matdun would certainly have not trusted the young kerbal,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand just done the landing herself. However, in this case she didn\u2019t feel confident\u003Cbr\u003E\nenough to trust herself not to botch the landing. Besides, what\u2019s the worst that could\u003Cbr\u003E\nhappen? They were dead anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTransferring control. Don\u2019t screw this up, Bilvin\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun could just picture the cocky grin the kerbal gave her in response. \u201CWhat, me?\u003Cbr\u003E\nNever.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the controls in Bilvin\u2019s pod, Matdun now had nothing to do. She now understood\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe other kerbal\u2019s restlessness earlier. With no control of this falling metal pod, one did\u003Cbr\u003E\ntend to want to make sure everything went well. A sort of \u2018backseat piloting\u2019 if you will.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only thing left to do was watch the altimeter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt 700 metres above the ground, Bilvin deployed the parachute. Matdun watched it\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrail out behind the capsule, flutter in the wind, then finally deploy fully. This slowed\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe capsule down to about 15 metres per second, still too fast for a safe landing. Matdun\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuspected that the core command pods would survive such an impact, but she certainly\u003Cbr\u003E\ndid not want to put that suspicion to the test.\u003Cbr\u003E\n250 metres up, the engines fired up. Three of them at least. The fourth, as predicted,\u003Cbr\u003E\nsputtered once and with a sad ka-putt, died. What is Bilvin doing? She\u2019s obviously\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrying to use both the parachutes and the engines? What is Bilvin\u2019s plan?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, a horrible screech met Matdun\u2019s ears. She realized it was the reaction wheels.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were spinning at grossly overclocked speeds, providing just enough torque to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompensate for the missing engine. Obviously, one couldn\u2019t run the wheels at such\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeeds forever, and you\u2019d need to replace them after attempting such a maneuver, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor this landing, they could be spun up much faster than the manufacturer\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecommended speed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMiraculously, the plan worked. Despite only having access to three asymmetrically-\u003Cbr\u003E\nplaced engines, Bilvin managed to navigate the ship into a landing, only skidding\u003Cbr\u003E\nslightly upon touchdown as a reaction wheel failed at the last second.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun let out a breath she didn\u2019t realize she was holding, then peered through the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsmall window on the capsule. The first sight she saw was Director Danford, wide-eyed\u003Cbr\u003E\nand covered in feathers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe immediately opened the intercom channel to Bilvin. \u201CJust to be clear, we did land at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Space Facility, and not some sort of alternate dimension, correct?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Yes, why do you\u2014oh. Hi Director!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun got to work on opening her capsule door, and exited the vehicle. It appeared\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat Bilvin\u2019s skidding maneuver during the last few seconds of flight had put the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule much closer to the Facility\u2019s staff than originally planned. Hence, Danford\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ncloseness to the spacecraft, and surprise. That didn\u2019t explain the feathers though.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, closer inspection of Caelus certainly did. Judging by the remains, the capsule\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad struck a very unlucky bird during its rapid descent through the atmosphere. That\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould certainly explain the WHAM they\u2019d heard earlier. Feathers were all over the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule, and the impact point was right next to the failed engine, as well as the radial\u003Cbr\u003E\nparachute control system. Upon closer inspection, its species appeared to be some type\u003Cbr\u003E\nof balding eagle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTalk about a fowl landing!\u201D Jenfry punned, which elicited an icy glare from everyone\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithin earshot.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis moment did not last long though, as the team of technicians immediately swarmed\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe spacecraft, taking pictures, examining impact points, and chattering among\u003Cbr\u003E\nthemselves. They barely left enough room for Bilvin and Matdun to get clear.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the two kerbals had exited, Matdun turned to Bilvin. \u201CThanks for saving us.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd\u2026here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe handed Bilvin the snacks which she\u2019d discovered inside her side of the spacecraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilvin took them without comment. \u201CNo worries, it was the least I could do.\u201D Her eyes\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwinkled. \u201CI look forward to flying with you again!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford (now mostly feather-free) walked up. \u201CExcellent mission, you two! I\u2019m told\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat we got excellent data from this flight, despite the few quirks which developed. Get\u003Cbr\u003E\nback to the simulators, because we\u2019ve got more missions coming up!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSorry boss, but I\u2019ve got to take a shower and a nap first,\u201D Bilvin said. \u201CBut I\u2019ll be ready\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor launch in a couple of hours, don\u2019t you worry!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun estimated that her own nap would last a good deal longer than that, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nnevertheless greeted Danford with a smile before heading back to her quarters. It had\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen a very long day.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford had never seen the weekly engineers\u2019 meeting so busy. His lead engineer,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett had \u2018accidentally\u2019 let slip what today\u2019s topic would be, and as such it seemed\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat every engineer in the space program was here. In fact, he didn\u2019t recognize many\u003Cbr\u003E\nfaces; did they even work for the space program?\u003Cbr\u003E\nNevertheless, he took his seat at the head of the large conference table, Dilbrett on his\u003Cbr\u003E\nright.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood morning all. Now, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard, today\u2019s meeting is going to be a\u003Cbr\u003E\nvery special one.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe gathered kerbals all hung onto every word of his, some barely daring to breathe.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve launched test rockets, we\u2019ve launched kerbals, we\u2019ve seen what the conditions\u003Cbr\u003E\noutside our atmosphere are like. These have all been steps towards our ultimate goal:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Mun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this word, the unkerbinly silence vanished, filled with a dull roar as every kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nbegan talking with their neighbors about this news. Danford waited for the commotion\u003Cbr\u003E\nto die down, but after a couple minutes the volume had actually increased. So he gently\u003Cbr\u003E\ncleared his throat.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo one heard him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh-hem.\u201D He cleared it a little louder.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, no response, except perhaps the room got even noisier.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COkay everyone, settle down, let\u2019s get this meeting started.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe room was beginning to descend into chaos, as it seemed that every kerbal there had\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir own opinion on how the mission should be carried out; some had even begun\u003Cbr\u003E\nscribbling out trajectories and delta-v charts on chalkboards.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was wondering if shouting at them would even make a dent in the noise, when\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford felt a tap on his arm. The words Dilbrett was speaking were inaudible against\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe din, but the megaphone he held in his hand was very clear. Danford had grabbed it\u003Cbr\u003E\nand raised it to his mouth before even wondering why Dilbrett had brought one to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeeting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTHAT\u2019S ENOUGH. ALL OF YOU, SIT DOWN.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could hear a pin drop. That\u2019s better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CALRIGHT, NOW THAT\u2014whoops.\u201D He was still speaking through the megaphone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright, now that we\u2019ve discussed the target at length, let\u2019s start coming up with ideas\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor missions. I want to hear all of them\u2013but please. One at a time.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree hours later, Danford couldn\u2019t believe how many ideas had been submitted,\u003Cbr\u003E\nranging from extensively-researched missions with every metre per second of delta-v\u003Cbr\u003E\ncatalogued along the way, to one kerbal\u2019s suggestion of getting a \u2018really, really big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, I think we\u2019ve narrowed it down to three mission ideas. There\u2019s the Direct Ascent\u003Cbr\u003E\nroute, the Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous, and the Munar Orbit Rendezvous. Let\u2019s hear the\u003Cbr\u003E\npros and cons of each, again.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA heavyset kerbal stood up, about halfway down the table. \u201CFor simplicity, you can\u2019t go\u003Cbr\u003E\nwrong with Direct Ascent. Just one ship flies to the Mun, lands, then returns to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo complicated \u2018docking\u2019 required! I don\u2019t even think rendezvousing two ships in\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace is even possible, for Harv\u2019s sake.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett spoke up. \u201CHave you seen the size of the rocket which would have to lift that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be more than double the height of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E! Testing the first stage alone would\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake years.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright then, how about your pet project? Let\u2019s hear it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs I mentioned, the Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous is a very flexible mission plan, which\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan retain most, if not all of the simplicity of the Direct Ascent method, yet still be\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunched aboard smaller, more reasonable rockets. We launch our Munar lander aboard\u003Cbr\u003E\none rocket, then launch the transfer stage immediately afterwards. These two ships link\u003Cbr\u003E\nup in orbit, fly to the Mun, the lander flies down, does its stuff, then returns to Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\nusing the transfer stage!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe still haven\u2019t considered the Munar Orbit Rendezvous yet!\u201D A bespectacled kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nspoke up from the far end of the table. \u201CWe only have to launch one rocket, but the\u003Cbr\u003E\nlander and command module are separate ships, allowing us to use a far lighter lander\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan your other versions! In fact, I\u2019ve done the math and it comes out to use less fuel in\u003Cbr\u003E\ntotal than either of those two mission plans.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the size of that single rocket? While certainly not a Direct Ascent\u003Cbr\u003E\nmonstrosity, it\u2019s still larger than anything we have the capacity to build,\u201D Dilbrett\u003Cbr\u003E\ncountered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CKeep It Simple, Stupid!\u201D The first kerbal shot back rudely. \u201CDirect Ascent needs only\u003Cbr\u003E\none ship, and only one set of components too! Why on Kerbin would you need\u003Cbr\u003E\nduplicate life-support systems on the lander?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis went on for another two hours, and by the time they had decided on a result,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford was exhausted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs everyone done?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA host of sullen glares from two-thirds of the those present was his answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI think everyone\u2019s admitted it; Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous is the best option we have,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbased on the lifting technology available to us. Now, we need to figure out how to\u003Cbr\u003E\naccomplish such a mission.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the table burst into discussion once more, Danford smiled. They had just taken the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfirst step into a larger world. They were going to the Mun, at long last.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: UNN News Van\u003Cbr\u003E\nSix Months Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan Kerman, the finest newscaster in the USKK (at least in his studio\u2019s mind, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat\u2019s really all that matters), eyed a small, unkempt house.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre you sure this is the right place?\u201D his camerakerbal, who was doubling as his\u003Cbr\u003E\ndriver, asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is it,\u201D Erdan looked at the piece of paper upon which the address of that tiny\u003Cbr\u003E\nabode was scrawled. \u201CGet the gear, we\u2019re going in.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFirst of all, I\u2019d like to thank you for this interview, Desdin.\u201D Erdan said, as he settled\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto the chair he\u2019d been provided. Most of his interviews were conducted in the comfort\u003Cbr\u003E\nof Erdan\u2019s own studio, but Desdin Kerman had insisted on holding this one in his\u003Cbr\u003E\npersonal home. By the looks of the drawn blinds, clutter, and general dustiness, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nformer kerbonaut didn\u2019t look like he got many visitors. \u201CWith the upcoming launch of\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus X, it will be excellent to get your perspective on the space program. Not many\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbals have seen the inside of the program like yourself!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D Desdin replied, staring downwards at his hands. \u201CI think it\u2019s finally time to get\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis off my chest.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan pressed on. \u201CYou\u2019ve certainly been through a lot in the past few months, haven\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou? What with being selected as one of the USKK\u2019s newest kerbonauts, launching on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe ill-fated *Uranus VIII *mission, and that daring feat of courage you pulled off! I\u003Cbr\u003E\nguess my first question is, why aren\u2019t you still with the space program?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin laughed ruefully, a faraway look in his eyes. Erdan was not exactly sure how to\u003Cbr\u003E\nrespond, so he took advantage of this awkward moment to make sure the camerakerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad the two framed correctly. Eventually, Desdin did speak.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2018Feat of courage\u2019. Really? Is that what they\u2019re calling it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow Erdan was doubly confused. \u201CAre you implying that actual events went\u003Cbr\u003E\ndifferently?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sure you are aware of the space program\u2019s\u2026 \u2018kerbal\u2019 policy.\u201D Desdin positively\u003Cbr\u003E\nspat the word.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPolicy? That\u2019s just a word the public uses to describe missions which undergo minor\u003Cbr\u003E\nmishaps. I don\u2019t see how\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill avoiding direct eye contact, Desdin cut him off. \u201CIt may not be official, but what if I\u003Cbr\u003E\ntold you that the failures are deliberately encouraged, just to make missions more\u003Cbr\u003E\nexciting?\u201D \u201CI\u2019d have to say I\u2019d have trouble believing you. Does this really happen in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprogram?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, Mr. Erdon, it doesn\u2019t just happen, but is encouraged by the highest levels of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nprogram themselves.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s Erdan,\u201D the reporter corrected, \u201Cand really? Jebediah himself signed off on\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeliberately sabotaging the missions?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSabotage? Oh no. The rockets are never deliberately tampered with, but checks for\u003Cbr\u003E\nmistakes made during construction are lacklustre, leading to the errors we\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\naccustomed to seeing during the missions.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan sat back. This certainly didn\u2019t sound like the space program he\u2019d been reporting\u003Cbr\u003E\non for the past couple of years. He was tempted to dismiss Desdin\u2019s claims as mere fear\u003Cbr\u003E\nmongering. But could the kerbal really be telling the truth? He was a former kerbonaut\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter all. Besides, this sounded like the beginnings of a fantastic story.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COkay,\u201D he said. \u201CSo how does this \u2018policy\u2019 work? Is this connected to your departure\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the space program?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIn time, Erdin, in time. First, let me share with you its very beginning. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nfamiliar with Uranus III\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nFive months ago, and 400 kilometres above the surface of Kerbin, Uranus III orbited.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CApproaching MECO, all systems nominal.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that Control, shutting down engine.\u201D Donnand Kerman spoke, as he pressed a\u003Cbr\u003E\nbutton on the lower left side of his control panel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus III\u2019s orbital operations motor slowly throttled down, leaving the spacecraft in a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomfortable medium Kerbin orbit. While certainly not approaching the height the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN had achieved with their unkerballed Caelus I, it still was impressive. You could\u003Cbr\u003E\ndefinitely see a lot more of Kerbin from up here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COooh, we\u2019re passing over the USKK! Let me get the camera out!\u201D Rondred\u2019s voice\u003Cbr\u003E\nfloated up from below Don. The Uranus program had improved upon its first iteration,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand now both kerbals were pointed \u2018up\u2019, to avoid injuries like poor Jorfred. Uranus II\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad been the first flight to fly with the updated design, and based on feedback from that\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission, the engineers had placed a hole in between the capsules to allow the pilots to\u003Cbr\u003E\ntalk to each other without requiring an intercom.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother new feature of this mission was a television camera, which Ron was currently\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrying to focus on Kerbin. The news stations back on the ground wanted live footage\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom orbit, so they lobbied to get a camera onto the spacecraft. The space program,\u003Cbr\u003E\neager to increase its public image in the wake of the Uranus I incident, happily\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomplied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, get some shots of me too!\u201D Don called down to the other kerbal, though he didn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nreally mind if all the footage taken during the flight were just of Kerbin. The kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\nback on the ground absolutely loved getting shots of the planet, and being this far up,\u003Cbr\u003E\none could very easily see the curvature of the planet. It was just so pretty\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe harsh crackle of the radio awoke Don from his reverie. \u201CUranus III, this is Mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nControl. Do you copy?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, Control. What are things looking like from down there, Gene?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJust fine, Don. All systems are looking nominal. Speaking of which, it\u2019s time to activate the\u003Cbr\u003E\nreason you\u2019re up there. Prepare to deploy the solar panels!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was the moment Donnand had been waiting for. Previous missions had been\u003Cbr\u003E\nlimited by the amount of power they could carry into orbit, bringing them back too\u003Cbr\u003E\nquickly to do extended scientific studies or detailed analyses of how the spacecraft\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponded to being in orbit. These new solar panels would mean that the life support\u003Cbr\u003E\nand heaters could stay on for longer, extending their time in space to many hours, and\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheoretically many days. Though Don would prefer to perhaps get a larger capsule, if\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey were planning to stay up here for that long.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CStow the camera, Ron. It\u2019s time for the big show!\u201D The other kerbal knew just as well\u003Cbr\u003E\nhow big of a moment this was, and forgot to put away the camera in his excitement,\u003Cbr\u003E\nleaving it floating around the capsule, still broadcasting. \u201CYep, the panels are ready to\u003Cbr\u003E\ngo!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, keep an eye on those power readings, we are ready to deploy the panels.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, you are clear to begin.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou hear that, Ron? Activate!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nRon pushed the deployment button (which sadly was neither Big nor Red), and Don\u003Cbr\u003E\nwatched the readings. Ten seconds went by, then thirty, and then a full minute, while\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe battery banks were still showing the same passive draw in energy that was\u003Cbr\u003E\ncharacteristic of the default power setup of Uranus. After two minutes had passed, Don\u003Cbr\u003E\nradioed Control.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGene, I\u2019m not seeing an increase in power. Are you guys receiving any data?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CStrange, we registered the \u2018deploy panels\u2019 command, but the batteries aren\u2019t charging. Can you\u003Cbr\u003E\nget visual confirmation?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon peeked out the window, but spotted nothing but stars.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a negative, Control. The panels are not deployed. Repeat, we have a negative on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat deployment.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Okay. This is a problem. You only have enough power for one more orbit at that altitude;\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe\u2019ll have to bring you back down soon if we don\u2019t get those panels fixed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore Don could reply, he noticed a screw floating past his face. Maneuvering in the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntight confines of his capsule, he looked downward. Rondred had disassembled his\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol panel, and was busily inspecting various bits of wiring.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh, Roger that Control, let me just\u2026ah\u2026get back to you in a second,\u201D he said, turning\u003Cbr\u003E\noff the radio. \u201CRon, uh\u2026what are you doing?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m trying to fix these blasted panels! There\u2019s got to be a reason they won\u2019t deploy!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I thought the engineers wouldn\u2019t even let you look at that\u003Cbr\u003E\npanel when you visited the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E last week.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, I\u2019ve been looking at it for the last two hours, and nothing bad has happened!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe navball came loose, and began orbiting Ron like a small moon. Don made a mental\u003Cbr\u003E\nnote to pocket it at some point. Ron continued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBesides, what\u2019s the worst that can happen? You\u2019ve got all the controls in your pod, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nGround Control has access to all the data on this panel anyways.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh well, you\u2019ve already taken it apart. What\u2019s your plan to fix these panels?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, I was thinking that maybe a wire came loose or something, but the button feeds\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto the computer just fine\u2026 Hmm, do you think it\u2019s a computer problem?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, where else could it be located?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, Don. There\u2019s a lot of wire between the computer and the panels, the\u003Cbr\u003E\npanels could have got stuck, or maybe the motors are burnt out? There\u2019s a bunch of\u003Cbr\u003E\nplaces where something could go wrong!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut there are two solar panels, and it\u2019s gotta be said, the chances of them both failing\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the exact same way are pretty low.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm. You know what, there are two copies of all components after the computer,\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom motors to wiring. Unless the engineers somehow installed two defective panels,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe computer has to be it!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCan you debug the thing?\u201D Ron looked at his controls. \u201CMy panel is not\u2026uh\u2026set up\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor that right now.\u201D Indeed, the console now looked like some sort of wild animal had\u003Cbr\u003E\ntaken large bites out of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSure, just don\u2019t break anything\u2014,\u201D Don replied, watching the throttle control float past\u003Cbr\u003E\nhim. \u201C\u2014else.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe quickly brought up the debug commands by pressing a pair of keys simultaneously\u003Cbr\u003E\non the top and bottom on his panel, and looked for anything strange in the output. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nfound it immediately.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey Ron, it looks like we\u2019ve got a bunch of Null Reference Exceptions. They\u2019re filling\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe output log, and stopping the computer from responding to the solar panel\u003Cbr\u003E\nsubroutine!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLog? Subroutine? Dammit Don, I\u2019m a kerbonaut, not a computer scientist!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBasically, the computer\u2019s clogged up because it\u2019s receiving a lot of errors from another\u003Cbr\u003E\nsystem, so it can\u2019t execute our command to deploy the solar panels.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI knew it wasn\u2019t the panels!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright, how to do this\u2026 Hmm, it looks like our atmospheric trajectory computation\u003Cbr\u003E\nmodule is outputting the errors. I think it has something to do with the atmospheric\u003Cbr\u003E\nsensors reading zero, but it\u2019s trying to calculate our trajectory anyway. I\u2019m going to try\u003Cbr\u003E\nand rewire the system, but it could take a while.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonnand was no technical whiz, but after his and Ron\u2019s misadventure in Mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nControl a year ago, he had been more interested in the technical aspects of the capsules.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was able to navigate the system without too much difficulty, and found the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntrajectories module, a small black box sitting underneath his control panel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRon, I\u2019ve found the module! Can you pass me the needle nose pliers? I should be able\u003Cbr\u003E\nto rewire it from here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this moment, the lights in the capsule flickered, punctuated by a yell from below.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRon? Are you alright?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUgh\u2026yep, just touched a couple of wires I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat the\u2013! Our power levels just dropped three hundred percent! Romfarer\u2019s eye,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat happened?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI, err, may have shorted one of the batteries\u2026 Well, former battery; it\u2019s more of a\u003Cbr\u003E\nbattery-shaped piece of plastic now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe don\u2019t even have enough power to deorbit ourselves now; we need to get those\u003Cbr\u003E\npanels fixed fast! Tell you what, I\u2019ll just take the module out entirely. It\u2019ll mean we\u2019re a\u003Cbr\u003E\nfew kilometres off with our landing, but that\u2019s no problem. We\u2019d better hope that the\u003Cbr\u003E\npanels aren\u2019t damaged\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon gritted his teeth and cut the wires from the trajectories box leading into the main\u003Cbr\u003E\nflight computer. Suddenly, a couple of red lights on his console turned green, signifying\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe computer was no longer overloaded. Don\u2019s worried face broke into a wide grin. It\u003Cbr\u003E\nworked!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COkay Ron, press the button, we\u2019re running out of power fast here!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHere goes!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo simultaneous clunk-whirrs reverberated through the hull, and a few seconds later,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe power levels began rapidly rising.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes! We did it! Power\u2019s back online!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe two kerbals shared a zero-gravity high-four through the small hole between the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsules.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t have to recap the entire mission.\u201D Erdan told Desdin, annoyed. \u201CI did report\u003Cbr\u003E\non it after all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you know how popular the footage from Rondred\u2019s camera feed was with\u003Cbr\u003E\naudiences back on Kerbin.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COf course,\u201D Erdan replied, thinking back to the story he\u2019d done on the incident.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAudiences love that sort of dramatic tension. Two kerbals stranded in a dying\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft with time running out. It\u2019s like a movie! The fact that it was actually\u003Cbr\u003E\nhappening in real time only heightened the drama.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you understand why the space program wouldn\u2019t be opposed to having that sort of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthing happen more often.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you\u2019re saying they just cut out safety entirely?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo, not quite. But it became common practice to skip final checks, and cut corners\u003Cbr\u003E\nduring manufacturing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWait a minute. Wasn\u2019t that new engineer Jebediah brought into the program supposed\u003Cbr\u003E\nto fix those problems? Are you saying that this didn\u2019t happen?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre you kidding? If anything the rockets are getting worse now that Doodbro is part\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the program. Having another manager didn\u2019t fix anything, it just kept the program\u003Cbr\u003E\nmired in bureaucracy and red tape. Different departments don\u2019t talk to each other, parts\u003Cbr\u003E\ndon\u2019t work together, it\u2019s chaos.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan didn\u2019t know what to say.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COf course,\u201D Desdin continued. \u201CThis all came to a head during Uranus V.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree months after III, Uranus V floated in the dark. Its pilot, Sean Kerman, lay back\u003Cbr\u003E\nand let out a sigh of relief. The rocket booster had just decoupled, and he was safely in\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit. Despite intensive training, nothing could have prepared himself for the ferocity of\u003Cbr\u003E\na rocket launch. He looked out the window nervously. Not only was he the only kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\non this mission, this was his very first time in space. He couldn\u2019t get over how big\u003Cbr\u003E\neverything was, as well as that instant death lay literally seventeen millimetres away.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo avoid dwelling on such unpleasant images, he turned his thoughts towards the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission. As a former reactor technician, he was the most qualified of all USKK\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbonauts for the task at hand. Werhner Von Kerman\u2019s prototype Radioisotope\u003Cbr\u003E\nThermal Generator was supposed to provide a steady trickle of power through\u003Cbr\u003E\nharnessing the heat a sample of radioactive material gave off. Naturally, the technology\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad been thoroughly tested on the ground, but this was its first demonstration test in\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSean was merely there to monitor the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E and make sure nothing went wrong. So\u003Cbr\u003E\nsimple, even a probe could do it! He suspected that the only reason he was along for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nride was to boost the prestige of the space program, in ways an unkerballed spacecraft\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould not.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClick\u003Cbr\u003E\nClick\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe radiation counter mounted above his head made a bit of noise, then was silent.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile there was more radiation up here than on the ground, the shielding of the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule eliminated most of the nastier particles. Some still got through, but Sean had\u003Cbr\u003E\nseen much worse.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe radio crackled. \u201CHow\u2019s the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E looking, Sean?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCurrent is nominal, Control. All systems are green.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that. Werhner will be happy.\u201D The ground controller stopped talking, but failed to\u003Cbr\u003E\nsign off, presumably speaking to other members of Mission Control in the background.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSean waited for him to continue. \u201CThe ballistics guys want you to fire your engine for a few\u003Cbr\u003E\nseconds at periapsis; this will adjust your orbit to pass through Kerbin\u2019s radiation belts. They\u003Cbr\u003E\nwant to get a reading of the number of ionizing particles you can pick up, for a better idea of how\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe capsule shielding is holding up.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that Control, let me know when and where to burn.\u201D As he turned off the radio,\u003Cbr\u003E\nSean grumbled to himself, \u201CFor Nova\u2019s sake, I am just a probe.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, it was a damn sight better than being stuck in an office down on Kerbin, the view\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas fantastic up here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the time came to make the burn, Sean gripped the controls, and began to turn the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft, hearing the gentle thrummmm of the reaction wheels spinning up. Just like\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe simulations, he thought to himself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClick click click\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe counter started making more noise. Sean looked up in confusion. He hadn\u2019t even\u003Cbr\u003E\nmade the burn; there\u2019s no way he could be in the radiation belts yet. Perhaps this was\u003Cbr\u003E\nsimply a more energetic region of space? He put the counter\u2019s increased activity out of\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis mind.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe gingerly throttled up the main engine, feeling the ship vibrate around him, and the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngentle roar of propellant leaving the spacecraft. The burn went off without a hitch, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe shut down the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nClickclickcliCkClickClickclickcLIckclickClicKclickclickclick\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the roar of the engine gone, the radiation counter\u2019s frantic complaining could be\u003Cbr\u003E\nplainly heard. Eyes wide, Sean looked around the capsule in panic. The counter was\u003Cbr\u003E\nregistering more and more radiation by the second, and he had no idea what was\u003Cbr\u003E\ncausing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis hazard was accompanied by another, more insidious problem. The lights in the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule began to flicker, signifying a drop in power generation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn a flash, Sean realized the cause of these problems: the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E. He quickly radioed the\u003Cbr\u003E\nground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, I have an emergency here. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E is leaking material, repeat, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E is\u003Cbr\u003E\nbreached.

Hang on, I need to advise with the Power team.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA yellow light began pulsing, signifying a \u2018High Radiation\u2019 alert.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, I know what the problems are! I\u2019m asking you, what should I do?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo response. Fuming, Sean thanked Nova that he\u2019d trained well for this mission, then\u003Cbr\u003E\nslid out a tray which contained a red button marked \u2018Abort\u2019. Slamming his fist down on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe button produced a small jolt which ran through the spacecraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nClickclickclick click click\u2026click\u2026click\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026click\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nSean sighed in relief as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

Our radiation sensors are\u003Cbr\u003E\nback to normal.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAffirmative, Gene. I jettisoned the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.

Why\u003Cbr\u003E\ndid you do that?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI stand by my actions; the radiation would have reached critical levels in less than a\u003Cbr\u003E\nminute had I not decoupled the module.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a long moment, Gene did not reply. Then he sighed heavily. \u201CFine. Well, we got some\u003Cbr\u003E\ngood data, so begin the deorbit burn and return home.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that Control.\u201D Sean said stiffly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd Sean?

Sure,\u003Cbr\u003E\naudiences enjoyed Sean\u2019s reactions, but the entire incident was over in less than two\u003Cbr\u003E\nminutes. Most kerbals missed it entirely.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s not why I told you about it. My point was that Mission Control was increasingly\u003Cbr\u003E\ndistant and unconcerned by the kerbals\u2019 sacrifices and problems.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFrom what you told me about the lax safety standards, I imagine the increased number\u003Cbr\u003E\nof incidents would wear on them after a while.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExactly, Erdin. Eventually, the little problems became part of the mission, just like any\u003Cbr\u003E\nold maneuver or systems check. Because it\u2019s not as if any error ever caused a mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nfailure now, did it?\u201D Erdan noticed that Desdin\u2019s right hand clenched into a fist as he\u003Cbr\u003E\nspoke this last sentence.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut one did, didn\u2019t it?\u201D he said carefully, knowing this would be a sensitive area for\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe former kerbonaut. \u201CUranus VIII.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin said nothing. Erdan wondered if he\u2019d pushed the kerbal too far. In fact, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nentire reason he\u2019d decided to do this interview was in order to get more details about\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat mysterious mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter a full two minutes, Desdin finally looked into Erdan\u2019s eyes for the first time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite himself, the reporter shivered. Those eyes were like cold steel, hard and intense.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin spoke. \u201CUranus VIII. Yes. This is where my tale has been leading.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat happened?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHell. Erdun, it was hell.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeep\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeep\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeep\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nHand on the control stick, Desdin Kerman deftly guided his spacecraft towards his\u003Cbr\u003E\ntarget, two months after Uranus V, and two prior to his conversation with Erdin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBeginning final approach now,\u201D he spoke into his headset.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeep\u2026beep\u2026beep\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe tracking monitor started to make more noise as his spacecraft got closer to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nother. Desdin\u2019s mission was to rendezvous with a sister craft, the Uranus VII. This\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontained a functional Reaction Control System, which would be used to dock with\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin\u2019s vessel. Concerned about weight, Uranus VIII contained no such system, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nrather had more fuel and enhanced reaction wheels, to assist with the approach\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaneuver.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the moment, he was following the directions of his tracking monitor and\u003Cbr\u003E\nrangefinder. Each spacecraft had a small beacon constantly outputting a tiny radio\u003Cbr\u003E\nsignal, and by judging the strength of the other signal, a spacecraft could determine its\u003Cbr\u003E\ndistance to the other ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was conveyed to the pilot via an audio system, which beeped faster the closer you\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere to the other spacecraft. Right now, Desdin estimated Uranus VII was about 300\u003Cbr\u003E\nmetres away and rapidly closing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeepBeepBeepBeep\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlicking off the rangefinder, he began firing the engine, killing his ship\u2019s relative\u003Cbr\u003E\nvelocity with respect to Uranus VII. He expertly adjusted the throttle to bring the two\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft motionless relative to one another.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is *Uranus VIII *reporting successful approach maneuver. My velocity with\u003Cbr\u003E\nrespect to *Uranus VII *is now trivial,\u201D he spoke proudly into the radio. Let\u2019s see\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoodbert try to beat that!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUranus VII here, impressive maneuver, I\u2019ll admit. Though just watch as my docking breaks\u003Cbr\u003E\nyour speed record back on Kerbin!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin and Doodbert had arrived from different branches of the USKK military, and as\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuch had a natural rivalry from the start. Each tried to outdo the other in performance\u003Cbr\u003E\nand speed during training and in the simulators. The competition certainly did not stop\u003Cbr\u003E\nonce they were put in charge of actual spacecraft. As it stood, Desdin held the record for\u003Cbr\u003E\nfastest docking from the close approach position the two craft were presently in.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, it looked like Doodbert was about to challenge that record now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVII, this is Control. We advise you to take caution while approaching, reality may not work the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsame way as the simulator did.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRelax, Control. I\u2019ve got this. Zero-gee just adds a bit of an extra challenge, that\u2019s all!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hourglass-shaped Uranus VII spun itself to be perpendicular with VIII, and began\u003Cbr\u003E\nmoving in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBert, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re forgetting something?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? I followed procedure to the\u2026oh. Opening docking cover now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, as Uranus VII continued to grow larger in Desdin\u2019s window, he could\u003Cbr\u003E\nsee that the docking port was still firmly covered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDoodbert, open your port now!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI just did!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, it\u2019s definitely not opened, so you need to\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nTHUNK\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDammit!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe two spacecraft spun around, Desdin bringing VIII swiftly under control.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was a sign of how often these sorts of things happened when Control responded with\u003Cbr\u003E\nannoyance, rather than concern.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCopy that, VIII. Just fix it as quick as you can, everyone here is tired and wants to go home.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger, Control.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs he unbuckled from his chair, Desdin imagined millions of kerbals eagerly watching\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir television screens at this mention of a problem. Ever since the illustrious fix of\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus III, all USKK spacecraft carried television cameras to broadcast the kerbonauts\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\nexploits to the entire country. The failures and subsequent solutions always boosted the\u003Cbr\u003E\npublic appeal of the space program, to the point where many vendors sold \u2018highlight\u003Cbr\u003E\nreels\u2019 of the mishaps. Those kerbals who fixed the problems were always lauded as\u003Cbr\u003E\ngreat heroes, so he looked forward to getting his hands on the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, I am going EVA for a closer look at the problem.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey! I can fix it from in here, there\u2019s no need to get outside!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoodbert knew this fact as well, and evidently hoped that he could be the hero this\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission, rather than Doodbert Kerman, idiot kerbonaut who jammed his docking port\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoors shut. But Desdin had the spacesuit, so Desdin would fix the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe spacesuits were a relatively old idea, but a new invention, brought on by necessity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe increasing rate of failures brought home the necessity of allowing a kerbal to\u003Cbr\u003E\ninspect the exterior of his spacecraft and potentially make repairs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first-generation suits flew aboard Uranus VI, and that vessel\u2019s crew had tested them\u003Cbr\u003E\nduring that mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBased on their feedback, tweaks had been made to its design, and this suit was fully\u003Cbr\u003E\nreinforced, provided an excellent amount of breathable air, and best of all, included a\u003Cbr\u003E\njetpack. Werhner Von Kerman was rather vague about the specifics, but he had\u003Cbr\u003E\nmentioned that the suit ionized a small portion of the air inside and forced it out into\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace to provide propulsion. This provided exceptional exhaust velocities, though it did\u003Cbr\u003E\nslowly use up the kerbal\u2019s supply of air over time. Also, the battery in the backpack\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould hold only so much charge to run the thing, so he would have to return to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft and recharge periodically. The power would definitely last long enough to\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake him the short distance to Uranus VII, though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSorry Doodbert. You got the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, I got the spacesuit. See you outside!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nOpening the hatch door, Desdin floated out into space. Activating the jetpack (officially\u003Cbr\u003E\nit was known as the Kerballed Maneuvering Unit, or KMU, but everyone referred to it\u003Cbr\u003E\nas a jetpack), he sped towards Uranus VII. While this technology was certainly fantastic,\u003Cbr\u003E\nit didn\u2019t scale up very well, keeping spacecraft with extraordinary amounts of delta-v\u003Cbr\u003E\nstill out of reach. The thrust given by the thrusters was far too small to move much\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore than a kerbal around.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Uranus VII fell away behind him, Desdin suddenly felt very small. The entire planet\u003Cbr\u003E\nof Kerbin sat right below him, its clouds and cities merely two hundred kilometres\u003Cbr\u003E\naway. Elsewhere, there was only darkness. The light from Kerbin and the sun\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompletely washed out the faint stars, leaving Desdin alone in the cosmic darkness.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, he had a jetpack. Touching the controls, he zipped towards Uranus VIII.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey Bert,\u201D Desdin knocked on the capsule\u2019s window. Visibly startled, Doodbert\u003Cbr\u003E\nlooked towards him in annoyance (and most likely jealousy).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Just let me know what\u2019s wrong.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin flew up to the front of the spacecraft, and took a close look at the docking\u003Cbr\u003E\nadaptor. It didn\u2019t take long before he located the source of the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COooh, it looks like you\u2019ve got a blown actuator.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s not so bad, just open the port manually, and I\u2019ll finish the docking.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot the \u2018blown\u2019 I meant. Something actually exploded, totally trashing the docking\u003Cbr\u003E\nmechanisms.\u201D With a cold chill, Desdin noticed that had the explosion been a little\u003Cbr\u003E\nlarger, the hatch seal would have been compromised, killing Doodbert instantly. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nelected not to tell the other kerbal this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBlast. Control, what\u2019s your take on this?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like docking is certainly possible and accurate in zero-gee, given by your attempt.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, the dent from Doodbert\u2019s unsuccessful maneuver was perfectly centred on\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus VIII\u2019s docking port. Control continued. \u201CHowever, we don\u2019t want to risk any more\u003Cbr\u003E\ndamage to the spacecraft by docking with a non-functional port. You\u2019re coming back home early,\u003Cbr\u003E\nboys.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAww\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin was saddened too. He had wanted to be able to fix the capsule and save the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission. Ah well, at least he had a jetpack. To console himself, he did a couple of loop-\u003Cbr\u003E\nde-loops around *Uranus VII *(much to the annoyance of Doodbert). Upon returning to\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis spacecraft and repressurizing the cockpit, he opened up communications to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nground again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like we\u2019re coming up on the deorbit burn now, Control. Am I clear to begin the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaneuver?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a negative, Uranus VIII. We need you on station in the event anything else goes wrong\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith VII.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger. Though we\u2019ve already had our failure this mission, what could possibly go\u003Cbr\u003E\nwrong?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWait, wait, wait. You actually said that? For real?\u201D Erdan interrupted.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other kerbal was staring at the floor. It was a few seconds before he responded.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvidently, talking about the mission he was involved had brought up a lot of\u003Cbr\u003E\nunpleasant memories.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIn hindsight, it does look like I tempted fate. You must understand, it certainly didn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nfeel that way at the time.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin glanced out the window. Uranus VII\u2019s retroburn completed successfully, and the\u003Cbr\u003E\nother spacecraft flew away from his own. The radio crackled with Bert\u2019s voice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CManeuver completed, I\u2019m on target for splashdown east of the space centre. See you\u003Cbr\u003E\nplanetside!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBye, Bert.

The stars outside his\u003Cbr\u003E\nwindow formed blurs as they spun by.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026Control, I\u2019ve\u2026ugh\u2026had a problem.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe centrifugal force from the spinning capsule made it difficult to speak into his\u003Cbr\u003E\nheadset.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat now? We\u2019re less than fifteen minutes until the end of the mission, for Harv\u2019s sake.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m currently\u2026ugh\u2026spinning very rapidly.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, can your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E not take care of the spin?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s a negative, it\u2019s telling me it\u2019s\u2026\u201D Desdin struggled to read his panel clearly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026KP overloaded?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot good. We\u2019re going to have to boost your horizontal torque to compensate. Can you reroute\u003Cbr\u003E\npower to the reaction wheels?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin hadn\u2019t paid as much attention as he probably should have to the spacecraft\u003Cbr\u003E\norientation briefing, but he did remember how to do that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAffirmative. Rerouting\u2026now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter flicking the safety switch off, and dialing up the amount of power available to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nreaction wheels, his spacecraft slowed its spin, and eventually stopped. Grateful for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrelief, Desdin sat back for a second. Then he grabbed his control stick. Now he could\u003Cbr\u003E\nfigure out what had gone wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA cursory scan of the sky showed a strange piece of debris approximately 100 metres\u003Cbr\u003E\naway from his ship. Upon closer inspection, Desdin opened a channel back to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CControl, it appears that the decoupler triggered prematurely; the capsule is now the\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly remaining piece of the ship.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? By Nova, how did that happen?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m trying to figure that out now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COkay VIII, we\u2019re going to help you out but for now we need to coordinate Doodbert\u2019s recovery.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u2019ll re-establish contact in about twenty minutes. Until then, try to figure out exactly what\u003Cbr\u003E\nwent wrong.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Roger.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe radio went quiet, leaving Desdin in silence, save the tiny hiss of the life-support\u003Cbr\u003E\nsystems. All that remained between him and an icy death just centimetres beyond the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule walls. In spite of himself, he shivered. He was utterly alone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter several minutes of fruitlessly checking gauges and readouts, Desdin faced the\u003Cbr\u003E\ninevitable: he\u2019d have to go outside. While functionally it was exactly identical to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nEVA he had performed half an hour ago, this one felt much riskier. While he\u2019d still be\u003Cbr\u003E\nforever lost in space if his pack failed, having contact with Control and Uranus VII had\u003Cbr\u003E\ngiven him more of a sense of comfort. Now there was no one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs he exited his capsule, he nervously looked around for the second part of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft. He eventually found it, floating some 200 metres away from his capsule and\u003Cbr\u003E\ngetting further away. Pushing off from Uranus VIII, he felt like he was leaving it behind\u003Cbr\u003E\nforever. The arcjets ignited, and he sped towards the debris.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll of a sudden, everything went black. Panicking, Desdin looked around, fearing that\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe\u2019d suddenly gone blind, until he saw Kerbin\u2019s night side. The many cities down on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe planet shone their lights into space, confirming that he had in fact not lost his sight,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe sun had simply set, as evidenced by the rapidly fading glow on the horizon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGrimacing, Desdin fumbled around for the button to toggle his helmet lights on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon reaching the debris, Desdin grabbed hold and investigated it more closely.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything appeared intact, with no obvious shorted cabling or exploded propellant\u003Cbr\u003E\ntanks. Then, he noticed the decoupler. Several explosive bolts had triggered, decoupling\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe capsule from the rest of the spacecraft, exactly as it was designed to do. There must\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave been some sort of fault which had prematurely triggered them. Searching the\u003Cbr\u003E\nwiring for problems proved fruitless, as most of the control systems were contained\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithin the capsule.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe capsule! Desdin had lost track of it against the darkness of the night sky. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrantically searched for a dark patch among the stars, anything to tell him where it was.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis light was too diffuse to illuminate anything at more than 100 metres or so.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin floated alone in the dark, resigned to wait until the sun came up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen, in a flash of insight, he remembered the transponder tracking system. The signal\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich his ship gave off could be heard by his suit\u2019s radio! Hardly daring to breathe, he\u003Cbr\u003E\npointed his suits\u2019 antenna at various spots in the sky while listening carefully for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsignal.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt first, he heard nothing but the faint hiss of static. Heart hammering in his ears, he\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwisted around, trying to hear something.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll of a sudden, a faint beeeeeeeeeeeeep came from his upper left. Back on Kerbin, he\u003Cbr\u003E\nfound that sound exceptionally annoying, but at the moment it was more welcome than\u003Cbr\u003E\nif someone offered him free snacks. Excitedly, he fired his thrusters and shot off in that\u003Cbr\u003E\ndirection, the signal growing stronger by the second. Finally, he got close enough for his\u003Cbr\u003E\nlight to illuminate the dark outline of his ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWrenching open the capsule door, cramming himself in, and repressurizing in record\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime, Desdin yanked off his helmet. The air levels hadn\u2019t fully normalized yet, so he felt\u003Cbr\u003E\nlight-headed for a few seconds. After strapping himself into his seat, he leaned back. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas a wreck. His heart was hammering, and his breaths came in short, rapid bursts. His\u003Cbr\u003E\nhands were shaking so much that he had trouble grasping the controls. For now, he just\u003Cbr\u003E\nrested them in his lap.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen he noticed a red light on his control panel. It had stayed dark through most of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission, but now it had activated, it signified the capsule had less than ten percent of its\u003Cbr\u003E\npower remaining. Desdin smacked himself on the forehead. Of course, the solar panels\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere back on the jettisoned part of his spacecraft, and the high power levels he had\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen drawing to run the reaction wheels were draining the batteries dry.\u003Cbr\u003E\nActing quickly, Desdin switched off all systems, reaction wheels, the radio, even the\u003Cbr\u003E\nflight computer. With no engines or any sort of maneuvering system, it was uselessly\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrawing power. The only thing he left on were the life support system, and even then\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe dialed back the heaters to their lowest setting. It would keep him from freezing to\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeath, but the capsule would get cold.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin leaned back. He realized that he couldn\u2019t contact Mission Control without\u003Cbr\u003E\ndraining the battery further. With the comm on, he\u2019d only have about an hour of life\u003Cbr\u003E\nsupport left. Besides, he doubted that Control would have much to contribute; they\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobably just tell him to deorbit himself with his jetpack, and catch him with a\u003Cbr\u003E\nhelicopter or something if he survived re-entry, based on their \u2018solutions\u2019 they\u2019d come\u003Cbr\u003E\nup with for the past few missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo what did you do?\u201D Erdan asked, with bated breath. Desdin had stopped talking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe kerbal was now staring down into his hands, studying them intently.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDesdin? We\u2019ve got to continue the\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI know.\u201D This short response was enough to make Erdan stop. He glanced at the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncamerakerbal, who was likely feeling much like how Erdan was; intrigued about\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin\u2019s story, but put off by his mannerisms.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter about thirty seconds, Desdin continued, still without looking up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2026mentioned how terrifying it is to\u2026exit your spacecraft on the night side. That\u003Cbr\u003E\ndarkness, the cities of Kerbin your only light, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s horrible.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut why did you go outside? What was your plan?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThinking about how Control would have reacted gave me the solution: I had my\u003Cbr\u003E\njetpack. I could use it to deorbit the entire capsule, heatshield, parachute and all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut you mentioned that the jetpack didn\u2019t produce much thrust. Deorbiting an entire\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule must have taken hours.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSix. It took\u2026six. Six hours of utter silence, six hours of pushing that capsule. At the\u003Cbr\u003E\nend I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d\u2026if I\u2019d even make it to the ground alive.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene sat at one of the tech\u2019s stations at Mission Control, head in his hands. It had been a\u003Cbr\u003E\ntotal of six hours since Uranus VIII had gone dark. Miraculously, a piece of debris\u003Cbr\u003E\nmatching the capsule\u2019s size had just been detected entering the atmosphere, and Gene\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad sent a recon plane out to get a visual on the object. The entire room was waiting for\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe plane\u2019s report with bated breath: was it really Uranus VIII?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is RC-107 calling Control; we have a visual on the capsule.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, RC. What\u2019s its status?\u201D Gene jumped to his feet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCurrently floating in the ocean, off the coast of Espinias. Are we clear to enter their territory?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon\u2019t want to spark another international incident.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re currently CKFN-leaning, it might not be the best idea to provoke them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey\u2019ve been known to shoot at any unfriendly aircraft they see, including large birds.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCopy, this large bird is staying well away. Do you know if the kerbal\u2019s still alive in there?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe, ah, lost all contact with the spacecraft about a day ago. He must have turned off\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis radio to save power. Unfortunately, it never came back online, so we have no idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, his life support couldn\u2019t have lasted this long, even with all nonessential\u003Cbr\u003E\nsystems shut down.\u201D Gene paused, then continued in a hoarse voice. \u201CHe\u2019s\u2026he\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobably gone.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe comm was silent for a moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll work on getting official clearance to retrieve the capsule. It shouldn\u2019t take more\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan a day or so, divert to the nearest friendly runway and remain on standby.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAffirmative, we\u2019ll stay in touch.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene sat down heavily, head in hands. How did this mission go so wrong?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo how did you get back to the USKK?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin was staring sideways, seemingly ignoring Erdan. Before the newscaster could\u003Cbr\u003E\nrepeat his question though, the former kerbonaut responded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDoes it matter?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan stopped short. \u201CYou describe the whole mission vividly, except your rescue?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou call that a rescue?\u201D All of a sudden, Desdin was filled with rage, again staring at\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan with those terribly intense eyes. \u201CThey abandoned me. I was floating in that\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule for longer than I was in space, and they were shocked to realize that I was still\u003Cbr\u003E\nalive when they pulled it out of the sea!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2026ah\u2014,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy didn\u2019t they save me? Why didn\u2019t they bring me back from space sooner? Why\u003Cbr\u003E\ndidn\u2019t they pull me out of my capsule as soon as I landed? I could see the rescue plane! I\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould see it!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Desdin began sobbing, taking Erdan by surprise. He moved over, and patted\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe former kerbonaut\u2019s shoulder awkwardly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere, there. I\u2019m sure they did everything they could. From what I heard, they saved\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou from being captured by the CKFN.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdin looked up. \u201CSaved me? I wasn\u2019t saved. They opened my eyes to the true nature\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the space program. Corruption, lies, and incompetence, it goes all the way to the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncore, same as the whole USKK!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShocked, Erdan had no response for this. Desdin looked directly into his eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMark my words, Erdan. You\u2019ll get plenty more of these stories in the future. The space\u003Cbr\u003E\nprogram is heading towards doom.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the first fifteen minutes after they left Desdin\u2019s house, neither reporter nor\u003Cbr\u003E\ncamerakerbal spoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, Erdan broke the silence. \u201CSo\u2026 What did you think of the interview?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHonestly sir? I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really all there. The poor guy went through a lot, I\u2019m\u003Cbr\u003E\npretty sure he\u2019s not remembering everything correctly. And that rant at the end\u2026 I\u003Cbr\u003E\nmean, come on!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CReally? I thought he had a couple of valid points.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. I think he\u2019s just steamed at the program for not rescuing him right away.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe guy\u2019s got a point about being left floating off of some city-state\u2019s borders for well\u003Cbr\u003E\nover a day, but seriously? He was completely making things up about those lax safety\u003Cbr\u003E\nchecks. By Harv, you just had an interview with Jeb where he reassured you that\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019re doing all they can, safety-wise.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s true. You can\u2019t excuse me from being skeptical of the official story though. I\u2019ve\u003Cbr\u003E\ngot to be skeptical of everything, you know.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo be skeptical of this kerbal! Didn\u2019t you see his house? He\u2019s a recluse, hiding away\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom society. He\u2019s spouting off conspiracy theories and more. I don\u2019t think \u2018his side\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\neven deserves to be aired.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou may have a point,\u201D Erdan responded, looking off into the distance as the van\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrove along.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis camerakerbal\u2019s words haunted Erdan for the next few days. As he looked over the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfootage, he debated with himself whether or not he should publish it. Sure, it was an\u003Cbr\u003E\nexample of free speech, but it was true, a lot of the kerbal\u2019s accusations seemed\u003Cbr\u003E\nunfounded at best, and occasionally, conspiratorial and downright paranoid. As he\u003Cbr\u003E\nwent to bed, he placed the tapes on his bedside table, resolving to decide what to do\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith them in time for work tomorrow.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was still in turmoil after waking up. As he went through his morning routine, no\u003Cbr\u003E\nanswer came easily. Then, as he was about to leave for the studio, his eyes fell on his\u003Cbr\u003E\nvery first journalism award, lovingly maintained in a display case by the front door. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad won that back in high school, for his excellent reporting on the final hours and\u003Cbr\u003E\nceasefire of the Great War. He had a duty to the citizens of this nation, to keep them\u003Cbr\u003E\ninformed on worldwide events and uphold the truth. If that meant he\u2019d have to show\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe other side of the story now and again, so be it. He grabbed the tapes, and put them\u003Cbr\u003E\nin his bag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen he arrived at the studio, he gave the lead tech the tapes and told him to work\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem into the afternoon broadcast. His conscience satisfied, he began working through\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis interview schedule for the day. Shortly after lunch, however, he received a phone\u003Cbr\u003E\ncall from the tech.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m terribly sorry sir, we can\u2019t find the tapes. One of the interns must have misplaced\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry about it. Keep looking for it, but it\u2019s not the end of the world if you can\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nfind them. Just air a rerun of \u2018Story Time with Xactar\u2019 if they don\u2019t turn up.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWill do.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan paused for a minute. How curious. Ah well, he had more important things to do\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoday, the tapes would probably turn up eventually.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey never did.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN: Space Facility Meeting Room Delta\u003Cbr\u003E\nFour Months before Uranus VII \u0026amp; VIII docking attempt\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo it\u2019s decided. We\u2019ll use the RV-105 thruster ports for the docking maneuver.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, hold on a sec! We never came to a final decision on that! I still think the PA-7\u003Cbr\u003E\nlinear thrusters offer more control over the spacecraft\u2019s translation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut the 105s give more control directions, for a cheaper price to boot! Not to mention\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe increase of mass when you have to account for those extra PA-7s onboard.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. Their mass is negligible! Besides, Reaction Systems Ltd. will\u003Cbr\u003E\nsponsor us if we use their models. That offsets the increased cost!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd how would STEADLER react? You think reaction wheels just grow on trees?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed. He felt like this argument had been going on for weeks. In a way, it\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad. When the initial Munar design session proved to be utter chaos, he\u2019d held many\u003Cbr\u003E\nsmaller meetings in the weeks since then. The hope was that they could be more\u003Cbr\u003E\nproductive and finalize all the details of the CFKN\u2019s Munar mission without too many\u003Cbr\u003E\narguments.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe was half-successful, at least. While they did accomplish more, the meetings were\u003Cbr\u003E\nanything but focused; the fewer kerbals meant more arguments between engineers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven the timider ones had surprisingly strong opinions on certain mission components.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett, a major voice in these meetings, addressed the entire room.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRegardless of the make of thruster, we can\u2019t just ignore the fact that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and\u003Cbr\u003E\ndocking systems are completely unproven. A mission aiming for the Mun which\u003Cbr\u003E\ndepends on those components working perfectly is extraordinarily reckless, worthy of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthose fools in the USKK!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeads nodded around the table, as the Uranus III solar panel mishap was fresh in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nminds of all those present.\u003Cbr\u003E\nScratching his chin, Danford addressed his Chief Engineer. \u201CSo Brett, what do you\u003Cbr\u003E\npropose we do about it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpirits high, Danford entered the Advisory Council meeting chamber, three weeks after\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat meeting. As was custom, all Council members ignored him; they were debating\u003Cbr\u003E\nsome issue or another among themselves.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt appeared that today was a special day; the President himself was there too. The\u003Cbr\u003E\nleader of the CKFN rarely bothered with these meetings (and the inevitable\u003Cbr\u003E\ndisagreements which resulted), instead preferring to read the summaries drawn up by\u003Cbr\u003E\neach council member. However, with elections coming up, he evidently wanted to keep\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis ear close to the ground when it came to the various programs of the CKFN.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClearing his throat, the Director of the Space Programme stood in front of the council\u003Cbr\u003E\nmembers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh Danford, you\u2019re here. You had mentioned you had some sort of presentation for\u003Cbr\u003E\nus?\u201D Bilcas commented, looking up from his papers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI do. Corely, if you\u2019d please?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis companion\u2014a young intern working at the Space Programme\u2014struggled through\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe door, arms full of slides. These detailed the various technical specifications of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nentire Munar roadmap, from launchpad maintenance specifications to which brand of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsnacks the kerbals should carry with them on their journey.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSet the projector up in the back,\u201D Danford instructed, as the kerbal dragged a large\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuitcase full of audiovisual equipment into the room.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen he had managed to get everything set up and the Council members had turned\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoward the projection screen, Danford began.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs you all know, in recent months the USKK has been exceeding our space program in\u003Cbr\u003E\nnearly every conceivable manner, from number of launches to new technologies\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeveloped. Fortunately, we are ready to counter these accomplishments with one of our\u003Cbr\u003E\nown, one which will exceed anything the USKK plans to put into space. Corely?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe intern turned on the projector, which displayed a full page of flux integrals, capable\u003Cbr\u003E\nof instilling fear in anyone who had not undergone at least three years of vector\u003Cbr\u003E\ncalculus. This was decidedly not what Danford intended to show the Advisors, and he\u003Cbr\u003E\nglanced at the intern in the back, clearing his throat pointedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe kerbal in the back fumbled with slides, inserting another into the projector. An\u003Cbr\u003E\nimage of Danford on his last vacation appeared on the screen. This was the one where\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe had ill-advisedly gone hula dancing and was as such dressed in a short grass skirt,\u003Cbr\u003E\npromoting a fair number of chuckles from the audience.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheeks flushing\u2014where had Corely even found that picture\u2014Danford cleared his\u003Cbr\u003E\nthroat once more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, the correct image appeared, that of the full Mun, as imaged through the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN\u2019s finest telescope.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COur goal is simple: The Mun,\u201D Danford announced, hoping the previous two slide\u003Cbr\u003E\nmix-ups did not detract from the gravity of this announcement. The four kerbals of his\u003Cbr\u003E\naudience froze in shock, not sure how to respond to this ambitious announcement.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas was the first to react. \u201CLand on the Mun? How much will that cost?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI thought the space program was aiming for only near-Kerbin missions? Why are you\u003Cbr\u003E\nshooting for the Mun?\u201D General Geoffnard commented.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven Bilfrod had something to say. \u201CA Munar mission certainly is possible, but I have\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoubts about your hardware. If you\u2019re currently taking months to build a rocket just to\u003Cbr\u003E\nreach low orbit, how long will an entire Munar landing take to complete?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed. He\u2019d expected this criticism, certainly, but surely one of the council\u003Cbr\u003E\nmembers could show a little support? Bilfrod was the Science Advisor, by Mu! Surely\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe\u2019d appreciate a Munar mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf you\u2019ll turn to Page Seven of the report\u2014thank you Corely\u2014you\u2019ll see our estimates\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor the missions\u2019 cost, timescales, and feasibility.\u201D The intern distributed thick booklets\u003Cbr\u003E\nto each Council Member.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford\u2019s eyes turned to the President. That important CKFN official\u2019s expression was\u003Cbr\u003E\nneutral as he parsed the words of Danford and the Council members.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, he spoke. \u201CAs you mentioned, the USKK has been launching a great deal of\u003Cbr\u003E\nships, achieving greater and greater feats every mission. Their launch capabilities\u003Cbr\u003E\nobviously greatly exceed our own. It may be in our best interests to invest the time and\u003Cbr\u003E\nresources that would be spent on such a Munar mission on improving our\u003Cbr\u003E\ninfrastructure and increasing the number of kerbals we put into orbit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWith all due respect sir, if our eyes are turned anywhere but skyward, we will most\u003Cbr\u003E\ndefinitely fall behind the USKK. All funds are currently put towards constructing and\u003Cbr\u003E\nimproving the rockets we have now; we have none to spare for upgrading our facilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat being said, I believe our current facilities are good enough to allow a Munar\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanding.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nApparently satisfied by this, the President sat back in his chair.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo unless there are further questions, I will continue with our series of missions,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford addressed all members of the Council.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COur initial proposal is a test of the Reaction Control and docking systems, which will\u003Cbr\u003E\noccur in Low Kerbin Orbit. This hardware is the most crucial for our chosen Munar\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission configuration, and we must be completely confident in its ability to keep our\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrew alive on a mission to the Mun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe will launch two ships, a modified Caelus capsule with integrated docking port, as\u003Cbr\u003E\nwell as an unkerballed refueling vessel based off of the Caelus design. These two vessels\u003Cbr\u003E\nwill rendezvous in orbit, then dock together. We will test several methods which will be\u003Cbr\u003E\ncritical for the Munar mission, including fuel transfer and a long-duration stay in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately for us, the USKK has proven that long-term missions are indeed possible,\u003Cbr\u003E\nso we will pack the refueling ship with supplies to maintain our crew on-orbit for at\u003Cbr\u003E\nleast a week, the longest a Munar mission could reasonably take to complete.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COur next mission will then follow up on this framework, and send a Caelus and its\u003Cbr\u003E\nrefueler on a Munar flyby trajectory, the first of its kind. This will both gather\u003Cbr\u003E\ninformation for further Munar testing as well as serve to boost our standing as a leader\u003Cbr\u003E\nof space exploration\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDuring all of this, the plan is to design and build a separate spacecraft which is capable\u003Cbr\u003E\nof landing on the Mun. With the knowledge we will have gained, it will then be trivial\u003Cbr\u003E\nto attach it to a final Caelus\u2013refueler, and put kerbal boots on the ground!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCorely changed the slide to an artist\u2019s impression of a spacesuited kerbal standing on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mun, a flag flying bravely as he gazed towards Kerbin, depicted as a small blue\u003Cbr\u003E\nmarble on the horizon.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow if you\u2019ll all follow along with me in the report, I go over exactly how these\u003Cbr\u003E\nmissions will be carried out\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter the meeting, Danford was supervising Corely\u2019s efforts to put away the projector,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaking sure that he didn\u2019t drop another expensive piece of equipment. Then he noticed\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat General Geoffnard remained in the room. \u201CSomething I can do for you, General?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy yes, Danford. By your estimate, would the refueling vessel exceed 5 tonnes?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUhh\u2026We haven\u2019t compiled a detailed mass budget yet, but it shouldn\u2019t. What, ah,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhy do you ask?\u201D answered Danford, somewhat confused by this request.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI am overseeing a division of the Military which has been experimenting with our own\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket designs, and we\u2019ve come up with a vehicle capable of launching approximately\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat weight to orbit. It promises to be much cheaper and faster to build than the ships\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou\u2019re currently working on at your Facility.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CInteresting,\u201D mused Danford.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe should be able to lend a hand in your situation. Naturally, we don\u2019t have the same\u003Cbr\u003E\ncalibre of engineering talent that you\u2019ve acquired, so some\u2026assistance from your staff\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould be most welcome.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaught off-guard by this offer, Danford had to take a minute before replying. \u201CThis is\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis is really generous of you, General!\u201D Then the Director\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201CWhat\u2019s the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncatch?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo catch, don\u2019t you worry. It\u2019s to both our advantages if we combine forces. We\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nfighting on the same side, after all.\u201D The General\u2019s eyes twinkled, and he exited the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeeting room.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDirector?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA timid kerbal peeked into Danford\u2019s office.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt had been four months since Danford presented to the Advisory Council, and Caelus\u003Cbr\u003E\nIII had run into yet more delays, mere weeks from launch. This left Danford in a\u003Cbr\u003E\nparticularly irritable mood as he tried to resolve them in a timely manner. \u201CWhat is it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe snapped, without even looking up from his desk.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CY-you may want to see this. The USKK, well, they\u2026they\u2019ve launched another\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlready?\u201D Now he did glance up from his paperwork, snorting in annoyance. \u201CThey\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nreally pumping those rockets out. What does this make, the seventh?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CActually, t-there are two rockets. We\u2019re\u2026not getting much, but it looks like they\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nattempting some sort of\u2026docking procedure.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed, rubbing his face with his hands. \u201CLet me see this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe strode out to the main assembly chamber, where a small television sat, perched atop\u003Cbr\u003E\nan engine bell. Sure enough, there was footage of a USKK spacecraft lining up for a\u003Cbr\u003E\ndocking maneuver with another ship, which was already in orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford arrived just in time to see that spacecraft bump into the other one, shaking the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncamera mercilessly. The image had no sound accompanying it, but Danford could easily\u003Cbr\u003E\nimagine the loud THUD such an impact would generate. Several engineers winced.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019ve quite managed to figure out docking yet,\u201D Danford\u003Cbr\u003E\nremarked to the assembled crowd, his dark mood lightening a touch.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNah, his approach was fine, it\u2019s just that the port doors didn\u2019t open, see?\u201D replied\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett. The lead engineer was present as always, keen eyes picking out minute details\u003Cbr\u003E\non the two spacecraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm, why so they didn\u2019t. I wonder what the cause was?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt looks like we\u2019re about to find out, one of the kerbals is going EVA!\u201D one of the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngathered engineers remarked excitedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford hated to admit it, but the USKK certainly did advance its technology quickly. It\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas only a few months ago that the EVA suits were merely an idea. In fact, many\u003Cbr\u003E\nacademics had had doubts that it was even possible to sustain a kerbal outside of their\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft. But despite the naysayers, the USKK had built a functional suit and a jetpack\u003Cbr\u003E\nsystem, which the onscreen kerbal was now using to fly towards the stricken vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeveral engineers chuckled as the kerbonaut on EVA tapped on Uranus VII\u2019s window\u003Cbr\u003E\nand waved to the kerbal inside. However, from his reaction to the damage, it appeared\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat the port had sustained irreparable damage, and so he began the trip back to his\u003Cbr\u003E\nown spacecraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that the excitement had passed, the assemblage of kerbals dispersed back to their\u003Cbr\u003E\nassigned jobs throughout the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, leaving Danford and Dilbrett watching the capsule\u003Cbr\u003E\ncommence its deorbit burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know Brett, what I\u2019d like to know is how on Kerbin they always manage to beat\u003Cbr\u003E\nus to whatever we\u2019re planning. I know the media constantly reports on our mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nplans, so they\u2019re far from secret, but surely we have at least some sort of head start!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett responded. \u201CSimple. It\u2019s their quantity over our quality.\u201D Switching off the TV,\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe faced Danford. \u201CSince our ships are so much more robust than theirs, we can head\u003Cbr\u003E\nstraight for the Mun, while the USKK are dealing with faulty RTGs and malfunctioning\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomponents in low orbit!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed. \u201CYou have a point. Though I would have expected us to launch at least\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomething during these last four months. The USKK\u2019s just launched their eighth Uranus,\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor crying out loud! Surely we can launch a probe or something, just to stop grass from\u003Cbr\u003E\ngrowing on the launchpad?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEveryone\u2019s working as hard as they can on Caelus, I can assure you, with little\u003Cbr\u003E\nresources to spend on anything else. However, the fact that we have to build a refueling\u003Cbr\u003E\nship at the same time certainly didn\u2019t speed matters up though. At the moment we\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nspending most of our time there just integrating it with General Geoffnard\u2019s launch\u003Cbr\u003E\nvehicle. Now, if you\u2019d give Project Jupiter another look, it would provide a common\u003Cbr\u003E\nformat of attachment and\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDilbrett, if we don\u2019t have enough workers and money to work on one little probe, we\u003Cbr\u003E\ncertainly don\u2019t have enough to build a whole new lifter system. Just\u2026\u201D Danford\u003Cbr\u003E\nmassaged his temples. \u201CJust keep working with the staff and resources you have on\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaelus. I\u2019ll see what I can do about getting some more.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford walked back to his office. This was all Bilcas\u2019 fault: that cantankerous old\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal kept on slashing his budget, despite the importance of his mission. He\u2019d have to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbring this up at the next Advisory Council meeting\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe icy wind nipped at Dilbrett\u2019s face, prompting the engineer to wrap his scarf a little\u003Cbr\u003E\ntighter. Why he of all kerbals was required to be present for this launch was far beyond\u003Cbr\u003E\nhim; it would have gone off just as well had he been back at the space facility, rather\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan at this secret military base uncomfortably close to Kerbin\u2019s North Pole. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nimagined himself sitting in a nice, comfortable, climate-controlled room in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u003Cbr\u003E\nenjoying a nice hot beverage. Sure, Danford had told him to make sure the launch of the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndocking target went off perfectly, and he did catch that frozen O-ring on one of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSRBs, but the weather here was absolutely unbearable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven the rocket itself made him uncomfortable. General Geoffnard\u2019s \u2018engineering\u003Cbr\u003E\ntalent\u2019 were basically model rocket jockeys who had never even heard of a liquid-fuelled\u003Cbr\u003E\nengine. All they had on hand were SRBs, and had built their launcher entirely from\u003Cbr\u003E\nthose. He still got a nasty taste in his mouth whenever he looked at the thing. SRBs!\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith them on board, you might as well just not even bother with a guidance system at\u003Cbr\u003E\nall.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, his team had done good work for this rocket. They had stripped a Caelus spacecraft\u003Cbr\u003E\ndown to its structural frame, attached a probe core, expanded fuel system, and a whole\u003Cbr\u003E\nload of batteries, all along with an integrated docking port on top. It was some of their\u003Cbr\u003E\nfinest work, well worth the time it had taken to complete.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll except for the batteries, that is. Dilbrett was itching to get his hands on a proper\u003Cbr\u003E\nsolar panel, but the teams in the labs were having trouble making them work in\u003Cbr\u003E\nvacuum. Thus, the giant array of batteries would have to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA shout from the launchpad distracted him from his musings.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRocket secured, we\u2019re clear for launch!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe crews had completed their final inspection of the rocket and its payload. The ship\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad evidently passed all tests with flying colours. It didn\u2019t even need fuelling; the\u003Cbr\u003E\npropellants were storable and preloaded. Of course, it made for some tense construction\u003Cbr\u003E\nscenarios, requiring strict procedures for booster handling to prevent accidents. How\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe imbeciles in the USKK\u2019s program managed to attach SRBs to every rocket of theirs\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithout blowing themselves up was beyond Dilbrett.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the countdown reached zero, the docking target began its climb into the heavens.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOfficially, this ship had no name, as it was a singular event, this launch. Future\u003Cbr\u003E\nrefueling vessels would launch aboard Caelus lifters for increased payload capacity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, this did not stop the engineers who built the vessel from christening her the\u003Cbr\u003E\nJanus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJanus streaked towards space, slowly arcing over in a rough approximation of a gravity\u003Cbr\u003E\nturn. Rather than the easterly launch profile all ships from either USKK or CFKN had\u003Cbr\u003E\nfollowed up to this point, Janus was launching nearly due south, in a trajectory\u003Cbr\u003E\nspecifically calculated to pass directly over the main Space Facility, where Caelus III sat\u003Cbr\u003E\nready on the launchpad.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the rocket faded from view, Dilbrett went to an intercom, punched in a code, then\u003Cbr\u003E\nspoke into the microphone. \u201CPayload launched as expected and is en route. We are go\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor Caelus III. Repeat, we are go.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun carefully guided Caelus III through the air. The liftoff had been smooth, timed\u003Cbr\u003E\nto coincide exactly with the launch of Janus, but the most difficult part of this ascent still\u003Cbr\u003E\nlay ahead. Danford had decided that they must rendezvous with the refueling craft\u003Cbr\u003E\nimmediately, as even Dilbrett\u2019s huge battery array was not guaranteed to last an entire\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit without a recharge. Once the spacecraft went dead, there was no way to find it in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe sky, let alone give it commands. Thus, it was crucial that Matdun rendezvous with\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe target on her first try.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJenfry, get me a reading on our relative velocity,\u201D she barked.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer crewmate punched a few keys on his console, bringing up the necessary number. A\u003Cbr\u003E\ncursory glance showed her uncomfortably large numbers. Their pitch over maneuver\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad come too late, the consequence of a thunderstorm occurring several hundred\u003Cbr\u003E\nkilometres downrange. As a consequence, too much of their velocity was vertical, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nJanus was blazing along at well over two kilometres per second towards them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wasn\u2019t trained for this, dammit! She had seconds to figure out how to solve this,\u003Cbr\u003E\notherwise Janus would blow right by them, and would be dead by the time she could\u003Cbr\u003E\nget Caelus III into a proper orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJenfry, I\u2019m pitching us down to five degrees above the horizontal. Please advise the\u003Cbr\u003E\nground of this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger tha\u2014wait, five degrees? We shouldn\u2019t pitch over to less than thirty until at least\u003Cbr\u003E\nforty klicks!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJenfry, there\u2019s a time for procedure, and there\u2019s a time for flying by the seat of your\u003Cbr\u003E\npants. I learned that from Bilvin a long time ago.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, it was that other kerbonaut\u2019s last-second maneuver on Caelus II which had\u003Cbr\u003E\nprompted Matdun to try and learn some unconventional skills so that she could prepare\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould for any situations like this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, Roger that I guess. Control, we\u2019re pitching down to a criminally low attitude at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis altitude so we can catch Janus, please confirm.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nStandard procedure dictated that a rocket should not pitch over too far in a dense\u003Cbr\u003E\nairflow for good reason. Deviating more than ten degrees from one\u2019s prograde marker\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould result in an drag distributing itself unevenly on the vessel, causing an\u003Cbr\u003E\nimproperly-controlled rocket to tumble out of control.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately, this spacecraft was in the best hands on Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow\u2019s that relative speed looking like now, Jenfry?\u201D she yelled over the engine noise.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s decreasing quickly! Very quickly! Wait\u2026now it\u2019s stopped decreasing. Uh, is this a\u003Cbr\u003E\nproblem?\u003Cbr\u003E\nCHOOM\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNegative, the second stage ran out of fuel; I just decoupled it. What\u2019s our velocity\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA gentle vibration began as the four engines of Caelus throttled up as the ship continue\u003Cbr\u003E\nto burn towards its target.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRelative velocity has dropped below one hundred metres per second! You\u2019ve\u003Cbr\u003E\ncircularized our orbit and we\u2019re on a direct rendezvous course with Janus, five-point-\u003Cbr\u003E\nthree klicks away. You did it, Matt!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe pilot relaxed her tight grip on the controls. Despite the odds, she\u2019d pulled this off.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sound of cheering came through her earpiece, and a smile spread across her face.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMatdun spoke into her headset. \u201CWe are sitting two hundred metres off Janus\u2019 starboard\u003Cbr\u003E\nside. Requesting permission for final approach, over.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPermission granted, Caelus III, you are clear to begin the docking maneuver. Best of luck.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, Danford!\u201D Jenfry said brightly into the radio. \u201CActivating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite his goofy attitude and lack of professionalism, Jenfry certainly knew how to\u003Cbr\u003E\ndock a spacecraft. It didn\u2019t matter if it was spinning, re-entering an atmosphere, or\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompletely out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel, he would hit that target. And he had done so, in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsimulator, multiple times.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo it didn\u2019t surprise Matdun when the two spacecraft connected smoothly, with a faint\u003Cbr\u003E\nclink. \u201CDocking successful,\u201D she reported. \u201CLinking spacecraft subsystems now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe interior lights dimmed for a second as the spacecraft\u2019s electrical systems coupled,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut quickly increased back to their normal levels.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that the two spacecraft had successfully connected, things could proceed at a more\u003Cbr\u003E\nleisurely pace. Their task was now to confirm that fuel transfer was indeed possible\u003Cbr\u003E\nbetween spacecraft. Flicking several overhead switches, Matdun configured the tanks\u003Cbr\u003E\nonboard the Janus to begin pumping fuel into Caelus\u2019 half-full ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a low whine, fuel pumps began moving mass from the other spacecraft to Caelus\u003Cbr\u003E\nIII.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis looks like it could take a while,\u201D Jenfry commented, as he stared at the tank gauge\u003Cbr\u003E\nlevels, which were increasing at a snail\u2019s pace.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThen let\u2019s take the chance to admire the view,\u201D responded Matdun, looking out her\u003Cbr\u003E\nwindow. The sun had just risen, illuminating the planet below. Despite being a relative\u003Cbr\u003E\nveteran of the Space Programme, she never tired of the sights one saw from orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI think I can speak for everyone when I congratulate you on achieving your objective,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford!\u201D General Geoffnard exclaimed. \u201CAt this pace, we will make it to the Mun years\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore the USKK even leaves Kerbin orbit.\u201D As he so often did, Danford was presenting\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis report on the Space Programme\u2019s most recent launch to the Advisory Council.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilfrod, on the other hand, found value in the technical achievements attained.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDemonstrating that fuel pumps function as expected in orbit opens up so many new\u003Cbr\u003E\nopportunities! Just think, we can have vast refuelling stations in Kerbin orbit, ready to\u003Cbr\u003E\ntop off and send vessels to the Mun and beyond at a moment\u2019s notice! A true spaceport!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, yes, well done Danford.\u201D Bilcas, as always, remained unaffected by the report.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHowever, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the reaction of our population. Public opinion of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Space Programme is rather\u2026lacklustre. Need I remind you about the USKK public\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponse to their missions? Why, I hear their spacecraft and kerbonauts are near-\u003Cbr\u003E\nhousehold names, and it\u2019s not hard to see why! Their docking mission was far more\u003Cbr\u003E\nexciting: the tension when those two spacecraft slammed together, the light-hearted\u003Cbr\u003E\nEVA which followed, the heartbreak which gripped their nation at the presumed death\u003Cbr\u003E\nof one of the kerbals, and then the sheer joy at his discovery days later. It was almost\u003Cbr\u003E\nlike something out of a movie!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut\u2014but it shouldn\u2019t be out of a movie,\u201D Danford protested, \u201CA properly-executed\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace mission should achieve all its objectives without incident. The USKK is\u003Cbr\u003E\ndangerously flippant with their kerbals\u2019 safety, and nearly all our engineers agree that\u003Cbr\u003E\nit\u2019s just a matter of time until something goes horribly wrong!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBe that as it may, their space program certainly has captured their public\u2019s admiration\u003Cbr\u003E\nand support.\u201D The Finance Minister leaned forward. \u201CPerhaps it is time to emulate their\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2018kerbal\u2019 policy, and loosen safety regulations slightly. I am certain the public would\u003Cbr\u003E\ngreatly enjoy the\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford interrupted, horrified. \u201CI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m hearing this. How can you just\u003Cbr\u003E\ncasually suggest we put our crew at risk like that? This meeting is over. Goodnight!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs he stormed out of the meeting room, it occurred to Danford that Bilcas would likely\u003Cbr\u003E\ntake this disagreement as reason to slash the Space Programme\u2019s budget yet again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett would not be pleased\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0USKK: Jebediah Kerman\u2019s Office\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree hours after Caelus III docking\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is bad. This is bad. This is very, very bad.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb paced around the room, unable to keep still. Bill worriedly looked on, concerned for\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis colleague.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRelax, Jeb. Caelus III was just one docking maneuver, nothing really more technically\u003Cbr\u003E\nchallenging than our own.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, but it succeeded!\u201D The Director of the USKK Space Program sat down behind his\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesk, rubbing his temples. Bill had known Jeb a very long time, and had rarely seen him\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis worked up. Most of the time, Jeb projected utter confidence in his goals and vision\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor the Program. Suppressing a smile, Bill realized that his friend was behaving very\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch like his counterpart, the anxious Director of the CKFN\u2019s Space Programme\u2014what\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas his name, Dinfrid?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb, listen to me. The engineers have triple-checked the docking ports on Uranus IX,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand we have a launch date all set up for two weeks from now. Plus, we\u2019ve flown nearly\u003Cbr\u003E\nthree times as many missions as the CKFN!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough we\u2019re about even in terms of successful ones, he added to himself. Nevertheless, his\u003Cbr\u003E\nwords did have a positive effect on the Director, who even cracked a small grin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat is true. We\u2019ll show the CKFN that their docking maneuver\u2019s no big deal; we can\u003Cbr\u003E\nput far bigger and better hardware into orbit!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob burst into the room, breathing heavily, evidently having run a great distance. \u201CJeb,\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019ve\u2013huff huff\u2013I\u2019ve got an important bit of info for you, but you\u2019re\u2013phew\u2013not going to like\u003Cbr\u003E\nit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHit me.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nTaking a second to catch his breath, Bob continued. \u201CThe CKFN is going for the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaelus IV will be a Munar flyby, and they\u2019re pushing towards an actual landing as soon\u003Cbr\u003E\nas possible.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill frowned. \u201CHow do you figure that? Isn\u2019t the CKFN focused on beating our orbital\u003Cbr\u003E\nduration record? That\u2019s practically the whole point of their docking in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWasn\u2019t Janus built to carry supplies up to a long-duration Caelus capsule?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBob makes sense, Bill,\u201D Jeb cut in. \u201CIf our estimates are right, Janus carries far more fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan supplies. If they refueled Caelus in orbit, it should be possible to make it to the Mun\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith the capsule itself.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill scratched his chin. \u201CSo that was basically a Munar dry run. The CKFN has the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapability for a Munshot.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd I\u2019m willing to bet they\u2019re going to make it there the next time they launch.\u201D Bob\u003Cbr\u003E\nbroke in, much recovered from earlier. \u201CBut for some reason they decided not to pull\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe trigger, instead just undocking and returning to Kerbin. Perhaps they had some sort\u003Cbr\u003E\nof malfunction they\u2019re keeping under wraps?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill rolled his eyes. \u201CYou\u2019re forgetting this is the CKFN. I bet their engineers don\u2019t even\u003Cbr\u003E\neat dinner before constructing and testing at least ten prototype sets of cutlery. They\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobably going to launch the real mission sometime in the next couple of months.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThough we mustn\u2019t get too complacent,\u201D Jeb pointed out. \u201CThe fact that they\u2019ve done\u003Cbr\u003E\nall those tests means that they should be able to build another rocket straight away. I\u003Cbr\u003E\nwouldn\u2019t bet on their launch date being more than four to six weeks away.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, they could be trying to lull us into a false sense of security, make us think that\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere\u2019s no way they\u2019ll make it to the Mun before them, then blindside us, and beat us to\u003Cbr\u003E\nit!\u201D exclaimed Bob, punctuating his words with a series of rapid hand jabs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven Bill started to worry, his earlier good mood gone. What would happen if the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN managed to make it to the Mun first? The current wildly positive public opinion\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the Space Program may vanish if the USKK didn\u2019t paint itself as a leader in space\u003Cbr\u003E\nexploration. And once the public left their side, so would the backing of their\u003Cbr\u003E\n(somewhat shady, Bill had to admit) corporate friends. Without money, they couldn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch missions, and without those, why, it just devolved into a negative feedback loop\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich could end in a hundred different ways, none of them good.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re the Director, Jeb,\u201D Bill said. \u201CWhat should we do?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nConsidering his options silently for a minute, Jeb then spoke. \u201CFirst of all, modify\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus IX. It\u2019s a perfectly usable spacecraft, but it just doesn\u2019t have what it takes to get\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the Mun. Keep the crew capsule, but beef up the fuel supplies, and get Danbro\u003Cbr\u003E\ncracking on making a rocket which can take it to the Mun. Finally, schedule a press\u003Cbr\u003E\nconference. I want to let everyone know that we\u2019re going to beat the CKFN one more\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: Vehicle Assembly Building\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo hours after Jebediah Kerman\u2019s press conference\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CSo the USKK\u2019s going to the Mun too.\u201D Danford mused.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt was only a matter of time; we haven\u2019t exactly been subtle about our Munar plans,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nresponded Dilbrett, as he eased a long-handled screwdriver into an odd-looking engine\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomponent.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford turned towards his Chief Engineer. \u201CI have to confess; I\u2019m worried we won\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe able to launch before the USKK does. They have consistently proven that they can\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuild, test, and launch ships much, much faster than we can. What if that Jebediah is\u003Cbr\u003E\nright? What if they beat us there?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThen they beat us there. That won\u2019t exactly change much; we\u2019ll still launch our mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nas planned.\u201D Dilbrett began twisting the screwdriver with increasing efforts, a screw of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsome sort was evidently stuck.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBrett, it could change everything. If the Advisory Council heard that the USKK beat us\u003Cbr\u003E\nyet again, I think\u2013I think they might just shut down this program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on.\u201D Distracted for a moment by the stuck screw suddenly coming loose,\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett paused before continuing, wiping sweat from his brow. \u201CScale back our\u003Cbr\u003E\nfunding, yes. Refuse us access to more suitable facilities, certainly. They\u2019ve done that\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore. But they\u2019d never go all the way to shut down the Programme. We\u2019ve achieved\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoo much, shown that there exists an entire universe out there just waiting to be\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplored.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford\u2019s face broke into a faint smile at his old friend\u2019s words. \u201CSo we have,\u201D he\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhispered, staring wistfully into the distance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen he collected his thoughts and addressed Dilbrett once more. \u201CThere I go thinking\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout the future. This is now, and I need to hear how Caelus IV is coming. The Advisory\u003Cbr\u003E\nCouncil certainly can\u2019t revoke our funding if we do launch first, now can it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlashing a wry grin and withdrawing the screwdriver from the engine module, Dilbrett\u003Cbr\u003E\nbegan listing the mission\u2019s components. \u201CThe Caelus capsule is nearly complete, final\u003Cbr\u003E\nvacuum checks are being done as we speak. Its launcher appears to have developed a\u003Cbr\u003E\nsmall problem with the starboard fuel flow; fortunately, that should be an easily solvable\u003Cbr\u003E\nproblem, the turbopumps just need readjustment. I estimate we\u2019ll be able to launch on\u003Cbr\u003E\nschedule.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood, good. Have you solved the power issues? I recall the first Janus needed several\u003Cbr\u003E\nkilowatt-hours of batteries. That won\u2019t last the whole trip to the Mun. Did you get the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsolar panels to work in a vacuum yet?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett\u2019s brow furrowed, as he unconsciously turned the screwdriver over in his\u003Cbr\u003E\nhands. \u201CUnfortunately, no. We are still dealing with outgassing in hard vacuum. The\u003Cbr\u003E\nR\u0026amp;D wing is researching alternate sealants but they\u2019re coming along slowly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately, they\u2019ve got a prototype fuel cell which should fit our needs well enough. It\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoesn\u2019t output much power, but it should be able to sustain Caelus on its way to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent, and how about Janus? How\u2019s its construction proceeding?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJanus itself is complete. In fact, it\u2019s proven so easy to build, we\u2019re thinking of\u003Cbr\u003E\nconstructing a whole bunch to put into orbit. There\u2019s talk about linking them all\u003Cbr\u003E\ntogether and using their shared fuel supplies to move massive payloads.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThinking about the size a Munar lander would have to be, Danford was glad his\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngineering team was looking that far ahead. \u201CWhat\u2019s your ETA on the launch? Same\u003Cbr\u003E\nas Caelus?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely. We\u2019re using the same lifter design for both this time, so no more polar\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch sites nor SRBs. It\u2019s such a well-used design, the chances of anything happening\u003Cbr\u003E\nare really quite negligible. In fact, this has really shown off how standardized lifter\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesigns really speed up the process of launching, not to mention the safety benefits. If\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe began Project Jupiter, we could have a whole family of lifters, not just the one!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEasy there. We\u2019ve still got to get to the Mun!\u201D Danford chuckled. \u201CThough you do\u003Cbr\u003E\nraise an excellent point. Perhaps when Caelus IV has returned it might be worthwhile to\u003Cbr\u003E\nlook into building some larger rockets. We will have to send an entire lander to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun, after all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery true. Alright then, I\u2019d best get back to check on the engineers. Like I said, we will\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch within six weeks.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford put a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201CLet\u2019s go to the Mun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0USKK: Rocket Testing Grounds\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree Weeks Later, five Weeks after Caelus III docking\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe LV-T45 sputtered once, and died in a billow of black smoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, shoot,\u201D said one of the engineers gathered around the test stand. Danbro thought\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat to be an very apt observation. He stepped forward and addressed the crowd.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGiven that enriching the oxidizer flow didn\u2019t work, anyone else have any bright ideas\u003Cbr\u003E\non how to increase a T45\u2019s thrust? That doesn\u2019t involve nitric acid, thank you very much,\u003Cbr\u003E\nGilberry.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA mustachioed kerbal slowly lowered his hand, crestfallen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CC\u2019mon guys, we\u2019ve got to figure something out by the end of the month, otherwise\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus IX won\u2019t be able to take off, let alone make it to the Mun!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was much discussion among the crowd, but no new ideas. Most suggestions had\u003Cbr\u003E\nalready been tried, to varying degrees of success, most of which made today\u2019s test look\u003Cbr\u003E\npromising in comparison.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat if we went bigger?\u201D a voice rang out.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Chief Engineer looked up. Slouching against a concrete retaining wall was\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoodbro. After his appointment by Jebediah, the kerbal hadn\u2019t really done much; he\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nhung around with the engineers but never really offered solutions. This now appeared\u003Cbr\u003E\nto have changed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBigger how? We could widen the fuel tanks, sure, but what would lift them? There\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nno way we could build engines big enough in the time we have!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNah, just cluster a bunch of T45\u2019s together. You\u2019ll have much more space on the\u003Cbr\u003E\nbottom of a two-meter tank; plenty of room to fit at least six engines.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know, that could work! Doodbro, you\u2019re a genius!\u201D Danbro began giving orders\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the assembled engineers, who quickly scattered to work on the tasks he assigned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo weeks later, Donnand Kerman walked into the spacesuit fitting room at the\u003Cbr\u003E\nTraining Centre, where his friend Rondred was currently locked in battle with a very\u003Cbr\u003E\nharried-looking technician. He leaned against the wall, watching the ongoing dialogue\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith amusement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow see here, if you\u2019d just stop moving, I can get this on you.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNhhgh, I can\u2019t help it! The straps on my legs are too tight; I can\u2019t feel my feet!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJust try to stand still? I need to get this glove on you, but I can\u2019t when you\u2019re flailing all\u003Cbr\u003E\nover the place!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t see why I need another spacesuit! Can\u2019t I just use my old one?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve told you, you are going to the Mun. If something goes wrong, you need a suit which\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan survive for longer than half an hour or so. It takes about a day to get to the Mun and\u003Cbr\u003E\nback, it would not do to have you asphyxiate on your way out there.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut\u2013but I\u2019ll have a capsule filled with air!\u201D At this, Ron actually fell over, looking\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomewhat like a turtle on his back, as he waved his arms and legs helplessly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut if something goes wrong\u2014You know what? Forget it. You\u2019re worse than my two-\u003Cbr\u003E\nyear-old. Just\u2026 Let\u2019s try again in an hour or so, okay? I need a coffee\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe tech passed by Don, grumbling under his breath about adding something stronger\u003Cbr\u003E\nto his coffee, and the other kerbonaut approached his friend, helping him to his feet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey fearless explorer! Has the dreaded Leg Strap finally beaten you?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHa ha, Don,\u201D the other responded, with more than a touch of sarcasm. \u201CThey were on\u003Cbr\u003E\nreally tight! I think I\u2019m lucky that I didn\u2019t lose any toes!\u201D With the straps unbuckled, he\u003Cbr\u003E\nbegan rubbing feeling back into his foot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo in all seriousness, how are you feeling? I mean you\u2019re going to the Mun. You\u2019ll be\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe furthest kerbal from Kerbin in history!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t forget that other kerbal who\u2019s going with me! What\u2019s his name? Dodfrey?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDunfrod?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHeh, you\u2019d better learn it before you climb into the capsule with him, otherwise you\u2019ll\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe in for a very awkward flight!\u201D Don ribbed, but truthfully he had no better idea of\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat the kerbal\u2019s name was. Something starting with B, maybe?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, I\u2019ve got a whole week before we lift off, that\u2019s plenty of time to learn his name!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: Mission Control\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree Weeks Later, Launch Day\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFinal checks complete, we are clear for launch. Good luck you two.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFuel systems pressurized, final countdown commencing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLiftoff in ten, nine, eight\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSpacecraft umbilical disconnected, tower retracted successfully.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026four, three, two, one, liftoff! We have liftoff of Caelus IV on this beautiful summer day!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rocket leaped into the air, in the same way as all its brethren before it. Danford\u003Cbr\u003E\nwatched the readouts; strings of numbers flew by almost faster than he could see. Based\u003Cbr\u003E\nupon these numbers, the rocket was performing well. At the very limit of its weight\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarrying capacity, but it was flying well. Perhaps Project Jupiter was more necessary\u003Cbr\u003E\nthan he\u2019d originally thought.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDespite himself, Danford grinned. This was it! They were finally on their way to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun, and before the USKK, to boot! He looked around the control room, filled with\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbals whose hard work had all led up to this moment. He turned to one of the lead\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrollers.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow\u2019s Janus doing? Ready for launch?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir, she finished final structural checks hours ago and is ready to be rolled out onto\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe launchpad as soon as Caelus is away.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the ETA on that, an hour?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFour, to be precise. We need to make certain that the launchpad is undamaged from\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaelus\u2019 liftoff.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHalf of Danford wanted to just order the crews to roll out and take off straight away,\u003Cbr\u003E\nregardless of launchpad condition, but he knew that it would take much more than a\u003Cbr\u003E\nfew hours to build a new launcher if it toppled over or blew up because the launchpad\u003Cbr\u003E\nfailed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright. Go oversee the procedure personally.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford stayed in Mission Control, keeping an eye on Caelus as it continued its burn\u003Cbr\u003E\ntowards orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0USKK: Kerbonaut Training Centre\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree hours after Caelus III docking\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe have confirmation of the CKFN\u2019s Caelus launch. Repeat, Caelus has launched.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe loudspeaker blared overhead at the Space Centre. All over the complex, kerbals ran\u003Cbr\u003E\nhurriedly to their destinations. Uranus IX stood proudly on top of the launchpad. Like\u003Cbr\u003E\nants, technicians swarmed around it, finalizing tests, taking measurements, and making\u003Cbr\u003E\nsure the fuel pumps were operating at peak efficiency.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2018We have over a week,\u2019 eh?\u201D Don said playfully, as Ron and he jogged towards the\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunchpad. Due to the CKFN\u2019s launch, pace had been stepped up, and Uranus IX was\u003Cbr\u003E\nordered to be launched immediately. Ron, not knowing of this fact, missed the bus\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich normally carried kerbals to the rockets, and had to run the distance himself. Like\u003Cbr\u003E\na good friend, Don was accompanying his Munar-bound comrade. Fortunately, it\u003Cbr\u003E\nwasn\u2019t too far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRon was still struggling with his helmet. While the technician from earlier had\u003Cbr\u003E\nsucceeded and the suit fit well, whoever had designed it certainly did not consider\u003Cbr\u003E\nscenarios in which a kerbonaut would have to put it on while sprinting. As the two\u003Cbr\u003E\nmade it to the pad, Ron finally locked the helmet in place.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright bud, you\u2019d best get up into that rocket! That other kerbal is probably already\u003Cbr\u003E\nup there!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRight\u2026His name\u2019s D\u2014no. B\u2014oh dear. Do you remember?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon shook his head. \u201CGuess you\u2019ll just have to call him \u2018you\u2019, like you did for Gene the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfirst six months we were here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know, that didn\u2019t turn out too badly!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon grinned, as their respective definitions for \u2018too badly\u2019 evidently differed by a large\u003Cbr\u003E\nmargin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSee ya, buddy.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Ron turned towards the elevator, and began pushing the elevator button repeatedly\u2013\u003Cbr\u003E\nas if it would make the car arrive faster\u2013Don spoke one more time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey Ron?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis friend turned towards him, mirrored faceplate obscuring his features.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFly safe,\u201D Don said. Without needing to see his features, he knew Ron was smiling.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a jaunty wave, the soon-to-be extraplanetary kerbal made his way into the\u003Cbr\u003E\nelevator and began moving upwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nHalf an hour later, Jebediah sat back in his chair in Mission Control, taking a sip of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncoffee. It was going to be a long day, but this was it! They were going to the Mun!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAlright people,\u201D he spoke up. \u201CBased upon the CKFN\u2019s trajectory, it looks like they\u003Cbr\u003E\nstuck with a standard zero-degree inclination launch. They\u2019re definitely going to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun today. But we\u2019ve still got a shot at this. Caelus can\u2019t make it to the Mun alone, so\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir Janus spacecraft needs to link up with it. Our radar hasn\u2019t picked up any other\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunches yet, so they\u2019re going to have to loiter in Kerbin orbit for at least several hours\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhile they get the other craft ready for launch.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the technicians spoke up. \u201CThat is unless the CKFN has invested in multiple\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch pads. If they\u2019ve done so, they\u2019ll be able to launch immediately.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CImpossible.\u201D Jeb countered. \u201CThe latest intel from the CKFN shows that their Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgramme is suffering from severe budgetary problems. That\u2019s half the reason they\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch as few ships as they do. Their initial launch site for Janus was only temporary, a\u003Cbr\u003E\nbase on loan from their military. Besides, it\u2019s hardly optimal to launch from such a high\u003Cbr\u003E\ninclination for a Munar trajectory.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nApparently satisfied, the tech turned back to his console and continued monitoring its\u003Cbr\u003E\ndata.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb continued. \u201CIf we play our cards right, we should be able to launch and be on our\u003Cbr\u003E\nway to the Mun before the CKFN can even dock their ships together! What\u2019s the\u003Cbr\u003E\nestimated time till launch now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThirty-two minutes until liftoff, sir,\u201D Gene called out from his position in the front.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s go to the Mun,\u201D Jebediah Kerman said, a wide grin on his face.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E Break Room\u003Cbr\u003E\nFifteen Minutes Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford whistled. \u201CThat\u2019s a big rocket.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett had to concur. \u201CI\u2019m always ripping on the USKK engineers, but if they\u003Cbr\u003E\nmanaged to figure out two metre tankage in less than a month, they must have some\u003Cbr\u003E\nserious skill over there.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre larger rockets really that complicated?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFor sure! It\u2019s not just a matter of scaling up your tanks, you need to design a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompletely new class of engines to stick below them\u2013though it looks like they\u2019ve solved\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat problem by clustering them, very clever\u2013plus the issue of fuel flow, pogo\u003Cbr\u003E\noscillations, along with a higher mass in total so you have to design thicker walls, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot too thick, otherwise you\u2019ll be too heavy to take off\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sighed. Apparently he\u2019d hit a sensitive subject with Dilbrett. He turned his\u003Cbr\u003E\nattention back to the television as his Chief Engineer continued with his rant.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: One Kilometer from Launch Pad\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeventeen Minutes Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nDon stood on the grassy knoll between the Centre and the ocean. After saying goodbye\u003Cbr\u003E\nto Ron, he\u2019d made his way out here, which offered a better view than the limited\u003Cbr\u003E\nvisibility inside the Space Centre. However, he wasn\u2019t the only one who had thought\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis. Several thousand other spectators also shared this field. When news reached the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmedia that the USKK was shooting for the Mun, they went into a frenzy. Already he\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad counted at least thirty-eight reporters interviewing various spectators as to what\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey thought of the impending liftoff, and he\u2019d only just arrived!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe energy of the crowd was intense, a thick buzzing was the result of each kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\ntalking excitedly to his or her neighbor about how they thought the launch would go,\u003Cbr\u003E\nhow the kerbals inside feel right now, or what they had for lunch that day. Seriously, an\u003Cbr\u003E\nolder gentleman was talking about his sandwich to whoever would listen. Don edged\u003Cbr\u003E\naway from that fellow, before he could be subjected to tales of corned beef.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe managed to find a break in the crowd, and miraculously a clear view of the rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe checked his watch. Any minute now\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u201CWe have liftoff! Uranus IX is on its way to the Mun!\u201D Jebediah cried, the joy he felt\u003Cbr\u003E\nclearly audible in his voice, and visible in the form of a wide grin from ear to ear, as he\u003Cbr\u003E\nstood at the back of Mission Control.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was a joyful sight, all seven LV-T45s burned skywards, in a display of pyrotechnics\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat was a sight to be seen by the several thousand spectators gathered around the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Centre.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene was smiling as he turned toward a technician\u2019s terminal, but that quickly faded as\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe noted how many gauges were in the red zone. Already.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhy are the engines running so hot?\u201D he demanded of the tech, who appeared just as\u003Cbr\u003E\nbewildered as himself, stammering out a jumbled response. Unsatisfied, Gene barked to\u003Cbr\u003E\nanother tech, \u201CGet me on the line with Engineering. Now!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt took a minute for the Space Centre\u2019s internal intercom system to patch him through,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand an even longer minute for the lead engineer to answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CH\u2019lo?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanbro, we\u2019re launching Uranus IX and\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat, already? Isn\u2019t that in another three hours?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo, we\u2019re launching now, and its first stage engines are running hot. I need to know\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhy and what we can do to fix them.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh it\u2019s, I dunno, probably something to do with the heat conduction of the engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe had a couple of issues with them during half-power tests.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COkay, how did they behave at full?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh\u2026 Right, we\u2013ah\u2013never got around to those tests.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurely Gene had misheard the Chief Engineer. \u201CWhat?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, we were going to run the engines at full power, but the test stand wasn\u2019t strong\u003Cbr\u003E\nenough, so I told somebody to let the guys in Maintenance know, and so\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene never heard the rest of the kerbal\u2019s response, as he dropped the receiver, leaving it\u003Cbr\u003E\ndangling on its cord. He rushed back to the rest of Mission Control, turning various\u003Cbr\u003E\nabort scenarios over in his mind. Uranus couldn\u2019t fire up its orbital manoeuvring\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines like the CKFN could with their Caelus, as the main engine was hidden inside\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe main structure and couldn\u2019t be deployed until the second stage engine had burnt\u003Cbr\u003E\nout. Perhaps if they shut down all engines when the ship was above the ocean, then\u003Cbr\u003E\ndetach Uranus\u2019 capsule once it was in free fall?\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore he could reach Director Jebediah and let him know of the options available, one\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the techs grabbed his arm.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CS\u2014sir? I have anomalous readings from the engines and I\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure what to\u003Cbr\u003E\ndo.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene looked, and immediately wished he hadn\u2019t. The monitor showed that at least\u003Cbr\u003E\nthree engines had failed to respond to throttle inputs, and two more had ceased\u003Cbr\u003E\nproviding thrust. Judging by the numbers, they had probably exploded, which\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplained the loss of throttle control in the others.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDamn. There went his abort plan. Maybe they could still ride it out until the first stage\u003Cbr\u003E\nburnt out?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSir?\u201D The call came from Trajectory Management and he somehow knew what the\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal would say before he spoke. \u201CIt appears the rocket is suffering from a lack of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol; it is beginning to experience a small-scale tumble.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was apparently the understatement of the decade, as a wide assortment of\u003Cbr\u003E\nwarnings began appearing on monitors around the room. Alarms blared overhead,\u003Cbr\u003E\nproducing a tremendous din, which was not helped by kerbal after kerbal attempting to\u003Cbr\u003E\nget his attention, each seeming to not comprehend that yes he was aware that the rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould smash itself to bits in less than two minutes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally reaching the Director, Gene spoke quickly. \u201CSir, as you can tell, we have suffered\u003Cbr\u003E\na loss of at least two first-stage engines. This will lead to Uranus IX impacting the\u003Cbr\u003E\nground in less than one minute, thirty seconds. Our abort scenarios are all but useless,\u003Cbr\u003E\nas they were designed for the previous eight Uranus lifters. What are your orders?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb for once in his life seemed to not know what to say. \u201CI\u2014ah\u2014well\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSir. We are under an extreme time pressure. What are your orders?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2013are there any ab\u2013abort scenarios left?\u201D Jeb croaked, the wide grin but a distant\u003Cbr\u003E\nmemory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere is one. We may be able to jettison the crew capsule and deploy parachutes, in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nhopes that they would yank the capsule away from the rocket. But\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat sounds good!\u201D Jeb brightened somewhat. Then he realized Gene hadn\u2019t finished\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeaking. \u201CBut what?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere are approximately seven thousand spectators on the ground outside the launch\u003Cbr\u003E\nsite. If a rapidly-spinning rocket impacted their group with enough fuel inside to make\u003Cbr\u003E\nit to the Mun\u2014\u201D He swallowed, not having to finish the sentence. \u201CThen what do we\u003Cbr\u003E\ndo?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene\u2019s mouth suddenly went dry. He barely managed to get two words out. \u201CRange\u003Cbr\u003E\nSafety.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201CNo.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb, we have thirty seconds. It\u2019s either the crew or the spectators.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile Gene had phrased it in the form of a choice, it was really no choice at all. The\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbonauts knew death was a part of the many risks space exploration carried, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nordinary civilians were just there for a rocket launch. Jeb knew this too, and his eyes\u003Cbr\u003E\nhardened.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFine. But I\u2019ll\u2013I\u2019ll do it myself. I owe the crew that much. Have we\u2013have we managed to\u003Cbr\u003E\nestablish contact with them?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene shook his head as he led the Director over to the Range Safety console. Hopefully\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019ve blacked out due to g forces by now, he thought to himself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlipping back its protective plastic cover, Jebediah manoeuvred his hand over the Big\u003Cbr\u003E\nRed Button. \u201CForgive me, Harv,\u201D he whispered, before slamming his fist down.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKa-thunk.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs had happened a year ago during Aether I\u2019s first flight, a series of electronic pulses\u003Cbr\u003E\ntravelled from the Button, through Mission Control, to the rocket itself. This time, no\u003Cbr\u003E\nwelding accidents had severed the control lines leading to the explosives. This time, the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncommand executed successfully.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor but a single instant, Uranus IX shone as bright as a star.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E Break Room\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately Afterward\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2014and that\u2019s not even taking into account vibration effects, I mean the larger tank\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeans at least four times the surface area so you need to do a whole new set of scale\u003Cbr\u003E\nmodel tests in order to\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford watched the television as Dilbrett prattled away in the background, unsure of\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat he was seeing. Did the picture glitch out? Where a rocket flew a minute ago, he\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould see nothing but white. Then the picture refocused on what was a smear of smoke\u003Cbr\u003E\nacross the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDimly Danford noticed Dilbrett\u2019s voice trail away in the background. When he glanced\u003Cbr\u003E\nover, he saw that the other\u2019s eyes had become cold and steely, his earlier extension of\u003Cbr\u003E\nrespect towards the USKK\u2019s engineers instantly revoked.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford raised a trembling hand to his mouth, not sure what to say.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: One Kilometer from Launch Pad\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately Afterward\u003Cbr\u003E\nDonnand Kerman stared at the sky. Where once flew his best friend was now a mere\u003Cbr\u003E\npuff of smoke. The shock wave hit him next, mussing his hair and imparting a ringing\u003Cbr\u003E\nin his ears.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNO!\u201D he screamed at the sky. \u201CNo, no, nonononononono.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe broke down, falling to his knees in the grass, as the first bits of debris began raining\u003Cbr\u003E\ndown around him, lighting small fires in the grass.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe crowd had now realized fully what had happened, and screams came from those\u003Cbr\u003E\nassembled as they attempted to get out of the way of the bits and pieces of flaming\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket which came raining down like the world\u2019s worst hailstorm.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDully, Don reflected that Range Safety explosives\u2014as there was no doubt to what type\u003Cbr\u003E\nof explosion that was\u2014attempted to vaporize as much rocket as they could, but were of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncourse unable to annihilate every part of a spacecraft. No type of explosive was nearly\u003Cbr\u003E\npowerful enough. Most big pieces\u2013those larger than a kerbal\u2013had been torn apart\u003Cbr\u003E\nenough to not pose too much of a threat, but even a fist-sized chunk of metal could still\u003Cbr\u003E\ndo a fair amount of damage, especially if it\u2019s on fire and travelling at half the speed of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsound.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost of the crowd around him had begun to hurriedly gather their things and depart\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore more rocket could fall on their heads, but Don cared little about his surroundings\u003Cbr\u003E\nat the moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRon\u2026\u201D he whispered. \u201CRon, why?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: Caelus IV, Low Kerbin Orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwenty Minutes Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRomfarer\u2019s eye, where are those snacks?\u201D Bilvin searched vainly through various nooks\u003Cbr\u003E\nand crannies in her compartment of the spacecraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHee hee hee!\u201D her co-pilot\u2019s voice rang out through the intercom sounding suspiciously\u003Cbr\u003E\nlike his mouth was full.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDammit Jenfry, you\u2019d better not have taken them all! Can\u2019t you spare me just one?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore Jenfry could respond, Danford\u2019s voice came through her earpiece.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJenfry, Bilvin, are you there?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRoger that, boss, we\u2019re here. Dealing with a bit of a missing inventory at the moment,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut nothing too major.\u201D She could hear Jenfry munching happily on his pilfered stash,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand resolved to get her snacks back somehow. She continued. \u201CWe\u2019re still a good\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwenty minutes out from our plane-change maneuver though, why are you checking in\u003Cbr\u003E\nso early?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe USKK tried to launch a mission to the Mun as well, less than half an hour ago.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHah, let\u2019s see them try! We\u2019ve got a good head start alread\u2013wait, what do you mean\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2018tried\u2019?\u201D Danford\u2019s somber tone and use of the past tense suddenly hit home.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUranus IX exploded twenty minutes ago, with all crew aboard lost.

Just\u2013just keep that on your minds during the mission.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, rog\u2013roger that,\u201D Bilvin said, and clicked off the comm. \u201CGee\u2026\u201D she remarked to\u003Cbr\u003E\nJenfry, all snack-related escapades forgotten.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShould we say something?\u201D her companion asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t know what to say. By Mu, what do you say in this case?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI took Ancient Languages in university, I have something in mind.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead then.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJenfry cleared his throat, then began speaking another language. Bilvin knew little of it\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeyond the fact that the CKFN named their rockets in it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRequiescent inter sidera, respicit in caelo,\u201D the kerbal spoke slowly over the intercom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D Bilvin inquired, her curiosity piqued.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey will rest among the stars, remembered forever,\u201D Jenfry responded. \u201CI thought it was\u003Cbr\u003E\nfitting.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFitting indeed,\u201D Bilvin said, as she stared out her capsule window at the planet Kerbin,\u003Cbr\u003E\nfar below.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: United News Network Broadcasting Station, Parking Lot\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo Hours Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan Kerman leaped out of his car and towards the station. It figured that the biggest\u003Cbr\u003E\nnews story to hit the USKK since the end of the War would happen on his day off! If he\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould maybe get an eyewitness interview, or bribe a reporter who had been on the\u003Cbr\u003E\nscene for pictures of the explosion\u2013this day might just be salvageable after all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs he burst through the front doors, an intern stopped him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSir, I have some news for you.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat is it?\u201D He dimly recalled that this kerbal worked in the main broadcasting centre,\u003Cbr\u003E\nor something. It was hard to keep track of all the interns.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDo you remember that kerbal you interviewed? About a month or two ago?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI interview a lot of kerbals, you\u2019re going to have to be more specific.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat kerbonaut, you know, the one who left the Program?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRight, Desdin. I never forget a face; did you know that? Wait. Did he contact us to ask\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor a second interview?\u201D The gears of Erdan\u2019s mind turned. If he could score an\u003Cbr\u003E\ninterview with this kerbal commenting on the Space Program now, why that would be a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompletely new angle on the story!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEr\u2026no sir. Anyways, he seems to have gone missing, sir.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan\u2019s mood shifted nearly as quickly as that rocket had exploded. \u201CAnd you\u2019re telling\u003Cbr\u003E\nme this\u2026why?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe intern now appeared to be realizing that interrupting Erdan today, at this time, for\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat appeared to be pointless nonsense was a Very Bad Idea. \u201CI just thought\u2026you\u003Cbr\u003E\nshould\u2026know.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUnless he wants another interview, don\u2019t talk to me again. Got it? I\u2019m very busy.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nErdan didn\u2019t even wait for a response from the now-whimpering kerbal. He stormed by\u003Cbr\u003E\nand began turning story ideas over in his mind again. Maybe he could find someone\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith singed hair, that would really add a personal touch to the story\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2013I don\u2019t think I can do this anymore, Erdrin,\u201D Don said, shakily. It was an hour after\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe explosion, and the two veteran kerbonauts of the Space Program sat together in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbonaut Training Centre.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean? We all saw what happened, but the two of us have got to stay\u003Cbr\u003E\nstrong. With Ron\u2026gone, we\u2019re the most senior members of the program\u2019s kerbonauts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you leave, who knows how many will follow suit? Without kerbals, this Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram\u2019s going nowhere.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2014he was my best friend, Erdrin. I need some time\u2026some space to just deal with\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd I respect that. We can properly mourn Rondred ourselves. But at the moment the\u003Cbr\u003E\nother kerbonauts just saw two of their own die out there. We\u2019ve got to reassure them,\u003Cbr\u003E\nkeep them in the program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe was my friend,\u201D Don repeated, in a very small voice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI know.\u201D Erdrin said sympathetically as she patted her fellow kerbonaut\u2019s shoulder.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe are gathered here today to remember the loss of two of our own.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was a beautiful day at the Space Centre, with birds singing and not a cloud in the sky,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthree days after the accident. Rationally, Don knew it was unreasonable for the sky to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe dark and pouring with rain just because a rocket blew up, but that didn\u2019t change the\u003Cbr\u003E\nway he felt.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe sat quietly among those gathered, as Jebediah Kerman led the memorial service. He\u003Cbr\u003E\nmainly talked of the two kerbals, and their contributions to the space program. Don\u003Cbr\u003E\ncouldn\u2019t bear to keep listening, so he looked around at the assembled audience. His\u003Cbr\u003E\ngaze fell on a sobbing older female kerbal, dressed in black. Ron\u2019s mother? he thought.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut he told me his parents were\u2014oh. He realized that another kerbal was lost in the\u003Cbr\u003E\nexplosion, and mentally kicked himself. Of course the other kerbonaut also had a life, a\u003Cbr\u003E\nfamily, and people who would miss him. It wasn\u2019t all about Ron, was it? This added a\u003Cbr\u003E\nspike of guilt to the grief he had been feeling constantly for the last few days. Another\u003Cbr\u003E\nwave of guilt washed over him as he realized he still couldn\u2019t recall that other kerbal\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nname.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah did not forget though, and proclaimed that Rondred and Bobfrey Kerman\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould be forever immortalized on the grounds of the Space Centre by two kerbal-sized\u003Cbr\u003E\nflags. Designed originally for a USKK kerbal to plant on the Mun once they got there,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe first production unit would stand as a memorial for the two lost kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe flag itself was merely black fabric, broken up by a pair of stars shining brightly into\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe night, marking the two kerbals who had left this world forever.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree hours after the funeral service, Bob and Bill argued away in one of the Centre\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeeting rooms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe can\u2019t let this stop us from pressing onwards. We must try again.\u201D Bob spoke in a\u003Cbr\u003E\nclear voice, his stutter when talking to other kerbals than Jeb mysteriously gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStressful events can do a lot to a kerbal, Bill thought sarcastically.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTry again? Bob, we lost two kerbals!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s a tragedy, but we mustn\u2019t let this set us back.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re willing to just write off this as a setback!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what it is! Those kerbals knew what they were signing up for! We can do more\u003Cbr\u003E\nintensive tests next time.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere won\u2019t be a next time. We need to stop all launches, review all personnel, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake sure it never happens again! Like the CKFN, you don\u2019t see their rockets blowing\u003Cbr\u003E\nup!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThey have nothing they can teach us. By Harv, we\u2019re the USKK, we should lead\u003Cbr\u003E\naerospace design!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe are, but we can\u2019t just go shooting off rockets blindly, we need to have some sort of\u003Cbr\u003E\nidea of where we\u2019re going!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe Mun, or have you not been paying attention for the past year?\u201D Bob said nastily.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore Bill could come up with a suitably venomous retort, he caught sight of Jeb\u003Cbr\u003E\nwalking by the door, a large box in his arms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDirector! Can we speak with you?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHesitantly, Jeb walked into the room. \u201CHey Bill, Bob.\u201D His face, once filled with joy at\u003Cbr\u003E\nsharing his visions during these meetings, was blank. Bill and Bob immediately began\u003Cbr\u003E\nbombarding Jeb with questions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb, what are we going to do?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhere do we go?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShould we continue the Uranus rockets?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDo we start anew?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat about the engineering staff?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Director held up a hand.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2014I don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s not my job to know, not anymore.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you saying, Jeb?\u201D Bill asked, cautiously, noticing that the box Jeb was\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarrying was filled with the contents of his Director\u2019s office.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs of twenty minutes ago, I have resigned from the post of Space Program Director.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill, you\u2019re my successor, and Bob, you will assist him. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m no longer fit to\u003Cbr\u003E\nlead the Program. Those kerbals died because of me.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb, you can\u2019t leave! The CKFN just made it to the Mun, and they\u2019ll surely land a kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere first! We need you now more than ever!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Bob, but this decision is final. Goodbye you two, and\u2013ah\u2013good luck.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith this, the former Director turned around and walked out of the room, deaf to any\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore of their pleas.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill and Bob glanced at each other worriedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis\u2026 This isn\u2019t good,\u201D commented Bob, wide-eyed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was not often the two agreed on something.\u003Cbr\u003E\n?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCHAPTER IV:\u003Cbr\u003E\nCOMEBACK\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: Tracking Station\u003Cbr\u003E\nFive hours after Uranus IX disaster\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat is your current rotational velocity, Caelus IV?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve reached \u2018bout\u2026four degrees per second. What are the techs calling this again? The\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2018barbecue\u2019 manoeuvre? It\u2019s starting to feel a lot like a barbecue in here!\u201D Jenfry\u2019s voice came\u003Cbr\u003E\nthrough the radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLizby Kerman did not approve of this attempt at a joke, the situation was a little too\u003Cbr\u003E\ntense for her liking. Caelus III had steadily risen in temperature on its journey to and\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the Mun, and this manoeuvre was the best chance at the spacecraft and its\u003Cbr\u003E\noccupants surviving the trip home. The manoeuvre simply consisted of spinning Caelus\u003Cbr\u003E\nalong its main axis, to prevent any one side from getting too hot. Whether this had\u003Cbr\u003E\nworked or not was her primary concern at the moment. She pursed her lips. \u201CRight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat is the change in the capsule\u2019s thermal readings following the manoeuvre?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was a significant pause. \u201CAh, they\u2019ve definitely gone down. The heat looks like its\u003Cbr\u003E\nincreasing by \u2018bout\u2026point two degrees every minute? Maybe every two?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nLizby let out a breath. At least this had some effect on Caelus\u2019 heating problems. \u201CAll\u003Cbr\u003E\nright, I will check with the technicians to see if they\u2019ve come up with anything more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou should still have a significant margin before critical spacecraft systems begin to\u003Cbr\u003E\noverheat.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat \u2018bout us kerbals in here? I grew up in the northern CKFN, I\u2019m just not used to this sorta\u003Cbr\u003E\nheat!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe capsule will return to Kerbin in less than two hours. You will be fine.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLizby shut off the radio before Jenfry could respond. She did not have the time nor\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesire to listen to the kerbal whine any further about how hot it was getting inside the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapsule. He\u2019d been at it for a few hours now, and Lizby had been at several points\u003Cbr\u003E\nsorely tempted to point out that perhaps some of the hot air inside the capsule was\u003Cbr\u003E\noriginating inside Jenfry\u2019s mouth. Of course, while that would not be the proper thing\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor a Capsule Communicator to tell the kerbonauts, it certainly did not stop her from\u003Cbr\u003E\nthinking it to herself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe reached the conference room and opened the door. Within, a committee of\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnicians and engineers were set up, all discussing among themselves the best way to\u003Cbr\u003E\nreduce Caelus\u2019 heating problems. Upon spying Lizby\u2019s entrance, a bunch of kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\nrushed up to her.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDelta-t? Delta-t?\u201D they asked, over and over.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLizby\u2019s brow furrowed. Delta-t? She\u2019d heard engineers using the phrase \u2018delta-v\u2019 to\u003Cbr\u003E\nrefer to a spacecraft\u2019s velocity change before, but this was new. Then it hit her. Of course.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were asking about the new change in temperature in the capsule. Engineers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes she thought it best if they just stuck to their job of building rockets, and left\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe communication aspect of it to others. That was her job, after all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStill, she was stuck with them for the time being, and had to live with it. \u201CThe capsule\u003Cbr\u003E\nhas executed the\u2014 \u2018barbecue manoeuvre\u2019 as planned, and the temperature increase has\u003Cbr\u003E\ngone down to nought-point-two degrees per minute.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was much cheering and back-slapping among those assembled. Danford Kerman,\u003Cbr\u003E\nseated at the far end of the table, even perked up some; he had been downtrodden ever\u003Cbr\u003E\nsince first learning of Caelus IV\u2019s thermal issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent!\u201D The Director said. He even stood up from his chair. \u201CThis gives them\u003Cbr\u003E\nenough of a safety margin to make it back to Kerbin!\u201D Then his brow furrowed. \u201CDo we\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave a cause for the overheating problem in the first place, and how we\u2019re going to fix\u003Cbr\u003E\nit?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett Kerman, scribbling furiously, looked up from his stack of papers. \u201CYes\u2014and\u003Cbr\u003E\nno. We do know what is overheating the capsule: that\u2019s the Sun.\u201D There were a few\u003Cbr\u003E\nchuckles from around the room, but Danford merely raised an eyebrow.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUnfortunately, it looks like Caelus just can\u2019t handle this sort of heat. We\u2019ve got a\u003Cbr\u003E\nmishmash of differently thermal conductive interior components, meaning that it\u2019s next\u003Cbr\u003E\nto impossible to model what the heat\u2019s going to do, let alone dissipate it! With low orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\nmissions, we didn\u2019t run into this problem because Kerbin blocked out the sun half the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime, but with a multi-hour Munar transit time, the heat is just not leaving the capsule.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford stroked his chin thoughtfully. \u201CSo how do we fix that? Just reconfigure Caelus a\u003Cbr\u003E\nbit?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2018A bit\u2019 would be, unfortunately, an understatement. The amount of work necessary to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbring Caelus up to snuff would be on par to just building a whole new capsule\u003Cbr\u003E\naltogether!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nLizby noticed that many engineers, including Dilbrett, were now looking at Danford\u003Cbr\u003E\nexpectantly. Danford noticed this as well, after a moment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat, you guys seriously expect us to build another capsule? Don\u2019t you remember\u003Cbr\u003E\nhow long Caelus took to finish?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf Caelus can\u2019t safely make it past \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, then a reconfiguration wouldn\u2019t exactly\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nLizby sniffed. More of those engineers\u2019 terms and acronyms. She could tell that this\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould very quickly devolve into an argument quite full of them, and besides, she had\u003Cbr\u003E\nfar more important work to do back in the Tracking Station, rather than watching these\u003Cbr\u003E\nclowns debating spaceship designs for hours.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs she returned to her post, she could hear the rising argument three corridors away.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDays after Caelus III returned from the Mun, Calbin Kerman lounged in the chair atop\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis guard tower. Guard duty here was a tremendously boring occupation; nothing of\u003Cbr\u003E\nnote ever happened on the border, least of all at night. At least he could look at the sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe stars were visible above the trees surrounding him, and away from the bright lights\u003Cbr\u003E\nand bustle of major CKFN cities, they shone especially bright. His attention was\u003Cbr\u003E\ncurrently skywards, wondering about what might lay beyond.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuddenly, he heard a noise from the woods, a strange crackling and rustling.\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately springing to attention, he gazed out into the darkness beyond his post\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nspotlights. Seeing nothing, he leaned back in his chair, but remaining mindful of his\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurroundings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe noise returned. It sounded almost like an animal dragging itself through the\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderbrush. Sitting bolt upright, he reached for a pair of binoculars and twisted a dial\u003Cbr\u003E\non the side. This supposedly enhanced their image at night, but all he found it did was\u003Cbr\u003E\ndecrease the contrast and turn everything a sickly shade of green. Still, every little bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nhelped.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter warily searching the darkness for the source of this strange noise, he found it. A\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal stumbling his way through the forest, who appeared very, very lost. From the\u003Cbr\u003E\nstyle of this figure\u2019s clothes, he evidently hailed from the USKK, but they were so torn\u003Cbr\u003E\nand covered in dirt you could barely see what colour they originally were. This kerbal\u003Cbr\u003E\nmust have dragged himself through the USKK\u2019s barbed wire perimeter fence.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalbin quickly pulled his jacket around himself, and put on his helmet. He needed to\u003Cbr\u003E\nget down there and see what this kerbal wanted, be it good or bad. A thought occurred\u003Cbr\u003E\nto him, and he grabbed his service revolver and slipped it into his holster, just in case.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClimbing down the ladder of his watchtower, he approached the gate. The mystery\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal had slumped against its bars, looking disconcertingly like a prisoner. Calbin\u003Cbr\u003E\ngrimaced. Based upon some things he\u2019d heard about the USKK, that particular\u003Cbr\u003E\ndescription of the wasn\u2019t terribly inaccurate. Approaching the figure, he called out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWho goes there? This is the border of the CKFN. What is your business here?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot responding immediately, the kerbal coughed, then spoke in a croaky voice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2014I need help.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that he was closer, Calbin could see that the kerbal was bleeding. Whether this\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas from crawling through the barbed wire or from another injury, Calbin could not\u003Cbr\u003E\ntell, even under the glare from the spotlights.\u003Cbr\u003E\nQuickly, he scanned the surrounding forest for any others (he was still a border guard\u003Cbr\u003E\nafter all), but everything seemed clear. He opened the gate and helped the kerbal inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D Calbin asked, half-carrying the mystery kerbal into the guard\u003Cbr\u003E\nstation\u2019s break room. There was a couch there he could rest on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis guest coughed once. \u201CDes\u2014Desdin.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWait a sec\u2014you\u2019re one of those USKK kerbonauts! From the Space Program!\u201D Even\u003Cbr\u003E\nout here, kerbals still got news of what was going on in that other country, albeit\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomewhat delayed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot\u2014not anymore.\u201D Desdin began to cough, and fell to his knees. Quickly, Calbin lay\u003Cbr\u003E\nhim down on the couch and propped up his head.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHey, hey, hey. Stay with me. Help is on its way; you\u2019re going to be just fine.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe former kerbonaut smiled faintly, but did not speak. Still, he seemed unlikely to fall\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto unconsciousness any time soon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTurning away from the kerbal for a minute, Calbin went to his locker, where the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmanual on how to deal with such scenarios as this was stashed. Flipping through the\u003Cbr\u003E\npages, he found the chapter he was looking for: \u2018Defection Directives: What to Do When\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Other Side Comes to You\u2019.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe leaned against the wall and began reading. Fortunately, it was a short chapter,\u003Cbr\u003E\noutlining the basic procedures of what would happen next. All he\u2019d have to do was\u003Cbr\u003E\nradio his commanding officer, and the authorities would soon arrive to pick his charge\u003Cbr\u003E\nup. The kerbal would be collected and debriefed (naturally, one would want to get as\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch information as they could from the defector), then the kerbal would be integrated\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto mainstream CKFN society, under a new name.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be a bit of a turbulent time for the poor kerbal, but judging by his state, Desdin\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas used to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, you\u2019ve said that already, Bilvin. Just calm down, okay?\u201D Gusbin told her.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut these are actual pictures of the Mun! Up close, not through telescopes or\u003Cbr\u003E\nanything!\u201D The two were part of a small crowd clustered outside the Space Facility\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ndarkroom, where a technician was developing the photographs Caelus III took while on\u003Cbr\u003E\nits historic mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, I know they\u2019re exciting, but you were there last week; why are you so excited to\u003Cbr\u003E\nsee it again? If anybody\u2019s got a right to be excited, it should be Danford; he\u2019s done the\u003Cbr\u003E\nmost work out of all of us!\u201D Indeed, the Director of the Space Programme stood nearby,\u003Cbr\u003E\nregarding the door to the darkroom patiently. The door looked more like an entrance to\u003Cbr\u003E\nsome sort of highly fortified bunker, with multiple locks and reinforced hinges,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomplete with a hand-lettered sign stating: \u201CDO NOT OPEN\u201D.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, after what seemed like hours, the locks were undone and door opened up,\u003Cbr\u003E\nrevealing the developer, carrying a stack of photos. The largest ones he displayed at the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfront of the room, while a few smaller copies were distributed to the crowd.\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately, there were ooohs and aaahs from everyone upon seeing the photos; this\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas the Mun, and while it did look an awful lot like a large potato someone had let fall\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto the dirt, these were the best photos of this celestial body anyone on Kerbin had ever\u003Cbr\u003E\ntaken.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven more interesting were the images of the Far Side; while only illuminated partly by\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe sun, one could clearly see the increased number of craters and scarring caused by\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mun basically acting as a shield for Kerbin from the cosmic hailstorm of meteoroids\u003Cbr\u003E\nand their ilk. There was even a long canyon snaking its way across the surface. Gusbin\u003Cbr\u003E\nwondered what that would look like from the surface. Imagine the geological processes\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich must have taken place to produce such a distinctive feature!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nGusbin even let his mind wander a bit, imagining himself standing on the lip of that\u003Cbr\u003E\ncanyon, seeing its grey walls slope downwards. Of course, this was nearly entirely\u003Cbr\u003E\nimaginary; the photos were not nearly sufficiently detailed to show much more than the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncanyon\u2019s outline, but Gus did not let that stop him. For the first time since joining the\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgramme, he keenly felt that their goal was near. The fact that they got these pictures\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas proof that they were close. While Danford hadn\u2019t revealed anything official, talk\u003Cbr\u003E\nabounded throughout the Space Facility that work was soon to commence upon the\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket that would take kerbals to the Mun. There was truly so much to be learned out\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere, and they\u2019d soon find out what!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK: Space Centre Grounds\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree Months Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana Kerman, secret agent extraordinaire and current personal assistant to Bob\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerman, walked along one of the Space Center\u2019s sidewalks. She pondered how\u003Cbr\u003E\nunpredictable life could be; one day you were chasing down CKFN spies halfway\u003Cbr\u003E\naround Kerbin, the next you were fetching papers for a Space Program founding\u003Cbr\u003E\nmember. Still, this was a good assignment, all things considered. At least no one was\u003Cbr\u003E\nshooting at her. So far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe noted the chill breeze at her back. Three months had passed since Uranus IX had\u003Cbr\u003E\nexploded, and winter was fast approaching, with no plans to launch any more ships\u003Cbr\u003E\nanytime soon. The effects of that explosion could be still felt; even now governmental\u003Cbr\u003E\nagents walked the grounds, investigating various departments\u2019 practices and\u003Cbr\u003E\ndetermining whether the Program was safe enough to allow it to continue. They\u2019d sent\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir preliminary reports to Parliament several weeks ago, and Joliana anticipated\u003Cbr\u003E\nofficial word to come from the capital fairly soon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe arrived at the Administration Building, greeted Bob\u2019s secretary, and entered that\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal\u2019s office. Bob was seated at his desk, scribbling away at something when Joliana\u003Cbr\u003E\nwalked in. After a minute, the kerbal finished writing and looked up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, what do you have for me, Joliana?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFirst of all, sir, Bill Kerman has left for the capital on \u2018urgent business\u2019.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDid he specify what sort of urgent business?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo sir, he just up and left this morning. I have a few contacts in the capital; I could\u003Cbr\u003E\nsend someone to keep an eye on him when he arrives in Kolus City if you\u2019d like.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo need, he\u2019s undoubtedly just meeting with the Prime Minister\u2019s office again. I must\u003Cbr\u003E\nsay, Joli, he spends as much time over there as at the Space Center!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe must be discussing important matters concerning the Space Program then,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwouldn\u2019t he?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFor certain, but the Program\u2019s Director really ought to spend more time at the Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nCenter itself, don\u2019t you think?\u201D Bob snorted. \u201CHumph, regardless, I\u2019m not interested in\u003Cbr\u003E\ndiscussing Bill\u2019s choice in travel destinations, what else do you have? Any more news\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the engineers?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not good. A further ten quit the Program this morning.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTen? That leaves nearly less than half as many workers as we had three months ago.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanbro\u2019s trial and subsequent incarceration really shook many of the staff\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfidence, they are afraid the same thing could happen to them.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob sighed. \u201CI\u2019m not even going to get into how stupid that is.\u201D He rubbed his chin\u003Cbr\u003E\nthoughtfully for a moment, then spoke. \u201CEver since Jeb left, Bill\u2019s been giving me side\u003Cbr\u003E\njobs, little projects to keep me busy. It\u2019s obvious he doesn\u2019t want me messing about with\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Program itself. But I can\u2019t keep doing nothing for much longer. Bill\u2019s so busy with\u003Cbr\u003E\nnegotiation that he can\u2019t see that the Program is breaking up right under his feet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana, are there any senior engineers left? It\u2019s past time to crack down on these\u003Cbr\u003E\nquitting epidemics, rather than waiting for Bill to come through and actually make\u003Cbr\u003E\npolicy changes.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir, there are in fact three crew chiefs working in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E right now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThen get my hat, we\u2019re going to pay them a visit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the two arrived at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, its atmosphere was a far cry from the bustling,\u003Cbr\u003E\nenergized hub it had been three months ago. It did not help that the place felt like a\u003Cbr\u003E\nghost town with half the original workers still there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe crew chiefs sat on a few discarded boxes in front of Bob and Joliana. The one in\u003Cbr\u003E\nfront, in charge of Capsule Integration, addressed the two. \u201CTo be honest, Mr. Bob, it\u2019s a\u003Cbr\u003E\nbit of a relief to see you paying us a personal visit. There\u2019s been a lot of talk among the\u003Cbr\u003E\nworkers that upper management has just forgotten about us.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D Bob responded, raising an eyebrow.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot only that,\u201D another chief, from Propulsion, spoke up. \u201CThere\u2019s talk you guys want\u003Cbr\u003E\nto distance yourself from this department; given what happened with Uranus,\u201D She\u003Cbr\u003E\nsighed. \u201CCan\u2019t say I blame ya, though.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe third chief, Electrical Subsystems, added to this tale of woe. \u201CThat\u2019s not all. I heard\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat you guys have been working pretty closely with Werhner\u2019s labs on some of his\u003Cbr\u003E\ninventions. Do you know how many stupid gadgets he wants to stick on our rockets?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe gesticulated wildly. \u201CThe Uranus V \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E incident is exactly why that\u2019s a bad idea. We\u003Cbr\u003E\nneed more investment in rocket tech, so that we\u2019re not forced to cluster out-of-date\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines and wind up with overheating issues like on IX!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana frowned. The engineers seemed to be annoyed about a lot of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nadministration\u2019s decisions, but she wasn\u2019t sure how much of this was even within Bob\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nauthority to fix.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob did not share this uncertainty, it appeared. \u201CDon\u2019t you worry. I give you my word\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019ll look into these issues. In the meantime, I want to ask about the disappearing of our\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineering talent. Where is everyone going?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know sir, but without much of a goal, no one really knows what to work on\u003Cbr\u003E\nanymore. We\u2019re pretty hesitant to start work on anything new; remember what\u003Cbr\u003E\nhappened to Danbro?\u201D Propulsion offered dejectedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNonsense. Whatever happened to the reason you got into the Program in the first\u003Cbr\u003E\nplace?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nElectrical stroked his chin thoughtfully. \u201CWell, now that you mention it, I remember\u003Cbr\u003E\nstaring up at the sky one night after a long shift at the chemical plant. This was when\u003Cbr\u003E\nWerhner\u2019s discovery was all over the news, so there was lots of talk about rockets and\u003Cbr\u003E\nspace travel, that sort of thing. I got to thinking, \u2018What if I could make a difference?\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat if I could help explore what\u2019s up there?\u2019 I think with everything that\u2019s happened,\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2014I sort of lost sight of that goal; this just became another job to me. I think that\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobably the same story with a lot of other kerbals as well.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere we go!\u201D Bob said happily. \u201CRemind your crews of why they wanted to join the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Program in the first place, and all the things we\u2019ve done so far. We\u2019ve put kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\nin space, for Harv\u2019s sake, something unheard of five years ago. This is the cutting edge of\u003Cbr\u003E\nresearch and technology, after all.\u201D The chiefs were smiling and nodding at these\u003Cbr\u003E\nwords. Bob continued. \u201CHowever, the thing about the cutting edge, is sometimes we get\u003Cbr\u003E\ncut. What happened with Uranus IX was regrettable, but we need to pick ourselves up\u003Cbr\u003E\nand keep moving towards the future! The CKFN certainly hasn\u2019t been resting on their\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaurels the past few months, have they? Let\u2019s show them what rocket science looks like\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen it\u2019s done right!\u201D He punctuated this final word with a fist thrust into the air.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of the surrounding engineers had stopped what they were doing to listen.\u003Cbr\u003E\nListening to Bob\u2019s words brought smiles and faraway looks to the kerbals\u2019 eyes as they\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoo remembered why they got into the business in the first place. When Bob finished,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere were cheers and a general smattering of applause across his small audience.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCapsule Integration shook Bob\u2019s hands, his eyes wet with what looked a lot like tears.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell said, sir. Well said.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nElectrical added to this. \u201CI can\u2019t promise you miracles, sir, but\u2014but I\u2019ll talk to my\u003Cbr\u003E\nworkers. We\u2019ll do our best for the Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s all I ask,\u201D Bob responded. \u201CNow, I have to go; let me know if you have any\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore issues, all right?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nReturning to Bob\u2019s office, the kerbal sat down at his desk, and turned his attention to\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo Joli, what do you think of the engineers\u2019 position? Are they ready to start building\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore rockets?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob rarely asked others for their advice, so Joliana answered warily. \u201CI think your little\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeech today did revitalize the crews somewhat, but over a longer period, they will lose\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat motivation and workers will keep leaving the Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIndeed? And how would you propose to fix that?\u201D Bob asked. He appeared to be in a\u003Cbr\u003E\nvery good mood, he was leaning back in his chair and smiling, two rare characteristics\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the kerbal. Joliana continued, she\u2019d oblige him for as long as this mood lasted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell sir, I believe the main problems with the engineers stem from both guilt for the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndestruction of Uranus IX, and the poor administrative policies enforced on them so far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou took care of some of that guilt, by replacing it with pride, but they will need\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomething to strive for in the long-term. I\u2019m not entirely certain of the specifics of what\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat should be, though.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CInteresting. And the administrative policies, how would you fix those?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, I suppose the only real option would be to get Bill to give the engineers more\u003Cbr\u003E\nfunding, better equipment, larger and more strictly monitored testing setups, et cetera.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanbro was only a symptom of a larger problem; we need to fix the lack of support the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers have been getting at its source, or we\u2019ll just get more Uranus IXs.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI agree with you on both counts, Joliana.\u201D Bob then raised an eyebrow. \u201CHowever, we\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan\u2019t exactly just march up to Bill and ask him to change those policies. For one, Bill\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoesn\u2019t even have that authority. Any changes will have to be extensively negotiated\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith the Board of Directors, as well as making sure the budget is balanced with our\u003Cbr\u003E\naccountants, etc. Besides, Bill would have a fit if he knew I was pushing for such\u003Cbr\u003E\ndramatic policy changes. No, it will have to be something else.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir. If I may, why does Bill seem to dislike you so much? Surely it\u2019s not beneficial\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the Program if one of its senior members is unable to change its policies?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, the kerbal\u2019s never liked me much to begin with, but with the recent loss of\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah and the chaos consuming the Program, I actually think he\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll take\u003Cbr\u003E\nover. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been assigning me these tiny jobs, in the hopes that it will keep\u003Cbr\u003E\nme distracted.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, to be completely honest sir, I\u2019ve seen the efficiency at which you complete those\u003Cbr\u003E\ntasks. I have no doubt that if you put your mind to it, you could replace Bill as Director.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd quite frankly, do a much better job at it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThank you for your confidence in me, Joli. I also don\u2019t doubt that I could easily take\u003Cbr\u003E\nover. But that\u2019s not the way I want to go about things. Any old idiot can steal the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspotlight\u2014as we are seeing with Bill\u2019s performance so far\u2014but it takes far more skill to\u003Cbr\u003E\nremain on the edge of the public\u2019s eye, carefully staying out of full view, controlling\u003Cbr\u003E\nevents to be in your favour.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo is that what we\u2019re doing? Manipulating Bill into doing what you want?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob chuckled. \u201CI suppose you could put it that way, but it sounds much better if you say\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe\u2019re giving Bill the \u2018guidance\u2019 to do what\u2019s best for the Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCan\u2019t argue with that, sir.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGlad to hear it, Joli.\u201D Bob paused for a moment. \u201CNow, do you recall a conversation we\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad about five months ago? Where you passed on to me your employer\u2019s most recent\u003Cbr\u003E\norders?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana sighed. \u201CAs I said at the time, sir, they are not orders. As \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s representative in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Program, I have a responsibility to pass on its wishes for paths they wish for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Program to follow at some point in the future. As they do not have direct control\u003Cbr\u003E\nover the Space Program\u2014your Board of Directors has gone so far as to patent any\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket tech, ensuring their continued dominance in the field\u2014it is only natural they\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould want to have a bit more input, particularly with the more militarily-oriented\u003Cbr\u003E\napplications.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUnited Secret Intelligence. Not so secret if you keep letting me know you\u2019re their\u003Cbr\u003E\nrepresentative, now are they?\u201D Bob leaned back, grinning.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve been over this. I can\u2019t exactly perform my job at maximum efficiency if you do\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot know the extent of my capabilities. Besides, I require some sort of official agency\u003Cbr\u003E\nbacking me up; you\u2019d hardly listen to these recommendations if I told you they came\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom myself alone.\u201D Joliana intoned, annoyed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll right, Joli.\u201D Bob dismissed the explanation, then continued. \u201CAs I\u2019m sure you\u003Cbr\u003E\nremember, they most recently asked us to create a subset of the Program to launch their\u003Cbr\u003E\nown types of missions. As you said, they\u2019d be primarily focused on military\u003Cbr\u003E\napplications.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf I may, sir, why are you bringing this up now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBecause this is how I\u2019m going to fix the engineers\u2019 troubles. They want and need better\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnology and testing procedures.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana had no idea how this was in any way related, and said as such.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s very simple, Joli. Making any direct policy change, such as the ones the engineers\u003Cbr\u003E\nwant, takes a whole lot of negotiation with accountants, the Board, and many other\u003Cbr\u003E\ndepartments to make sure everything is in order. However, no such negotiation is\u003Cbr\u003E\nrequired to create a new division of the Space Program, provided the necessary funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nare already available.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe only question is, why would you ever want to do something like that,\u201D muttered\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana, still very much confounded by Bob\u2019s plan. \u201CAre you seriously considering just\u003Cbr\u003E\nputting all the engineers into this new department? Because Bill will most certainly hear\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout that, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E won\u2019t exactly give much of a choice in terms of missions; it will\u003Cbr\u003E\nderail any Munar plans, for example. The suggested subdivision was intended to be an\u003Cbr\u003E\noffshoot from the Program, not its replacement.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat if I told you I wasn\u2019t planning on transferring any engineers at all? As your\u003Cbr\u003E\nagency will be providing funds, all we have to do is open the Division and request as\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch as we require from them in equipment costs, wages, and development work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince this division is an official part of the Program, we could easily transfer those to the\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo you\u2019re not actually planning on building rockets for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo. Well, at least not yet. The Program is far too fragmented to work on two major\u003Cbr\u003E\nprojects at once; our priority is still to beat the CKFN to the Mun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo if you\u2019re not employing any engineers in this new division, then who is going work\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSimple. I\u2019ll take the best of our rocket-focused scientists and technicians from\u003Cbr\u003E\nWerhner\u2019s labs. The old fellow doesn\u2019t know what to do with them all, anyway. The\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers don\u2019t want situations like Uranus IX to happen again, yet they want more\u003Cbr\u003E\nadvanced rocket technology. This division will do rocketry research, as well as testing\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis new tech to make sure it is safe for the mainstream rockets coming out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd any technology the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u2019t want will go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E! This satisfies the engineers,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe administration, and the agency, all in one. That\u2019s\u2013that\u2019s genius!\u201D Then Joliana\u2019s eyes\u003Cbr\u003E\nnarrowed. \u201CYou can\u2019t have come up with this all in the five minutes we\u2019ve been\u003Cbr\u003E\ntalking.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201CYou are correct; I did not.\u201D He opened the top left drawer of his\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesk and withdrew several sheets of paper. Upon them was the early version of an\u003Cbr\u003E\nofficial request to open this new division. \u201CI first had the idea a couple of months ago,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbased upon your employer\u2019s \u2018recommendation\u2019. From there, I simply tweaked the idea\u003Cbr\u003E\nof a separate division to best suit our needs. And there we have it, the salvation of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Program. Today\u2019s trip to the engineers was to make absolutely sure that they\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould be totally receptive to this plan.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd I presume they were?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COf course! The engineers are just begging for strong leadership; you saw how they\u003Cbr\u003E\nreacted to my little speech in there.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut I thought you said you didn\u2019t like the spotlight?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why this division will take the place of a leader. Its designs will propel the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers forward.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou sound very confident that this division will produce things of value. What if\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere\u2019s nothing new to learn in rocket science?\u201D While in favour of the scheme, Joliana\u003Cbr\u003E\ntried to poke any hole in it she could. If this new division flopped (or was vetoed by\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill), \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E would be very annoyed, so Bob had to be prepared for any eventuality.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Bob grinned. \u201COh, I have my sources, primarily among those techs in Werhner\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nlabs. They inform me we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of the field; giving more\u003Cbr\u003E\npriority to their research will unlock technology which will have us walking on the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun while the CKFN is still floating about in low orbit.\u201D Bob had evidently done his\u003Cbr\u003E\nhomework; he had an answer for every question Joliana threw at him.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSatisfied, Joliana acquiesced. \u201CIf you say so, sir.\u201D She picked up the papers and scanned\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem. \u201CIn the meantime, how do we go about creating this division?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, aside from finalizing the document here, all we really need is Bill\u2019s signature.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Director\u2019s authorization will give us all the clearance we need to open up the new\u003Cbr\u003E\ndivision.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow on Kerbin are you going to get Bill to approve this? He\u2019ll take one look and rip\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis paper up.\u201D She brandished the papers in question. \u201CLooking at some of these terms,\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou\u2019re asking for a great deal of control over the division. If I didn\u2019t know you were\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoing this for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u2019d think you were starting your own private space program here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why I need you to translate it into something a little less readable, preferably\u003Cbr\u003E\nfull of very long words, so that Bill won\u2019t even bother to read it. He\u2019s been so busy\u003Cbr\u003E\nlately, I\u2019d be surprised if he had time to get through one paragraph.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well sir, I will get right on it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo days later, Joliana approached Bill Kerman outside the Administration Facility.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Director was freshly returned from the capital and looking very tired and harried.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMr. Bill! Do you have a spare moment?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill stopped and turned, a long-suffering look on his face and bags under his eyes. \u201CYes,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut I only have a minute or two. What is it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe engineers need authorization to open up a new dedicated testing division of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Program. They say it will prevent accidents like the one on Uranus IX.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat sounds like a good plan. How\u2019s it being funded? Will I have to talk to the\u003Cbr\u003E\naccountants and work out a budget for the division?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CActually, no. That\u2019s taken care of, as you can see here, on Page 12.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill leaned closer, taking a look at the paragraph in question. \u201CAh yes\u2026I, err, see.\u201D The\u003Cbr\u003E\nDirector was obviously having difficulty deciphering the meaning of the words Joliana\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad enlisted one of her lawyer contacts to write. Finally having enough, Bill\u003Cbr\u003E\nstraightened. \u201CWell, I, uh, presume everything else is in order; I\u2019ll authorize it. Do you\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave a pen?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a smooth motion, Bill signed the form Joliana and Bob had been working on for\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe past couple of days. Then, he set off again towards his office, leaving a very pleased\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal behind.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately after talking to Bill, Joliana joined Bob in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. A makeshift podium\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad been set up, and the kerbal was preparing to make a speech to all the engineers,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwho were gathered together in the main assembly chamber, among various rocket bits\u003Cbr\u003E\nand pieces.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a sense of pride, Joliana spoke. \u201CI\u2019m pleased to report that Bill signed the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndocument, sir. The Advanced Projects Division is now officially authorized. The timing\u003Cbr\u003E\nworked spectacularly; Bill was in such a rush that he didn\u2019t even read the fine print.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot that he would have found anything; your legalese was most impressive. Now, it\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime to share the good news with our crowd.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob walked to the podium, greeted by cheers from those who remembered his speech a\u003Cbr\u003E\nfew days ago.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe plan for this speech was to reveal the new division, or the Advanced Projects\u003Cbr\u003E\nDivision, as it was called. Had Bill had not signed the document, Bob would have had\u003Cbr\u003E\nto speak more inspiration for the engineers to continue their work, while frantically\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrafting an alternate plan to achieve his goals.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHello, all!\u201D Bob spoke into the microphone. \u201CI\u2019m pleased to report that myself and my\u003Cbr\u003E\ncolleagues of the administration have heard your complaints and are in the process of\u003Cbr\u003E\nbrainstorming solutions as I speak!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe engineers, already pleased by Bob\u2019s return, began cheering louder.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe first and foremost solution is as follows. As of this moment, the administration is\u003Cbr\u003E\nopening the Advanced Project Division, a subset of your work here in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Its\u003Cbr\u003E\nprimary focus will be to research and develop new rocket technologies. No longer will\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou be forced to work with discarded tech from Werhner\u2019s labs, or have to do all your\u003Cbr\u003E\ntesting on your own; this new division will provide everything you need. Now, all you\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave to do is what you do best: put rockets together!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe largest cheer yet greeted Bob\u2019s words. Joliana smirked. The engineers had been\u003Cbr\u003E\nignored and patronized for so long that they were overjoyed when someone actually\u003Cbr\u003E\nlistened to their concerns. They would be loyal to Bob for a long, long time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly, for all that kerbal\u2019s talk about not preferring the spotlight, he handled this\u003Cbr\u003E\nsort of thing very well. Indeed, Joliana had been surprised when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E had made her the\u003Cbr\u003E\nassistant of this seemingly quiet, unassuming kerbal in the Space Program. She\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nargued that providing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s guidance would be a waste and that even if Bob would lack\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe authority to carry the advice out. However, she was never as happy to be proven\u003Cbr\u003E\nwrong as he was today. With the access to space launch facilities and technologies\u003Cbr\u003E\ngranted by this department, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E would be able to finally mount some sort of defence\u003Cbr\u003E\nagainst the CKFN\u2019s military\u2019s previously-unrestricted access to space.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana would be keeping a close eye on Bob in the future; the kerbal had nearly single-\u003Cbr\u003E\nhandedly managed to turn a nearly untenable situation into a win for all parties\u003Cbr\u003E\ninvolved. That sort of skill would be very dangerous if ever directed against her and\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s own interests. Still, a new dawn approached for the Space Program; while a\u003Cbr\u003E\ntremendous amount of work still awaited everyone, the USKK was back in the race to\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: Facility for Space Research, Danford\u2019s Office\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo Weeks Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford leaned back in his desk, watching as the engineer standing in front of him\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrew the presentation to a close. The kerbal in question was lead engineer on the Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgramme\u2019s division working on the Aurora capsule, Caelus\u2019 successor.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford reflected on what he\u2019d heard so far. It was really quite remarkable what the\u003Cbr\u003E\nteam had accomplished; in just over three months, they\u2019d come up with a far more\u003Cbr\u003E\ncapable and technologically-advanced ship compared to Caelus. The engineer\u2019s face\u003Cbr\u003E\npositively shone with pride at what they\u2019d done as he pointed at a technical diagram of\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe capsule. Danford liked that, it really showed how dedicated his crew was towards\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Programme.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe engineer concluded his speech. \u201CSo as you can see sir, Aurora has a completely\u003Cbr\u003E\nredesigned thermal cooling system, which can and will prevent any incidents like the\u003Cbr\u003E\none with Caelus III on its Munar trip. Do you have any further questions?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford did. \u201CI noticed that the capsule appears to have two docking ports, one fore\u003Cbr\u003E\nand one aft. Are those both going to be functional?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir, the capsule will indeed be able to connect to two spacecraft at once. In fact, we\u003Cbr\u003E\nenvisioned it as connecting both to the Munar lander as well as a Janus refuelling\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh excellent,\u201D Danford then glanced at some of the more detailed specifications for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspacecraft. \u201CWhat\u2019s this I see? There\u2019s no liquid fuel carried on board?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis was a suggestion from one of the Propulsion Engineers; we wanted to make\u003Cbr\u003E\nAurora as safe as possible. So we did away with conventional liquid fuel and oxidizer,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand designed the monopropellant in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system to be used for main propulsion as\u003Cbr\u003E\nwell as fine position control. This will make for a ship which won\u2019t detonate if a tank is\u003Cbr\u003E\nbreached, as well as giving it exceptional long-term capabilities. The fuel will be just as\u003Cbr\u003E\nviable two years from now as it is today. Of course, that does come at the cost of\u003Cbr\u003E\nreduced delta-v once in orbit.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201D Danford replied. \u201CAurora should mainly act as a command-and-\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol vessel for larger spacecraft or carry crew up to low orbit. I don\u2019t expect it will\u003Cbr\u003E\nhave to venture out into deep space on its own. Speaking of which, you mentioned\u003Cbr\u003E\nJanus during your presentation. What\u2019s the news on the updated version of that\u003Cbr\u003E\nvessel?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh yes, Janus is a very simple craft so it was trivial to simply widen the body to\u003Cbr\u003E\naccommodate Aurora\u2019s ventral docking port, as well as fit more fuel as well as an engine\u003Cbr\u003E\non-board. In fact, we have an early version of that ship ready for launch, which can\u003Cbr\u003E\noccur as soon as Jupiter I is ready.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFantastic. I just heard from Dilbrett that he\u2019s planning to launch the Jupiter I prototype\u003Cbr\u003E\nwithin the week, if everything goes well.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat is excellent news. I think this is everything you need to know about the capsule.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u2019ll get an intern to give you a complete technical readout of our designs.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford leaned back in his chair. \u201CThat would be much appreciated, thank you. Now,\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeaking of launch dates, how long do you think the capsule will take to complete?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe engineer deflated somewhat, losing his earlier good cheer. \u201CWell, sir, that\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomething I wanted to talk to you about.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGo ahead.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe Vehicle Assembly Building is proving to be entirely unsuitable for our needs; the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfacilities simply aren\u2019t up to the task of the high-precision work necessary to assemble\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe capsule. We\u2019ve tried to outsource as much as possible, but the most we can give you\u003Cbr\u003E\nis a simple boilerplate, with only basic systems included.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm. So basically we can\u2019t get to the Mun without better tech?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExactly, sir. There\u2019s just no way to build a spacecraft which is rugged enough to get to\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mun and stay there with our current equipment.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve been trying for months to get Bilcas to allocate more funds to the Space Program\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor precisely that reason, but he keeps refusing me. Maybe this news will pressure him\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto finally coming through for us.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHopefully, sir. In the meantime, what would you prefer my team focus on? We could\u003Cbr\u003E\nassist Dilbrett\u2019s team with the Jupiter prototype, get it to the launchpad a few days\u003Cbr\u003E\nahead of schedule?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo, no, your time is better spent elsewhere. Continue working on Aurora, at the very\u003Cbr\u003E\nleast build the boilerplate, as we can launch that. Make sure your team is ready to begin\u003Cbr\u003E\nbuilding the capsule as soon as the required facilities become available. When you\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nthrough with that, focus on the Munar lander. We\u2019re going to want to put a kerbal on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe surface, after all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery good sir! I\u2019ll let my team know!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nA few days later, in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, Danford paid a visit to Dilbrett\u2019s team. \u201CHow goes the\u003Cbr\u003E\nJupiter?\u201D the Director called out.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA kerbal in the middle of welding a seam in a rocket engine, face covered by a mask,\u003Cbr\u003E\nlooked up. Upon seeing Danford, he shut off his torch and lifted the mask. Beneath was\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett\u2019s face, smeared with grease. \u201CHey Danford! Everything\u2019s going well, thanks!\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u2019s good to see you! Want a coffee?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett pointed at a battered, ancient coffee machine which looked like it predated the\u003Cbr\u003E\nGreat War. Danford wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it burned coal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, I\u2019ll pass, thanks.\u201D He looked up at the body of the prototype Jupiter I, looming\u003Cbr\u003E\nlarge overhead. \u201CI see you\u2019re making good progress on the rocket. When\u2019s the expected\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch date?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShouldn\u2019t be much more than a few more days,\u201D Dilbrett said, somewhat preoccupied\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith working his thick welding gloves off his fingers. \u201CThe fuel tanks are complete, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nonce we finalize work on the main engine, she\u2019ll be ready to fly!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford took note of the massive engine bell. \u201CThat certainly is a main engine. I think I\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould fit my car in there!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHa! We\u2019ve taken to calling it the \u2018Mainsail\u2019 around here, the thrust it\u2019ll output is\u003Cbr\u003E\ncomparable to one of the city-states\u2019 total power plants\u2019 outputs in a year!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford chuckled. \u201CSo will this be the final version of Jupiter which will fly, Brett?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot entirely. The rocket you see here is just the final prototype of the Jupiter I lifter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen we launch, it won\u2019t even have a second stage on board; it\u2019s just to test the engine\u003Cbr\u003E\nand to make sure that all systems work properly. 2.5 metre rockets are no joke, after\u003Cbr\u003E\nall.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDilbrett\u2019s smile faded as his thoughts obviously turned to the USKK\u2019s ill-fated Uranus\u003Cbr\u003E\nIX. Danford tried to take his mind off the situation by changing the subject.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, uh, I heard you guys were planning on making this recoverable?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvidently, this was the right thing to say, as the smile returned to the lead engineer\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nface. \u201CWe are! Of course, today\u2019s rocket won\u2019t be, but there are plans to outfit future\u003Cbr\u003E\nrockets with the technology.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo will it let you land the rocket stages safely?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, the initial designs will add landing legs and parachutes to the Jupiter first stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis should let the stage come back down, be refurbished, and reused on a future\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunch. This should bring costs down a great deal!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s good to hear. Apparently we\u2019re going to need more advanced facilities in order\u003Cbr\u003E\nto make it to the Mun with Aurora, so we\u2019re going to have to do some major cost-saving\u003Cbr\u003E\nefforts around here. Recycling our rockets will be a great way to do that!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCost-saving? You mean we won\u2019t be able to replace the coffee machine?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe machine in question chose that moment to unleash a particularly nasty-sounding\u003Cbr\u003E\ngurgle, and belched a cloud of thick, black smoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, well, we\u2019ll see about the coffee maker. I may be able to pass its replacement off\u003Cbr\u003E\nunder \u2018kerbal rights\u2019.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent, that\u2019s good to hear! I\u2019m beginning to suspect it may be possessed by some\u003Cbr\u003E\nsort of demon.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CReally? You believe in that sort of thing? Why that\u2019s just\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe coffee maker let out more smoke, this time emitting a noise which sounded a little\u003Cbr\u003E\ntoo much like a roar.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2014err\u2014I\u2019ll look into it. Good luck on the rocket, Brett!\u201D Danford beat a hasty retreat,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaking a note to get that coffee maker replaced\u2014or at the very least exorcised\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\nimmediately.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree days later, Danford grinned as he watched the Jupiter I rocket roll out to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nlaunchpad. Completed at last, the ship shone in the morning sun. For a change, Mission\u003Cbr\u003E\nControl wouldn\u2019t be monitoring this launch. No complicated payload stood atop this\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket, rather it was Instead, the engineers had the run of the launch controls. This\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould be as simple as one of the old sounding rocket launches they\u2019d done a year or\u003Cbr\u003E\ntwo ago. Rocket lifts off, rocket reaches highest point, rocket comes down. Simplicity\u003Cbr\u003E\nitself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA shout from the launchpad alerted him that fuelling had completed, and the rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas nearly ready for takeoff. Soon enough, the ship\u2019s umbilical cables disconnected,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand it leapt into the air.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLeapt was perhaps an understatement; the thrust of the main engine was designed to\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarry both an upper stage and a sizable payload, so its Thrust to Weight ratio was far\u003Cbr\u003E\ngreater than the rockets Danford had seen launched so far.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the blink of an eye, it cleared the tower and was on its way to climbing higher than\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe mountains near the Space Facility. Soon, it was almost too small to see.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford looked over to the engineers manning a makeshift Mission Control; a tech kept\u003Cbr\u003E\na radio dish pointed at the rocket, receiving telemetry and performance data from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nvehicle. This was displayed on a number of screens all connected together with some\u003Cbr\u003E\nunholy tangle of wires. Two engineers monitored the data, and a printer was busily\u003Cbr\u003E\noutputting the most important information onto a long strip of paper.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHow\u2019s the rocket looking?\u201D the Director asked. One engineer looked up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShe\u2019s performing very well, but the higher acceleration is playing all sorts of havoc\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith our aerodynamic results. She\u2019s barely made 5 klicks and already is at Mach 1!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other piped in, not looking up from his monitor. \u201CWe\u2019re getting a nasty\u003Cbr\u003E\ntemperature rise on the upper portions of the rocket, I don\u2019t think that nose cone\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing to last much longer!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the tech said that, several numbers went into the red, and suddenly they cut out\u003Cbr\u003E\naltogether.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell dang, there goes the transceiver, probably fried by the heat. If that\u2019s gone, we\u003Cbr\u003E\ndon\u2019t have any control over the ship anymore.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe kerbal pointed up to the sky, where the trail of smoke left by the rocket was now\u003Cbr\u003E\ntilting to the left, as the rocket tipped over and began its long fall back to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately, the Space Facility wasn\u2019t near any civilian-populated areas.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford was somewhat worried by this. \u201CIf you lose control authority when things get\u003Cbr\u003E\nwarm, isn\u2019t that bad?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second engineer chuckled. \u201CWell yeah, if you wind up going over Mach 2 under 10\u003Cbr\u003E\nklicks, shock heating\u2019s going to cook your goose for sure. With an actual payload\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderneath, there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll reach those speeds that early into the flight.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first tech showed Danford the long strip of output numbers. \u201CLook at these thrust\u003Cbr\u003E\nand temperature readings on the Mainsail itself! Gorgeous!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford thought that the numbers looked rather like random values, but he smiled and\u003Cbr\u003E\nmhmm\u2019d at the kerbal. Still, if the engineer was happy, Danford was happy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe walked away, adding elements to his mental checklist. Now that the launcher was\u003Cbr\u003E\nwell on its way to completion, all the Space Programme needed was to build Aurora,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand design a Munar lander system. The Mun drew ever closer, and with the USKK out\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the picture, his workers had the luxury of time and being able to double-check their\u003Cbr\u003E\nwork.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey were making excellent progress; he had no doubts that one day soon the CKFN\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould land a kerbal on the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0USKK: Space Centre, Bob Kerman\u2019s Office\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne Month Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u2026and as you can see, sir, the Advanced Projects Division is fully staffed and working\u003Cbr\u003E\nat optimum efficiency. However, they have yet to actually produce anything of value.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs I said, Joli, give them time. Aerospace developments don\u2019t happen overnight!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana\u2019s jaw set. \u201CWith all due respect, now that the CKFN has proven they have a 2.5-\u003Cbr\u003E\nmeter launch vehicle, it may be best to re-task the division to focus primarily on a wide-\u003Cbr\u003E\nbodied lifter of our own.\u201D She picked up a grainy surveillance photograph and waved it\u003Cbr\u003E\naround to punctuate her point.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe sighed. \u201CPerhaps you could get them to dig up the Uranus IX specifications, focus\u003Cbr\u003E\non solving the first-stage overheating issues?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob was adamant. \u201CGive them time. Uranus IX was a rush job, built just to beat the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN to the Mun. It failed. The techs need to take things slowly and make sure they\u003Cbr\u003E\ndon\u2019t miss any rocket designs which could be more efficient than the current ones.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well sir.\u201D Joliana grumbled. She pulled another paper out of the stack she was\u003Cbr\u003E\ncarrying. \u201CIn other news, it looks like there are still complaints about lack of direction\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the Space Center staff, though those have decreased substantially from the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineers. In my opinion, sir, we need to get Bill to decide what the Space Program\u003Cbr\u003E\nshould focus on.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the mood in the capital? With those government observers finally gone, maybe\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill will want to finally focus on the Program? Then again, he\u2019s been over there for a\u003Cbr\u003E\ngood week now. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that something big is going\u003Cbr\u003E\ndown.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know, sir. I\u2019m a field agent first and foremost; the politics going on in\u003Cbr\u003E\nKolus City are no concern of mine.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHuh. Well, whatever it is, it\u2019s been consuming a great deal of Bill\u2019s time. In fact\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob\u2019s face drew into a wide grin, the one Joliana associated with one of his schemes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh no, she thought to herself. What does he have planned now? \u201CSir?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt may be time to take a little vacation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CA\u2026vacation?\u201D Whatever it was Joliana expected to come out of Bob\u2019s mouth, it was\u003Cbr\u003E\ncertainly not this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, but not to the Dazian Beaches. I\u2019ll have need for your skills; I\u2019m planning to go\u003Cbr\u003E\nhunting for a certain kerbal, one who can tie.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd that kerbal would be\u2026?\u201D The question was almost redundant, as she realized\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere was only one possible answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJebediah Kerman,\u201D was Bob\u2019s response, and Joliana sighed, suspicions confirmed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWith all due respect\u2014\u201D Before she could commence her rant on why bringing back\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah was a terrible idea, Bob cut her off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI know what you\u2019re going to say; his policies caused the death of three kerbals, chaos\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the engineering department, and put us seriously behind in the space technology\u003Cbr\u003E\nrace with the CKFN.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou are correct, sir.\u201D Those three topics were precisely what Joliana was going to\u003Cbr\u003E\nmention.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why I want to bring Jeb back, but in an advisory role only. You can\u2019t deny the\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal had vision! His plans and ideas brought us to dominate Low Kerbin Orbit for\u003Cbr\u003E\nnearly a year, doing research which is still bearing fruit for scientists here on Kerbin.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThen launch more kerbals into orbit. It doesn\u2019t take Jebediah to tell you that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe game has changed, Joli. Jeb\u2019s got more imagination than the entire administration\u003Cbr\u003E\nof this Program, and we\u2019re going to need that if we want to beat the CKFN to the Mun,\u003Cbr\u003E\nespecially with their advantages over us so far.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana massaged her forehead. \u201CAll right. Suppose Jebediah would be an asset to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram, rather than the liability he\u2019s proven to be. How do you propose to find him?\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe\u2019s dropped completely off the map.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI have a few ideas, the first and foremost his old hometown. There\u2019s bound to be\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomeone there who he\u2019s talked to recently.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou do realize you don\u2019t require me if all you want to do is talk to Jeb\u2019s old friends,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncorrect?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, I do require your connections. Bill\u2019s likely to be back within a few days, and I\u003Cbr\u003E\nneed to get up north quickly. Do you happen to know of any jets I could borrow?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe sighed. \u201CI do know of a craft or two I could borrow for a day or two. But I doubt\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou know how to fly one, they\u2019re fairly new technology.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob bowed his head, conceding that much. \u201CYou are correct; I can\u2019t fly a plane. Besides,\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a bit of an\u2026issue\u2026with heights. Perhaps you could chauffeur me? You are my\u003Cbr\u003E\npersonal assistant after all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI suppose so, sir.\u201D While Joliana grumbled externally, she was secretly glad for this\u003Cbr\u003E\nopportunity. She quite enjoyed flying the new prototype jet planes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E had been\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeveloping, and this would be an excellent opportunity to get away from the dullness\u003Cbr\u003E\nof her duties here at the Space Center.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcellent, let me know when you have it ready, I have a few last-minute arrangements\u003Cbr\u003E\nto make. The sooner we leave, the better the chance we get back before Bill returns.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes sir.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill Kerman leaned forward in disbelief. \u201CSo what is it you\u2019re saying, sir?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Prime Minister of the USKK leaned back in his seat. \u201CI am saying that Parliament\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas not satisfied with the governmental investigators\u2019 reports.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut I\u2019ve worked to include their suggestions over the past few months into Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram policy! That\u2019s the entire reason I\u2019ve been here so often over the last few\u003Cbr\u003E\nmonths.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow, don\u2019t get me wrong. I appreciate your cooperation with the government\u003Cbr\u003E\nregarding the policy changes, but there is a subset of Parliament which thinks that more\u003Cbr\u003E\nextreme measures are needed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd those extreme measures are to put the Space Program under government\u003Cbr\u003E\ncontrol.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes. Bill, I know the independent Program has covered a lot of ground over the past\u003Cbr\u003E\nfew years and done wonderful things for science and public inspiration, but to be\u003Cbr\u003E\nhonest, Parliament has lost faith.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat? After a single accident?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Prime Minister sighed. \u201CIt\u2019s not just that. Look, Bill, we\u2019ve been seeing diminishing\u003Cbr\u003E\nreturns from the Program. Your most recent missions haven\u2019t given much of a\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnological advantage or done as much useful science as the initial ones. My\u003Cbr\u003E\ncolleagues and I believe that greater good can be accomplished by beating the CKFN on\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe home front, rather than trying to explore a new frontier.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201CSurely public opinion counts for something? The people are\u003Cbr\u003E\nincredibly enthusiastic about the Program!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot particularly. The most recent public opinion polls reveal that the explosion of\u003Cbr\u003E\nUranus IX\u2014the debris killed nineteen civilians, thank Harv it wasn\u2019t more\u2014has made\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe public far more worried about the impact that space travel has on both themselves\u003Cbr\u003E\nas kerbals, and on the nation itself. I daresay very few kerbals will go out to watch the\u003Cbr\u003E\nnext rocket launch.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill conceded the point. \u201CYou\u2019ve stated Parliament\u2019s worries. What are these increased\u003Cbr\u003E\ngovernmental controls?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Prime Minister passed a sheet of paper over the desk to Bill. \u201CAs you can see, the\u003Cbr\u003E\ndocument\u2014Bill UK-67\u2014outlines the transition towards a government-overseen space\u003Cbr\u003E\nagency. The Director\u2014which is you, of course\u2014will be replaced with a governmental-\u003Cbr\u003E\nchosen candidate who will answer directly to Parliament, and the Program\u2019s funding\u003Cbr\u003E\nwill also be overseen by that body. Naturally, you are free to continue working with the\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram, just not as its Director.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill kept reading. \u201CWhat\u2019s this at the bottom? You\u2019re restricting launch sizes? This\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould prevent the Program from launching anything but tiny probes! Correction, tiny\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobes to low orbit!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh yes, an excellent suggestion from one of my colleagues. There was a great deal of\u003Cbr\u003E\nconcern over the Uranus IX explosion, and many in Parliament feared that more kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould be at risk if there existed additional, less obvious, flaws in the engineering work\u003Cbr\u003E\nor policies. This size and payload restriction will let any unforeseen kinks work their\u003Cbr\u003E\nway out.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut this puts us completely out of the race for the Mun! The CKFN will surely beat us\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere if we\u2019re stuck launching tiny payloads!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Prime Minister raised an eyebrow. \u201CBill, I believe your Program is operating under\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe impression that the USKK is desperately competing with the CKFN in space. While\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey have admittedly made some progress there, their achievements have merely\u003Cbr\u003E\nmatched your own. This government believes that effort should be spent on beating the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN in more functional applications, such as economic dominance, or militarily. Your\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram should be focused on that as well, rather than attempting to send kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\nstraight for the Mun, which is as far as our scientists can tell, a featureless rock.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo that\u2019s it? The Program is finished?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s finished. The Bill is still in its early stages, and Parliament will not\u003Cbr\u003E\nvote on it for a few months. I\u2019m informing you of its existence now to give you time to\u003Cbr\u003E\nlet go of non-essential staff, gear down production, and prepare for a successor.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou mean the Bill isn\u2019t in effect yet? There\u2019s a chance to stop it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, the Prime Minister let out a sigh. \u201CNo. Bill, this\u2014ahem\u2014bill is a near-certainty in\u003Cbr\u003E\nmy books. I highly advise against trying to fight this; all it will do is tarnish your\u003Cbr\u003E\nreputation further.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill stood up. \u201CVery well. I suppose we\u2019re done here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Bill walked towards the door, the Prime Minister spoke. \u201CBill, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u003Cbr\u003E\nadmire what you managed to do these past few years. But this nation needs to stand\u003Cbr\u003E\ntogether against the CKFN, not be divided over the Space Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill left the office. Regardless what the Prime Minister said, he was going to fight this\u003Cbr\u003E\nbill. The Space Program couldn\u2019t be snuffed out that easily!\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith a practised hand, Joliana set the aircraft she\u2019d procured down on the cracked\u003Cbr\u003E\ntarmac of a back lot of Tenby, Jebediah Kerman\u2019s hometown. She suspected that a town\u003Cbr\u003E\nas small as this wouldn\u2019t get much air traffic, particularly a cutting-edge Vertical Take\u003Cbr\u003E\nOff and Landing design. She just hoped it was out of the way enough.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhere did you have in mind for searching for Jebediah, sir?\u201D she asked as the two\u003Cbr\u003E\nexited the vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI thought we\u2019d walk around and get to know the place, see if anyone knows of Jeb,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthen take it from there. We\u2019re in no real rush, Bill\u2019s not due back from the capital for a\u003Cbr\u003E\nfew days.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs it turned out, finding information about Jeb was less difficult than they\u2019d initially\u003Cbr\u003E\nthought. The town appeared to be proud of their famous kerbal, and most kerbals they\u003Cbr\u003E\ntalked to had some anecdote or another about Jeb. However, it wasn\u2019t until they met the\u003Cbr\u003E\nlocal general store owner when they found information of value.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, Jeb! You know, he\u2019s a bigwig at the Space Program now! I did so enjoy watching\u003Cbr\u003E\nthose rockets go up on the TV\u2014except for that most recent one. \u2018Tis a pity. Ah, I\u003Cbr\u003E\nremember when Jeb still lived here though, must have been, oh, twenty, twenty-five\u003Cbr\u003E\nyears ago? He used to pop down to the store for snacks every weekend! Ah, that was\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore the Great War, you know, I nearly had to shut down the store during that\u003Cbr\u003E\nconflict! Terrible for business, that was.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, ah, I can imagine. Do you know if Jeb has been back in town recently? We\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\nlooking for him; he left the Space Program nearly four months ago.\u201D asked Bob, clearly\u003Cbr\u003E\na little impatient with this kerbal\u2019s stories.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHuh, well I can\u2019t recall Jeb being back in town recently; he\u2019d surely have come by to\u003Cbr\u003E\nvisit me! But if you want to know more about where Jeb might be, I\u2019d check with\u003Cbr\u003E\nValentina. She\u2019s an old flame of his; they were close for a while a few years ago.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHmm, do you have any idea how we could get in touch with her?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI think she\u2019s one of them fancy new fighter jet pilots now, but I just heard she\u2019s back in\u003Cbr\u003E\ntown. You can probably find her at the bar down the street, to tell you the truth. But\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat\u2019s this about Jeb not being with the Program any more?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana could see that Bob had no desire to continue the conversation now that he had\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe information he needed. So she quickly intervened. \u201CI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have much\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime, and have to run. Thank you for your cooperation!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe bar the shopkeeper mentioned was a quiet affair, certainly no wretched hive of\u003Cbr\u003E\nscum and villainy like what Joliana was expecting. Evidently the locals preferred their\u003Cbr\u003E\ndrinks in peace. Still, she must be cautious. Entering, Bob made his way to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nbarkeeper, a heavyset kerbal cleaning out some glasses. Joliana followed, keeping her\u003Cbr\u003E\neye out for trouble.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D Bob asked. \u201CIs Valentina Kerman here tonight?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe barkeeper made an affirmative-sounding grunt and jerked a thumb towards a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncorner booth. Bob thanked the kerbal and the two made their way over to the table.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpon reaching it, Bob spoke. \u201CValentina Kerman, I presume?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWho\u2019s asking?\u201D came the response. The kerbal appeared uninterested. \u201CLook,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhatever it is you want, I probs won\u2019t be able to give it to ya, my squadron\u2019s shipping\u003Cbr\u003E\nout tomorrow morning.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry. All I need is information. On one certain Jebediah Kerman.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Valentina raised an eyebrow. \u201CJeb? Jeez, I haven\u2019t spoken to him in years. Why\u003Cbr\u003E\nare you asking me, by Mu? Isn\u2019t he some sort of bigwig at the Space Program now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob slipped into the seat opposite Valentina. \u201CYes, up to about four months ago. He\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nvanished off the map, and we\u2019re trying to find him. I\u2019ve been told you were close to\u003Cbr\u003E\nhim\u2026do you have any idea where he might have gone?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other kerbal\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201CBefore I go telling you Jeb\u2019s life story, mind if I ask\u003Cbr\u003E\njust who you are? I\u2019m a bit of the suspicious type, you know.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob chuckled. \u201CHey Joli, looks like we\u2019ve found you a kindred spirit!\u201D Leaning up\u003Cbr\u003E\nagainst a wall and scanning the crowd for trouble, the secret agent narrowed her eyes,\u003Cbr\u003E\nunamused. \u201CRegardless, I\u2019m Bob Kerman, co-founder of the USKK Space Program. This\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere is my assistant Joliana.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nValentina leaned back in her chair. \u201CAh, so you\u2019re Bob. I recall Jeb mentioning you a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncouple times. Nice to meet you.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLikewise. So, how about it? Any idea where Jeb may have gone?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nValentina\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201CWell, I can\u2019t tell you much for certain, but I do know he\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ngot a cabin up in the northern woods. You used to only be able to get to it by hiking, but\u003Cbr\u003E\nnowadays I\u2019m sure you can just fly there, though you might have a bit of a time landing\u003Cbr\u003E\nyour plane! I\u2019ll give you the coords if you want to check the place out.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll manage, and the coordinates would be most helpful, thank you.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d need them again, \u2018specially after your guys asked me\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout this a few weeks ago. Maybe they got lost, heh?\u201D She scribbled down some\u003Cbr\u003E\nnumbers on the back of a napkin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COur guys?\u201D asked Bob.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, the big dudes with weird accents. Said they were from the Space Program too.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this, Joliana\u2019s eyes widened, coming to a realization. She caught hold of Bob\u2019s sleeve.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me, sir, but we need to leave.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking around, Bob looked like he was about to protest, but thought better of it when\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe saw the look in Joliana\u2019s eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, very well. Thank you for the information, Valentina. I\u2019ll say hi to Jeb for you when\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe see him.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, yeah, whatever\u2026\u201D The pilot turned her attention back to her drink.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOutside, Bob turned to Joliana. \u201CDo you mind telling me what that was all about?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe didn\u2019t turn around, but kept walking quickly towards where they\u2019d parked the\u003Cbr\u003E\naircraft. \u201CThe CKFN.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWere there agents in the bar? I didn\u2019t see\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo, they were the ones who talked to Valentina!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou sure? It could have been just a couple of concerned citizens, looking for the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfounder of the Space Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThink about it, your rival\u2019s space program\u2019s leader just up and quits after a rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\nblows up. If I was the CKFN, I would spend all my efforts determining his\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhereabouts. An opportunity like this would be too good to pass up, if you ask me.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob had caught up to her now. \u201CYou don\u2019t mean that Jeb\u2019s\u2026in danger from these\u003Cbr\u003E\nagents?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer face darkened. \u201CI don\u2019t know. But we need to get to that cabin before they do.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShooing away a couple of small children who were enamoured by the plane\u2019s sleek\u003Cbr\u003E\nlines, she climbed in the cockpit and began the engine start-up sequence, before\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocketing into the sky and towards the provided coordinates.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nEyeing the terrain below, Joliana glanced over her shoulder. \u201CWe\u2019re less than five\u003Cbr\u003E\nkilometers out, sir. I suggest you strap in; this could be a rough landing.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNervously peering out at the endless expanse of trees, Bob did as she asked. \u201CDoesn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nlook like any clearings ahead. Is this plane strong enough to survive a landing on top of\u003Cbr\u003E\na tree?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTheoretically.\u201D This did not appear to calm Bob\u2019s nerves, already appeared to be on\u003Cbr\u003E\nedge due to the height. \u201CI imagine the cabin has some sort of clearing around it,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthough.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo Joliana\u2019s relief (and likely Bob\u2019s as well), the cabin did indeed have a patch of grass\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurrounding it, flat and wide enough to serve as a makeshift landing pad. She brought\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe plane down once more as smooth as a feather, though she did catch a wing on one\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the surrounding trees\u2019 branches. Hopefully the paint wasn\u2019t scratched, or she\u2019d never\u003Cbr\u003E\nhear the end of it back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter exiting the plane, Joliana crept carefully up to the cabin, sitting serenely on top of\u003Cbr\u003E\na rise in the grass. She motioned Bob to get down behind a rock.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou can\u2019t possibly think those CKFN agents got here first, now do you? We were\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing so fast in that plane I thought it was going to split in half!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBob, they\u2019ve had weeks to get here. Even on foot, it\u2019s not too far from the nearest\u003Cbr\u003E\ntown.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, it doesn\u2019t look like anyone\u2019s here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201D Joliana said darkly. If the agents had already come and\u003Cbr\u003E\ngone and encountered Jebediah\u2014, well, Bob\u2019s plan to breathe more life into the Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram would very quickly fall apart. \u201CLet\u2019s move up.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe two crept closer to the cabin, and Joliana tried the door. \u201CLocked.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGood or bad sign?\u201D asked Bob.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot sure, give me a second and I\u2019ll get this open,\u201D she said, pulling a custom-built\u003Cbr\u003E\nlockpick from her utility belt and reaching for the lock. It was an old-fashioned single-\u003Cbr\u003E\ntumbler design and she unlocked it easily enough.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the door opened, a wave of dust poured out. Bob looked like he was about to begin a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncoughing fit, but he put a hand over his mouth and stepped to the side, suppressing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana held her breath and ventured into the cabin. It didn\u2019t take her long to conclude\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah wasn\u2019t there. In fact, it didn\u2019t look like anyone had lived there for years, based\u003Cbr\u003E\nupon the lack of personal belongings and several-centimetre-thick layer of dust that lay\u003Cbr\u003E\nover everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob walked in. \u201CWell\u2014ahem\u2014it looks like Jeb didn\u2019t come back to his cabin after all. By\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax, where could he be?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot sure. Any more ideas as to places to look for him?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThere might be another place he could be at, but it\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019ll be another wild\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoose chase or not.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll take any lead over no lead,\u201D Joliana said as she walked back outside. Then she\u003Cbr\u003E\nfroze. A tall kerbal dressed in hiking clothes stood outside, about halfway down the hill.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe spoke crisply, in a clear CKFN accent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, hello there! Do either of you chaps happen to know where one might find a certain\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah Kerman? We were told this cabin belonged to him.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana drew her service pistol and levelled it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPut your hands up, Confederate scum.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe CKFN spy, for his credit, did not freeze, but leaped behind several rocks in one\u003Cbr\u003E\nswift, fluid movement. That didn\u2019t stop Joliana from letting off several shots, but their\u003Cbr\u003E\nonly effect was to send a few rock chips flying.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re going, Bob!\u201D she yelled at the kerbal still inside the cabin. A second or two later,\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob emerged, half-covered in dust. He looked like he dove to the floor the second he\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nheard gunfire. Smart.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom behind the rocks, she could hear the CKFN agent speaking into his wrist radio.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNox 2, I\u2019ve come under fire from enemy units at the cabin, repeat, hostiles engaged.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nKnowing the agent was calling for backup, Joliana grabbed Bob by the collar and took\u003Cbr\u003E\noff running for the plane. She managed to get a few shots off, but unfortunately didn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nhit anything. Still, it stopped the agent from returning fire.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, the two reached the aircraft. Joliana shoved Bob up the ladder, and quickly\u003Cbr\u003E\nfollowed. She wasted no time with pre-flight checklists, but rather fed fuel to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines (still warm from their landing not ten minutes earlier) and shoved the throttle\u003Cbr\u003E\nforward. The aircraft\u2019s vertical-facing engines roared to life, scorching the grass\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderneath.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the aircraft had cleared the treetop, Joliana immediately spooled up the main jet\u003Cbr\u003E\nengines, shoving them both back in their seats as the plane accelerated away. She could\u003Cbr\u003E\nsee Bob\u2019s knuckles turning white as he desperately clutched his seat\u2019s armrests.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally, putting some distance between them and the agents, she let out the breath she\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen holding. She turned to Bob.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CConfirmation of CKFN agents operating here is definitely something \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E should know\u003Cbr\u003E\nabout. I\u2019m going to need to call this in. Mind getting in the back while I call?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSure. I imagine you want to know where we\u2019re headed next first, though?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRight. You said you had an idea to where Jebediah may have gone?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes. A year or two back, Jeb wanted to open up an airbase on one of the islands north\u003Cbr\u003E\nof the Space Center. He intended it to be a hub of shipping and transportation. He even\u003Cbr\u003E\nstarted spending a lot of time up there, flying back and forth himself in an early-model\u003Cbr\u003E\naircraft.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo is that airbase still there?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, but it never proved to be financially viable. The Space Program\u2019s funders wrote\u003Cbr\u003E\nit up as a loss and the place was shut down. I can\u2019t imagine why Jeb would want to go\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere, but it\u2019s the place with the next-closest connection I can think of.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll right, I\u2019ll set a course for the airbase now.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill watched shadows outside getting longer and longer as the sun set.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe sighed. What could he do? From where he was sitting, the government was right.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Space Program was divided, unfocused, and would probably not make it to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun before the CKFN regardless. He\u2019d recently seen some improvement, particularly\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith the engineers, but it was almost certainly too little, too late. In a few months, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace Program would be over.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot for the first time in recent days, he found himself wondering what Jeb would have\u003Cbr\u003E\ndone, if he was around. Then, he cursed himself for thinking of that kerbal. It was Jeb\u003Cbr\u003E\nwho was responsible for all this. His policies, his apathy towards proper safety\u003Cbr\u003E\nprocedures, and then dumping the whole Program\u2019s responsibility onto Bill at the first\u003Cbr\u003E\nsign of trouble.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, Bill sighed. If only that blasted rocket hadn\u2019t blown up. He\u2019d tried his best to keep\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Program together in the aftermath of Uranus IX, but he just wasn\u2019t cut out for the\u003Cbr\u003E\njob of Director. No matter how much direction he\u2019d tried to give the Program, it never\u003Cbr\u003E\nseemed to be enough. There was always more work to be done, another governmental\u003Cbr\u003E\ninvestigator to satisfy, another document which required his signature.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe this is for the best, though, he thought, as the sun disappeared over the horizon,\u003Cbr\u003E\nshrouding his office in darkness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt appears the runway is not in terrible shape, I\u2019ll land conventionally.\u201D Joliana brought\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe plane down and taxied towards the main aircraft hangers. \u201CWhere do you expect to\u003Cbr\u003E\nfind Jebediah?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob scratched his chin. \u201CThere\u2019s a series of old administration buildings further inland,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut let\u2019s first check the aircraft hangers. Jeb\u2019s always loved planes.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe plane came to a stop, and the two exited, approaching the largest of the hangers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore they got halfway there, a voice stopped them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHello, Bob.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nA lone figure emerged from the base\u2019s aircraft control tower, and walked toward Bob\u003Cbr\u003E\nand Joliana. It was Jebediah Kerman, looking tired and scruffy, with week-old stubble\u003Cbr\u003E\nand large bags under his eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb, it\u2019s good to see you! How have you, ah, been?\u201D Bob said, quite happily.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe former Director took a moment to reply. \u201CI\u2019ve\u2026been getting by. Why did you come\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJeb, I\u2019m going to be honest with you. We need you back at the Space Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith this, Jebediah turned away. \u201CDidn\u2019t you hear me after Uranus IX exploded? I\u2019m\u003Cbr\u003E\ndone. Done with killing kerbals and done with space.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t believe that for a second. What happened to the optimistic kerbal who believed\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the Space Program? Who believed we could make a difference in the world? Who\u003Cbr\u003E\nbelieved we could explore space peacefully, and for the betterment of all of Kerbin?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s gone, Bob.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana smiled to herself. Having witnessed the inspirational speeches Bob liked to whip\u003Cbr\u003E\nup, she had a feeling this would be an entertaining exchange. Meanwhile, Jeb continued\u003Cbr\u003E\nhis self-pitying spiel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAfter Uranus IX exploded, I saw first-hand what I had done to the Space Program, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hated myself for it. I can\u2019t go back. I stay here, and wander this base. The empty\u003Cbr\u003E\nhangers remind me of my penance, and I must stay here to live through it.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana suppressed another smile. Really? That sort of thing sounded like what an\u003Cbr\u003E\nadolescent would write into their diary while trying to be all \u2018deep\u2019 and insisting to\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheir mother that \u2018this wasn\u2019t a phase\u2019. She deeply hoped Bob would put some sense\u003Cbr\u003E\ninto the kerbal, because she was on the verge of speaking up herself.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CC\u2019mon, Jeb. If you feel like you committed a crime, turn yourself in, go to jail. Don\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nwander around an abandoned airbase for three-and-a-half months! Don\u2019t beat yourself\u003Cbr\u003E\nup over IX, it was as much Danbro\u2019s fault as yours.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201CMaybe\u2014maybe you\u2019re right, but how can I help the Program\u003Cbr\u003E\nany more? I drove it straight into the ground.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m damn sure I\u2019m right, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t even be here! Jeb, you\u2019re a fantastic asset\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the Space Program. \u201C\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m no Director. You saw first-hand the results of my policies.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMaybe so, but you can\u2019t deny that your imagination and drive led us to soundly beat\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN to low orbit, and we very nearly beat them to the Mun as well!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana saw Jeb smile. It was a very faint smile, but a smile nonetheless.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s true.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBy Harv is it true!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut I caused Uranus IX. The kerbals at the Space Center and across the USKK won\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\naccept me back.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019d be surprised as to what can be forgiven, Jeb. And besides, there\u2019s one more\u003Cbr\u003E\nreason why we need you back at the Space Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana saw Bob pull a photograph out of his pocket and show it to Jeb. By that kerbal\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nreaction, she could tell exactly what photograph it was: the CKFN\u2019s Jupiter rocket from\u003Cbr\u003E\nearlier. She\u2019d have to liberate that from Bob at some point, classified information like\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat certainly did not belong out in the field.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs that what I think it is?\u201D asked Jeb, dumbfounded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt sure is. The CKFN launched a 2.5-meter rocket without any issues. Now do you see\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhy we need you back? If the CKFN makes it to the Mun first, they\u2019ll establish a\u003Cbr\u003E\nmassive lead in space travel. Who knows what they\u2019ll find up there? Maybe the new\u003Cbr\u003E\nterritory will give them the confidence to declare war on the USKK and wipe us all\u003Cbr\u003E\nout!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb snorted, then smiled a little bit more. \u201CDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s just a bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nunreasonable?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMaybe, but who really knows what\u2019s up there? Besides, keeping the CKFN from\u003Cbr\u003E\nestablishing a monopoly over space travel will be good for everyone.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHah! You think they\u2019d start selling meteor chunks or something?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAt ridiculously steep prices, no doubt.\u201D Bob started chuckling, and Jeb joined in.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe former Director broke into a full smile. \u201CYou don\u2019t know how good it feels to laugh\u003Cbr\u003E\nagain. Maybe I really have been gone for too long. Bob, tell your assistant to fire up that\u003Cbr\u003E\njet of yours. I\u2019m coming back to the Space Center!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob grinned. \u201CThat\u2019s good, I wasn\u2019t going to leave until you said yes, you know. Wasn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nlooking forward to what you do for sleeping arrangements here\u2026\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0CKFN: Facility for Space Research, Danford\u2019s Office\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo Days Later\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford leaned back in his chair. The term was nearly up for the CKFN\u2019s current\u003Cbr\u003E\nPresident, and the entire country was preparing for the elections next week. With Jupiter\u003Cbr\u003E\ncoming along on schedule, a boilerplate of Aurora nearly finished, and work beginning\u003Cbr\u003E\non the Munar lander, Danford didn\u2019t have a whole lot to do. Thus, he sat idly in his\u003Cbr\u003E\nspartan office, watching one of the most recent presidential debates on a small\u003Cbr\u003E\ntelevision set an intern had brought in.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far, nothing terribly exciting had occurred, unless one counted the various insults the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncandidates spouted off at one another, of course.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll three candidates stood on a stage erected in some small town in the middle of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nCKFN, bickering about today\u2019s topic. The candidate furthest to the left hailed from a\u003Cbr\u003E\nmore conservative-leaning political party, who strongly believed that altogether too\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch information was flowing between the USKK and CKFN, far more than should be\u003Cbr\u003E\ntolerated (they were enemies after all, they had insisted), and demanded a complete\u003Cbr\u003E\nborder shutdown and an overall isolationist policy on the world stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second candidate was more liberal, and believed that some trade should be opened\u003Cbr\u003E\nbetween the two great powers, arguing that the CKFN could dominate the USKK\u003Cbr\u003E\neconomically, particularly if more attention was paid to upgrading and modernizing\u003Cbr\u003E\nindustrial sections in the southern half of the country. Unsurprisingly, this candidate\u003Cbr\u003E\nhailed from that region, and no doubt had several kerbals with a great deal of self-\u003Cbr\u003E\ninterest in the region supporting his candidacy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the final candidate was far more interesting to Danford. She spoke little of\u003Cbr\u003E\ninternational relations, but was an enthusiastic supporter of the Space Programme. She\u003Cbr\u003E\nfound a way to bring up the subject nearly every debate she spoke in, and stressed that\u003Cbr\u003E\nrather than attempting to out-compete the USKK on the Kerbin itself, the CKFN should\u003Cbr\u003E\ndo so in the skies above, by establishing a permanent kerballed presence in orbit. She\u003Cbr\u003E\nempathized that the Space Programme was the way to the future of the CKFN, by\u003Cbr\u003E\nresearch and developing new technologies, as well as exploring new worlds. Needless\u003Cbr\u003E\nto say, she\u2019d be getting Danford\u2019s vote.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, today\u2019s debate was about as far from the topic of space exploration as\u003Cbr\u003E\none could get, as the candidates were arguing whether or not current cabbage import\u003Cbr\u003E\nlegislation was too strict, too lenient, or should be abolished altogether. Wild tales of\u003Cbr\u003E\ncabbage smugglers had been circulating around the CKFN for a few months now, of\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbals attempting to dodge the expensive import fees by making tremendous journeys\u003Cbr\u003E\nacross kilometres of open desert with their wares. Of course, more often than not, these\u003Cbr\u003E\ntales were pure fiction or highly exaggerated, but the fact remained that the import fees\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere quite high, and there existed a significant demand for the goods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo Danford, each candidate had entirely too strong of an opinion upon these cabbages,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand he sorely wished they\u2019d actually get back to talking about subject matter which did\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot cause their viewers to fall asleep (as most of the audience onscreen appeared to be\u003Cbr\u003E\nnapping). But the debates went on, for better or for worse. Finally, when Danford was\u003Cbr\u003E\non the verge of switching the television off altogether, his desk\u2019s telephone rang.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThrilled to have some form of distraction, he grabbed the receiver.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHello?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe voice on the other end was deep and gruff and belonged to General Geoffnard.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDanford. I need you to come to the capital as soon as you can. The President has called\u003Cbr\u003E\nan important Advisory Council meeting.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201CThe President called the meeting? His term ends in three\u003Cbr\u003E\ndays, what\u2019s there to be said?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCircumstances have, ah, conspired to require a meeting. Listen, I can\u2019t brief you\u003Cbr\u003E\nfurther over the phone\u2014USKK spies could be listening\u2014so get to the Capital.\u003Cbr\u003E\nImmediately.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGlancing at the television, Danford saw that the cabbages debate was still in full swing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCompared to this, the mystery Advisory Council meeting would be heaven. \u201CSure\u003Cbr\u003E\nthing, General,\u201D he responded, and hung up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Danford walked into the Council room an hour later, he saw the other members\u003Cbr\u003E\nwere already seated. There was Bilcas, glaring at his watch; Bilfrod, shuffling papers\u003Cbr\u003E\nnervously; the General, sitting ramrod-straight in his chair; and finally, the soon-to-be-\u003Cbr\u003E\nformer-President of the CKFN, seated at the head of the table and looking like he would\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch rather be at home enjoying a nice cup of tea.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow that everyone\u2019s arrived, we can begin,\u201D the General began. \u201CThank you all for\u003Cbr\u003E\ncoming on such short notice. Within several hours, this event will be all over the news,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut I need to get the President\u2019s opinion as soon as possible.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas grunted. \u201CI\u2019m not particularly sure why you insisted on us all being here; surely\u003Cbr\u003E\nif it\u2019s a matter for the President, it can be solved via personal communication?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeoffnard grimaced. \u201CNot exactly. I feel getting everyone\u2019s opinion would give us an\u003Cbr\u003E\nadvantage in this situation. To be frank, two hours ago, the USKK invaded the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsovereign state of Malentea.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could hear a pin drop. Danford\u2019s mind was reeling. Peace had reigned supreme for\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe last twenty-four years on Kerbin, why was the USKK spoiling that with a Max-\u003Cbr\u003E\ndamned invasion? \u201CYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201D he found himself blurting out. \u201CWould\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould this mean a repeat of the Great War?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid the situation is all too serious, but we may yet avoid war.\u201D responded the\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeneral. He unfurled a map of the region, southeast of the USKK. Additionally,\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeoffnard had marked upon the map diagonal lines which showed the extent of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK\u2019s invasion, enveloping the entire country of Malentea.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAllow me to explain the background on this area for those unfamiliar.\u201D Danford saw\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe General glance towards him, and narrowed his eyes. No doubt the General was\u003Cbr\u003E\nrolling out the history lesson because he was present. Danford wasn\u2019t an idiot, for\u003Cbr\u003E\nHarv\u2019s sake, he remembered just as well as any kerbal what had gone on during the\u003Cbr\u003E\nWar.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGeoffnard began. \u201CIn the aftermath of the Great War, the full extent of the Malentean\u003Cbr\u003E\nIsthmus was promised to the USKK in return for its liberation of several nation-states.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, the signing of the Treaty of Okheka in the final days of the war froze the\u003Cbr\u003E\nborders of both the USKK and CKFN, and forbid either from adding more territory in\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe future, essentially nullifying this promise. The Treaty was signed to avoid precisely\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis sort of preying on the weaker nation-states, which I\u2019m sure you all can recall was\u003Cbr\u003E\none of the primary causes of the War.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe General\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201CIn the event of such a breach of the Treaty, it called for\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe other nation to declare war upon the aggressor, in defense of the smaller nation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis was written in the hopes of forcing the other to back down. Ideally, this threat of\u003Cbr\u003E\nmutual warfare would discourage either side from even trying to break the Treaty.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, the USKK has evidently decided that the Treaty no longer applies to\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem, and has moved troops into Malentea.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe passed some grainy, black-and-white photographs across the table, clearly showing\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK tanks doing battle with an unidentified militia-type force. The President looked\u003Cbr\u003E\nat them and sighed heavily.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHas the USKK declared a casus belli? Do they have any sort of justification for this\u003Cbr\u003E\nattack?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNone officially, but I believe this was a diplomatic annexation gone bad. Malentea\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nleaders have long sought to join the USKK, but dissident factions may have started riots\u003Cbr\u003E\nand popular movements against the current governing body, which led to the images\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou see here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRegardless of intent, the USKK still violated international law. I presume you called\u003Cbr\u003E\nme in here to ask whether we will declare war in Malentea\u2019s defense?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat was indeed the purpose of this meeting, sir.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, the President sighed. \u201CI can\u2019t condemn the nation to war, then leave office three\u003Cbr\u003E\ndays later. Nor will my successor have an easy time of it; the government typically takes\u003Cbr\u003E\nmonths to reorganize when a new President enters office. It appears the USKK has\u003Cbr\u003E\nlucked out in their timing of this invasion.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot luck, sir,\u201D the General stated. \u201CThe details of our elections are not exactly private, I\u003Cbr\u003E\nbelieve it was very precise timing on their part which led to this invasion happening\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow, when they know we are unable to respond quickly.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe President massaged his temples. \u201CSo what are our options, then? Do we declare\u003Cbr\u003E\nwar? I was under the impression that most of the military is currently either disbanded\u003Cbr\u003E\nor off patrolling the borders, and it would take a great deal of time to organize the\u003Cbr\u003E\nforces.\u201D The President continued. \u201CI suppose declaring war immediately, then taking\u003Cbr\u003E\nsome time to send an attack isn\u2019t out of the question.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDanford sat in disbelief. While certainly not eager about the whole thing, the President\u003Cbr\u003E\nwas discussing declaring a war which would undoubtedly consume most of the planet\u003Cbr\u003E\nonce again. And he did so while looking annoyed. Danford had always imagined a\u003Cbr\u003E\ncertain gravitas was present when discussing such matters, but he supposed reality\u003Cbr\u003E\nnever really did match up with what one saw in the movies, did it?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe General was now pacing at the front of the room. \u201CSir, if the USKK so wished, they\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould invade us during that interim period and force our surrender. Recent intelligence\u003Cbr\u003E\nreports show that they have conducted alarmingly extensive modernizations and\u003Cbr\u003E\nupgrades to their military, and I believe have the potential to strike a devastating blow\u003Cbr\u003E\nagainst our nation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSurely they aren\u2019t so stupid as to attack us? It would take them weeks just to cross our\u003Cbr\u003E\ndefensive lines!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSir, based upon the intelligence we have, their modern tanks can cover a great deal of\u003Cbr\u003E\nground, and can concentrate a great deal of firepower on a single point. Static defenses\u003Cbr\u003E\nwon\u2019t last long against the USKK\u2019s armies. Also, there is the matter of aircraft, whose\u003Cbr\u003E\nmilitary application is still poorly understood, but which could easily overwhelm us.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe President was silent. \u201CSo what is it you\u2019re saying? We don\u2019t declare war?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs always, the final decision is up to you, sir, but my recommendation is to allow the\u003Cbr\u003E\nUSKK to continue. Entering a war which the defender wants to lose with an unprepared\u003Cbr\u003E\nmilitary is just not strategically sound. Besides, it has been over twenty years since the\u003Cbr\u003E\nTreaty, and one could argue that it may need some readjustments based upon the\u003Cbr\u003E\nevents which have occurred over the past two decades. Naturally, I recommend\u003Cbr\u003E\ncondemning the USKK at our earliest opportunity; they should certainly not get away\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith this scot-free.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI agree, Geoffnard, thank you,\u201D the President stated. Around the table, Danford could\u003Cbr\u003E\nsee the other council members nodding their heads in agreement. He continued. \u201CDoes\u003Cbr\u003E\nanyone else have an opinion on this development?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBilcas cleared his throat. \u201CIf we are to let this incident go without taking military action,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwell it sets a bit of a precedent, doesn\u2019t it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvidently confused by Bilcas\u2019 vague statement, the General responded angrily. \u201CA\u003Cbr\u003E\nprecedent for future invasions by the USKK?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNot necessarily. If the Treaty of Okheka is truly null and void, why any nation could\u003Cbr\u003E\nthen annex its neighbors\u2014if it so wished, of course.\u201D Bilcas clarified, smiling in a bit of a\u003Cbr\u003E\nconspiratorial manner.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201C\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6I see,\u201D remarked the General. \u201CThis will no doubt have to be more clearly defined\u003Cbr\u003E\nin the future, though. Thoughts on the Finance Minister\u2019s words, sir?\u201D he asked, turning\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the President, who was looking thoughtful.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStanding up, the President responded. \u201CAll I can say is I believe the CKFN\u2019s current\u003Cbr\u003E\nborders to be sufficient for our prosperity. A re-evaluation of those will have to be a\u003Cbr\u003E\nquestion to ask my successor. Now, if that\u2019s everything, I very much wish to get home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u2019s been altogether too long of a term in office.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nFour days later, Danford stood in the centre of the CKFN\u2019s capital, in front of the main\u003Cbr\u003E\ngovernmental buildings, where a cheering crowd had gathered. Fortunately, he was not\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeaking to them today, giving as many speeches as he\u2019d had for the Space Programme\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad made him rather sick of the whole thing. Still, today\u2019s speech would certainly be\u003Cbr\u003E\ninteresting, though the content of the speech did not nearly interest him as much as the\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeaker herself, or rather what her future policies hopefully would contain.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Adming Kerman, the space-loving Presidential candidate had won the election, not\u003Cbr\u003E\nquite by a landslide, but by a significant margin which evidently reflected the public\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nenthusiasm for space travel. He smiled. It must mean he was doing a pretty good job at\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Programme, if the public voted for a candidate who promised to make\u003Cbr\u003E\nadvancements in that area!\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe began to speak, reciting grand words no doubt memorized the night before, but still\u003Cbr\u003E\nimpressive. For the most part though, it was a pretty generic \u2018thank you for electing me\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeech, but the last few segments caught his interest.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFor as you all know, in a vile and despicable move, the USKK has invaded the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsovereign state of Malentea with overwhelming force, and we are unable to intervene.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe can only condemn them for such a shameful act of destroying the peace we all have\u003Cbr\u003E\nworked so hard to maintain since the Great War!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this condemnation of their rival nation, the audience let out a cheer. Danford\u003Cbr\u003E\nsuspected that this didn\u2019t mean much; if the President got them riled up enough, the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrowd would probably cheer for anything. Still, there was something to be said about\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe national pride the President was inspiring. The previous President never was one\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor grand speeches and usually preferred to work on things such as cabbage legislation,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmuch less visible or accessible to the public.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIndeed, our great nation is focused upon greater achievements, ones which will bring\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN into the future! Take Danford Kerman here, his crew at the Space Programme\u003Cbr\u003E\nare reaching for the very stars themselves, reaching to bring us all a better tomorrow!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, the crowd went wild, and Danford gave a little wave, once again amazed by the\u003Cbr\u003E\npositive opinion of the Space Programme. One would expect that kerbals would be\u003Cbr\u003E\ndistrustful of his agency after the USKK demonstrated the deadly consequences of\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket failure, but these kerbals didn\u2019t seem to be thinking about that at all. Truly,\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderstanding public opinion was a more difficult task than rocket science.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the President continued her speech to the crowd, Danford looked skyward to where\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mun was rising above the horizon. He imagined kerbals walking on that body, clad\u003Cbr\u003E\nin space suits and planting the flag of the CKFN proudly, to show the world the\u003Cbr\u003E\nfantastic achievement they\u2019d attained, which would be talked about for years, and no\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoubt live on throughout history as kerbalkind\u2019s first step out from their home planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBringing his gaze back down to Kerbin, he reflected upon the road he\u2019d need to travel\u003Cbr\u003E\nto get to that future. The Space Programme faced a few issues, certainly, but he was\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfident that this new political regime would allow for those to be smoothed over\u003Cbr\u003E\nquickly enough, he was certain.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThings were looking up!\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0USKK: Space Program Administration Facility, Bob Kerman\u2019s Office\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne Week Later\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor at least the twelfth time that day, Joliana Kerman glanced at Bob and Bill, locked in\u003Cbr\u003E\nargument, and let out a snort of annoyance. Ever since she and Bob had returned from\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah\u2019s old base, Bob had been arguing non-stop with Bill, and making no progress,\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom the sounds of it. Bill seemed to have relapsed into the same counter-argument he\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen using ten minutes ago and the two were making no progress. Shaking her head,\u003Cbr\u003E\nshe turned her attention back to the mail she was sorting, shifting in her uncomfortable\u003Cbr\u003E\nsmall folding chair. Evidently the \u2018Personal Assistant to Bob Kerman\u2019 did not warrant a\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesk of her own. Fan letter, fan letter, bill, bill, bill for Bill, spam, another fan letter\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis could get a little repetitive. Still, despite it all, she didn\u2019t really mind this job.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSometimes she would catch herself thinking about getting back into the field, but that\u003Cbr\u003E\nencounter with those CKFN agents was enough action for her for a good while. For the\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime being, sorting mail would do just fine for Joliana, though she really could do with\u003Cbr\u003E\na break from that argument.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI just can\u2019t believe you brought\u2026him\u2026back here!\u201D Bill was saying.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou do know you can speak his name; it\u2019s not like he\u2019s some sort of evil spirit who\u003Cbr\u003E\nappears when you say it three times. He\u2019s our friend, Bill!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHe killed those kerbals, Bob, there\u2019s no coming back from that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on, looking at the grand scheme of things, that\u2019s hardly a drop in the bucket.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy, similar R\u0026amp;D programs to ours have a much larger\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CDon\u2019t even go there. He pushed the button to blow them up personally. We all heard\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat went down in that control room; with two minutes of decision-making time, Jeb\u003Cbr\u003E\nchose to kill those kerbonauts. Snap decisions like that might work when one\u2019s in the\u003Cbr\u003E\npilot\u2019s seat, but never when kerbals\u2019 lives are on the line like that!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re being unreasonable! What would you have had him do? Wait until the rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\ncrashed into the spectators, killing everyone? No no no, he should have seen the engines\u003Cbr\u003E\noverheating somehow before IX lost control, with data that didn\u2019t exist at the time and\u003Cbr\u003E\nmade the call to scrub the launch? Is that what you\u2019re saying?!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know full well that there wasn\u2019t any data available, which was only because of his\u003Cbr\u003E\nlax policies with inspections!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell he\u2019s back and you can\u2019t change that. You know what? Just stay in your office all\u003Cbr\u003E\nday, and you won\u2019t even have to see him! There. Problem solved.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m still the Squad-damned Director of this Space Program, don\u2019t you forget. Maybe I\u003Cbr\u003E\nshould just fire the both of you and be done with this whole business.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana noted that the threat directed towards his position at the Program rattled Bob a\u003Cbr\u003E\nconsiderable amount, as the kerbal stepped forward aggressively. \u201COh yeah? You\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\njust going to start laying off everyone who disagrees with you? Yeah, that\u2019s going to\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake a lot of kerbals really happy. What\u2019re your buddies in Parliament going to say\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen the Space Program splits in two? Huh?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomething flashed within Bill\u2019s eyes, and the kerbal glanced sideways for a moment\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore replying. \u201CMaybe\u2014maybe it doesn\u2019t matter what they think.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob laughed nastily. \u201CWhat, you\u2019ve done such a bad job managing the Program, the\u003Cbr\u003E\ngovernment\u2019s decided to shut it down?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis certainly caught Bill by surprise. After a moment, his jaw set, and his voice\u003Cbr\u003E\ndropped to a whisper. \u201CMaybe.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYeah, well\u2014wait, wait\u2026what?!\u201D Bob was uncharacteristically caught entirely by\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurprise.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLet\u2019s\u2014ah, let\u2019s consider this discussion elsewhere. Somewhere a little more\u2026private.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis eyes flickered briefly over Joliana, who rolled her own. She probably had a higher\u003Cbr\u003E\nsecurity clearance than the both of them combined, but if Bill felt he needed to keep\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhichever Big Secret he was hiding under his hat confined to as few ears as possible, so\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe waited until the two had left the room, then took her things over to Bob\u2019s desk, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nsat in his big chair. Much more comfortable!\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill moved quickly down the hall, glancing in every doorway he passed, Bob\u003Cbr\u003E\nbegrudgingly following. This was taking longer than anticipated, all the rooms they\u2019d\u003Cbr\u003E\npassed so far were full of kerbals. Fortunately, a couple minutes more of searching\u003Cbr\u003E\nyielded a small room used for storing cleaning supplies. Bill ushered Bob inside, and he\u003Cbr\u003E\nclosed the door behind the two of them. As a meeting room, this was decidedly non-\u003Cbr\u003E\nideal, as there was barely any space to maneuver, the only lighting came from a single\u003Cbr\u003E\noverhead lightbulb, and a couple of spiders appeared to be listening in, but it would do\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill composed himself. He\u2019d been butting heads with Bob over this for the past week\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow, bringing the former Director back was absolutely inexcusable. Why couldn\u2019t Bob\u003Cbr\u003E\nsee that Jeb was the reason the Space Program was in as much hot water as it was right\u003Cbr\u003E\nnow?\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking around at their cramped surroundings, Bob spoke. \u201CNow that we\u2019re alone,\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhat\u2019s this about the Program being shut down?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill swallowed. \u201CAbout a week ago\u2014while you were off site with your assistant\u2014I met\u003Cbr\u003E\nwith the Prime Minister regarding the results of the governmental investigators.\u003Cbr\u003E\nApparently, they were displeased with our conduct and work practices and, ah,\u003Cbr\u003E\nrecommended we shift the Program\u2019s focus immediately.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob appeared to be taken aback by this, but contrary to his usual response, did not\u003Cbr\u003E\nmake some sort of nasty remark about Bill\u2019s character, nor did he scoff and dismiss\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill\u2019s concerns. Instead, he asked an insightful question. \u201CShift our focus to what,\u003Cbr\u003E\nexactly?\u201D Unaccustomed to this, Bill took a moment to respond.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, rather than the current big, expensive kerballed boosters, they want us to return\u003Cbr\u003E\nto what we started with two years ago\u2014small atmospheric probes.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob\u2019s face took on a pensive expression as he mulled over these words, once again\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurprising Bill. \u201CThat\u2019s\u2026not ideal. When does it come into effect?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nRelieved that Bob was actually listening to him for once, Bill continued. \u201CWell, I suppose\u003Cbr\u003E\nthere\u2019s one piece of good news; the necessary bill to enact these restrictions isn\u2019t due to\u003Cbr\u003E\nbe voted on for another two months.\u201D Bill knew what Bob would say, and cut him off\u003Cbr\u003E\nbefore he could speak. \u201CHowever, the Prime Minister has been very clear that he expects\u003Cbr\u003E\na majority to pass it when it comes to a vote.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBrow furrowing, Bob responded. \u201CRegardless of what the President thinks, that vote is\u003Cbr\u003E\nno sure thing. We just need to convince them that we\u2019ve learned from our past mistakes\u003Cbr\u003E\nand the Program\u2019s under competent management.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhich is why bringing him back was such a bad idea! That majority will be a sure thing\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhen Parliament hears the kerbal who blew up our last rocket is back,\u201D Bill couldn\u2019t\u003Cbr\u003E\nbelieve Bob wasn\u2019t getting this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCome on, Bill. We need Jeb to actually get things done around here! We\u2019ve sat around\u003Cbr\u003E\ndoing nothing for the past five months and I bet it\u2019s half the reason that bill made it this\u003Cbr\u003E\nfar!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou know; Jeb isn\u2019t the only kerbal with ideas on what the future of the Space\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram should be.\u201D Bill hesitated, then decided to share an idea he\u2019d been toying with\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor the past couple of days. \u201CWhy don\u2019t we assemble a team of mission specialists and\u003Cbr\u003E\nplan out a long-term strategy for the next year or so? That surely will inspire some\u003Cbr\u003E\nconfidence in Parliament!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre you kidding? You\u2019re trying to fix this with a committee?\u201D Bob exclaimed,\u003Cbr\u003E\nimmediately shooting the idea down. \u201CThey\u2019ll use up those two months just deciding\u003Cbr\u003E\non a basic framework! It\u2019s way too little, far too late.\u201D Bill missed the brief window of\u003Cbr\u003E\ntime where Bob listened to what he had to say and responded rationally.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo he\u2019s our only option?\u201D he asked incredulously. \u201CI refuse to believe that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBill, if you\u2019d actually talked to the kerbal since he got back, you\u2019d know that he\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nimmensely sorry about the entire incident, as well as the handling of it. In addition, he\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso got a plan for how we could get to the Mun.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill couldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201CAnd so you think following any plan he comes up with is\u003Cbr\u003E\na lower risk strategy?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnything we do is risky, Bill\u2014this is rocket science after all! But we\u2019ve got precious\u003Cbr\u003E\nlittle time to do things and are low on options. I\u2019m not saying his plan is perfect\u2014it will\u003Cbr\u003E\nneed some tweaks for sure\u2014but it\u2019s our best chance at saving the Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe you. How can\u2019t you see this is exactly what we did to get us into this\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhole scenario? We\u2019ll follow this damn plan over my dead body!\u201D Bill was positively\u003Cbr\u003E\nshouting now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob\u2019s face darkened, but before he could respond, the sound of a hesitant knock broke\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe tense atmosphere between the two. Bill scowled at Bob, then opened the closet door.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA small kerbal stood there, clad in a white lab coat and glasses, clutching a clipboard as\u003Cbr\u003E\nif if was a shield.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUh\u2026um, is Bob there?\u201D he asked, timidly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat, you can\u2019t talk to the Director of the Space Program?\u201D snapped Bill. Upon seeing\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe poor kerbal\u2019s terrified look, he immediately regretted it. \u201CSorry, sorry. Bob\u2019s right\u003Cbr\u003E\nhere.\u201D Bill stepped out of the closet to give the two some room.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat is it, Derrigh?\u201D Bob questioned. Evidently he was familiar with this kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell\u2026I\u2026err, the simulations we were running ha\u2014have completed. I was coming to\u003Cbr\u003E\ntell you about it, but your assistant said you\u2019d stepped out, I\u2026I heard raised voices\u003Cbr\u003E\ncoming from here, and\u2026ah, well, you\u2019ll want to see these results.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAre they good results?\u201D Bob asked, quizzically. \u201CWe\u2019re kind of in the middle of\u003Cbr\u003E\nsomething here.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSir,\u201D At this, Derrigh cracked a smile. \u201CThey were beyond our wildest expectations.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoroughly confused, Bill stepped closer. \u201CWhat is this? Results? Simulations? What\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\ngoing on? Bob, what haven\u2019t you been telling me?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob sighed, annoyed. \u201CRemember that \u2018Advanced Projects Division\u2019 you green-lit a few\u003Cbr\u003E\nmonths ago? They\u2019ve been working on alternative rocket designs to the standard \u2018serial\u2019\u003Cbr\u003E\nstaging method.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIndeed,\u201D the technician confirmed, nodding his head. \u201CBob has been taking a great\u003Cbr\u003E\ndeal of interest in our work, and requested updates on our progress. I\u2019m happy to be\u003Cbr\u003E\nable to report that we actually have something!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob nodded. \u201CIf these results are as good as Derrigh here says, we can build better-\u003Cbr\u003E\nperforming lifters with the same 1-meter stack sizes we\u2019ve been using so far, rather than\u003Cbr\u003E\nresorting to a 2-meter design. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you why that would be ideal.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2014that\u2026actually makes sense. I\u2014ah, well done then!\u201D Bill said, surprised. He was\u003Cbr\u003E\nsurprised all this had taken place right under his nose these past weeks. Then again, he\u003Cbr\u003E\nhad been busy running back and forth to the capital. Eager to escape the argument\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich his discussion with Bob was devolving into, he spoke to the tech. \u201CSo what are\u003Cbr\u003E\nwe waiting for, let\u2019s see these results!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n* * *\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the trio entered the laboratory, the general air was one of excitement and great cheer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs Derrigh led them towards the chief scientist of the lab, it almost seemed like a full-\u003Cbr\u003E\nscale party was taking place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe chief scientist turned around and introduced himself. \u201CHello, Bob, Director, I\u2019m\u003Cbr\u003E\nGus Kerman, only recently promoted to the chief scientist of this lab.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nShaking the kerbal\u2019s hand, Bill asked him about the levity surrounding the group. \u201COh,\u003Cbr\u003E\nexcuse my colleagues, they\u2019re just relieved that we finally obtained good results!\u201D the\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal responded excitedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJudging by the atmosphere around here, you\u2019d better have found a way to create fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\nout of thin air,\u201D Bob remarked. \u201CHang on, are those guys drinking ethanol?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh\u2014you do have to understand, we\u2019ve had a very stressful few weeks here at the\u003Cbr\u003E\nAPD, running fruitless simulation after simulation, trying desperately to find a better\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket setup than our current one. With the lack of activity around here recently, there\u2019s\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen talk of maybe you guys are planning to shut the Space Program down! I can assure\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou, everyone at the APD is wholeheartedly committed towards space exploration!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill\u2019s eyes widened, and he hoped that the kerbal didn\u2019t realize just how close those idle\u003Cbr\u003E\nrumours were to reality. \u201CWell, I\u2014ah, can assure you that the leadership is just as\u003Cbr\u003E\ncommitted as you are towards our goals. You needn\u2019t worry.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s certainly good to hear! Now, I know what you\u2019re here for, let me show you the\u003Cbr\u003E\nresults! Please bear in mind that this simulation is hardly exhaustive\u2014you do have to\u003Cbr\u003E\nremember that it\u2019s only recently that computers have become powerful enough to\u003Cbr\u003E\nenable simulations of this type. We\u2019re really breaking new ground here!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMhmm,\u201D was Bob\u2019s only comment, as he watched a kerbal with a lampshade on their\u003Cbr\u003E\nhead run around.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat being said, while this may not be as ground-breaking as violating Conservation of\u003Cbr\u003E\nMass, it should offer at least a 25% increase in delta-v when compared to a standard\u003Cbr\u003E\nserial-staged vessel, and comparable performance to a 2.5 metre rocket, like the, ah,\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheoretical performance Uranus IX could have given us.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CImpressive,\u201D Bill commented. \u201CSo you\u2019re saying that these rockets could reach the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun? And why haven\u2019t we been using this method before now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMultiple reasons, really. One is the engineering complexity. Serial staging is\u003Cbr\u003E\nremarkably simple you know, as it simply places one stage on top of the other, and\u003Cbr\u003E\ndecoupling the two is trivial. This new method takes a great deal of knowledge in how\u003Cbr\u003E\nstages attached to the side of other stages behave when detached, something we\u2019ve only\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen able to analyze recently due to the Uranus\u2019 SRBs. Also, we integrated fuel lines into\u003Cbr\u003E\nour simulation, a relatively new technology which allows us to actually pump fuel from\u003Cbr\u003E\ntank to tank. We didn\u2019t have those when the engineers were starting out building the\u003Cbr\u003E\nAether rockets!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis all seemed to make sense to Bill. He was about to ask what the engineers decided\u003Cbr\u003E\nto call this staging method, when Bob cut in, evidently less sure about the design side.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd all of that allows you to achieve this efficiency? What in the world would that\u003Cbr\u003E\nrocket look like?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, naturally further refinements will have to be done by the engineers once we have\u003Cbr\u003E\na working model, but the rough shape should be a central core surrounded by parallel-\u003Cbr\u003E\nstaged boosters, each with their own engine. Fuel tanks drain the outer tanks first, then\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019re detached, and the process continues, keeping the central core full of fuel. Think\u003Cbr\u003E\nof it as connecting a large amount of drop tanks to the rocket, but they all have engines\u003Cbr\u003E\non the bottom.\u201D Gus explained proudly.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s going to be an awfully wide rocket, won\u2019t it?\u201D Bill pointed out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt certainly could be; some of the techs have been drawing likeness to a pancake! But I\u003Cbr\u003E\nbelieve that for normal-sized payloads and sufficiently-powerful rocket engines, the\u003Cbr\u003E\nstacks can be made taller, and not wider.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, if you say so,\u201D Bill responded, unconvinced.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe tech\u2019s face brightened as they approached a small room of whirring fans and\u003Cbr\u003E\nblinking lights, within which a single green-lit screen sat. It displayed a large, flickering\u003Cbr\u003E\nline of text: \u2018?v = 3345 m/s\u2019.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIs\u2014is that the delta-v of the rocket? What sort of payload would it be carrying?\u201D Bob\u003Cbr\u003E\nasked, clearly impressed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGus grinned, pushing his glasses up his nose. \u201CIn fact, this simulation was based upon\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Uranus IX mission, we got the capsules\u2019 and transfer stage\u2019s mass from Engineering,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand applied it to the simulation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWait a minute,\u201D Bill just recalled something. \u201CWasn\u2019t XI\u2019s estimated delta-v at least 3.8\u003Cbr\u003E\nkilometres per second?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nGus\u2019 brow furrowed, then he read the number again. \u201COh dear, this is a newer\u003Cbr\u003E\nsimulation, it was estimating how much delta-v would remain once the ship was in\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit, to check if it could perform a successful Munar mission. We basically did analysis\u003Cbr\u003E\nfrom past rocket launches, estimating how much fuel was expended and\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CGus,\u201D Bob interrupted. \u201CHow much delta-v did the ship have when fully-fuelled?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh, of course!\u201D The scientist looked around. \u201CEr, I appear to have misplaced the data\u003Cbr\u003E\ntape, but it was approximately five kilometres per second, on the pad.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFive? As in five thousand metres per second?\u201D Bill asked, incredulous.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, as far as I can recall. Naturally, the simulation would give more detailed results to\u003Cbr\u003E\nits performance, but even then we\u2019re still dealing with some degree of error; these\u003Cbr\u003E\nmachines are limited in how much they can model, after all.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s more than enough to make a Munar flyby\u2014why, we could do an orbital\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission, and maybe even a landing with this tech!\u201D Bob exclaimed excitedly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore Bob could continue, Bill pulled him aside. \u201CBob, can I talk to you for a second?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe two went over to a corner which was undisturbed by the ongoing party.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat is it Bill? I thought you\u2019d be happy about this new design! The Program is\u003Cbr\u003E\nsaved!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBob, don\u2019t start getting any Munar ideas, we haven\u2019t even tested this design yet!\u201D Bill\u003Cbr\u003E\nhissed. \u201CIt doesn\u2019t matter how good those numbers look, they don\u2019t have anything\u003Cbr\u003E\nconcrete! Without actual hardware, the Program\u2019s still doomed.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh come on, Bill. We can surely show off the design, perhaps to the military? I\u2019m sure\u003Cbr\u003E\nthey\u2019d be very interested with a rocket which can carry large payloads.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAfter what happened with Uranus IX, how can you even consider allowing this\u003Cbr\u003E\ntechnology to kill more kerbals?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLighten up Bill, the military will get their hands on the tech eventually, it\u2019s just a\u003Cbr\u003E\nmatter of getting what we want when they do. I\u2019m certain they would be willing to\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeak up in Parliament on our\u2014\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHem-hem.\u201D From behind them came the sound of a kerbal gently clearing her throat.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill and Bob quickly turned to face this new sound.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CJoli? What are you doing here?\u201D Bob asked, puzzled by the appearance of his assistant.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CForget her, what is he doing here?\u201D Bill asked, turning his gaze to the kerbal behind\u003Cbr\u003E\nher.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor Jebediah Kerman, former Director of the USKK Space Program, stood beside\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana. \u201CHey Bob, I\u2014ah, popped by your office, and, well, Joliana brought me up to\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeed on what\u2019s been going on. She mentioned a new design the technicians had\u003Cbr\u003E\nworked up so we popped over here to see it. Really great stuff, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D Joliana confirmed. \u201CHe was interested in the new rocket design, so I offered to\u003Cbr\u003E\nshow it off to him while you two were having your little, ah, \u2018discussion\u2019. Speaking of\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhich, what\u2019s this about the Program being \u2018doomed\u2019? Bill, you looked particularly\u003Cbr\u003E\nconcerned about that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCaught completely off-guard, Bill struggled to explain this away but only managed to\u003Cbr\u003E\nget out a few \u2018ums\u2019 and \u2018ahhhs\u2019. By Harv she was a sharp one. \u201CAh, merely a figure of\u003Cbr\u003E\nspeech?\u201D he tried again, though the lie fell short even to his ears. Eyes narrowing,\u003Cbr\u003E\nJoliana turned her head. \u201CBob?\u201D she asked sharply.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh it\u2019s really nothing,\u201D Bob said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \u201CJust a minor piece\u003Cbr\u003E\nof legislation passing in Parliament to, oh, you know, shut down the Space Program as we\u003Cbr\u003E\nknow it. Nothing of any major concern whatsoever, I can really see why you kept that to\u003Cbr\u003E\nyourself, Bill.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMu\u2019s eye, Bob, give me a break. You\u2019ve kept your secrets too; like this fancy rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\ndesign you\u2019ve got the lab working on!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAs you said, Bill, it\u2019s not vital to the future of the Space Program! Why in Harv\u2019s name\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould you keep this decision secret, especially if you keep on shooting down any ideas\u003Cbr\u003E\non how to fix it?\u201D Bob retorted, voice rising once more. By Max, why couldn\u2019t he just\u003Cbr\u003E\nunderstand the scope of this problem?\u003Cbr\u003E\nBefore he could let loose, though, Jeb cut in. \u201CWell, actually\u2026this design might be vital\u003Cbr\u003E\nto the Program.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D asked Bill with disdain, turning to the former Director. \u201CYou\u003Cbr\u003E\ncan\u2019t possibly expect a new staging design will convince the bureaucrats, particularly one\u003Cbr\u003E\nthat\u2019s still just wild speculation and a number on a screen.\u201D After he\u2019d pointed this out,\u003Cbr\u003E\nhe realized that this was the first time he\u2019d spoken to Jebediah in over four months, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nfelt a little bad about his sharp tone. Not too bad though, he still wasn\u2019t exactly pleased\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe former Director was back.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBut don\u2019t you see? It\u2019s not the staging design itself, it\u2019s the payloads we could put into\u003Cbr\u003E\norbit! You saw those results, we could reach the Mun, with ships the size of Uranus IX,\u003Cbr\u003E\nand much safer too! Heck, we could even put huge payloads into Low Kerbin Orbit!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat would certainly make some in Parliament stop and think, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201D Jeb was\u003Cbr\u003E\nlooking more excited now, some hints of his old energy leaking back into his\u003Cbr\u003E\nmannerisms.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExactly, Jeb,\u201D Bob agreed, looking thoughtful. \u201CAll we need to do is likely just launch a\u003Cbr\u003E\npayload or two, whether to Mun Orbit or just to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the government has no\u003Cbr\u003E\nchoice but to keep us in action. It\u2019s not as if they have any other space launch options\u003Cbr\u003E\njust lying around!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill responded, still unconvinced. \u201CAt the moment, we\u2019re hopelessly behind the CKFN\u003Cbr\u003E\nfor launching capabilities, and from what the Prime Minister said, Parliament knows it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u2019s half the reason they\u2019re shutting us down; they think any achievements we gain\u003Cbr\u003E\nare just not worth the risk of rockets blowing up. The CKFN put kerbals around the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun, for Harv\u2019s sake! Even if we do manage to launch a payload into orbit, how are we\u003Cbr\u003E\nsupposed to show Parliament that we\u2019re not out of the game?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnalysis of the most recent Caelus mission showed that they only barely made it to the\u003Cbr\u003E\nMun, requiring refuelling en route,\u201D Joliana cut in. \u201CThe CKFN\u2019s rockets are incredibly\u003Cbr\u003E\nanemic, especially compared to this new design. They may be reliable and extensively\u003Cbr\u003E\ntested, but they trade that for raw performance. We now have the capability with this\u003Cbr\u003E\nnew method to overtake them by showing our rockets are far more powerful then\u003Cbr\u003E\ntheirs.\u201D Bill\u2019s brow furrowed. How on Kerbin did Bob\u2019s assistant know this much about\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN\u2019s rockets?\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnaware of Bill\u2019s musings, she continued. \u201CThis nets us a number of advantages. One,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe CKFN sees our technology has outclassed theirs and spends time rushing to catch\u003Cbr\u003E\nup. This diverts time from their inevitable Mun mission. Two, this makes the USKK\u003Cbr\u003E\nlook strong, and the CKFN weak, something which Parliament absolutely adores. Thus,\u003Cbr\u003E\neven the most die-hard factions in government will be inclined to allow us to continue,\u003Cbr\u003E\nso long as we continue to show off how much better USKK rocketry is than the\u003Cbr\u003E\ncompetition. And three, this puts us farther along the way for developing for a Munar\u003Cbr\u003E\nmission, as we have the launcher design completed, and by demonstrating the size of\u003Cbr\u003E\npayloads it can carry to orbit, we simply have to design a crew carrier and lander which\u003Cbr\u003E\nwill fit this design.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell said, Joli!\u201D Bob said as she finished her speech, clapping her on the shoulder.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis design will be the saviour of the Space Program yet!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt might be the saviour,\u201D corrected Bill. \u201CWe neither have a working design nor a\u003Cbr\u003E\npayload to show it off.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob glanced at Jeb. \u201CWell, we may have an answer to that. Remember that plan I told\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou Jeb was thinking about for how the Program should move forward?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb stepped forward. \u201CHey, hey, Bob, those were just my thoughts about some of the\u003Cbr\u003E\nProgram\u2019s future options, not really a cohesive plan,\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob continued anyway. \u201CNonsense, it was an excellent plan, and much better than how\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Program has been handled so far.\u201D This elicited a scowl from Bill. Bob was being\u003Cbr\u003E\nvery unfair; it wasn\u2019t easy being Director! Bob kept speaking. \u201CAs I recall, you proposed\u003Cbr\u003E\nusing the older-model boosters which launched the early Kaether spacecraft to lift\u003Cbr\u003E\nprobes to Kerbin orbit and beyond. Since a probe is much lighter than a kerbal, we\u003Cbr\u003E\ncould most likely make it to the Mun using just those basic one-metre stages.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re forgetting that those earlier boosters suffered failures too. What if the same\u003Cbr\u003E\nhappens again?\u201D Bill pointed out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow that the engineers have been reorganized, I\u2019m certain they can pull of\u003Cbr\u003E\nmanufacturing those simple rockets easily enough!\u201D Bob said, confidently.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHang on a minute, while we\u2019re tossing out ideas, I\u2014ah, may have one more,\u201D Jebediah\u003Cbr\u003E\noffered cautiously, with a look at Bill.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhat is it, Jeb?\u201D Bob asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWell, rather than just rehashing the early Kaether rockets with probes instead, why\u003Cbr\u003E\ndon\u2019t we use this new method of staging? Apparently it can easily be done with simple\u003Cbr\u003E\none metre stages.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s brilliant!\u201D Bob shouted excitedly. \u201CThen we can launch heavy payloads to\u003Cbr\u003E\nMunar orbit, all without the risk to kerbals you\u2019re so worried about, Bill!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe could even perhaps try to pull off a remote landing, if we could get a properly-\u003Cbr\u003E\nsized payload to the Mun. That would certainly put us ahead of the CKFN!\u201D Jeb said,\u003Cbr\u003E\ncracking a smile.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBill sighed. While he couldn\u2019t deny that a Munar landing would almost certainly\u003Cbr\u003E\nreverse Parliament\u2019s decision on the Program, this staging design still needed extensive\u003Cbr\u003E\ntesting before it could be deployed on an actual mission, and he said as much.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s true, Bill,\u201D Bob responded, \u201CBut we can easily test it with a simple test flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeck, that test flight could show just how much payload we can put into orbit, and\u003Cbr\u003E\nwould certainly wow Parliament!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce again, Bill sighed. He would have protested, but he was sick of rehashing the\u003Cbr\u003E\nsame argument over and over. Bob had finally worn him down. \u201CYou know what, fine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe\u2019ll do this.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt his words, Bob and Jeb shared a quick high-four. Bob quickly continued. \u201CBut it\u003Cbr\u003E\nneeds to be properly managed! I want you two to write down Jeb\u2019s \u2018plan\u2019 in a detailed\u003Cbr\u003E\nreport and give it to me by tomorrow. We\u2019re going to go over this piece by piece,\u003Cbr\u003E\nmaking sure everything makes sense. We can\u2019t afford any more mistakes.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nJebediah smiled. \u201CThanks Bill, we\u2019ll get on that right away! I understand if you\u2019re still\u003Cbr\u003E\nwary about trusting me with leadership, and I promise that I\u2019ll just help with the basic\u003Cbr\u003E\nframework of this plan; I\u2019ll leave you guys to debate the finer details like safety without\u003Cbr\u003E\nme.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2014ah, thanks Jeb,\u201D Bill said, hastily turning away. Despite Jeb\u2019s ideas on how to save\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Program, he still wasn\u2019t a fan that the kerbal was back. \u201CI think I\u2019ll head back to my\u003Cbr\u003E\noffice; I need a nap.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe walked away from Bob and Jeb (Joliana appeared to have wandered away at some\u003Cbr\u003E\npoint while Bob was shouting, perhaps joining the crowd) and pushed his way through\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe ongoing party. As he approached the exit, he noticed Gus, the chief scientist among\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe crowd. He was suddenly reminded of his question from earlier, and pulled that\u003Cbr\u003E\nkerbal aside.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYep, ah, how can I help you, Bill?\u201D Gus asked, looking a little put off by the fact he had\u003Cbr\u003E\nbeen dragged away from his party.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ll just be a moment. I had a question about the staging design. What are you guys\u003Cbr\u003E\ncalling it? I seem to recall you saying something about pancakes?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh dear me, no! That\u2019s just what the interns are describing the rocket as, though as I\u003Cbr\u003E\nsaid, with the proper engine design it won\u2019t be much wider than a conventional Uranus\u003Cbr\u003E\nlifter. No, we\u2019re naming it after the team who discovered it, which was in fact myself\u003Cbr\u003E\nand another kerbal, Perry Kerman.\u201D He pointed his colleague out of the crowd, who\u003Cbr\u003E\nturned out to be the one running around with the lamp shade on his head. \u201CWe\u2019re\u003Cbr\u003E\ncalling it Perry-Gus staging.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo that\u2019s the official name the department is calling this method?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CActually, it seems that the interns are trying to call it \u2018asparagus staging\u2019 as a bit of\u003Cbr\u003E\nplay on words, and they say that the rocket would actually look a bit like a bundle of\u003Cbr\u003E\nasparagus. They\u2019re putting it on all the official documents too, so it\u2019s a major pain to get\u003Cbr\u003E\nthem to stop repeating it. Eventually though, I\u2019m sure that this parody name will just\u003Cbr\u003E\nfade away into obscurity!\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s good to hear! Thanks, Gus,\u201D Bill said with a smile, and walked away. Even\u003Cbr\u003E\nthough Jeb was back, and Bill was under pressure from Parliament with this bill\u003Cbr\u003E\nshutting down the Space Program, it was good to hear that some kerbals were still\u003Cbr\u003E\nhaving fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\n?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTO BE CONTINUED\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading!
