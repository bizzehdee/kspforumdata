It was actually the part count limitation that was the biggest issue for me, but I was able to just about squeeze in an antenna and single solar panel so it\u0027s able to do multiple crew reports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually a really easy craft to fly and had quite a bit of fuel spare after the mission, so there\u0027s plenty room for error. Since this mission I\u0027ve used it quite a bit in early career mode, was especially useful at getting a bunch of Minmus contract done in one hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3YWZTGPT10?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe craft is \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/crafts/606\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Eavailable on KerbalX.com\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E if you want to give it a go.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
