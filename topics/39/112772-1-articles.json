Not just some .png with lines drawn on it in photoshop; a full-blown, high-quality, 16384x8192 digital map. \n\nI\u0027d like you guys to help me come up with stuff;\n\nCountries\n\nCities\n\nCultures/Cultural history\n\nGovernments\n\n1000-2000 years of political history\n\nNames of physical landmarks (Mountains, Oceans, Continents, etc.)\n\nPlease do not name anything after the Kerman brothers. They are far too recent in Kerbin\u0027s history to have any major landmarks named after them. Are there any landforms on Earth named after Neil Armstrong or Yuri Gagarin? No. \n\nThe image above is what I have so far, which I am currently working on in Qgis."},{"CreatedByName":"BriXman","CreatedById":89391,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:30:37Z","Content":"Countries: Some parody of the nordic countries, especially Sweden.
