I\u0027m currently drawing up plans for some capital ships. However, looking at the Spooky Classification System, I noticed a huge problem with it that I just couldn\u0027t leave unaddressed. So, I am going to explain what the problem is and what I\u0027m doing to correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem with the Spooky Classification System is that it isn\u0027t descriptive enough. The purpose of having a designation system is to give an idea as to what sort of characteristics that ship has, and what its role is in the fleet. The Spooky Classification system bases its designations off of the vehicle\u0027s mass, which by itself isn\u0027t enough to give any idea as to what each ship is supposed to do. And while certain types of ships certainly do lend themselves to having greater masses than other ships, that isn\u0027t why they are designated as such. A battleship isn\u0027t designated as a battleship because of it\u0027s size, but because it is meant to slug it out with other ships. And to do that, it needs to have big guns and heavy armor, which then results in a big ship with more mass. The mass comes with the type, but it does not define it. The ship type tells us \u003Cem\u003Ewhat\u003C/em\u003E the ship can do, not how big it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few other problems with it that stem from this. Namely that it manages to have both too many and too few ship types. For having only one descriptor that defines each ship type there are waaaay too many ship types in the Spooky Classification System. It\u0027s basically splitting hairs. Also, there is no variety in those ship types, because of the same thing. Only having one descriptor for ship types limits what kind of ships you can have. Also, it\u0027s way too strict, not giving players room to experiment with different designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now that I have stated my reasoning, it\u0027s time that I gave you my replacement. I call it the Advanced Ship Designation System. Instead of giving distinct mass ranges, this system gives a set of basic features and characteristics for people use as guidelines when designing and categorizing their ships. It\u0027s also intended to be specific enough to give an idea of what it\u0027s supposed to do, but vague enough to allow for experimentation.

However, looking at the Spooky Classification System, I noticed a huge problem with it that I just couldn\u0027t leave unaddressed. So, I am going to explain what the problem is and what I\u0027m doing to correct it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMust say that\u0027s an awesome system, the amount of effort you go to for stuff like that is tremendous. For now I\u0027m going to link that in the OP, though it\u0027s worth mentioning I\u0027m perhaps a little iffy about some of the classifications. Personally I\u0027ve always gone by one, rather simplistic system for the Kethane Station, for as long as I can remember. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDestroyers:\u003C/strong\u003E A ship designed with nothing in mind other than to kill and not be killed, there\u0027s room for additional features but there\u0027s an obvious priority, i.e. the Aegis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFrigates:\u003C/strong\u003E These are destroyers at heart; However they tend to be considerably smaller, having both less armour and weaponry. Giving them a considerable advantage in terms of speed. These ships usually end of doing a considerable amount of leg work in a battle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFighters:\u003C/strong\u003E I really have no word to differentiate these from their smaller brethren, so advice would be appreciated. Fighters are very much the next step down from frigates, although usually still capable of interplanetary travel, fighters often have little or no armour, are smaller still, and concentrate solely on speed and aggression; Using light yet powerful weapons: they are a serious threat. I.e. the Buzzard, or Macey Dean\u0027s \u0027Isprit\u0027. These craft are special in that they sometimes have atmospheric capabilities, however they are primarily for use in space. They\u0027re also what I might use in place of what you\u0027re calling a monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECarrier Fighters:\u003C/strong\u003E The smallest of the bunch, these are the grunt of the fleet. They\u0027re incredibly compact and only able to complete small transfers for themselves: so normally transported by carriers. With little to no armour and a particularly limited supply of ammunition (to be reloaded by their carrier). They are what you might call... disposable, but it\u0027s important to note that carrier fighters are actually where a lot of the battle is fought, partly due to their large number and speed. Making them invaluable in terms of risk:reward, i.e. the Raptor. These also happen to be what I might use in place of a monitor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECarriers:\u003C/strong\u003E Often kept back from the front of the battle, a carrier lacks serious armour and it\u0027s primary goal is to transport fighter\u0027s and ammo - although there\u0027s nothing stopping it from using that ammo if needs be, i.e. the Fortress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBattlecruisers:\u003C/strong\u003E Again, essentially a destroyer, but with one quite drastic twist: it is able to carry one or two fighters of it\u0027s own. At the expense of not quite as powerful weaponry as it might normally have, but not always. These also happen to end up being the largest in the fleet, depending on what you need to bring along in your carrier. (The best example of this in my series is the Dreadnaught, although SuperHappySquid\u0027s\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yfU31XbSwBw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E makes for a better fit).\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t help noticing that people have yet to make a proper classifications system for atmospheric craft, might be an idea.
