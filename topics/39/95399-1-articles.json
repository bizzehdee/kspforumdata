He designed the spacecraft and launch vehicle, then he built his super N1, flew to Mars and most likely abandoned the previous ships. I managed to reverse-engineer them basing on one screenshot of the lander and a short film from launch vehicle test. I made only few changes, added 2 tanks in the lander to increase error margin for return to Earth and removed the SRB from the launch rocket as they were not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9opyQAMI56Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
