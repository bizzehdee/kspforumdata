The kerblet rolled over sleepily, still clutching a stone in one small pudgy green fist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUmmy, \u0027one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle smiled, \u201CYes, beautiful girl, I can see you\u0027ve\u00A0still got your stone. Just you hold on to it and you\u0027ll still have it in the morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pulled the cover back over Joenie and watched as her daughter\u0027s eyelids drooped, struggled fitfully to stay open for just one last minute and then closed. She waited quietly for a moment, until the slowing pace of Joenie\u0027s breathing told her that she really was asleep, then turned away and tiptoed out of the sleep room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny was waiting for her on the porch. \u201CBoth asleep?\u0022\u00A0she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded. \u201CBoth absolutely out for the night,\u00A0touch wood.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Meleny chuckled softly. \u201CAnd so they should be. I\u0027ve never seen such a pair for getting into places that they shouldn\u0027t. Give them another month or two and we\u0027ll both be hard pressed to keep up with them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle sank into a chair. \u201CAnother month or two? I\u0027m hard pressed to keep up with her now and she\u0027s only barely walking! Although your Adbas seems to manage just fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny grinned. \u201CThe trick with Adbas is to keep him distracted. If he\u0027s busy enough playing with something new then he tends to keep still. For half a minute at least.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle groaned. \u201CI should probably have married a geologist then rather than a Keeper. At least a geologist would be able to provide a steady stream of new and interesting stones to play with.\u0022\u00A0She sighed. \u201CSpeaking of Keepers... I should probably go. Joenie should sleep through the night but the quicker I get back the better.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny shook her head in mock seriousness. \u201CWell I\u0027m just as happy that you married a Keeper. I don\u0027t want to even \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E about the chaos that either of our two would cause if they got their inquisitive little hands on Daddy\u0027s rock hammer!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth kerbals got to their feet. Gerselle gave Meleny a brief but heartfelt hug. \u201CThank you so much for looking after her tonight. I\u0027m afraid I might be imposing on you quite a bit more over the next few months as well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny looked at her curiously. \u201CHow much time does a growing Kerm actually need?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have no idea,\u0022\u00A0Gerselle confessed, \u201Cand the Records aren\u0027t much help either. They do give plenty of advice about \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E to talk to your Kerm but not very much at all about when, how often, or how much care they actually need.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny quirked an eyebrow at her. \u0022So, much like parenting books then? Lots of detail but none of it ever seems to apply to your own little bundle of joy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded wryly. \u201CProbably. Although I\u0027m also hoping that Kerms are at least a little bit like kerblets, and need less attention the older they get. As far as I know they can feed themselves too and don\u0027t need cleaning -\u00A0or at least I devoutly hope they don\u0027t!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny laughed. \u201CFeeding and bathing a Kerm!\u00A0I wouldn\u0027t know where to start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMe neither but I think I\u0027m about to find out. Peaceful night, Meleny.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPeaceful night, Gerselle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny watched as Gerselle set off down the path towards the rest of the village without even pausing to wave goodbye. Not that she blamed her. The care and feeding of kerblets was one thing, the care - and feeding, of Kerm was quite another. \u201CGood luck, Gerselle,\u0022 she whispered,\u00A0\u201CGood luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs she trotted across the village green towards her makeshift shelter, Gerselle reflected that whatever was about to happen, it was at least a good night for it. The young Kerm was far too small to build a hut around of course, so the best she had been able to do was a rough lean-to to keep the worst of any rain off her sleeping pallet. Not that that was going to be terribly comfortable either but it would have been far worse if it had actually been raining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe reached the entrance to the lean-to and ducked under it, being especially careful not to brush up against the Kerm sapling in her way. Munlight glowed softly through the chinks in the roof as she dragged her pallet over to the sapling and crawled into bed, carefully working her head under the newly unfurled cluster of leaves midway up its slender trunk. She lifted her head until it brushed against the leaves, slipping her pillow under her neck as she did so. Then, not really knowing what else to do, she waited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe leaves were cool and felt slightly prickly as they rested against her forehead. They also didn\u0027t seem to be doing very much. Gerselle tried to remember if the Records had mentioned anything about this but to the best of her recollection, most of the advice revolved around what to do once the Kerm had made contact. The concept of a shy Kerm didn\u0027t really seem to have been a consideration. She frowned and reached around behind her to massage her neck, lifting her head up as she did so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe prickly feeling against her skin was abruptly replaced by an unpleasant crawling sensation as the leaf hairs began to wriggle against her scalp. Startled, Gerselle\u0027s head thumped against her pillow as she reflexively flinched away. That... crawling feeling, wasn\u0027t at all like the mild tickling that Jonton had described but perhaps he was just used to it. Or maybe his Kerm was just older and a little more practised at making contact. Still, there was no avoiding it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle rolled up her poncho into a bundle and wedged it under her pillow to provide a little more height. Then, gritting her teeth, she shuffled up the pallet until her head was in place back under the Kerm leaves. Instantly, the crawling sensation started up again and Gerselle clenched her calves as she tried to remain still. Fortunately, the feeling did subside into more of a tickling feeling as the leaf hairs burrowed underneath the more sensitive outer layers of her skin. Then they stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a pregnant pause. Gerselle breathed deeply, trying to still her racing pulse and calm her thoughts. If she tried hard, she could almost believe that she felt a faint tendril of \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E thought brushing against her mind but it was extremely tentative, darting away as soon as she tried to reach out to it. Remembering the advice from the Records, Gerselle stopped trying to focus on the fleeting glimpses of thought and instead did her best to project broader feelings of welcome and reassurance. It seemed to work. The tendril still felt very cautious as it approached but this time there was a definite moment of contact. A brief wash of \u003Cem\u003Earoma\u003C/em\u003E swept against Gerselle\u0027s mind and then withdrew. Emboldened by her lack of response, the tendril came forward again, brushing more confidently against her. Gerselle\u0027s nose twitched at the scent. Other tendrils circled round and then settled delicately against her mind. More scents swept through her brain and then more and yet more, as the Kerm opened itself up to her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s nostrils fluttered wildly as the flood of aromas cascaded through her. Overloaded, her brain began to interpret them as bursts of colour and even snatches of sound. A distant, rational part of her realised that the Kerm must perceive almost \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E through smell - it\u0027s world was in the minutia of the soil and the creatures within it. Creatures that had no need of light and had only the crudest sense of sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of her struggled to hold itself together against the torrent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerm seemed to realise that she was struggling and the flood of information slowed. The lean-to around her had been replaced by a surreal landscape of coloured blotches. Fragments of sound fluttered across it, snatches of birdsong, the wind in the trees, a babble of voices, the tap tap tap of footprints across the porch. A furious melange of scents still bombarded her, some pleasant, some... very pleasant indeed. Gerselle cheeks flamed in the darkness and she devoutly hoped that the Kerm was not aware of the significance of \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E particular smell. Other scents were less enjoyable and occasionally she felt a very strong urge to gag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Gerselle relaxed, the landscape began to shift. Slowly at first and then jumping randomly from scene to scene. None of it made the slightest bit of sense but at the back of her mind she could sense happiness, excitement and an almost childlike enthusiasm. The phrase\u00A0\u201CUmmy, \u0027one!\u0022\u00A0drifted through her head and she fought down an urge to burst out laughing. The Kerm really wasn\u0027t so very different from a kerblet after all and it had the same infectious joy and desire to share its world with her. She couldn\u0027t really make out very much of what it was trying to tell her - and indeed she had a sense that the Kerm itself didn\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Eunderstand\u003C/em\u003E very much of it either, it was simply repeating what it had sensed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle had no idea how long she had been in communion with the Kerm but the colours around her were starting to blur and melt into one another. The scents were also becoming more muted and she had the distinct feeling that the Kerm was tiring. In response, she did her best to project thoughts of sleep and rest. A thought struck her and she focused firmly on an image of the Kerm leaves lifting away from her head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;disappointment\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle was stymied. How could she explain that she would be back soon? Did the Kerm even have a sense of the passing of time? Then an another idea struck her. She did her best to recall the aroma of damp earth in the morning and the scent of Kerm leaves in the early morning mist. She let the memory fade out and be replaced by the feeling of cold on a starry night and the crisp clean scents of the evening air. Finally she focused on herself, lying under the Kerm sapling and lifting her head up to brush against its leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;happiness\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;more more more\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;not now\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe colours around her faded away. Gerselle was only vaguely aware of the leaf hairs withdrawing from her scalp as she slumped down in her bed, utterly drained. Blinking, she stared at the clock hanging from a nearby branch. Only an hour to cram all that sensation into? Small wonder she was so spent. Still - at least she hadn\u0027t kept Meleny waiting too long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, Gerselle wasn\u0027t feeling a great deal less tired. She had made the mistake of telling Joenie that Daddy was coming back tomorrow, which had led to a tearful bedtime when Daddy failed to appear. Gerselle had eventually soothed her by promising that she would see him in \u0027one sleep\u0027. One very short sleep as it happened. Joenie of course had been up at first light, whereupon she had promptly toddled across to Gerselle\u0027s bed, squeaking in excitement. Gerselle still had no idea how she had managed to climb up onto the covers but not only had she managed it but she then proceeded to bounce cheerfully up and down on Gerselle\u0027s stomach babbling \u0027Dadadadadadada\u0027 to herself. Groaning, Gerselle had bowed to the inevitable and climbed out of bed for a very early breakfast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had been a trying morning, with a very excited kerblet but now they were standing by the side of the road at the edge of the village, watching a small figure walk towards them. As the figure drew closer, Gerselle smiled to see Jonton\u0027s familiar ambling walk. She put Joenie down and waved to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere you go, beautiful. Why don\u0027t you go and say hello to Daddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie perked up. \u201CDadada? DADADADA!\u0022\u00A0She scampered off down the road. Jonton dropped to one knee and flung his arms open in welcome. As Joenie crashed pell-mell into him, he swept his arms around her in a great bear hug and kissed her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey hey, big girl! Where did you learn to run so fast?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie clung to him for a moment and then squirmed around and pointed back to Gerselle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUmmy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s right - mummy. Shall we go and give her a hug?\u0022\u00A0Jonton settled Joenie onto one arm, dropped his backpack and sprinted up the road. Tears prickled his eyes as he saw Gerselle\u0027s face and put his arms around her and Joenie both, in a long wordless embrace. \u201CIt\u0027s been far too long,\u0022\u00A0he murmured into her ear. Gerselle didn\u0027t reply but just drew him closer until Joenie squeaked in protest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh - sorry. Are we squashing you, little lady?\u0022\u00A0Jonton gently disentangled himself and put Joenie down on the ground. Gerselle squeezed his arm briefly before retrieving a large pack at her feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo what now, love. Do I get to see the new village?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn a while. I thought it would be good to get a little time to ourselves first.\u0022\u00A0She shook the pack. \u201CHow about some lunch in the new Grove?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three kerbals made their way up the hill. Gerselle smiled to herself as Joenie grabbed hold of Jonton\u0027s hand, forcing him to alternately shuffle and skip along behind her, almost bent over double. As the path got steeper, he stopped, scooped a delighted Joenie up and settled her on his shoulders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s better.\u0022\u00A0Jonton\u0027s back popped as he took a good look around him for the first time. \u201CThis looks a bit different than I remember.\u0022\u00A0Wonderingly, he walked up to one of the Kerm saplings and stared at it in delight. \u201CThis is looking remarkably healthy - in fact the whole hill is looking remarkably healthy given what I remember of the soil.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle nodded. \u201CThe clover is doing well. This is our second crop now, after ploughing the first lot back into the ground.\u0022 She laughed, \u201CYou always did tell me that the Kerm would speak to me through it\u0027s leaves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton looked puzzled. \u201CIt does,\u0022\u00A0he said slowly, \u201Cbut not until the knitting is complete. How did you know it wanted you to plant the clover?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s eyes widened. \u201CThrough the spots on the leaves of course. It\u0027s all written down in the Records.\u0022\u00A0She walked up behind him and pointed over his shoulder. \u201CThey\u0027re fading a bit now - I guess the soil has improved slightly - but you can still see the blue dapples. Different colours and patterns mean different things but apparently blue means \u0027plant clover\u0027. It took quite a while to work out since the oldest Records aren\u0027t very clear but it certainly seems to be working.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head in disbelief. \u201CMessages in dappled leaves. I had no idea! I guess my old Kerm is settled enough now that it doesn\u0027t need those sort of messages any more. Anyway - this looks like the perfect spot for lunch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe three kerbals settled down onto the clover. Jonton kept half an eye on Joenie as Gerselle opened her pack and set out a simple meal of greenleaf rolls, cold sapwood cordial with milk, baked tubers and plump orange sunfruit. As he bit appreciatively into a tuber, he was mildly surprised to see Joenie grabbing pieces of roll and stuffing them into her mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle caught his surprised look. \u201CI\u0027ve had to stop making them with luffa eye peppers,\u0022\u00A0she said ruefully. \u201CThose didn\u0027t go down too well but yes, she loves greenleaf.\u0022\u00A0She paused as Joenie grabbed another morsel from her plate. \u201CAnd baked tuber too apparently. At least they\u0027re probably a bit better for her digestion. Too much greenleaf tends to have unfortunate effects.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter lunch, the two adult kerbals sprawled out companiably on the clover, watching Joenie scamper over the hilltop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CShe really can move on those little legs,\u0022\u00A0Jonton said in wonder. Gerselle smiled proudly, \u201CYou should see her with her friends. Always the first into everything, although Meleny\u0027s Adbas is usually a close second!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn excited voice drifted over to them, \u201CUrm \u0027ummy, Urm!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton raised his eyebrows, \u201CKerm?\u0022\u00A0he said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWorm, I expect,\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle. \u201CWorms, leaves and especially stones - it\u0027s all new and exciting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if to prove her mother right, Joenie hurtled towards them, clutching something in her hand. She dropped it proudly on the ground in front of Jonton. \u201C\u0027One, dada, \u0027one!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravely, Jonton picked up the stone for inspection. Oh - that\u0027s a good stone, sweetheart. Look, can you see the fossil?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COssil!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s right. Fossil.\u0022\u00A0He offered the chunk of rock back to his daughter. \u201CJoenie want stone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie shook her head firmly. \u201CDada\u00A0ossil.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton was oddly touched. \u201CThat\u0027s very kind - thank you, Joenie,\u0022\u00A0he said solemnly.

Not that she blamed her. The care and feeding of kerblets was one thing, the care and\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 feeding, of Kerm was quite another. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGood luck Gerselle she whispered, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGood luck.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs she trotted across the village green towards her makeshift shelter, Gerselle reflected that whatever was about to happen, it was at least a good night for it. The young Kerm was far too small to build a hut around of course, so the best she had been able to do was a rough lean-to to keep the worst of any rain off her sleeping pallet. Not that that was going to be terribly comfortable either but it would have been far worse if it had actually been raining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe reached the entrance to the lean-to and ducked under it, being especially careful not to brush up against the Kerm sapling in her way. Munlight glowed softly through the chinks in the roof as she dragged her pallet over to the sapling and crawled into bed, carefully working her head under the newly unfurled cluster of leaves midway up its slender trunk. She lifted her head until it brushed against the leaves, slipping her pillow under her neck as she did so. Then, not really knowing what else to do, she waited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe leaves were cool and felt slightly prickly as they rested against her forehead. They also didn\u0027t seem to be doing very much. Gerselle tried to remember if the Records had mentioned anything about this but to the best of her recollection, most of the advice revolved around what to do once the Kerm had made contact. The concept of a shy Kerm didn\u0027t really seem to have been a consideration. She frowned and reached around behind her to massage her neck, lifting her head up as she did so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prickly feeling against her skin was abruptly replaced by an unpleasant crawling sensation as the leaf hairs began to wriggle against her scalp. Startled, Gerselle\u0027s head thumped against her pillow as she reflexively flinched away. That... crawling feeling, wasn\u0027t at all like the mild tickling that Jonton had described but perhaps he was just used to it. Or maybe his Kerm was just older and a little more practised at making contact. Still, there was no avoiding it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerselle rolled up her poncho into a bundle and wedged it under her pillow to provide a little more height. Then, gritting her teeth, she shuffled up the pallet until her head was in place back under the Kerm leaves. Instantly, the crawling sensation started up again and Gerselle clenched her calves as she tried to remain still. Fortunately, the feeling did subside into more of a tickling feeling as the leaf hairs burrowed underneath the more sensitive outer layers of her skin. Then they stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a pregnant pause. Gerselle breathed deeply, trying to still her racing pulse and calm her thoughts. If she tried hard, she could almost believe that she felt a faint tendril of \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E thought brushing against her mind but it was extremely tentative, darting away as soon as she tried to reach out to it. Remembering the advice from the Records, Gerselle stopped trying to focus on the fleeting glimpses of thought and instead did her best to project broader feelings of welcome and reassurance. It seemed to work. The tendril still felt very cautious as it approached but this time there was a definite moment of contact. A brief wash of \u003Cem\u003Earoma\u003C/em\u003E swept against Gerselle\u0027s mind and then withdrew. Emboldened by her lack of response, the tendril came forward again, brushing more confidently against her. Gerselle\u0027s nose twitched at the scent. Other tendrils circled round and then settled delicately against her mind. More scents swept through her brain and then more and yet more, as the Kerm opened itself up to her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerselle\u0027s nostrils fluttered wildly as the flood of aromas cascaded through her. Overloaded, her brain began to interpret them as bursts of colour and even snatches of sound. A distant, rational part of her realised that the Kerm must perceive almost \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E through smell - it\u0027s world was in the minutia of the soil and the creatures within it. Creatures that had no need of light and had only the crudest sense of sound. The rest of her struggled to hold itself together against the torrent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerm seemed to realise that she was struggling and the flood of information slowed. The lean-to around her had been replaced by a surreal landscape of coloured blotches. Fragments of sound fluttered across it, snatches of birdsong, the wind in the trees, a babble of voices, the tap tap tap of footprints across the porch. A furious melange of scents still bombarded her, some pleasant, some... very pleasant indeed. Gerselle cheeks flamed in the darkness and she devoutly hoped that the Kerm was not aware of the significance of \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E particular smell. Other scents were less enjoyable and occasionally she felt a very strong urge to gag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Gerselle relaxed, the landscape began to shift. Slowly at first and then jumping randomly from scene to scene. None of it made the slightest bit of sense but at the back of her mind she could sense happiness, excitement and an almost childlike enthusiasm. The phrase \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUmmy, \u0027one!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 drifted through her head and she fought down an urge to burst out laughing. The Kerm really wasn\u0027t so very different from a kerblet after all and it had the same infectious joy and desire to share its world with her. She couldn\u0027t really make out very much of what it was trying to tell her - and indeed she had a sense that the Kerm itself didn\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Eunderstand\u003C/em\u003E very much of it either, it was simply repeating what it had sensed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerselle had no idea how long she had been in communion with the Kerm but the colours around her were starting to blur and melt into one another. The scents were also becoming more muted and she had the distinct feeling that the Kerm was tiring. In response, she did her best to project thoughts of sleep and rest. A thought struck her and she focused firmly on an image of the Kerm leaves lifting away from her head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;disappointment\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGerselle was stymied. How could she explain that she would be back soon? Did the Kerm even have a sense of the passing of time? Then an another idea struck her. She did her best to recall the aroma of damp earth in the morning and the scent of Kerm leaves in the early morning mist. She let the memory fade out and be replaced by the feeling of cold on a starry night and the crisp clean scents of the evening air. Finally she focused on herself, lying under the Kerm sapling and lifting her head up to brush against its leaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;happiness\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;more more more\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;not now\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe colours around her faded away. Gerselle was only vaguely aware of the leaf hairs withdrawing from her scalp as she slumped down in her bed, utterly drained. Blinking, she stared at the clock hanging from a nearby branch. Only an hour to cram all that sensation into? Small wonder she was so spent. Still - at least she hadn\u0027t kept Meleny waiting too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next morning, Gerselle wasn\u0027t feeling a great deal less tired. She had made the mistake of telling Joenie that Daddy was coming back tomorrow, which had led to a tearful bedtime when Daddy failed to appear. Gerselle had eventually soothed her by promising that she would see him in \u0027one sleep\u0027. One very short sleep as it happened. Joenie of course had been up at first light, whereupon she had promptly toddled across to Gerselle\u0027s bed, squeaking in excitement.

We might be able to work something out from the telemetry but speaking personally, that telemetry is going to make a lot more sense after a couple of mugs of Jorfurt\u0027s latest and a good long sleep.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stared at him and then dismissively shrugged his shoulders. \u201CWhatever you say, Jeb. I doubt that anyone else will go for it though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a rare hint of steel in Jeb\u0027s voice. \u201CNot my problem, Genie,\u0022\u00A0he replied, \u201CI\u0027m leaving it to you to persuade them. And if all else fails, I\u0027ll chase every last one of them out of the warehouse and lock the door.\u0022\u00A0The steel disappeared as Jeb sagged against the doorframe, massaging his temples. \u201CBesides,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI know \u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m\u003C/em\u003E bushed, so I hate to think how everyone else is feeling right now. If we start putting another rocket together in this state, we\u0027re more likely to burn the place down than anything else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney threw up his hands. \u201CYou\u0027re probably right,\u0022\u00A0he said grudgingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked at him wearily. \u201CThanks, Genie. I\u0027d better go speak to Leland and let him know what happened - and what we plan to do about it. He\u0027s bound to ask anyway.\u0022\u00A0He glanced around the bunker. \u201CI\u0027ll meet everyone back at the warehouse in an hour or so.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s shoulders were slumped as he walked towards the main warehouse and vehicle assembly building. The press interview had gone fairly well all things considered and he thought that he had been reasonably optimistic without sounding too forced. However, no amount of quietly confident replies to Leland\u0027s questions could disguise the fact that their first attempt at a Munar flight hadn\u0027t even made it into low Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETime to put on the public face, Jeb\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0he thought to himself, as he squared his shoulders, forced the scowl off his face and opened the warehouse door. Inside, the atmosphere was unsurprisingly gloomy, with despondent kerbals standing around in small groups. He spotted Geneney in one corner and dipped his head briefly. Geneney caught his eye and nodded back, before stepping out into the middle of the warehouse floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u0027s no good way of saying this, people, so I\u0027ll get right to the point. Today was a setback.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shut the door quietly behind him and went over to sit down beside Bill and Bob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut it\u0027s a setback we can overcome. We know the Moho booster works, we know it will be enough for what we have in mind and I have absolutely no doubt that we can work out what went wrong, fix it and then put today behind us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe babble of voices died away. Geneney bowed his head in acknowledgement and then straightened up with a determined expression on his face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI can tell you right now that this is not going to be a finger pointing exercise. We all build them, we all fly them and when they go wrong - well we all share that too. I\u0027ve seen what comes out of our workshops - each and every kerbal here does good work and I know that nobody but \u003Cem\u003Enobody\u003C/em\u003E wanted that flight to fail.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd I can also tell you right now that I am \u003Cem\u003Eproud\u003C/em\u003E to be standing here today!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney noticed the confused looks from around the room and the corner of his mouth briefly twitched upwards as he continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI am proud to be working with a team that has overcome impossible obstacles and a shoestring budget to do things that have \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E been done before. A team that can build an honest-to-Kerm rocket ship, by hand, from the raw metal upwards - and then put the son-of-a-gronnek into \u003Cem\u003Eorbit!\u0022\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EGeneney jabbed himself in the chest for emphasis. \u201CForget what I said about doing good work - you people are doing awesome work!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney was startled to realise that his fists were clenched and his voice was cracking. He paused, striving for a lighter tone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFor now though, I think we all deserve a break. I know I\u0027ve been putting the hours in over the last couple of weeks but I\u0027ve never yet managed to be the first in or the last out of this warehouse. I\u0027m not going to name any names but I\u0027m pretty sure that at least two of you have been spending your nights sleeping under a workbench for most of the last week! Jeb\u0027s still looking for his spare toothbrush by the way so if someone could put it back that would be good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a patter of rather forced laughter. Most of the kerbals standing around Geneney began to look more enthusiastic, although some were muttering worriedly to their neighbours. Geneney raised a hand as the muttered comments began to swell into a general grumble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know that taking a break isn\u0027t what some of you want to hear but trust me on this one. I can\u0027t tell you how often we ended up banging our heads against some problem with the Kerbal 1 and just getting nowhere. We usually found that the best way to solve that problem was to take a couple of days off, maybe work on some other part for a bit and then come back to it with a clear head.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo I tell you what we\u0027re going to do. We\u0027re going to kick back, spend some time on the beach, maybe have a few drinks. I\u0027d promise you a fireworks display but Jeb gets... excitable around fireworks so I think we\u0027ll give those a miss. Then we\u0027re going to come back in here tomorrow afternoon, we\u0027re going to work through this little problem and then we\u0027re going to put the next rocket right smack into orbit around the M\u00FCn!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded in satisfaction as the sullen muttering faded into cheerful chatter. He sprang to his feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSounds good to me, Genie! Ornie - I\u0027m going to need a lift down to Jorfurt\u0027s to pick up a couple of casks and other suitable refreshment. You\u0027re our resident barbecue expert, so grab a couple of volunteers and figure out what you need for the catering. Bob - you\u0027re in charge of music. Everyone else - we\u0027re gonna need plenty of firewood, something to sit on and a table or two to put the food on. And if anyone has any games they want to bring along, then feel free!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe junkyard gates swung open and a motley array of vehicles trundled out. Ornie\u0027s truck led the way, indicators flashing as it turned right on its way to Barkton town centre. It was followed by a handful of cars, each crammed full of eager kerbals. Finally, with a rumbling of engines, two motorcycles rolled through the gates, ridden by Wilford and Camrie with Seelan and Lodan sitting bolt upright behind them. Lodan hopped off to close the gates, before leaping back on behind Wilford. With a roar, the two bikes raced away, heeling over sharply as they swung round the corner and rode away down towards the beach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Ornie\u0027s truck pulled up on the edge of the sand, a firepit had already been dug out and a large heap of driftwood piled up inside. A semicircle of stones were carefully laid out on one side of the pit to form the beginnings of a makeshift barbecue grill. Two tables stood ready by the firepit and assorted chairs, old tyres and large rocks were scattered in a loose circle around the heap of wood. Ornie noticed Bob\u0027s guitar resting jauntily against one of the chairs. Half a dozen kerbals stood around chatting, watching the others marking out a large circle in the damp sand further down the beach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb scrambled out of the front seat, slamming the door closed behind him. No sooner had he made his way round to the back of the truck than all six kerbals were running up to help unload it. Ornie retrieved his trolley from the back seat and was busy setting it up, when he heard a loud clunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey!\u0022\u00A0shouted Jeb, \u201CThis isn\u0027t a keg of Wakira Special you two are thumping about! If you can\u0027t take better care of one of Jorfurt\u0027s brews you\u0027re not going to be drinking any of it later.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie appeared round the side of the truck, carrying his trolley in one hand. Calzer and Tomcas had propped up two planks against the back and were cheerfully rolling a keg down them. He raised his eyebrows at the impromptu ramp and then very pointedly, pressed a button on the tailgate. With a wheeze of hydraulics, the tail lift slowly unfolded and lowered itself to the ground. Calzer and Tomcas looked appropriately sheepish as Jeb scowled at them. \u201CYou two can carry this down to the beach - and just be happy that Genie didn\u0027t catch you mistreating the beer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jeb stood by the heap of driftwood, he could hear the swishing of knives and other assorted cooking implements as Roncott and Lowise busied themselves making vegetable skewers, spiced meatcakes and other delicacies for the barbecue. Wilford and Camrie were helping after a fashion but as far as he could tell, were actually spending more time regaling the others with tales of their flights into space. Calzer and Tomcas were setting up the trestles for the beer kegs and Jeb was inwardly amused to see the extreme care with which they lifted the first keg into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAcross the beach, the rest of the team appeared to playing some kind of game. From what Jeb could see, it appeared to involve standing in front of a stick whilst someone threw a ball at you and then clouting the ball away as hard as you could using a wooden bat. Beyond that it was all vaguely confusing, although judging from the level of noise and general excitement, everyone seemed to be having fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COrnie,\u0022\u00A0he asked plaintively, \u201Ccould you please tell me what on Kerbin they are doing down there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie grinned. \u201CLooks like Richlin is teaching them shepherdball,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201COr the simple version of it anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EShepherd\u003C/em\u003Eball?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure. Very popular on the Wakira coast. Me and Richlin used to spend a fair amount of time on the air show circuit around there and learning to play shepherdball was practically mandatory. A good hard packed runway makes a surprisingly good batting surface at a pinch.\u0022\u00A0Ornie gazed reflectively at the players in the distance.\u201CI never was much good at it myself but Richlin was a fair old spin bowler back in the day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou do realise that I don\u0027t have the slightest idea what you\u0027re talking about don\u0027t you?\u0022\u00A0said Jeb. Across the beach, he heard a distant thwack and a roar went up as the ball sailed high over the heads of the hapless kerbals attempting to catch it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeside him, Ornie launched into an enthusiastic lecture on the basics of shepherdball. By the time he reached the finer points of the different bowling styles, Jeb had a rather glazed expression on his face. \u201CAnyway, spin, seam, swing - it\u0027s all about getting the ball to move around in mid-air. Quite a nice exercise in applied aerodynamics actually - I reckon Bill would get the idea pretty quickly!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked bemused. \u201CWell once Bill\u0027s got the idea, you can both try explaining it all to me again,\u0022\u00A0he said. Then he brightened up. \u201CAnyway, forget aerodynamics - it\u0027s time for a quick exercise in\u00A0pyrodynamics! Time to get the fire going before those shepherders, shepherds - what the Kerm do you call a shepherdball player anyway - get back here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie laughed. \u201CPlenty of time yet,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u201CBy my count they\u0027re only about half way through the second innings.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe driftwood was bone dry and presently Jeb had built up the fire into a cheerful roaring blaze. By the time the first shepherdball players started making their way up the beach, Ornie had raked out a bed of embers into the barbecue pit and was squatting by the grill, sauce bottle close at hand and intently watching the first few sizzling meatcakes as they started to brown. As he trickled a generous portion of sticky brown sauce over them, noses began to twitch all around the fire as the sweetly spicy aroma rose into the evening air. On the other side of the fire, Jeb was standing behind the kegs, cheerfully serving drinks and taking the occasional healthy swig from his own mug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long while there was nothing to hear but the crackling of the fire, the sizzling of the coals under the barbecue and the contented sounds of hungry kerbals steadily working their way through Roncott, Lowise and Ornie\u0027s cooking. As everyone began to put their plates to one side, Jeb topped up everyone\u0027s drink and then turned to Bob with a grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou weren\u0027t planning to just sit and look at that guitar all evening were you, Bobcat?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob popped the last fragment of chargrilled mushroom into his mouth and stifled a belch. \u201CNow that you mention it, Jeb,\u0022\u00A0he said solemnly,\u00A0\u201CI have been working on a song or two for just such an occasion.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe rubbed his fingers in the sand to scrub off the grease and then picked up the guitar leaning against his seat. He strummed it briskly, head tipped to one side as he listened for any out of tune strings and then satisfied, climbed unsteadily to his feet. \u201CMy friends,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CI give you - the Ballad of the Kerbal 1.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob slowly began to pick out a familiar melody and as the conversations around the fire gradually petered out, he began to sing along;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt first I was afraid. I was petrified...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThought we would never make it back, if we let Jebediah drive.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a roar of laughter as Jeb leapt to his feet and sketched a bow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd so I spent oh so many nights, thinking what could all go wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I got onboard - and I brought parachutes along...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tempo of the music began to speed up. Everyone around the fire began to clap along in time as Bob\u0027s fingers danced over the strings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd now we\u0027re back! From the edge of space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rode shotgun on the launch with my friend Bill in the far left place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe saw the M\u00FCun. We saw the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd we even made it home without too many scars!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy now Bob had one foot up on his seat as he enthusiastically strummed away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh yeah we\u0027re back. From the edge of space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe soared across the sky - and you should have seen Jeb\u0027s face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe saw the M\u00FCn. We saw the stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the capsule seat, got imprinted on my...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, Bob\u0027s chair collapsed and he tumbled over onto the sand, guitar waving in the air. Jeb darted forward to help his friend and did his best to keep a straight face as he saw Geneney surreptitiously moving his foot back out of the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs kerbal after kerbal called out with requests for their favourite songs, Ornie was surprised to see Jeb looking rather misty eyed. \u0022Are you OK there, Jeb?\u0022 he asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m fine, Ornie. Bob\u0027s song just brought it all back is all. Blame it on the beer.\u0022 Jeb stared into the dwindling flames of the bonfire. \u0022But yeah - that\u0027s pretty much what it was like. We climbed into that capsule, knowing that it was our last shot and hoping to Kerm that we hadn\u0027t forgotten anything vital.\u0022 Jeb gave him a wry look. \u0022Almost everyone had written off those \u0027crazy interplanetary characters\u0027 by then and we really were down to the bottom of the parts bin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie had the grace to look embarrassed but Jeb waved away his half formed apologies. \u0022No need to apologise,\u0022 he said gruffly, \u0022You were far from the last - and we\u0027d been called far worse by then anyway. Besides, even after the Kerbal 1, I\u0027m not sure what we\u0027d have done without you and Richlin on the team. We wouldn\u0027t be planning our fourth orbital flight, that\u0027s for certain.\u0022 Jeb smiled grimly, \u0022Fourth orbital flight... that\u0027ll be sticking in the craw of those fardling \u0027experts\u0027 at the Institute.\u0022 He snorted. \u0022Except that most of them will just be telling everyone how they knew it was a good idea all along.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb looked down at his mug and shook his head. \u0022Think I\u0027m going to warn Jorfurt to stop serving this one at least an hour before closing time. Never known one of his brews to hit me like this.\u0022 He winced as Bob tried for a top note and didn\u0027t quite make it. \u0022Anyway, no need to eat that old soup again. What Genie said this afternoon back at the warehouse - I couldn\u0027t have put it better myself.\u0022 Ornie glanced over at Jeb and saw the familiar determined look back on his face. \u0022And I still havn\u0027t forgotten what I said to Genie about scouting for landing sites either.
