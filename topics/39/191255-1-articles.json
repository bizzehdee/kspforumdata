This means no gimbal, no liquid fuel engines other than LVT-30, no control surface fins etc. Along the way, I got rather attached to Jeb, and built a story around\u00A0this mission: why is he alone?

Marker, within sight of the township of Shoreton, and his workplace, the legendary (or not so much anymore) Kerbal Space Center. However, he was camping behind an outcropping on the western edge of the lower slopes, and so had no view, except that of a ochre-streaked, pointed cliff face directly opposite. Jeb was an avid mountaineer, and had shot to fame by climbing 6,764m to the peak of Mount Melancholia, the tallest mountain on Kerbin. This, of course, was before his hot-headed and reckless younger self signed up to be bolted into manned cruise missiles and shot onto various sub-orbital trajectories around Kerbin. He\u2019d retired from active corps duty three years ago- too much strain on the old back, being compressed under 12 G\u2019s- but had taken up an advisory role on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s directorial board. \u003Cem\u003EFat lot of good that did,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thought Jeb bitterly, \u003Cem\u003Enine years we\u2019ve been blasting those bloody things away, and what? Four manned orbits, and a couple probes to Mun and Minmus, which have all stopped working now, of course. Our technology is a shambles. We\u2019ve got one viable liquid fueled engine, for Kraken\u2019s sake! The military\u2019s weapon tests have been to space more than we have!\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd unfortunately, it was the truth. Kerbin\u2019s nuclear missile program had heated up recently: Lusikrantz to the north had 250 missiles, Jeb\u2019s own nation of the United Kerbinai Republic had about 400, and the crazy eastern stand-up guys in Kolusia were rumored to have tested a \u2018super-yield\u2019 bomb, twenty times more powerful than the UKN\u2019s biggest. And that wasn\u2019t even half the threats pointed at Kerbalkind: the civil war in Lusikrantz had some pretty nasty biological bombs being lobbed around, and the mineral drilling off the Alverian coast had caused that 200-meter tsunami a couple years back. Rumor had it at least fifty thousand square miles of the coastline were still flooded. No wonder the scientists had moved the Big Ticker\u2019s hands to fifteen seconds before lunch. Lunch being the metaphorical date that the entire Kerbal species was taken out for \u2018lunch\u2019, although what lunch was, nobody knew for sure. \u003Cem\u003EProbably best if I stick to the mountains for now,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Jeb chuckled inwardly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a ear-burning whine, coming from somewhere above his head. Curious and more than a little terrified, Jeb poked his head out of the tent\u2019s front flap, and peeked over the nearest outcrop just in time to see the sky turn from the lightening mauve of early dawn, to a searing, cold white light. All the microhairs on his skin stood on end. Suddenly, there was a distant boom, like the clap of a giant audience, and Jeb was bowled over, cracking his head against a rock and screaming as the lights behind his eyes went out.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nWhite. \u003Cem\u003EBlink\u003C/em\u003E. Snow, cold, orange. \u003Cem\u003EBlink\u003C/em\u003E. Tent, rock, cliff. Jebediah Kerman, Jr. sat up and rubbed his eyes, massaging his head as he did so. \u003Cem\u003EAw, sap. What on Kerbin happened?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0he wondered aloud as he shuffled back to his seemingly undamaged tent to collect his supplies. Unzipping the front flap and clutching the threadbare straps of his climbing kit bag, he groped around for the retractor strap that would compact the tent and allow it to fit in his backpack. He grabbed the little red strap at the same moment his right foot slipped. The involuntary reaction caused him to yank the strap while his head was still enclosed in the tent, which instantly closed around Jeb\u2019s head, exactly as the bag had been designed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nAfter a shout and a couple of choice words, Jeb\u2019s first correctly marshalled thought was:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EGreat job, dingus, killed by a tent after a possibly extinction-level event. The Kraken\u2019ll be having a ripe old laugh at that once you get up to Kerballa\u2019s emerald gates.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis second, slightly more practical thought was:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERight. You\u2019ve\u00A0only got about three minutes of oxygen in here, but it\u2019s only covering your head. Grab the strap with your hand, and release the tent.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA good plan, if truth be told. There was one major flaw, however; he couldn\u2019t see his hands. With immense difficulty, he moved his now shrink wrapped head downward, eyes scanning the orange tinted fabric for a sign of his body. Wait! There! An ill-defined shadow! A hand, maybe? He told his brain to flex his fingers, and the shadow contracted and expanded. *Yes. Definitely a hand. Now, how do I use that hand to get me out? Where\u2019s the tab from here? Jeb\u2019s hand brushed up and down the fabric, probing any gap for a strap hidden in the folds. The air was definitely getting thinner now, Jeb realized, and his head began to feel fuzzy, the symptoms of early-onset oxygen deprivation. Desperately, he clutched at the fabric, scratching and flailing at every square inch.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDamn it to Bop! It\u2019s hopeless. Better make peace with-\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb\u2019s heart skipped a bit as his fingertips glided over a rectangular shape.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe..strap\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nJeb felt like he was thousands of meters under water. His vision was gone, his face was numb, and he was dimly aware of his own pained gasps. With all his might, he grabbed the strap\u2026 and yanked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn about half a second, the text expanded outwards, expelling Jeb from its confines. Jeb himself flew back and landed flat on his back for the second time that day. Wheezing with exhaustion, Jeb laid a hand across his chest, heaving, and struggled to his feet, whispering half-formed curses with his not quite recovered vocal chords. He gently pulled the tent\u2019s deflation flap, stuffed the resulting flat-packed rhombus unceremoniously into his bag, and hoisted himself over the treacherous rocky outcropping, shocked at the sight that met his eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\nShoreton was gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot a single nuclear crater, no buildings, not even a single body. It was as if civilization had been plucked from his immediate field of view, with only the great sentinel of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E watching on the horizon. It was an ineffable sight, to lose your home and everything you took for granted so inexplicably that no trace of it ever having existed was left behind. A normal kerbal probably would have cried their eyes out or have been reduced to gaping openly at the horizon for at least an hour. Jeb, being the pragmatist, shook himself from his reverie after a few seconds (okay, maybe minutes) of dumbstruck staring, and began the trip down to the base camp in the foothills 2,600m below, where he\u2019d parked his 4x4 three.. Days? How long had it been? He had been knocked out on the morning of the third day, and it has presumably been late afternoon when he had first awoken: who\u2019s to say he hadn\u2019t slept for two days? Or two *months?* Sighing under the weight of all his uncertainties, Jebediah Kerman, Jr. began the long trek down Mt. Marker, heading to the last familiar place left in Shoreton, and for all he knew the entire planet: his trek towards survival was also, unbeknown to him, a trek towards his destiny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-04T17:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight, so in the recent furore surrounding the KSP writing community, I returned here and noticed the \u0027old thread addendum\u0027.
