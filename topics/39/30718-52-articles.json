Daddy kept screaming. I tried to fight the tree for him but I was only little and couldn\u2019t do anything. Then daddy fell asleep for three days and when he woke up he wasn\u2019t the same any more. Mummy used to shout at him a lot, then she took me away to stay in her house with her Kerm. She used to talk to it a lot but she never screamed.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJoenie sniffled and wiped her nose on her sleeve, then blushed and turned her face away. Patbro pretended not to notice as she carried on talking. \u201CI think Daddy started getting better after my birthday. Maybe the butterflies helped. He was always talking to his Kerm - Mummy said he was part of the Kerm, helping it to look after the Grove but I didn\u2019t know what she meant. One day, daddy told me all about it, how he had arms and legs and branches and roots and leaves.\u201D Joenie giggled and she put her hand in front of her mouth. \u201CDaddy told me that the beetles tickled him.

All I get see is a big mess of everything in the soil all jumbled up together.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJoenie nodded. \u201CI haven\u2019t asked Elton to teach me about the soil animals,\u201D she confided. \u201CElton\u2019s nice but he\u2019s a bit scary too, like Grandpa.

He checked that Joenie had her seatbelt on before looking all around and pulling away. \u201CI think Elton does want to talk to you,\u201D he said. \u201CI think he\u2019d like that very much.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJoenie looked at him through narrowed eyes but Patbro\u2019s expression was quite serious. \u201CLeave it a little while though, Joenie. Elton\u2019s worried about your mum too and might not want to talk to you right now.\u201D He started the motor and pulled onto the road.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe truck stopped opposite Gerselle\u2019s hut and Patbro climbed out. The few small Kerm branches visible above the roofline swayed and rustled despite the lack of breeze and Patbro stared at them uneasily. Then the creak of passenger door opening and sudden patter of footsteps drove all other thoughts from his mind. \u201CJoenie - wait!\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJoenie stumbled, scraping her shin on a stone but scrambled to her feet and ran for her mother\u2019s hut, heedless of the blood trickling down her calf.

She pelted up the path, hurtled through the front door and pushed her way through the crowded kitchen, nearly tripping over Enely and leaving a trail of indignant kerbals behind her. One of them opened her mouth to speak before her elderly companion nudged her in the ribs. \u201CClose your mouth lass. That\u2019s Gerselle\u2019s young \u2018un.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMortified, the younger kerbal clapped her hand over her mouth. \u201COh Kerm - oh the poor girl.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EEnely sprang to his feet, eyes widening in alarm. The sleep room door banged open and Joenie charged through. \u201CDaddy!\u201D She skidded up to the bed and stopped short. \u201CMummy?\u201D She shook Gerselle\u2019s shoulder, careful not to disturb the leaves wrapped around her head. \u201CWake up, Mummy.

He saw Joenie shaking her mother\u2019s shoulder, saw Jonton getting to his feet; the villagers around him backing away as if in slow motion. Jonton\u2019s head turned towards him and Patbro stopped in dismay, quailing at the look in his friend\u2019s eyes.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CJonto\u2026\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CFetch Joenie.

ONE SIMPLE BJEDLA THING!\u201D Jonton\u2019s gaze scoured the room. \u201CAND YOU! NOT ONE OF YOU COULD STOP A LITTLE GIRL!

In the ringing silence following Jonton\u2019s outburst, she bolted for the spare bed, squirmed past its stunned occupants and slid under the nearest leaf cluster. Jonton saw the movement from the corner of his eye and spun round to follow it. \u201CJoenie! No!\u201D He threw himself after his daughter, Patbro following close behind and narrowly avoiding a low branch. Jonton\u2019s head scraped through a cluster of leaves, hairs brushing across his scalp and then recoiling from the roiling inferno of emotions raging beneath the surface.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EVines erupted from the ground hurling both kerbals back. Their writhing tips seemed to taste the air, unfurling into double rings of needle sharp teeth from which clusters of thinner, paler tendrils emerged like pulsating tongues, glistening with ichor.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EPatbro landed hard, gashing his forehead on the floor. He rolled over and sat up, blinking blood out of his eyes.\u00A0 The kerbals on the bed screamed in terror, freezing as the vines lashed at them. The other villagers stampeded for the door, barging past Enely and knocking him to one side. The leaves closed around Joenie\u2019s head and for a second, the thrashing vines froze. Seizing their chance, the kerbals scrambled off the bed and ran for their lives.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EConnecting to her mother\u0027s Kerm felt itchy compared to connecting to Elton but Joenie was in too much of a hurry to care. Ignoring the waves of agitation dashing against her, she called out with her thoughts as she\u0027d been taught. \u003Ci\u003EMummy!

Joenie tried again, making the words in her mind as big and as loud as she could. \u003Ci\u003EMummy - I\u0027ve come to find you!\u003C/i\u003E The agitation around her boiled over into fright.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;Gerselle!\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dangerdangerdanger\u0026gt; \u0026lt;make safe!\u0026gt;\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe vines whipped around and over Joenie\u2019s inert form, wrapping her in a protective cage. One of them found the scrape on her leg and began to probe it. Jonton staggered to his feet, grabbed the roaming vine and tried to pull it free, crying out as it twisted out of his grip and slashed at him, its cluster of dripping tendrils trailing lines of fire across his face. He staggered back, eyelids aflame.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe sound of her mother\u0027s voice all around her brought Joenie up short. \u003Ci\u003EMummy?\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u0026lt;I am not Mummy.

From the introspective look on Milden\u2019s face, he guessed that she wasn\u2019t faring any better. The knock on the hatch came as a welcome distraction.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie unbuckled her harness and pressed three fingers to the hatch window. She counted to twenty to give the divers time to get clear, then pulled the locking handle down and swung open the hatch.\u00A0 Fresh salt air blew into the capsule almost visibly dispersing the fug within. Peering over Barrie\u2019s shoulder, Wilford caught a glimpse of cloudless sky and a smear of green on the horizon. He undid his own harness and reached under his couch.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBarrie scrambled out of the capsule and into the waiting life raft. One of the divers poked his head above the hatch sill and stretched out a hand. Wilford handed him a heavily insulated tube with a loop of cord attached to one end. \u0022Hang on to this,\u0022 he said. \u0022The propellant lab will want to see it as quickly as possible and it\u0027s a long way back to Minmus if you drop it.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe diver\u2019s eyes widened behind his mask. He slipped his wrist through the loop and, clutching his\u00A0 end of the tube tightly, proffered the other end to Barrie. He watched her clip it to her belt before turning back to Wilford and helping him through the hatch.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EDunney eyed the scratched and worn coffee pot as it burbled away, a faint smell of burnt coffee residue lifting from the hotplate. Like its owner, the pot was showing signs of wear and, he thought, hard wear at that. Through the window, the main Alpha tracking dish revolved slowly against the sky. Dunney tucked his hands behind his back and watched it turn. \u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHe was interrupted by the sounds of hurried footsteps and the office door clicking shut behind him, followed by the thud of a large stack of files landing on a desk. The pot gave a last protracted gargle, like a kaya clearing its throat, and stopped. Dunney poured two cups, handing one of them to Lodan as he sat down by the fire.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CSo what\u2019s the verdict?\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELodan put his cup down. \u201CEnough ammonia to be worthwhile but mixed with water and Kerm only knows what else.

Interesting - very interesting indeed. Perhaps a big drill is what we need then, rather than a still.

I\u2019m told that my budget requests are \u2018up to their usual exemplary standards\u2019, with a strong overtone of \u2018but gathering dust on a desk.\u2019 The one time I did manage to get through to Obrick, I merely received a double earful of platitudes for my trouble.\u201D He drained his cup and stared at the ceiling. \u201CThe Duna shuttle programme is on hold, the LV-N programme will be on hold after the ammonia test fire series. Booster construction for Pioneer 7 continues on schedule, as does the first production run of Rockomax Type 6s reserved for Starseed. R7 development is on hold until further funding can be released. I could go on.\u201D Lodan rubbed his eyes. \u201CThe ecology and agronomy programmes are on a different budget, so at least the Berelgan is moving forward with those - and Erlin is managing to eke out a token life support development programme too, which is something.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CBut otherwise, we\u2019re grounded,\u201D said Dunney. He saw his own frustration mirrored in Lodan\u2019s eyes and bit back a more pointed comment.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CYes,\u201D said Lodan. \u201CI\u2019m flying out to the Capital next week and I fully intend to sit outside the necessary doors for as long as it takes to put a head-knocking meeting together.

The gunner swung his weapon round, spun the elevation handle and fired again. A second canister boomed across the waves, trailing a parachute behind it on a rapidly unspooling line. Both parachute and canister hit the water with a distant splash. The enemy vessel roared past and the gunner began counting under his breath. He reached fifteen and gave up in disgust as it raced into the distance unimpeded.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003EToo short or too weak to foul the prop.

You will stand down and prepared to be boarded.\u201D The fleeing vessel ignored her as she expected it would, the afternoon sun sparkling from its foaming wake. The pilot turned to her navigator, stooping over his chart table and binnacle. He scribbled two words onto a card and handed it over. She scanned the message, lips moving silently and keyed her microphone again, voice shifting subtly. \u201CCome \u003Ci\u003Eon\u003C/i\u003E, whoever you are.

Angling it catch the sun, he flashed a brief message over to the second dinghy.\u00A0 The sergeant slipped off her bench and checked the straps securing their gear. One of the nondescript canvas carryalls clanked as she cinched up a loose strap and the intermittent squeak of hawser against cleat from the bow, told her that the fourth member of her crew was already busy with the anchor. She emerged in time to catch the answering flashes and hear the distant coughing splutter of a diesel powered outboard motor starting up.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CAnchor raised ma\u2019am.\u201D\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe sergeant thumbed a button on her own outboard which started up with a purr. She glanced at the charge meter and, checking her compass, fed power to the motor and swung the small craft around, heading due east.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EFor the best part of half an hour they cruised the Southern Ocean at a leisurely, battery-conserving speed, the navigator busy with chart and chronometer, the other crew members keeping a sharp eye out for other boats. Then one of them saw it; a white v-shaped trail of foam, laid ruler straight across the waves. He gripped his crewmate by the shoulder and pointed. The sergeant\u2019s gaze followed his and she nodded in satisfaction. \u201CThat\u2019ll be them,\u201D she murmured. \u201CLooks like the net chuckers managed to spook \u2018em, even if they did sweet Blight all to stop them.\u201D She raised her voice slightly. \u201CRight you lot - rig for stealth and we\u2019ll follow them in.

She eased the throttle forward a notch and threw her tiller over, swinging the dinghy round in a looping turn that ended with them dead astern of the fleeing vessel and shadowing it at a discreet distance. She waited for their target to change course, ears straining for the sudden crack of deck guns. When it showed no sign of noticing them, she let out her breath in a tightly-controlled sigh of relief and glanced at her own chronometer. Then her ears pricked up at the distant sound of a diesel motor.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAbout bloody time.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe sound swelled to a muted, and then not so muted roar. The second dinghy barrelled in from the north, prow angled high, foam trailing from its exposed hull. Suddenly it heeled over, flanking their target and matching speed with it. \u201CATTENTION UNIDENTIFIED VESSEL. THIS IS THE VEIIDAN COASTAL PATROL.

The sergeant worked the tiller in short, precise movements, jaw set, eyes locked on the looming hull rolling and swaying bare metres away from her own craft. Her crew scanned the deck rail overhead, grapple poles at the ready, bracing themselves for contact. The dinghy skipped sideways and steadied. Three poles swung up, slapped wickedly curved hooks over the rail, and were discarded. Three armed kerbals grabbed their boarding lines, tugged them once and swarmed up the side of their target, rolling over the rail and coming up in a poised crouch, then running for cover, weapons at the ready. Shots rang out from the other side of the boat, rapid, staccato cracks audible over the noise of the decoy dinghy.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe boarding team darted aft, keeping low, leapfrogging from cover to temporary cover. A baton whipped out, dropping the lone sentry on their side of the boat and then they were through, charging up the steps to the bridge, kicking the door open and bursting in.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CDrop it!

Now stay down!\u201D The marine dashed forward, kicked the discarded handgun to one side and landed between his would-be assailant\u2019s shoulder blades, driving the breath out of the downed kerbal with a grunt, before snapping on a pair of wrist restraints. Behind him, he heard his teammates dealing with the other two. Doubled over to stay below the bridge windows, he sprinted over to the throttle levers and pulled them back to all-stop.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe dinghy slipped in behind the drifting boat, juddering as it bumped the larger vessel\u2019s stern. The sergeant thumbed off her outboard motor, swung her grapple pole up against the rail to secure her boarding line then pulled herself up the rope, hand over hand. The rattle of gunfire from further forward told her all she needed to know. Glancing all around for possible sight lines she flattened herself against the deckhouse wall and crabbed her way round to the inspection ladder, alert to the slightest movement around her. Scrambling up the ladder she belly-crawled round the foot of the radio mast and peered over the edge of the roof.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAs expected, the boarding team were pinned down by the bridge. Her first shot saw one enemy sailor staggering back, hand clamped over his shoulder, his gun skittering across the deck. Her second shot narrowly missed a second sailor as she ducked into cover but the sudden confusion was all the distraction her beleaguered boarding team needed. Another sailor fell to the deck and then another fell screaming in the sudden quiet. Three more grapples appeared over the deck rail, rapidly followed by the second boarding team.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EOne of the enemy crew spun on his heel and then froze.

Even to himself, the joke sounded flat. He rolled the end of his straw between finger and thumb, rocking the cup back and forth across the table. \u201CWill you be alright here, if Enely drives me over? What if\u2026\u201D He broke off at the sight of Meleny\u2019s patient expression. \u201CYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201D he murmured. \u201CYou, Joenie, Edbas and Katisa. Just fine.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if in reply, Meleny\u2019s midriff squirmed and a tuft of downy hair appeared over the seam of her poncho opening. Meleny dipped a finger into her pouch, smiling as it was promptly grabbed by a tiny hand and popped into a tiny toothless mouth. Presently, small, chirruping snores began drifting upwards. Despite himself, Jonton\u2019s answering smile turned into a grimace, fresh spots of blood appearing on the other side of his dressings.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMaybe I do need to get this looked at\u003C/em\u003E. \u201CI\u2019d better go and find Enely and Joenie,\u201D he said resignedly. \u201CAnd then think about packing a bag.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo - what seems to be the problem?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton resisted the urge to describe a wholly fictitious broken toe and settled for giving the medic a slightly incredulous look. \u201CI\u2019m not sure,\u201D he replied carefully. \u201CI think something may have bitten me but I\u2019ve never had this kind of reaction to a bite before.

Anyway, they just made me nauseous.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic glanced at the packet and made a note on his pad, a crease appearing on his brow. \u201CDid you get any other side effects.

Intimate rash?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head. \u201CNo, just the nausea.\u201D He tapped his swollen cheek. \u201CWhich wasn\u2019t a great deal of fun I can tell you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t,\u201D said the medic. He unpicked the knot of fabric at the base of Jonton\u2019s neck. \u201CNow, I\u2019m just going to take these bandages off and have a look underneath. Just tell me to stop if it gets too painful.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first layer of bandage unwound easily. Jonton gritted his teeth as the second layer peeled away, breaking open the scabs on his injured eyelid. Pus trickled over the corner of his mouth, nearly making him gag. The medic pulled away the final, bloody swathe of fabric, flinching at the sight of the rank and sodden dressings underneath. Eyes screwed up against the pain, Jonton didn\u2019t notice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, I\u2019m just going to tip you back a bit. With a hiss of compressed air, the chair back tilted flat. The medic fastened an absorbent drape around Jonton\u2019s neck. \u201CNormally this might sting a bit but I think these are about ready to fall off on their own.\u201D He slipped on a pair of gloves and gingerly peeled up the corner of one dressing. \u201CEasy does it - and there you go.\u201D He dropped the pad onto a tray with a faint thud and turned to the next one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E got you real good. I\u2019m going to take a couple of samples for the lab but right now, I think we\u2019ll let one of our Kerm take a look at you.\u201D The medic dabbed at Jonton\u2019s face with a damp surgical sponge and noticed the flicker cross his patient\u2019s face. \u201CSorry about that - nearly done. Okay, I\u2019m just going to tip you back up again.\u201D The chair hissed again, lifting Jonton into a sitting posture. \u201CIf you could just hold this here and \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E and follow me please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton followed him into an airy, pleasantly lit room. One corner was wholly occupied by a section of Kerm trunk, it\u2019s branches spreading across the ceiling. A wedge shaped sweetmoss pool surrounded by well-tended grass borders took up much of the floor space. The medic pointed towards a curtained off enclosure, its plastic drapes looking distinctly incongruous against all the greenery. \u201CPlease could I ask you to shower and change before getting into the pool. You\u2019ll find everything you need inside the cubicle.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral minutes later, a damp and faintly pine-scented Jonton emerged from the shower clad in a pair of loose fitting shorts. He slipped into the sweetmoss pool and stared up through the Kerm branches, feeling his pulse begin to pound.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u2019s a set of steps just under the water if you need to brace your feet against anything.\u201D The medic was lying on a slim futon bed, head resting under one of the larger Kerm leaf clusters. \u201CI\u2019ll be with you in a couple of minutes. Try and relax - the healing vines might tickle a little but they\u2019re nothing to be afraid of.\u201D He smiled. \u201CAlthough I\u2019m surely not telling the Sage of Barkton anything new there.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton swallowed hard. Images of swarms of needle sharp teeth slashing dripping white tendrils across his face raced through his mind,. His pulse throbbed painfully against his skull, fresh blood beginning to well up through the open wounds in his forehead. When the vines brushed against the side of his head it was all he could do not to scream. They crept over his swollen face, probing delicately at his injuries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA choking gust of cinnamon billowed from the ceiling. The vines whipped back, slicing through the water and dragging clumps of moss with them. Jonton barely had time to turn his head before dozens more vines erupted all around him, glistening tendrils exploding from their tips. Jonton\u2019s feet spasmed, mashing his toes into the pool steps. White fire shrieked up his legs and settled in his guts like a ball of hot, liquid lead. His vision blurred, became a darkness fringed tunnel, shadows from the thrashing vines more sensed than seen. There was a terrified cry from somewhere behind his head and then everything went black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe awoke to silence and a screaming pain in both feet. Shaking, he hauled himself out of the pool and collapsed face-down on the grass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat in the seven smoking \u003Cem\u003Ehells\u003C/em\u003E just happened?\u201D Jonton lifted his head and saw a very pale around the eyes medic staring back at him. \u201CNever known anything like it, never \u003Cem\u003Eheard \u003C/em\u003Eof anything like it before!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton rolled onto his back. A part of him heard hurried footsteps and a door slamming. A distant voice in the back of his mind shouted at him to get up before it was too late, to escape while he still could. Moving, though, seemed like an impossible task, let alone the brain-tangling complexities of getting dressed. He heard door hinges squeak and much more measured footsteps coming towards him. One kerbal or two? Did it matter anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton awoke and promptly screwed his eyes shut against a glaring white light. He tried to sit up only to find his limbs unable to move.

Unless you want a splitting headache on top of your other troubles.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton opened his eyes, squinting against the glare. A syringe filled with a pale, straw-coloured liquid floated just out of reach. \u201CKerm vines\u2026 attack\u2026let me go!\u201D He jerked his hands back and forth, struggling to break free. \u201DLet me go!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pair of hands clamped around his wrists. \u201CTake it easy now, sir.

So talk.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton rolled his head to one side, dislodging a padded bolster from under his neck. The medic sat opposite him, a grim look on his face. A large kerbal dressed in the white uniform of a hospital orderly, tucked the bolster back into place. \u201CNo need for that either, sir,\u201D he said. \u201CWe can get you off that gurney and into somewhere more comfortable once you\u2019re done talking.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton talked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHesitantly at first but gradually the familiarity of his story took over and he recovered some semblance of eloquence. The medic sat spellbound through his descriptions of Elton, a florid medley of emotions crossing his face as the story of Jonelle\u2019s awakening unfolded. He sat back in his chair and regarded Jonton at length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know whether to applaud you or have you locked up.\u201D The medic shook his head in bemusement. \u201CEither way, that\u2026 explains a lot. The attack by your partner\u2019s Kerm\u2026 sorry, \u003Cem\u003EJonelle\u003C/em\u003E must have marked you with something that sent mine into a real fighting panic. Which sort of makes sense if the first part of your story is right - any kerbal marked by one Kerm would likely be seen as a serious threat by other Kerm. Good thing you were in the pool - the moss probably slowed the vines down some.\u201D He shivered. \u201CBought me enough time to stop it killing you maybe.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA chill ran up Jonton\u2019s spine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe medic shivered again. \u201CIt\u2019s as well I\u2019m not a drinking kerb. If you ask me, a story like that is better remembered through the bottom of a bottle. A very strong bottle.\u201D He visibly pulled himself together. \u201CAnyhow, what to do with you, since setting a Kerm to heal a Kerm sting plainly isn\u2019t going to work.\u201D The medic\u2019s eyes lost their focus for a moment. \u201CWe do have some options there but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to keep you in under observation for the duration.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sat bolt upright, fists clenched. \u201CHow long?\u201D he asked harshly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll need a full diagnostic workup to start with - the samples I took won\u2019t be nearly enough.\u201D The medic\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t unsympathetic. \u201CAfter that - it\u2019s too early to tell I\u2019m afraid but at least a week, probably more. I know you\u2019re worried about leaving your daughter for so long but I think you\u2019ll just have to trust your friends to look after her.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe saw the appalled expression on Jonton\u2019s face and offered him a bleak look in return. \u201CYou\u2019re going to be our test subject my friend. I hope to the First Council that I\u2019m wrong but something tells me that you won\u2019t be the only Kerm-stung kerbal I have to treat before all this is done.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a remote valley, tucked away beneath the Trencher mountains of Southern Veiid, a kerbal watched two figures approaching across the scrubland. The distant streak of greenery around the narrow watercourse winding down from the foothills contrasted vividly with the sparser ground cover beyond and then the ochres and russets of the Hook escarpment curving around the horizon. A thin, keening wind stirred up the dust, piling it against boulders and boots alike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figures drew closer, close enough to be recognised and moving more cautiously now, disappearing behind a tussock of coarse grass here, a rocky outcrop there. The watching kerbal unfolded a cloth and draped it over the the lip of the cave entrance, it\u2019s white on black bisected circle logo standing plain against the orangey stone. She saw one of the figures pointing, then they both veered towards her, no longer bothering with the sparse cover. The soft crunch of leather on gravel announced their presence as they rounded the final bend of the trail and ducked into the cave beside her. She rolled up the cloth and tucked it away in her pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou took your sweet time getting back. Boss is starting to get restless.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019s going to get even more restless when he hears that we\u2019re boxed in.\u201D The scout upended his water bottle, swishing the meagre mouthful of water around his mouth before swallowing. \u201CNew Groves planted right up to the foothills and beyond. Overlapping too, near as we could tell on foot - not that there\u2019s much around here for the Blight to ruin.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPlanted in a tearing hurry by the looks of it,\u201D his companion added. \u201CNo kermol at all over yonder,\u201D he pointed at the Hook, \u201Cand precious few at the next nearest Groves neither. We did see one patrol though, heading north. Kerm knows what the poor beggars did to draw duty at the armpit end of Veiid.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan we get through the mountains?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot with the supplies we\u2019ll have left by the time we catch up with the boss. The nearest pass is about half a day away but the way in is blocked by another Grove. Couldn\u2019t find anything else within striking distance.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe watcher shaded her eyes and squinted at the distant Hook. \u201CBut yonder Grove lies unguarded?\u201D The scout nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen its fate is sealed.\u201D She picked up her pack and slipped noiselessly out of the cave. The two scouts looked at each other wordlessly, then followed her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbol was low in the sky by the time the three scouts reached a fringe of stunted trees clinging to the mountainside. Two other members of their party stepped out from the shade and watched them approach. One of them opened her mouth to speak before catching sight of the almost identical expressions on their faces. She slung her weapon over her back with suddenly trembling hands and quietly fell in behind the scouts as they marched past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe setting sun turned the campsite into a maze of knife edged shadows. The row of tents arrayed at the edge of the clearing lurked under the trees, doors yawning open to reveal ill-defined shapes inside. The loose semi-circle of stones in front of the tents resembled a set of giant\u2019s teeth, crooked and worn from overuse. A white box, its lid marked with the bisected circle emblem of the Children of Kerbin rested beside one of them,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the scouting party emerged from the trees, the kerbals sitting atop the stones stopped talking and looked up from their seats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell?\u201D One of the kerbals got to his feet. \u201CYou\u2019re late. Explain.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first scout gave a succinct summary of their expedition.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo way through? Not even across the mountains? No.\u201D Their leader smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. \u201CI believe the cowards leave us little choice then.\u201D Two of the other Children leaned forward expectantly, an unhealthy sheen in their eyes and spots of dark green flaring on their cheeks. Their leader reached under his poncho and withdrew a small Kerm wood disc on a simple chain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have made the pilgrimage,\u201D he said softly. \u201CI have travelled to Kolus and consulted the Sage. I have seen our history - and it is on our side. On the side of all \u003Cem\u003Etrue\u003C/em\u003E heirs to the kerm..olia.\u201D He licked his lips, voice caressing the final syllable. \u201CWe are \u003Cem\u003Ewarriors\u003C/em\u003E for our Kerm my brothers and sisters. Its roots will be more cunning and\u2026\u201D He bared his teeth, any pretence at a smile vanishing. \u201CIts kerbals will be the stronger.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA feverish buzz of anticipation greeted his pronouncement. The scout bowed his head in acceptance, then looked up, emotions locked away behind walled up eyes. \u201CWhen?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe travel in the cool of the night. We plant our Kerm at dawn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbol rose over the Hook, bathing the empty village in gold. A Kerm sapling stood alone in the centre of the village square, leaf clusters unfurling to greet the new day. The scout stared at it, the mask-like expression on his face slipping for an instant, revealing the roiling stew of emotions beneath. He gripped his spade, taking what reassurance he could from the smooth timber of its handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other Children clustered around him, their leader standing alone before them, white box by his feet. He bent down, lifted out a large yellow and brown mottled gourd, and held it aloft. A whiff of cinnamon graced the morning air, pungent even at a distance and the scout\u2019s nostrils twitched. His leader placed the gourd back in its cooler, picked up his own spade and slung it across his shoulder. \u201CToday we are kermolia. Today we fight for our Kerm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Children fanned out across the deserted village square, surrounding the sapling in a precise circle. Their leader lifted his spade over his head in a two-handed grip, before stabbing it into the ground, levering out a clod of dense gritty soil that crumbled as it fell. Emboldened, the other Children followed his lead, spades rising and falling in unison, the scrape of steel against hardscrabble loud against the desert quiet. The scout dragged his blade through the grit, eyes fixed on his feet. \u003Cem\u003EIts just another tree, Chop the roots, pull the stump and we\u2019re done.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBut it isn\u2019t just a tree\u003C/em\u003E, whispered another voice in the back of his head. \u003Cem\u003EAnd\u003C/em\u003E warriors - \u003Cem\u003Ehah. You know enough Old Kerba to put the lie to that. Kermolia weren\u2019t warriors - they were \u003C/em\u003Eprotectors. He dropped his spade, lifted his head and stared at the sapling, mask falling away from his face. Behind him, a ring of uplifted blades gleamed in the dawn sun\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blades came down. Chopping through the hardscrabble, shearing through roots and fibres, the blades came down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the vines rose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreaming, the scout turned to run but a wiry \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E whipped around his ankle, pulling his foot out from under him. He rolled upright, spitting gravel as he tried to scramble to his feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the vines came \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E and everything went black.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Veiidan patrol returned the next day. They wondered at the criss-crossing of animal tracks leading towards the village. Then they rounded the corner, looked out across the village square and wondered no more. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pack of desert dogs fled yelping, leaving their half-finished meal behind. An insistent warbling drone filled the air, dense clouds of insects crawling over oozing fibres and splintered Kerm roots and swarming over the hideously swollen figures sprawled in the dirt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree members of the patrol turned away retching. Their leader stared in stunned disbelief, the blood draining from his face. He walked forward, outstretched fingers reaching for a toppled branch and its clusters of glossy green leaves. A stray fly buzzed into his open mouth and he spat it out, oblivious to the sounds of vomiting behind him. Then he saw - truly saw - the bodies beneath the leaning trunk and the thin, corded vines speared through the writhing black carpets that covered them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis gorge rose, disbelief turning to fear laced with sick despair. Stiff-legged, he turned away from the devastation and marched over to the nearby radio hut, the message that would shatter his world already churning through his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt;

A wave of Groves spread across the land, driven by the more or less peaceful expansion of Kerm, kerman and kermol populations. The last great Seeding of the Age nearly led to\u00A0a Second Age of Madness\u00A0due to a shortage\u00A0of land\u00A0for planting new\u00A0Groves but fortunately for the kerbals there was new land a plenty across the seas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDriven by\u00A0 dire need, the Age of Sail began with an explosion of technical and scientific progress in seafaring, navigation, astronomy and any number of related disciplines. However the resultant land grab race by the proto-nations of Kerbin, nearly ended in open warfare. It took the founding of the\u00A0Council of Twelve Pillars (led by\u00A0a visionary leader named Jebediah Kerman) and the signing of the Bill of Land to stave off disaster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Age of Sail segued into the Second Age of Prosperity - which once again seemed set to end in Kerm overpopulation and another Age of Madness. Once again dire need drove an outpouring of scientific and technical progress and the so-called\u00A0Age of Fire began with another great leap for kerbal society - the development of spaceflight and the\u00A0founding of the Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly time will tell whether this Age will be a\u00A0second Age of Sail across the new oceans of space - or a descent into the Second Age of Madness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-04T11:45:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2017 11:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AviosAdku","CreatedById":165040,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-04T23:55:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks for\u00A0clearing up the timeline, I haven\u0027t had time to re-read the relevant chapters so that really helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting these cycles that the Kerm/Kerbal symbiotes have gone and continue to go\u00A0through, different but the same pattern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Time moves\u00A0on but history repeats itself\u0022 - James Gurney (I think),\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDinotopia\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAviosAdku\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T01:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223164637\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002230718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504525247\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly time will tell whether this Age will be a\u00A0second Age of Sail across the new oceans of space - or a descent into the Second Age of Madness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s almost as if Time is cyclical... like a wheel or something, or maybe...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKaka.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:ph34r:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ph34r.png\u0022 title=\u0022:ph34r:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T06:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeh, indeed.

Curiously, Cal\u00A0glanced down through the remains of his cockpit floor, watching the ground hurtling up to meet him. Another shell tore open a wing, shredding cables and other mechanisms beneath. The control stick went slack in his hand as the Cloudrunner teetered on the brink of control before tumbling into a spin.

Defending those murderous bjedla \u003Cem\u003Etrees\u003C/em\u003E?\u201D He spat. \u201CThat to your lawful superior officers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe platoon sergeant raised his sidearm. \u201CI\u2019m sorry about this, son.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single flat crack echoed across the hilltop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHere you go, boys. Three 905s, a half of T30 and a pint of LV-1 for the driver. Can I get you anything else now?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s all thanks, Jorfurt.\u201D The speaker took a long pull of his 905 and wiped the foam from his lips. Once the landlord was safely out of earshot, he turned back to his companions. \u201CSo who\u2019s with me? Head to the hills and find a bit of land we can call our own? Keep ourselves away from the fighting with no Kerm to threaten us neither.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m in. Never figured on becoming a farmer until I went back to the old Grove.\u201D The voice shuddered. \u201CBut I never figured on needing to escape from killer Kerm either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019ll need to show me which end of the spade goes in the dirt, but I\u2019m in. Should be a tidy profit in it too, selling Kerm free food. Specially now that import restrictions have gotten so Blighted tight with all the seed checks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eldest kerbal straightened her poncho collar and looked up at her companions. \u201CGuess you\u2019ll need somebody to tell you what to plant and to go inside when it starts raining. I\u2019m in.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last kerbal took a sip of his LV-1. \u201CI suppose so,\u201D he said. \u201CWorld\u2019s moving on and not for the better. I remember when you\u2019d come in here of an evening and find half the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E at the bar, talking about spaceships and Mun rockets and all that.\u201D He gestured around the room at the quiet knots of drinkers sitting by themselves. \u201CNot any more.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNope. Young Jeb got himself to the Mun, we got a lot of fine words from the government and not much else.\u201D The eldest kerbal tapped her glass of T30 stout on the drum-like table in front of them. \u201CI remember when Jeb brought these in for Jorfurt\u2019s birthday present. Made of genuine recycled rocket parts he said. Wonder what happened to to him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3163943\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 81\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3186648\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 83\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T14:55:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T19:48:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow..
