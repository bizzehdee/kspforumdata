He was the Head Engineer of the KFPS \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E, an interstellar patrol ship, yet it seemed the blasted ship would not run straight for a day without something breaking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nToday, it was the warp engine array. While the array could limp through hyperspace with only two warp engines functioning, which it was, the nadir engine finally failed. It was a messy sight, what with hundreds of untrained cadets violently releasing undigested food into paper bags as the ship lurched to a stop, in layer\u00A08 space no less.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYet the penny-pinchers that were the ship\u2019s flag officers refused to replace it. \u201CIf you can fix it,\u201D they would say, \u201Cwhy should we replace it?\u201D Every engineer knew for a \u003Ci\u003Efact\u003C/i\u003E that warp engine replacements cost only approximately a kilogram of Li-standard currency, less than a \u003Ci\u003Emonth\u003C/i\u003E\u2019s pay of an Admiral. The problem was, these selfish pieces of scum didn\u2019t want to pay that tiny sum.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalby donned an Extra-Vehicular Activity suit, since the warp engines were out in the frigid vacuum of space. He grabbed his multitool, and proceeded to the airlock. He wrenched the airlock door open, sealed it tight behind himself, and hit the depressurization button.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe airlock hissed, pulling the air into holding tanks for pressurization later, and then a robotic voice said, \u201CPressure stable.\u201D Calby opened the airlock outer door, grabbed the reel of tether above the airlock door, attached it to his suit, and closed the outer door.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTraversing the hull, he walked on it with his magnetic boots until he reached the aft section of the ship. Calby checked his HUD: he would have six hours of time before he needed to re-enter the ship. Plenty for a warp engine repair.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalby neared the aft section of the ship, the four warp engines growing larger. The port and starboard engines had already been put out of commission a while ago, and only the the zenith engine remained. As it was, however, one asymmetrically mounted warp engine was insufficient to plow the ship through increasingly dense spatial fluid, much less keep the ship straight and true. He greeted the other engineers that were assigned to perform maintenance on the warp array. In fact, it seemed that all the engineers aboard the ship were here. Not a surprise, since the warp array was absolutely critical.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSo, the ruddy engine\u2019s broken, eh?\u201D Asked a fellow engineer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI suppose so,\u201D Calby replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBlast \u2018em flag officers,\u201D the engineer continued. \u201CWho knows if we\u2019ll die out here just because of their penny pinching ways?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s certainly a possibility. Look, let\u2019s just fix this damned engine so we can continue on to Kreeni,\u201D Calby replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, yer right,\u201D the engineer said, and got back to his unscheduled maintenance of the warp array. Being a Head Engineer, only Calby was tasked to repair the warp engine, so he floated to the nadir engine. The engine, with its graceful curves, was mounted on a girder, with spat-flo intakes sticking out.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe diagnosis was simple; a spat-flo intake had clogged up. Calby was a tad bit ticked off because the onboard AI had dropped the entire ship out of warp because of a clogged intake, which was not at all critical, as there were four intakes for every engine. He made a mental note to perform percussive maintenance on the quantum AI unit later.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis done, he made his way back to the airlock, checked that it was depressurized, and opened the outer door. Removing the tether from his suit, he closed the outer door behind him and pressed the pressurization button. While the airlock hissed, venting air into the chamber, Calby checked the time. He had only used an hour of suit supplies. \u003Ci\u003ENot too bad\u003C/i\u003E, he thought to himself, as he removed his helmet, and tossed his suit into the laundry basket. He reported the completion of the repairs to his commanding officer, and was about the head down to the officer\u2019s club, perhaps to socialize and get a shot or two of hydrazine, when the alarm blared overhead. The PA systems of the ship roared to life.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCrewmen of the \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E, we have received an emergency report from the KFPS \u003Ci\u003EHaven\u003C/i\u003E. An unidentified asteroid hauler ship, name AMS \u003Ci\u003ETuber\u003C/i\u003E, registration number AMS-1659, class \u003Ci\u003EHorizon\u003C/i\u003E-class or alike, is proceeding towards an unknown destination at oh point seven five cee in layer sixteen space, possibly carrying a stolen asteroid from Sol V. All ships in\u00A0this section\u00A0were required to immediately pursue this ship. All stations to DEFCON Three; repeat, all stations to DEFCON Three. All crew members currently on EVA must proceed to nearest airlock and re-enter ship, and all Federation Army soldiers must immediately mobilize and proceed to gun stations.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalby looked up and saw Federation Army soldiers marching to the gun stations, most of them just lieutenants, the single golden bar on their shoulders betraying the truth that they had absolutely no battle experience. The relatively more senior soldiers, this time bearing one or two silver bars, came round, manning the more powerful guns \u2013 the guns with more destroying power anyone could imagine.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe PA system blared again: \u201CCrewmen of the \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E, all crew members are confirmed aboard and all gun stations are manned. Stand by for layer sixteen entry.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalby grimaced. Anything but this. He hated the feel of translation; while he did not suffer from warp sickness, translation felt like a \u003Cem\u003Echore\u003C/em\u003E to endure.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe\u00A0translation drive spun up, and knocked the ship into layer 16. Then, the two warp engines engaged, and plowed the ship through the dense spat-flo. Calby\u2019s heart rate rose, his vision blurred, and his stomach threatened to release his lunch. The sickness bags, available in every section of the ship, beckoned to him, begging to be used. Calby gritted his teeth, taking deep breaths, attempting to restrain his increasingly volatile stomach. \u003Ci\u003EC\u2019mon, Calby, you can do this\u2026\u003C/i\u003E With his last ounce of strength, he clutched his stomach\u2026\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd practically \u003Ci\u003Eteleported\u003C/i\u003E over to the box of sickness bags, tore one open, then heaved his guts out, heaved yesterday\u2019s breakfast out, then heaved a bit more, for good measure. Calby was stooped over, dumbfounded, concentrated bile still dripping out of his mouth, still holding the now-ridiculously-inflated sickness bag. Then, he fell flat on his face and released the bag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThankfully, the bag had an auto-sealing mechanism for this exact purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-26T01:54:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2016 01:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TotallyNotHuman_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T18:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhh...Percussive maintenance.

By the looks of the building, Bobdin had arrived at the Laythe Commercial Spaceport. He proceeded to the entrance of the Spaceport, and entered the airlock. Immediately, he made his way to the ticket vending machine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPlease provide name of destination,\u201D the vending machine squawked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSLS Superluminal,\u201D Bobdin said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSearching,\u201D the vending machine chirped. \u201CSLS Superluminal, Orion-class spaceliner, currently berthed at Laythe Station Epsilon.

He checked his watch; it was 2:35 pm. He could go get a cup of coffee, maybe two, before he boarded the spaceplane.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile Bobdin was enjoying his drink, the PA hummed to life. \u201CPassengers of the Excelsior, bound for Laythe Station Epsilon, boarding has commenced at Gate 39. Please get your ticket and proceed to gate.\u201D Bobdin quickly downed his coffee, checked that his ticket was still there, and proceeded to Gate 39. Once there, the machine verified his ticket\u2019s integrity and gave Bobdin a suit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe equatorial winds nipped at Bobdin. While the equatorial regions were the hottest on all of Laythe, its significant distance to Kerbol and its tidally locked orbit around Jool still made Laythe a comparatively cold place. But this was momentarily forgotten as Bobdin glanced up at the Excelsior, a passenger spaceplane meant to haul passengers to Low Laythe Orbit and back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBobdin made his way to the forward crew module, opened the hatch, and crawled in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPassengers of the Excelsior, this is the captain speaking.

Please ensure that seat-belts are fastened and tray tables are in the upright position. Thank you for choosing the Excelsior for your extra-atmospheric explorations. Cabin crew, prepare for ascent.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBobdin checked that he was strapped into his seat, that his pocket communicator was switched off, and that his tray table was in the upright position. Suddenly, the jet engines flared to life, the low whine becoming gradually higher and higher pitched as the turbines received more air and exponentially gained speed. The Excelsior cleared the runway in just a few seconds, and was on its way to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ascent was rather boring, but Bobdin kept himself entertained by looking out the window as the Laythian oceans sped past him at Mach 2. Soon, the plane was going so fast that the flames from atmospheric compression blanketed the windows, rendering Bobdin blind to the landscape speeding below him.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSoon, however, the flames died out, and the spaceport had receded into the terminator, unable to be seen from this distance.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPassengers of the Excelsior, we have arrived in Laythe orbit and are on an intercept course. Soon, we shall match speeds with Laythe Station Epsilon and dock with it. Cabin crew, prepare for orbital rendezvous.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that they were in space, the less efficient jet-rocket combination engines were no longer needed. Instead, the jet-rockets shut down, and then small but efficient orbital maneuvering engines powered up and prepared for the speed-matching maneuver.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Excelsior coasted for about fifteen minutes, and then Laythe Station Epsilon grew large in Bobdin\u2019s viewport. On its own, the station was not very large, but such was not the case with an Orion-class spaceliner docked to it. Suddenly, the small engines whirred to life, the minuscule acceleration not imparting any effect on the passengers, but sufficient to nullify the Excelsior\u2019s relative speed with the station within a reasonable timeframe.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSoon, even smaller omnidirectional thrusters engaged, and the docking covers opened to reveal Excelsior\u2019s dorsal docking port. The spaceplane drifted to the ventral docking arm of the station, and its port latched onto the station\u2019s port. Magnetic clamps secured the linkage, and automated pumps equalized the pressure between the two ships. Clanks reverberated throughout the ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPassengers of the Excelsior, docking has completed. Please make your way to the docking module and enter the station.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nBobdin floated up the docking module, towards the starboard docking port, where the SLS Superluminal was berthed.

Is this branch getting a new ship?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Admiral continued, \u201CWell, the Kerbol V orbital shipyard is currently berthing an \u003Ci\u003EEpsilon\u003C/i\u003E-class cruiser that had been sent by the interplanetary branch \u2013 that\u2019s us by the way \u2013 of the Federation Patrol Force. So, technically, I can name you captain of this ship and assign you twenty commissioned officers and thirty enlisted.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon was taken aback by this act of kindness. The admiral was not known to be a very kind kerbal. \u201CThank you very much, sir. When shall we arrive at the orbital shipyard?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Admiral replied, \u201CWe are currently bound for Kerbol V.

Calby was not known to be prone to warp sickness, so his commanding officer insisted that he go pay a visit to sickbay. This he complied not-so-happily, since his last medical check-up had been but two days ago, and he wanted to \u003Ci\u003Emaintain \u003C/i\u003Ethe quantum AI with his multitool, but orders were orders.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt had been three hours since the KFPS \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E had entered hyperspace. They were now chasing after the AMS Tuber at maximum speed, along with the KFPS \u003Ci\u003EBounty\u003C/i\u003E and the KFPS \u003Ci\u003ENova\u003C/i\u003E. Suddenly, Calby felt a jolt. This he would normally ignore, since hyperspace had bubbles that lacked spat-flo and would cause turbulence, much like bubbles in the atmosphere that would cause planes to tumble lightly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut this was different. An engineer at heart, Calby knew when a ship was functioning normally and when it was not. This jolt did not feel like the ship had hit a turbulence bubble. No, this jolt felt like a malfunction in the artificial gravity plates or compensator\u2026 \u003Ci\u003Eoh no.\u003C/i\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was an explosion, and Calby was thrown out of his bed by some phantom force, which really was the sudden lack of artificial gravity. Due to the sudden jolt from the artificial gravity not being there anymore, Calby banged his head on the sickbay walls, and then fainted. As his consciousness faded out, he prayed fervently that the ship\u2019s doctor did not capture this moment on the sickbay surveillance camera.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFifteen minutes later, Calby came to. His commanding officer requested him to inspect the artificial gravity systems of the ship. Calby floated down the corridor, to the engineering deck, and then his heart sank.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COh no,\u201D Calby breathed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe artificial gravity compensator had failed, sparks flying everywhere. There was no backup, but it was absolutely crucial. Having been an integral part of space travel since the 2230s, the Kerbals were not extremely to the long-term effects of microgravity. Thus, they would have to abort the chase and limp to another Starbase to get that repaired.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis done, he reported the situation to his commanding officer. Suddenly, the PA system came to life again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCrewmen of the \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E, we have encountered a problem. The artificial gravity compensator has failed, and we must abort the chase The nearest such starbase is Starbase IV, on the planet Uctin I, also known as New Alexandria. It will be two days of travel at point two fiver cee in layer eight to Starbase IV. Please prepare for translation.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalby groaned.

Most of the time, Bobdin entertained himself by paying visits to the spaceliner\u2019s cupola module, and drinking hydrazine with his fellow passengers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut something was wrong. When the spaceliner approached Dres, it was stopped by some sort of border patrol. The captain immediately stopped.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFirst Lieutenant Johngee Kerman of the Dres Border Patrol.

But on that day, he had been instructed to proceed at maximum speed to Kerbol V, also known as Dres, to watch for asteroid smugglers.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAt 1200 hours the same day, Lieutenant Desdon intercepted an encrypted message on the subspace ansible channel that indicated a possible asteroid theft. He immediately pursued the ship, which was named the AMS \u003Ci\u003ETuber\u003C/i\u003E, registration number AMS-1659, class \u003Ci\u003EHorizon\u003C/i\u003E-class or alike, but failed as the ship immediately increased its speed to oh-point-seven-fiver\u00A0c in layer sixteen, a cardinal offense.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAny words, Mr. Bobdin? Please remember that everything you say will be recorded,\u201D the admiral asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI would like to say that the Andromeda Asteroid Mining Company would neither engage in such illicit activities, nor escape when confronted by the Federation Patrol. The Company also owns no such ship with this name or registration number, and it also has a valid asteroid hauling license. So why have I been detained by the Patrol?\u201D Bobdin was clearly confused.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFirst of all, Mr. Bobdin, you have not been detained by the Patrol. Second of all, we have been through your criminal records. Computer, read out the criminal records of Bobdin Kerman.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CBobdin Kerman, criminal records,\u201D the computer jittered. \u201CMay 12th, 2275: three counts of asteroid smuggling from Kerbol III, also known as Kerbin, arrested but released due to insufficient evidence.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nLieutenant Commander Desdon peered at Bobdin, who was evidently frowning.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow, we\u2019ve got sufficient evidence that you stole those \u2018roids from Kerbin, and thanks to you not deciding to turn yourself in, the sentence shall be extended to twenty years on the Kerbol II Rehabilitation Facility\u00A0without parole,\u201D the admiral was saying.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAnd what is my other choice, if I may ask?\u201D Bobdin asked, shuddering. Kerbol II, or Eve, as it was known,\u00A0was reserved for the worst of the worst; interplanetary war criminals, illegal warp drive retrofitters, and most importantly, asteroid smugglers. The Federation viewed asteroids as protected natural resources, very much like the early governments of Kerbin, who viewed certain species as protected. Bobdin could hardly fathom surviving twenty years on the hellish surface of Eve.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYour other choice is to aid us in chasing after those asteroid smugglers. If you choose to help us, we may be able to grant you amnesty,\u201D the admiral said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m in. What must I do to help you?\u201D Bobdin asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHere\u2019s our plan. We currently have two of our patrol ships chasing after the rogue ship. Once we pinpoint its exact position, we just need to go there and destroy them,\u201D the admiral explained.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat sounds fair to me. But what do you need me for?\u201D Bobdin was still confused.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe know you have former ties with this asteroid smuggling group. If you can get their exact position in the galaxy, we won\u2019t have to chase after the rogue ship,\u201D the admiral said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well.

We happened to have a ship at the Uctin VIII shipyard, and I made Admiral Donfrey commanding officer of that ship,\u201D Calzon explained.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI understand. See to it that it is entered into the registry, Commander. But concentrate on the preparations now,\u201D Desdon said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Captain. Calzon out.\u201D Calzon concluded.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon said to the communications officer, \u201CTell the admiral that I intend to move the entire Vengeance fleet to V\u2019Onak and destroy the Reticulians there.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, sir,\u201D said the communications officer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon grinned.

He made a mental note to change into more suitable robes, perhaps once the shuttle landed. He couldn\u2019t believe that he really had just been granted amnesty; on the other hand, he was glad not to be confined to cramped quarters aboard an otherwise spacious ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe shuttle\u2019s engines powered up, a low rumbling as it slowed the ship down against Dres\u2019 gravitational pull. The deceleration burn was timed perfectly, and the shuttle set its metallic foot on\u00A0the shuttle landing pad, the engines kicking up dust from below.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs soon as the shuttle stopped all movement, a landing pad worker signaled to his coworkers to prepare the ship for unloading. Pad workers milled about, cleaning dust off of the landing pad, attaching refueling hoses to the \u003Ci\u003EFrontier\u003C/i\u003E, and attaching the crew transfer tube to the shuttle\u2019s airlock. They secured the linkage, pressurized the tube, and gave the a-OK for unloading.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CPassengers of the \u003Ci\u003EFrontier\u003C/i\u003E, we have landed on Dres. Please make your way through the crew transfer tube and into the spaceport. Thank you for choosing the \u003Ci\u003EFrontier\u003C/i\u003E for your non-atmospheric adventures,\u201D the captain said.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBobdin walked through the crew transfer tube, and arrived in the bustling Dres Commercial Spaceport. While smaller compared to its Laythe counterpart, and certainly less busier than that spaceport, the number of Kerbals milling around were certainly formidable for a spaceport of this size. Bobdin began to wonder if they were just tourists or if they actually resided on Dres; after all, he was a long-term resident of Dres and had a full time job there. But times change, and he was away on the SLS \u003Ci\u003ESuperluminal\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0and in the brig for almost eight months, so Dres certainly could have become a more popular tourist destination.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBobdin had eyes for only one place; the Spaceport Clothes Shop. He practically teleported there and purchased a nice t-shirt and trousers. Ungentlemanly, yes, but anything was better than that red-and-white criminal uniform. He then made his way to the bathroom where he changed out of those damned robes and into his new outfit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis done, he made his way to the exit airlock, grabbed a suit, and exited the airlock. Bobdin immediately hailed a taxi back to his apartment. A large quadruped taxi of sorts stepped forward and proclaimed loudly which company the taxi was from and what the fare would be.. Then, the taxi asked Bobdin for his destination. Bobdin was headed for Habitation Module #0932, and he said as much. The taxi\u2019s doors swung open, and Bobdin climbed in.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn ten minutes, the taxi had arrived at Bobdin\u2019s apartment.\u00A0The taxi, after being paid the required fare, ejected Bobdin from the capsule and into the Dressian regolith. Dusting himself off, Bobdin climbed up to the fifth floor of the module, and entered the airlock. Once he had passed through the airlock, he threw off his spacesuit, changed into his nightclothes, and immediately slept a long and serene sleep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TotallyNotHuman","CreatedById":157240,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T11:54:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope nobody minds that this chapter has been posted an hour and a half\u00A0late.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last few days were a blur to Calby. In just a few days\u2019 time, the Federation had lost an entire star system, colony, and patrol cruiser to the Reticulians.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe unnamed scouting probe had arrived at V\u2019Onak the day prior. Immediately, it entered an extremely low orbit, barely skimming the planet\u2019s atmosphere, and started recording and beaming back crucial video information before it was disabled by the Reticulians. It also activated onboard scanners to scan for resources on the planet. It beamed back two orbits\u2019 worth of video data along with scanner data before it was shot down with an unknown weapon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnalysis of the low-altitude reconnaissance film showed that the Reticulians possessed railgun technology; while not a large advantage, it put them approximately on-par with Federation technology. They had gas lasers, as far as laser tech went, which was 22\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E century technology. The stolen asteroid, now depleted of its Uraninite, now orbited V\u2019Onak, its only satellite. They also had multiple uranium storage facilities, many uranium refinement facilities, and hundreds of nuclear warhead production lines. Scanner data indicated that the planet was bone dry, the likes of which the scientists could not explain, which probably explained the need to pillage other asteroids and planets, and that the stolen asteroid had been completely excavated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut this did not matter right now. What mattered was that the personnel of Starbase IV and the crew of the KFPS \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E survived, and was well furnished on Starbase III. The Starbase Commander, Aldmund Kerman, was extremely hospitable and was overjoyed to receive his new subjects. The surge of population from Starbase IV made Starbase III the largest starbase of the Kerbol Federation. Admiral Donfrey had been more than ecstatic to meet the \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E-A, his new ship, and he was so happy that as soon as they arrived at the Kreeni system and offloaded all personnel onboard, he took the ship on several intra-system joyrides, even one into the famed Kreeni Asteroid Belt. Against regulations, yes, but who could blame him? He had just lost his ship, a ship that had served him well, albeit with several hiccups, and he was simply reliving the feeling of commanding a patrol cruiser.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince Commander Calzon did not have a Starbase to command, he was named second-in-command of Starbase III, and he would become Acting Commander if the current Commander, Aldmund, needed to leave the Starbase on official duty or was otherwise unable to command the Starbase.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSuddenly, an alarm went off in Kreeni Station. Calby knew what to expect; a PA announcement.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight on cue, the PA system came online.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll personnel in Kreeni Station, be advised: the Kerbol Federation has declared war on the Reticulian Faction. All Federation settlement members are required to board a cruiser and travel to 9464 Reticuli. All Federation Army soldiers must immediately report to gun stations aboard ships; non-enlisted officers and engineers may also man a gun station if possible.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nCalby rushed to the nearest gun station on the KFPS \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E-A, which was guarded by a frail-looking soldier.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COut of the way, private,\u201D Calby grunted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWho are you, sir? Gun stations are reserved for FA soldiers, NEOs, and engineers only,\u201D the soldier shot back.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI am Calby Kerman, Head Engineer of the KFPS \u003Ci\u003ECastor\u003C/i\u003E-A. Now get out of the way before I make mincemeat out of you,\u201D Calby growled.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe soldier immediately wilted, and ran off in another direction as fast as his legs could carry him. Calby engaged the lasers and the railguns immediately, as the ship undocked from Kreeni Station and sped off into hyperspace.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRight,\u201D Calby grinned devilishly, \u201Clet\u2019s see what you Reticulian scum have to offer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTommorow\u0027s post will conclude this story.

He was fully aware that this might be his last egress, this encounter with the Reticulians\u2019 dictator.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe retrieved his \u003Ci\u003EHaven\u003C/i\u003E EVA suit, an old friend, and suited up. He placed his railgun pistol into his shoulder holster, and procured a picture of Trixie Kerman, his love, as a memento.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe placed the picture into his utility pouch, and said his farewells. But he said a very special farewell to one kerbal in particular.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEnsign\u2026\u201D Desdon started, not remembering the officer\u2019s name.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CName\u2019s Camfrey, cap,\u201D the ensign replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well, Ensign Camfrey. I hereby formally relinquish command of this ship, the KFBS (Kerbol Federation Battle Ship) \u003Ci\u003EVengeance\u003C/i\u003E, and this entire\u00A0fleet, to you,\u201D Desdon said, a tear rolling down his cheek.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, sir,\u201D Camfrey replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIf I do not return within fifteen minutes, open fire on the Reticulians at will,\u201D Desdon said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYes, sir,\u201D Camfrey answered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFarewell, Acting Commander,\u201D Desdon finished.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon put on his helmet and made his way to the airlock. He entered, depressurized it, and stepped out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWho goes there?\u201D A voice came through on the ansible channel. \u201CThis is the headquarters of the Reticulian Faction. What business have you here?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI am Captain Desdon Kerman of the Kerbol Federation. You have destroyed a member system of our Federation, the Uctin system, and we come here to destroy you,\u201D Desdon said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou? Destroy us? Impossible!\u201D The commander of the Reticulians stepped out and leveled his railgun pistol. He squeezed the trigger.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon heard a whir as the enemy\u2019s railgun accelerator coils spun up. He was about to take aim and shoot his adversary, when a \u003Ci\u003Ething\u003C/i\u003E slammed into his right arm. Desdon knew instantly he\u2019d been hit, by a fifty-gram railgun slug\u00A0no less. He grunted in pain and let go of his railgun pistol.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSuit breach detected,\u201D the \u003Ci\u003EHaven\u003C/i\u003E suit\u2019s AI said. \u201CPressure is dropping.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nIgnoring the excruciating pain in his right arm, Desdon used the left arm to retrieve his railgun pistol, holster it, and then cover his right arm as he tried to make his way back to the airlock. He had to be quick or else he would risk getting shot again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSuit pressure stable at point six five atmospheres. Backfilling from emergency N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0tanks.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon glanced at his right arm. Blood had gushed from the wound and escaped into the void, with the air. But some blood had clung onto the hole in his suit, and scabbed up. Desdon didn\u2019t believe that a scab would hold back an atmosphere of pressure, but he didn\u2019t mind. He had more important things to attend to.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWasting no time, Desdon wrenched open the airlock with his good arm, closed the outer door, and pressurized it. Removing his helmet, he practically fell onto the bridge platform.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CFire at will, commander,\u201D Desdon croaked, barely audible, and then fell unconscious.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll stations, fire at will! Medic, report to bridge immediately!\u201D Now Acting Commander, Camfrey began screaming at various officers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe entire fleet began to fire on the Reticulians\u2019 ships. The ships at the forefront of the front line went first, the two-pound railgun projectile annihilating the smaller ships, and tearing larger ships apart by breaching their hull. The lasers concentrated on the ships, burning a hole through their hulls, and then the Reticulian officers aboard were vented out to meet an ignoble end as they exploded in the vacuum.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUgh,\u201D exclaimed the commander, as body parts and blood of the late Reticulian officers were sent flying in every direction.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe medical officer rushed into the bridge, took one look at Desdon, and understood everything. Feeling for a heartbeat, he proclaimed that the officer was indeed alive, but he had fainted due to the pain and shock. Reaching for his scalpel, he examined the wound. It was not mortal, and the medic reached in and removed the railgun slug from the wound with his scalpel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CArgh!\u201D Desdon cried out in agony. \u201CWhat in heaven\u2019s name happened here, officer?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI just got the railgun slug out of your wound, sir,\u201D the medical officer replied. \u201CNow if you\u2019d kindly hold still, I\u2019ll apply a bandage on your wound.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAh, I apologize, officer,\u201D Desdon said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNo worries. Hold still\u2026\u201D The medical officer replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon grimaced in pain as the medical officer bandaged his wound up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CNow, sir, you\u2019d better retire to your quarters. Doctor\u2019s orders,\u201D the medical officer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well. I shall retire to my quarters. Acting Commander, you have the bridge,\u201D Desdon said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI have the bridge, sir,\u201D Camfrey said.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDesdon trudged off the bridge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CSir, we\u2019re detecting an incoming warhead. Sensors indicate a high concentration of weapon-grade uranium,\u201D an officer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRange?\u201D Camfrey barked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRange is twelve klicks and closing rapidly, sir,\u201D the officer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CAll shields up!\u201D Camfrey yelled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CShields up, sir,\u201D an officer piped up. \u201CAll other ships in fleet report same.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe nuclear warhead, its sole booster blazing, impacted the \u003Ci\u003EVengeance\u003C/i\u003E. The shield deflected it and it reversed course \u2013 back to where it was launched. The warhead happily detonated after impacting its own mothership. It was quite an explosion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CScience officer, report! I want values on the Geiger sensor. Now!\u201D Camfrey barked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThe counter\u2019s clicking like no man\u2019s business, sir. Instrument panels indicate a thousand counts per second,\u201D the science officer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201COpen hailing channel, communications,\u201D Camfrey bellowed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CHailing frequencies open, sir,\u201D the communications officer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is Acting Commander Camfrey of the Kerbol Federation Vacuum Navy. If you wish to unconditionally surrender, all Reticulian soldiers shall be exiled to 4690 Phalguni, a binary system with three planets, and all females and children will be granted amnesty and be transferred to a Federation starbase. Should you decline, this battle shall end with the complete destruction of V\u2019Onak. Please consider those terms carefully.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Acting Commander, at that time, was not bluffing. He had full support from Admiral Scott Kerman and the rest of Federation Command, and he had the technology to destroy this entire planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor on the KFBS \u003Ci\u003EVengeance\u003C/i\u003E, there was a fusion-powered inertial confinement fusion laser. This laser ran on just a few milligrams of deuterium and tritium, and the subsequent reaction would release one quadrillion joules in laser form for one second, scorching the planet\u2019s atmosphere and cooking any and all living beings on the planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWe will not surrender. If our planet shall be destroyed, so be it. It just goes to show that the Federation is nothing but a group of tyrants,\u201D the dictator spat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CYou heard the dictator. Helm, navigator; insert your\u00A0laser ignition keys,\u201D Camfrey boomed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe helmsman and navigator inserted their ignition key, and turned it clockwise ninety degrees. Two lights lit up on the commander\u2019s laser panel, indicating the two stations\u2019 readiness. The commander inserted his own key and turned it. The third light lit up, and the plastic cover disengaged.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEngineering, do we have target lock?\u201D The commander asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CTarget is locked, sir,\u201D the head engineer said.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CICF fusion reactor status?\u201D The commander inquired.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CReactor at standby, sir,\u201D the head engineer replied.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CVery well,\u201D the commander answered.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe commander stared at the panel. The plastic cover was up. The planet\u2019s fate lay in the red button, smack-dab in the center of the panel. Every atom of his being screamed for him to activate the laser. But on the contrary, his morality, the way he had been brought up as a little kerbling, begged him not to press the button.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CForgive me,\u201D the commander whispered, and slammed his fist down on the button.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA series of electronic pulses raced through the circuitry of the ship. One such pulse engaged the fusion reactor, the other started the laser, and another opened the laser hatch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe laser hatch opened, and the laser, now extended, roared to life, and then fired, pounding a petajoule of energy into the planet for a split second.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor but a single moment, the planet V\u2019Onak shone as bright as the star it orbited. The commander instantly felt a pang of remorse, almost as if he could hear the denizens of the planet wail in despair as their lives were extinguished. The atmosphere shriveled up and died, as every cubic meter of the air ignited, engulfing the planet in the worst firestorm anyone had ever seen. The flames had scorched the ground of the planet, charring\u00A0every square kilometer of the planet\u2019s regolith, turning them into seared, lifeless stone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Reticulians were no more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe commander immediately ordered his ships to halt all fire, took one last regretful look at the mangled pieces of debris, and gave the command to enter hyperspace and make their way back to Starbase III.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCamfrey did not want to be lauded as a hero. Destroying an entire planet or an entire species was nothing to be commended for. But, it seemed that the parades and celebrations would go on anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpilogue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamfrey laid back on his couch, in his beach home on Laythe.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt had been ten years. Ten years since he had singlehandedly destroyed an entire planet. Ten years since his promotion and subsequent resignation. Ten years since the Great War.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCamfrey tried his best to ease the guilt. But the guilt had left a welt on his heart, unable to be mended. He donated to charity. He helped out, as a volunteer. But every time he gazed at his Rear Admiral\u2019s uniform, the decorations and the Medal of Honor and the two silver stars winking back at him, the guilt returned instantly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHis telephone rang. Camfrey trudged over to his table. Undoubtedly, he thought to himself, this would be from the many fans of the officer who destroyed an entire planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CCamfrey here,\u201D he sighed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CRear Admiral. I need you to get to Federation HQ immediately.\u201D The voice was gruff and it belonged to Vice Admiral Desdon Kerman.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMust I remind you, Vice Admiral,\u201D Camfrey said, \u201Cthat I am retired?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat does not matter. There has been an emergency. So get your green behind to Federation HQ, or I will come down to Laythe and drag you there,\u201D Desdon barked, and slammed down the phone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCamfrey replaced the handset on the telephone, and gazed at his Rear Admiral uniform.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CLooks like you and I shall fight together another day,\u201D Camfrey grinned.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seemed as if the uniform grinned back at his owner as Camfrey changed into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
