Hey, what\u0027s the big i--!\u0022\n\n\u0022Down!\u0022 Valentina pushed them both to the floor, upending the table, and then... all the Nine Hells of legend broke loose. \n\nThe glass wall panes shattered one after the other in crystal cascades of shards, to a noise like crashing cymbals. A zig-zagging line of destruction racked back and forth across the wall, the display cases along the counter disintegrated, soda bottles in the upright cooler exploded. The air was filled with pings and whizzes, splinters and sparks, punctuated by the muted, gut-churning sound of lead hitting flesh. And all around people were screaming, bleeding, dying.  \n\nValentina raised her head for a moment, then quickly dropped it again as something split the air just centimeters away. She wanted to scream too, to cry out, but no voice would leave her throat. Patrons who had only moments ago been talking and smiling now lay sprawled on the floor, slumped against the walls, or crumpled over their tables. Nearby, curled into a ball and clutching her head, Anastasia *was* screaming, a shrill, piercing shriek that bored into the base of Valentina\u0027s skull like a drill. A fresh line of jagged holes appeared in the overturned table above them, showering them with fragments. \n\nAnd even now, even *now*, in this place where Death walked with impunity, some part of Valentina\u0027s conflicted mind whispered to her that none of it was real, all just a mistake, surely some *reasonable* explanation. All of this, every moment since that draw of her eye floating high above Kerbin, everything before and everything to come, surely just a misunderstanding. After all, *this*, we do not speak of. \n\nBecause the truth is far, far worse. The truth... is too horrible to consider. \n\n*...all my fault...*\n\nOh, the lies we tell ourselves. That the shadow didn\u0027t move. That we didn\u0027t hear what we think we heard. That there are no such things as monsters. \n\n*...this, we do not speak of...*\n\nWhat\u0027s *really* there, what\u0027s really hidden in the shadows, watching, waiting, whispering... taunting before the inevitable revelation... *this*, we do not speak of, *this* is too horrible to consider, to even envision lest by doing so we give it leave to leap from the shadows and devour us. This is what we tell ourselves, even while it *does* move from the shadows, unhindered, unhidden, to stand before us. We deny it, helpless, even as its jaws close on us. \n\nValentina heard the whisper, saw the shadows shifting as if behind a veil, and still denied it. \n\nBecause there was one more lie, wasn\u0027t there? Hiding behind the guilt that paralyzed her.\n\n*...all my fault...*\n\n*...they died... they \u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E died... because of me...*\n\nAnd now, finally, as bullets and shards and splinters zipped and ricocheted around her, even that began to crack. She looked over to the wailing young girl beside her. \n\n*They\u0027ve come for me... because I saw what I shouldn\u0027t have... because I spoke of it...*\n\nThe incessant, deceitful whisper prattled on, but the truth had already sunk into her bones, chilling them like ice, her eyes still locked on the girl. \n\n*Not me.* \n\n*\u003Cu\u003EHer\u003C/u\u003E.*\n\n*Never make noise... do what you must to survive... and never, ever take sides...*\n\nA silken whisper, from a fleeting shadow... how could *she* fight *that?*\n\nA forgotten blood vow by M\u00FCnlight spoken long ago chided from her memory... *I. Will. \u003Cu\u003EBreak\u003C/u\u003E. You.*\n\nBut how could she? A shadow whose reach spans oceans and borders? A monster that strikes without care at helpless young girls?\n\nHow could she? \n\nHow could *anyone?*\n\n*Because*, Valentina thought with grim realization, *I \u003Cu\u003Ebelieve\u003C/u\u003E in monsters.*\n\nAnd with that, the veil was shattered, the darkness rent, the conflict was gone... and the monster stood before her. \n\nIn those silly Foreign movies, the hero stood before the monster, and punched it in the face. But Valentina was no hero. She was a simple girl from the taiga, and the people of the taiga knew monsters well. Everyone knew, punching it in the face never worked. \n\nEveryone knew, you had to take it by the throat instead. \n\nBeneath her rags, the M\u00FCnstone blazed into the fire of a thousand suns. \n\n*No more.*\n\n*No more!*\n\n***NO MORE!***\n\n\u0022We have to go!\u0022 Valentina yelled, but the girl was still curled up and screaming.\n\n*Magazine change. There will be a pause. You must move quickly.*\n\n\u0022We have to go, *now!*\u0022 she shouted and shook the girl. Anna looked up for a moment, her eyes wide with panic, but went back to screaming. With a curse, Valentina grabbed her. She looked around the dusty, ruined cafe, watched the impacts, analyzed their paths.\n\n*\u003Cu\u003EThere\u003C/u\u003E. By the counter. Cover. Then through the kitchen and out the back door.*\n\nThe big, burly clerk stood by the kitchen entrance, his face pale as a sheet, lost in his own horror. Valentina tensed, waited... the fusillade ceased.\n\n*Now!*\n\nShoving with all the strength she had, she pushed the terrified girl, sending her tumbling across the floor to refuge next to the counter. A line of erupting powdered cement and linoleum followed after her, then chased Valentina back behind the table.\n\n*Wait for it again....*\n\n\u0022Be ready to move!\u0022 She cried out. \n\nAnna seemed to shake herself from her stupor, pawing frantically at her neck.\n\n\u0022My... my m\u00FCnrock!\u0022 she pointed, pleading, \u0022please! It\u0027s all I have left of my brother!\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\nValentina dared a peek around the table and felt something flick her hair for her trouble, but there it was, lying in the middle of the floor in full view of the attacker outside. A small, grey, sparkly rock. \n\nWith another curse, she readied herself.... *NOW!*\n\nChaos ebbed, and Valentina darted from behind the table. Or tried to. She slipped and skittered on blood and melting ice cream and broken glass, making awkward progress, slipped again, slid right past it. She flipped around, feet scrambling for purchase, grabbed the rock, and--\n\nWhy is the pause so *long?*\n\nA sinking feeling growing in her gut, Valentina spared a glance out the ruined front windows... *there*. \n\n*Building across the street, third story, open window.*\n\nThe she saw the flash, and a finger of grey smoke reaching out for her. \n\nOh, *P\u0426TI\u0419S. **L\u0417FT. \u042D\u0414\u042F!***\n\nTime seemed to dilate and stretch out. Her feet scrabbled in the mess, fought for grip, felt like lead. At last she found traction and began to move, but slow, and dream-like, as if running underwater. People still lay scattered all around, some dead, some clinging to life. \n\n*I can\u0027t help them. I can\u0027t help \u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E of them.* It was both a lament and acknowledgement. \n\n*The girl. Save the girl. Deny the monster, if only for now.*\n\nShe charged towards Anna, still huddled and sobbing on the floor. In one fluid motion --fluid, because *all* her motions seemed languid and weak-- she scooped up the girl with one arm and pressed for the kitchen doorway. Just ahead, the shocked clerk gaped helplessly. \n\n*You. I can maybe save you.*\n\nAs she passed, she reached out and punched *him* in the face as hard as she could. Her fist moved slowly, drifting like a leviathan, the bones of her arm having plenty of time to perfectly align to absorb the impact. It connected with his chin, splitting it open. His cheeks remained still for a moment as his head began to snap back, then ripples of slow-motion shockwaves cascaded across his face. He slowly arced away, sending a few droplets of spittle flying from his mouth. The last Valentina saw of him, he was floating behind the safety of the heavy counter, and then she was past and into the kitchen. \n\nHere, more terrified faces looked to her, crouching under tables or hiding behind equipment. The inside wall was paper-thin, she couldn\u0027t help them, she couldn\u0027t help *any* of them, she just focused on the door ahead. Twisting around at the last drawn-out second, shielding the girl, she drove her shoulder into it, sending up a silent appeal that it opened outward. \n\nIt did. \n\nThe two glided out into the brilliant sunlight, Valentina twisted her body once more, forcing the girl ahead of her. Sound beyond sound abruptly slammed into her, driving *all* sound away, and raking a thousand red-hot teeth across her back. Reality wavered. \n\nShe blinked slowly, in a silent world, unaware of how she wound up on the ground on top of Anna. Trying to stand simply brought her back down, her reeling brain convinced every direction at once was up. Her entire body felt numb, pulsating. Anna knelt next to her, gripping her own head once more, her mouth moving soundlessly. Valentina tried to stand again but only rolled onto her back. Buildings loomed over her like twisted faces. \n\nDistantly, sound slowly began to return, led by a deep, thrumming ring. Valentina managed to force herself to her knees, the whole world still spinning. \n\nBeside her, Anna sounded a thousand miles away, \u0022I can\u0027t hear! I can\u0027t hear!\u0022\n\nValentina crawled to her, took her arms, tried to calm her. She felt her own mouth move, her vocal chords vibrate, but couldn\u0027t be sure if the hoarse whisper was real or imagined.\n\n\u0022It will pass! Be calm, be calm!\u0022\n\nThe two could only sit there hanging on to each other lest they fall off the very face of the world. Days went by, perhaps years... but in truth it was probably only minutes, before Valentina\u0027s brain began slowly sorting out the fraudulent \u0027ups\u0027 her ears were sending.\n\n\u0022Are you all right!\u0022 it felt like screaming at the top of her lungs, but only a trickle of voice came out. Yet it was a trickle more than before. \n\n\u0022I... I think so!\u0022\n\n\u0022Can you stand!\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know!\u0022\n\n\u0022Let us try!\u0022\n\nAwkwardly, they pushed each other to their feet. The world still seemed to be trying to shake them loose, but with less ferocity, now. Not far away, grey and brown smoke wafted from the open door.\n\nValentina looked the girl over, forcing her own eyes to focus. She was scraped and battered, but didn\u0027t seem injured. \n\n\u0022We cannot stay here!\u0022 it still felt like screaming.\n\n\u0022What... what happened!\u0022\n\nGiving her head one more shake, trying to clear it, Valentina was reminded of the pain on her back. With a barely heard groan, she sloughed off a couple of stiff, ragged layers. A sharp twinge in her shoulder screwed her face into a grimace. \n\n\u0022Wait, are *you* ok!\u0022 Anna asked.\n\n\u0022Is not bad!\u0022 Valentina wished she felt it, \u0022enough crusty P\u0426TI\u0419 on clothes, must be like armor!\u0022 With another wince, she also noticed her hair seemed shorter. \n\nAnna pointed towards the building, \u0022should... shouldn\u0027t we help them!\u0022\n\nBlack, oily smoke was now pouring from the open doorway. More of it seeped from two nearby emergency exits. \n\n\u0022I do not think we can,\u0022 Valentina gave her head one last shake, \u0022not from here.\u0022 She looked around, finally really taking in their surroundings. They were in a mostly empty parking area behind the cafe, flanked by a wide back alley. \u0022We have to go.\u0022 The low ringing was slowly being replaced by the distant wail of sirens, and right on cue, a police \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E swooped down out of the sky with *chirps* and *whoops* of its own. The lone occupant was out before the craft had even fully settled on its landing gear. \n\n\u0022Are you two all right?\u0022 The officer said with concern on his face, \u0022the fire department\u0027s on its way.\u0022\n\n\u0022We are fine,\u0022 Valentina said, clutching her throbbing shoulder. \n\n\u0022What happened here??\u0022 he asked, staring up at the rising smoke. \n\nValentina looked at the officer, looked at his nimble-looking cruiser. Her aching shoulders fell. \n\n\u0022Ma\u0027am?\u0022 he raised an eye... bulge, \u0022*are* you all right?\u0022\n\nStill holding her shoulder, Valentina approached him, and let out a long sigh, \u0022I am terribly sorry about this,\u0022 she said with a resigned look. \n\nHe blinked, \u0022sorry about wh--\u0022 *thump* \u0022goodnight, Mommie,\u0022 *thud*.\n\nAnna screamed again, quite possibly the only sound Valentina wished she *couldn\u0027t* hear, \u0022you-you-you just punched out a *cop!*\u0022\n\n\u0022He\u0027ll live,\u0022 she said flatly, unfastening his helmet, \u0022put this on,\u0022 she pushed it at the girl and herded her toward the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n\u0022You\u0027re seriously gonna steal a cop cruiser?!\u0022 Anna said incredulously. \n\n\u0022We need to get out of here, quickly,\u0022 she shrugged at the spot between her shoulders, \u0022this isn\u0027t over, yet.\u0022 \n\nValentina more or less shoved Anna up into the diminutive back seat, thought for a moment, then retrieved the unconscious officer\u0027s sunglasses as well.\n\n\u0022Are you sure you can fly this thing?\u0022 \n\n\u0022I can fly anything,\u0022 Valentina said calmly as she plunked into the pilot\u0027s seat. She looked over the incredible array of switches and buttons, and began working them.\n\n*BEEP!*\n\n*HONK!* \n\n*BEE-DO! BEE-DO! BEE-DO!*\n\n*WOOP! WOOP!*\n\n*SELF DESTRUCT, ARM--*\n\nShe flipped *that* switch back and sat very straight for a moment. \n\n*Foreigners!*\n\nAnother switch, and finally the welcome sound of the two big engines spooling up greeted them. Valentina looked over the panel again, finding the knob to close the plexiglass bubble canopy. A check of the vector nozzles, nudge the throttles forward... and the craft sprung daintily from the ground.\n\n*Need to get up high, out of range. There\u0027s an abandoned airfield on an island not far from here. Should be deserted. We can hide there and--*\n\nValentina felt it in her chest, at first. A deep rumbling that grew in intensity until the instruments began to blur. Just about the time the little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E crested the roof of the nearest building, that vague memory that had been orbiting around just out of reach plunged down like a shooting star. A moment too late. \n\nCerima was generally thought to be a chaotic, mad place, but pockets of relative stability *did* exist. They existed, because they had thriving economies supported by building and exporting some of the most fearsome weapons of war known to Kerb. \n\nLike this gunship, here. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-17T05:56:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2016 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-17T18:05:48Z","Content":"Hehehe.\n\nGetting better and better.

Dazzled by the muzzle flash, she jammed them forward again, but it wasn\u0027t enough to stop the craft from smacking back into the pavement with a spine-cracking jolt before bouncing back up again. She shoved the nozzles forward with a curse, pirouetted the cruiser around, and shot off down the alley. Behind her, Anna was screaming again. \n\n*Have to stay low, no chance up in the open.*\n\n\u0022Is all right!\u0022 Valentina called back, \u0022he can\u0027t possibly keep--\u0022\n\nMore tracer fire shot past the windscreen, tearing chunks of concrete and glass out the buildings ahead. Glancing in the mirror, she saw the gunship bearing down on them with alarming speed. Its glazed dome of a cockpit was flanked by a pair of expansive round intakes, covered in heavy wire mesh screens. The bulk was slung below long, drooping wings, giving the distinct impression of a raptor diving at its prey. A raptor, followed by a billowing trail of choking, black smoke. \n\nAnd, of course, guns. A really silly amount of guns all firing at once. \n\nValentina narrowly jinked out of the way of the barrage, and saw an opportunity just ahead. With a grunt, she made a slight right down a narrower alley. \n\n\u0022Is alright, now!\u0022 she yelled back, \u0022he cannot possibly fit through--\u0022\n\nBits of building exploded to her left and right, the gunship still right behind them, its wingtips tearing long, undulating gashes in the walls. She jerked the agile cruiser up and down, but this was even worse. *She* didn\u0027t have any room to maneuver in here, either! The alley opened up onto a street, she banked into a hard right turn. \n\nRight!\n\nLeft!\n\nRightRight!\n\nLeftRight!...RightLeftLeftRightLeft!\n\nThen she rolled the stubby wings nearly vertical, pulling into a crushing left turn onto a another street. The airframe groaned in protest, the opposing wall charging up at a frightening pace while G-forces pulled both of them down into their seats as the landing gear scraped along the wall that was momentarily more like the ground. \n\nHurtling down the road pulling out of the turn, Valentina flipped up the gear handle, only to be greeted by three flashing red lights. She frowned, but this time checked the mirror first. \n\n\u0022*Now* is alright,\u0022 she breathed, \u0022he cannot *possibly* maneu--\u0022\n\nIn the mirror she saw the gunship seem to skid around the corner, fishtailing wildly in the air. It slammed right into the building they had just scraped against, tearing a hole in it and causing a rain of debris. Huge chunks bounced harmlessly off the intake screens as it burst through and charged after them faster than ever.\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS!*\n\nValentina rolled away from another hail of fire and dived toward the road. \n\n*Think! ThinkThinkThink!* Surely there was *some* strategy recorded for dealing with Ceriman gunships. She\u0027d spent time around fighter pilots, must have absorbed *some*thing...\n\nOf course, she was usually fighting with them at the time, and otherwise the only phrases that drifted up were things like \u0022engage beyond visual range\u0022 and \u0022expedite egress\u0022 and something about nuking from orbit but that might have been a movie and--\n\nAnna squealed her back to the present, \u0022fruit stand! Fruit stand! *Fruit stand!\u0022*\n\nValentina looked up, too late.\n\n*ZOOM!*\n\nFruit salad. \n\nAnna screamed louder than ever, \u0022somebody\u0027s guts are all over the nose!\u0022\n\nPeering at the chunky red smears, Valentina frowned, \u0022no, is just strawberries.\u0022\n\nThe girl screamed again, \u0022cardboard boxes! Cardboard boxes! *Cardboard boxes!\u0022*\n\n*ZOOM!*\n\nConfetti.\n\nA small \u0027FRAGILE: HANDLE WITH CARE\u0027 sticker remained plastered to the windscreen just long enough to get the point across. \n\nAnd because these things always come in threes, \u0022plate glass window! Plate glass window! ***Plate glass window!**\u0022*\n\n*Oh for P\u0426TI\u0419S sake!*\n\nThey saw the onslaught coming, of course. Knowing from years of experience that resistance was futile, the two glaziers simply sighed and tensed. \n\n*ZOOM!*\n\nGlitter.\n\nOne of the pair rolled his eyes and handed a bill to the other. They had just turned back toward their truck, where they had stocked plenty of spare window glass, when the gunship came along, caught it with a wing tip, and tore the whole truck in half, too.\n\nMeanwhile, Valentina\u0027s eyes frantically scanned over the switch panels as more tracers flew past, \u0022doesn\u0027t this thing have any weapons??\u0022 she called out. \n\nAnna briefly interrupted her screaming, \u0022cops with guns, are you nuts?! What\u0027d you think this is, *Omork?\u0022*\n\nValentina just grunted and did a tight barrel roll around a flurry of shells. Makes no difference, she wasn\u0027t combat trained anyway. A quick left, then a dodge back to the right, and another hard right onto... what was this, Market Street? She noted this wasn\u0027t exactly combat anyway. This was running away from something big and mean, and growing up in the taiga, she had plenty of experience with *that*.\n\nA dozen things kept fighting for attention in the back of her mind as she jinked and swerved. The other pilot, he was *good*, but... he should have had them by now. He wasn\u0027t used to this *either*, that was a gunship, not a fighter plane. \n\n*Keep moving, keep dodging. Break his line of sight, then hide.*\n\nThere was something else, too, drifting around in that infuriating fog just beyond recollection. Something, she\u0027d heard *something* about those beasts, some Achilles\u0027 heel, but what *was* it? And something else, too, but--\n\nLoud *pings* and sparks off the left wing jerked Valentina back again. *That was close, nothing serious*--hard bank to the left, feint right-- *but where are we, Third Ave? Fourth, now?-- **There!***\n\n*Break his line of sight...*\n\nEnd of the street... the glassed-in lobby of a skyscraper--must be downtown, now--oh, why *not?* What\u0027s a few more plate glass windows, at this point? Anna screamed over the engines as they roared ahead. Impressive set of lungs on that girl.\n\nTime had the odd impression of stretching out again as the little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E smashed through the window, turning it into tiny, glimmering pebbles that flew in every direction. Startled business professionals in their tailored suits and skirts gaped at her, and Valentina seemed to have plenty of time to gape back and consider the bewildered looks on their faces. She did a slow roll around a support column and mulled over the *very* attractive marble mosaic on the floor. Quality workkerbship there, all right. Must\u0027ve cost a fortune. Oh, they have a coffee cart, too! She could really use some coffee right now. And one of those delicious pink cookies. Pity Tercella didn\u0027t patent her machine like Valentina told-- ***plate glass window!***\n\nThe cruiser crashed back out onto the street again, pulling up abruptly to miss a concrete support column for the elevated train track. They found themselves hurtling along another narrow passage between the track columns and dozens of store fronts. Valentina backed down on the throttles. \n\n*He\u0027ll have to go up and around, only have a few seconds, at best. Stay low, find a parking garage or alley before--*\n\nThrough a cloud of brown dust and black exhaust, the gunship burst from the now-ruined lobby, smashed *through* the support column, and shot forward on the other side. As the cement beams raced past between them in a grey blur, it pulled even with Valentina. Sneering, she raised a hand, and, in the way of the Foreigners, gestured to the other pilot that he was \u0027number one.\u0027 All her snark disappeared, however, when he grinned beneath his black, bug-like visor.  \n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS, his **teeth**...!*\n\nThey were filed down to sharp, interlocking points like shark\u0027s teeth. Then, with an equally vile grin, the gunner opened up with the *side*-mounted autocannon. Stout cement pilings simply disintegrated before the onslaught, and a ragged gash chased Valentina along the facing structures. She dove down out of the way, scraped the dangling undercarriage along the pavement, dodged honking kars left and right. \n\n*Madness! This is madness!*\n\nIn the mirror, she saw the trackway begin to collapse behind them in a ribbon of chaos. And of course, the train was just up ahead. Snapping the wings vertical again, hearing more unsettling pings, she turned off down the next alley, hoping the remaining track would hold. \n\n*Think! **Think!** There must be some way to--*\n\nThe pursuer was on top of them in an instant. More brilliant white tracers flew past. This time one caught the right engine with a metallic *thump*, followed quickly by--\n\n\u0022We\u0027re on fire!\u0022 Anna screamed. \n\nValentina spat a curse, turned down the next street, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E now trailing oily black smoke to match its hunter. She struggled with the controls as the airframe shuddered and groaned, red lights popping on all over the instruments.\n\n*Extinguisher! Extinguisher!* her eyes raced over the unfamiliar switches, where is the *ST\u0414LI\u0419S\u041AI*--\n\nThey shot wide open. \n\n*Extinguisher.*\n\nShe flipped the switch and called back, \u0022Anna! We need to get to the river!\u0022 Anna, however, was cradling her head and screaming, always screaming.\n\n\u0022Anna!\u0022\n\nShells whizzed by, leaving faint trails of smoke in the air. \n\n*\u0022Anna!\u0022*\n\nLeft, then another right. Valentina had *no* idea where she was anymore. The wounded engine spewed an ever louder cascade of grunts and bangs. \n\n\u0022Anna, I know you are scared,\u0022 she pleaded, \u0022but I *need* you right now!\u0022\n\nA large chunk of concrete, dislodged somewhere high above, fell against the canopy with a resounding *crunch*, leaving a snaking crack in the plexiglass. \n\n\u0022You know the city better than I do--\u0022\n\nSomething took a piece out of the tail. \n\n\u0022--we have to get to the *river!\u0022*\n\nAn alarm began buzzing. \n\n\u0022R...river...?\u0022 Anna\u0027s face strained against her own panic. \n\n\u0022Yes, yes, the river!\u0022 *bangTHUD!* \u0022how do we get to the river?!\u0022\n\nSomewhere in Valentina\u0027s head, she realized she was tiring.\n\n\u0022Um... the... the parkway...\u0022\n\n*Can\u0027t keep this up much longer,* \u0022which *way?\u0022*\n\nAnna\u0027s wide, terrified eyes darted about, for a moment she seemed sure to lapse back into shock, but then--\n\n\u0022No... *NO!* We\u0027d be sitting ducks up there!\u0022 she cried out, \u0022the tunnel! We gotta take the *tunnel!* Go left!\u0022\n\n*Ungh!*\n\n\u0022Right!\u0022\n\n*Mmmf!*\n\n\u0022Another right!\u0022\n\n*Guh!*\n\n***\u0022Crap!\u0022***\n\nThey shot out onto Tunnel Street, and there it was all right. All four lanes jammed with rush-hour traffic. Instinctively, Valentina pulled back the throttles. Something in the bad engine let go with a shudder.\n\n*Nowhere to go, now...*\n\n\u0022No, faster!\u0022 yelled Anna, *\u0022must go faster!\u0022*\n\n\u0022What?!\u0022 Valentina did it anyway. \n\n\u0022Faster! Aim for the middle. And hit the lights, center switch!\u0022 Anna pointed. \n\n*Bee-doh! Bee-doh! Bee-doh!*\n\n\u0022Just trust me, give it everything you\u0027ve got! *Balls to the wall!*\u0022^(actual asterisk)\\*^\n\n*Bee-doh! Bee-doh!

Bee-doh!*\n\nValentina resisted the urge to shut her eyes, and just plowed for the center of the tunnel. \n\nSuddenly, as if by some miracle, the flood of vehicles simply *parted*, like the waters of a certain colorfully-named sea. The ragged cruiser rocketed into the tunnel in its *own* little tunnel of space. Just behind, Valentina saw the gunship pull up and away at the last second. \n\nShe stared in disbelief at the blur of steel whizzing by on either side, \u0022how... how is this even possible?\u0022\n\n\u0022Running code,\u0022 Anna slumped against her seat, \u0022lights and siren. It overrides the AutoPark systems in heavy traffic and makes everyone pull over.\u0022\n\n*Bee-doh! Bee-doh! Bee-doh!*\n\n\u0022Auto-park?\u0022\n\n\u0022Um, yah!\u0022 She rolled her huge, pretty, tired eyes, \u0022MechJeb DriverAssist\u0027s been standard equipment for a couple years now, on everything but--\u0022 she pointed, and screamed again.\n\n*\u0022Trucks!\u0022*\n\nThere was a light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, it was mostly blocked by a pair of tractor-trailers that hadn\u0027t quite managed to pull out of the way. As they crept forward, angled away from the middle, the gap between the back of their trailers actually got *smaller*.\n\n\u0022Duck!\u0022 At the last possible instant, Valentina snapped the wings vertical again and tried to kiss the instrument panel. This time, she *did* shut her eyes. \n\nWith a screech and a crunch, the plucky little craft burst back out into daylight. Valentina looked up just in time to pull a hard turn and avoid the building looming in front of them. Squinting against the windblast, she took stock. The canopy was gone. The mirror was gone. Because of that, she couldn\u0027t see what *else* might be gone but since they were still going more-or-less where she was pointing, she figured it couldn\u0027t be anything *that* important. \n\nBy some inviolable rule of the cosmos, she still had her sunglasses. \n\nShe craned around to Anna, \u0022are you all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m ok,\u0022 Anna poked her head up, then more surely, \u0022*I\u0027m ok!*\u0022 She\u0027d had the good sense to lower the helmet visor. \n\n\u0022But... where is river?\u0022 They were hurtling down yet another nondescript urban canyon. \n\n\u0022We went under it!\u0022 Anna called back, \u0022it\u0027s just on the other side of those office blocks, to the left. There\u0027s a gap coming up in another kilometer or so.\u0022 She turned around and looked behind, \u0022but it\u0027s ok, I think we lost--\u0022\n\n*\u0022NO, DO NOT SAY--!\u0022*\n\nThe wall just ahead *exploded*, the gunship came roaring through the hole trailing fire and smoke like the proverbial infernal chiropteran, and turned right at them, eponymous guns blazing.  \n\nValentina joined Anna in screaming. \n\nShe yanked back the stick as hard as she could, the weary cruiser groaned in protest but darted upwards just missing the attacker. Arcing high across the sky, it left a dotted trail of smoke as the right engine coughed and wheezed but somehow kept going. It sailed over the row of office mid-rises, and finally the greenish waters of the river beckoned. The edge of the city was visible just beyond. \n\nValentina swooped down over the water, zig-zagging back and forth. At each turn, she could look back and see the gunship making its own high, drawn-out pirouette. Still trailing thin ribbons of smoke from its wings, the black exhaust belching from its huge engines seemed thicker, the turn not as fast. She plowed straight ahead down the middle of the channel. On either side, the banks grew higher into a shallow canyon as they left the city behind. \n\n\u0022He\u0027s gaining on us!\u0022 Anna squealed. \n\nValentina spared a quick glance back, causing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E to wobble and threaten to flip over. \n\n*Cannot look back, too low now, have to concentrate.*\n\nThey skimmed among just above the river, their slipstream throwing up a faint wake of widening mist. The riverbanks seemed to close in as they raced further into the countryside. \n\n\u0022Wait, why... why isn\u0027t he shooting?\u0022 Anna gave voice to the thought in Valentina\u0027s head. \n\n\u0022Out of ammo,\u0022 she yelled back, \u0022or flying through building made guns jam.\u0022\n\n\u0022He\u0027s--he\u0027s getting closer!\u0022\n\n\u0022Good!\u0022\n\n*\u0022What?!\u0022*\n\n*Concentrate... have to guess his approach...*\n\nAnna glanced back, \u0022he\u0027s gonna ram us!\u0022\n\n\u0022Counting on it.\u0022\n\n*\u0022Are you crazy?!\u0022*\n\n\u0022Probably.\u0022\n\n*Closer... need him closer...*\n\n*But... there\u0027s something else... something I am missing...*\n\n\u0022He\u0027s right on top of us!\u0022\n\n*Almost there... almost there...*\n\nDistantly, probably just a hallucination brought on by fatigue, a voice whispered in Valentina\u0027s head...\n\n*Apply the product of mass and acceleration...*\n\nShe brushed it away, she didn\u0027t even *know* anyone named Luke.\n\n*Closer... closer...*\n\nIn her mind\u0027s eye, she could practically *see* the pilot\u0027s horrible, eyeless grin.\n\n*NOW!*\n\nShe jammed the engine nozzles *down*, and the cruiser shot *up* like a rocket in a titanic eruption of spray as the gunship passed underneath it. Valentina struggled, fought with all she had to bring her destabilized craft back under control and keep it reaching skyward. \n\n*What?? What am I not remembering??*\n\nShe looked back in time to see the gunship lurching back and forth just above the river, white smoke now pouring from its engines. A drooping wingtip caught the surface, sending it cartwheeling across the water shedding parts and flames. It came to rest upside-down, and immediately began to sink. \n\n*But what am I missing?!*\n\nAnd then, she remembered. \n\n\u0022Shut your eyes!\u0022 Valentina yelled, but it didn\u0027t do much good. The flash seared through her sunglasses and filled the inside of her head with a reddish glow. It lasted only a moment, the world becoming eerily quiet as the engines and instruments died. Then the shockwave hit, and the intrepid little plane finally disintegrated. She was vaguely aware of the cockpit spinning through the air as reality became a blur. \n\nSky........ground......sky....ground...sky..ground.skygroundskygroundskygroundskygroundskygroundskyground *splash!* \n\nThe impact nearly took her breath away. As Valentina\u0027s senses congealed, she was filled with a very *clear* memory... of being surrounded by murky, green water and ominous forms, and the waiting panic of struggling to the surface. \n\nOddly enough, she didn\u0027t have to struggle long. Perhaps buoyed up by air trapped in her stiff layers of clothing, her head quickly broke the surface even as her feet kicked at the remains of the cockpit below. \n\n\u0022Anna!\u0022 she called, *\u0022Anna!\u0022* A tall wave brushed her towards the nearby shore as she craned to see. \n\n*\u0022Anna!\u0022*\n\nThe waves lapped in pregnant silence. \n\n*\u0022Ptooi!* Ew! Ewewewewewewew! Do you *know* where this water\u0027s *been?!\u0022* Anna bobbed to the surface just a few meters away, \u0022this is *so* gross! I, like, can\u0027t *even!\u0022*\n\nValentina quickly moved to her, \u0022are you all right?\u0022 That phrase was becoming far too common, today.\n\n\u0022Um... I think so,\u0022 she pried the flight helmet from her head. It was sporting a large crack now. \n\nA few moments later, two bedraggled forms crawled up muddy, debris-riddled shoreline, coughing and panting. As mud squelched between her fingers, Valentina mused that finally, she couldn\u0027t *possibly* get any dirtier. She collapsed onto her back in a squishy, lakeweed-covered heap. A deep, penetrating weariness seemed to pull her into the muck. \n\n*The darkness can have me, if it wants,* she thought with exhaustion, *I could use the rest.*\n\nRight on cue, the sun suddenly grew dimmer, and the world was cast in crimson hues. \n\nAnna looked up, \u0022like... is that what I think it is?? What the flarp just happened?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Sodium.\u0022 Valentina panted. \n\n\u0022Huh?\u0022\n\n\u0022I remember now. Molten sodium-cooled reactor fueled with weapons-grade blutonium^386^,\u0022 she said with a breathy, bitter laugh, \u0022get spray in engine heat exchangers, and coolant tubes, they shatter. Molten sodium hit cold water, one thing lead to other...\u0022\n\nShe sighed, \u0022and you get very interestingly non-linear feedback loop.\u0022\n\n\u0022A wha--?\u0022\n\nWithout looking up, Valentina pointed to the small but rising mushroom cloud that *just* blocked out the sun, \u0022big bada-boom.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ooooooohhhhh,\u0022 Anna still looked nervous, \u0022are... are we gonna be ok?\u0022\n\nThe weariness felt like it was seeping into Valentina\u0027s bones the way the mud was seeping into her rags. That, or she was simply sinking. She didn\u0027t much care, at the moment. Her back hurt. Her eyes hurt. Her *teeth* hurt. *P\u0426TI\u0419S \u042C\u0414LD P\u0414T\u0417*, when had she done anything to her *teeth?*\n\n\u0022Low yield, not efficient. Maybe half a kiloton. And wind is blowing out to sea.\u0022\n\nThe cloud roiled and congealed, casting an ever darker shadow. Or maybe that was just her eyelids. Was she sinking or... floating? \n\n\u0022Now, I think maybe I just lay here and glow in dark for a while.\u0022\n\n^(actual asterisk)\\*^Historical note: This phrase hails from World War II when running at full power meant pushing the throttle, mixture, and RPM levers all the way forward, to the firewall.
