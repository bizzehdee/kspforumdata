I noticed somebody mention how many Kerbals they\u0027d lost over the course of a career playthrough, and I thought, \u0022Yeah, I\u0027ve returned a surface sample from every surface except Eve and Jool in one playthrough without loosing a Kerbal!\u0022 Then I realized... every time I land, I quicksave before trying, then quickload if something goes wrong, so it\u0027s not really fair to say I haven\u0027t lost any. In fact, by doing it that way, I\u0027ve mostly eliminated the need for rescue missions, which can be entertaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d rather not completely forbid myself from using quicksaves. The Tylo mission was agonizing enough already - I can see repeating it once if there\u0027s a disaster, but not as many times as I quickloaded when I tried it. So, I\u0027ve been thinking, maybe there\u0027s a way to compromise, so that I can\u0027t always quickload. Way back in the day, I used to play a little Battletech (the tabletop RPG that Mechwarrior and other games are based on); I was thinking maybe there could be a dice-roll mechanic to offset ease of access to quickloading. So, for quickloads, I would use a set of rules to determine a dice roll that must be successful to load; otherwise, no loading, and deal with the consequences. Would anyone else be interested in such a system? Here\u0027s some ideas I\u0027ve come up with so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe roll should be largely based on the Kerbal\u0027s \u0022luck\u0022; if we wanted to make a more traditional roleplay system, that could even be a stat in and of itself. So, the various modifiers may have to do with how the circumstances affect the Kerbal\u0027s luck at that moment. Also, I think the reason for the quickload should make a difference, as well as some other factors. I\u0027ll base this on 2d6, since that\u0027s what I\u0027m nostalgic for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m counting \u0022revert\u0022 as the same thing as \u0022quickload\u0022. Here are the following reasons I can think of why you might quickload, and their base rolls:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Any roll for an unmanned ship: 9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbal(s) die on attempted landing (non-atmosphere body): 7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbal(s) die on attempted landing (atmosphere body): 9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Kerbal(s) are stranded after landing (broken rocket, not enough fuel, etc.): 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Kerbal(s) die due to operator error (accidental staging, rocket pointing the wrong way, etc.): 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Kerbal(s) are stranded in space but alive (mistimed burn, operator error, etc.): 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Kerbal(s) die while lifting off from Kerbin on rocket which has worked in the past: 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Kerbal(s) die while lifting off from Kerbin in untested rocket (not due to operator error): 7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Your manned ship has pulled a non-optimal maneuver you\u0027d like to try again: 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Kerbal(s) die while landing plane (non-parachute, horizontal landing): 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Kerbal(s) die while lifting off from non-Kerbin body: 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone can think of other reasons you might quickload/revert, please chime in. I generally figure other circumstances won\u0027t require a roll. Also, notice I\u0027m using a \u0022testing\u0022 mechanic here for circumstances 7 and 8; to me, that means I\u0027ve flown this exact rocket before and it worked. I usually play a sandbox game and a career game, where sandbox is treated like my testbed (I wouldn\u0027t enforce these rules there), and career is \u0022for-real\u0022. If I pull a craft file that I\u0027ve tested in a sandbox save to a career save, I consider that valid testing. I think Kerbals may respawn in certain circumstances; obviously, I\u0027d forbid usage of respawned Kerbals if they\u0027ve died. For modifiers, I was thinking of using a system like Fallout 3 or Skyrim\u0027s \u0022perks\u0022, except they won\u0027t necessarily be helpful. Each will have a name and modifier:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELuck of the Kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E: For circumstances 2 and 3, all Kerbals have a bank of \u0022luck\u0022 to optionally draw from; at first, this modifier is -5. Each time you invoke this modifier, you draw from the luck pool, so you must keep track of how many times you\u0027ve invoked it since the beginning of the save.
