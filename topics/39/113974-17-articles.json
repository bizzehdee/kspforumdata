Vasily, the post-landing checklist, please.\u0022\n\nThe two ran through the sequence by memory, the placard only velcroed to the panel for procedural formality. Knobs were turned, switches were thrown, one by one the capsule\u0027s systems blinked off. Valentina felt an odd sort of relief when she pulled a circuit breaker and that infernal MechIVAN light went out. \n\n\u0022Post-landing check complete, control,\u0022 she said, \u0022ready for final shutdown.\u0022\n\n\u0022Acknowledged, *Yenisey*. Recovery will be on site in ten minutes, you are cleared for final shutdown.\u0022\n\nShe and her comrade flicked the last few switches before doffing their gloves and helmets and stowing them away. Then, after pausing for just a moment, Valentina reached back and pulled the breaker for the voice recorder as well. Vasily turned and raised an eye... bulge at her.\n\nShe didn\u0027t quite look at him, \u0022you... really did not see anything... on that EVA, Vasily?\u0022\n\nHe shifted around awkwardly from laying back on his couch, looking a bit green... er, \u0022no, nothing. We have both seen our share of space objects, are you quite sure *you* saw something?\u0022\n\n\u0022It was so *bright*, like Eve on a clear morning. It seemed like the most obvious thing in the world.\u0022\n\n\u0022Remember,\u0022 he grinned, \u0022you are talking to one whose eyesight just barely meets standards. I stare at circuit boards, not stars.\u0022\n\nThen, a bit lower, \u0022you should not challenge the controllers. You know how they get.\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 she sighed, \u0022such is life in the great Ussari Union, no?\u0022\n\nHe scowled at her, \u0022there must be unity, comrade, and consensus. We cannot be always bickering over petty things like the Foreigners.\u0022\n\nShe shot him a look, but decided not to press the matter. Instead, she reached back and slid the hatch open.\n\n\u0022Come, let us get some fresh air.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022Gah, I do not know how you can be so spry after three and a half days in space!\u0022 Vasily grumbled as Valentina helped him out of the capsule, \u0022I feel as if I am walking on Eve!\u0022\n\nShe chuckled at that, \u0022if you were walking on Eve, I think the giant space rats would encourage you.\u0022\n\nHe smirked at her, \u0022tell me you do not believe in such nonsense.\u0022\n\n\u0022Space rodents of unusual size? No, I do not think they exist,\u0022 grinned Valentina, \u0022the humongous explodium sea frogs would have eaten them long ago.\u0022\n\nThe pair had a good, long laugh, Vasily eventually pointing to a pillar of dust rapidly approaching across the barren summer grassland, \u0022ah, here they come. About time, too. I cannot *wait* for a real meal!\u0022 He raised a hand in greeting.\n\nShortly, the area was swarmed with utility rigs and support trucks of every size. The piercing shriek of Converters filled the air as they circled around, and as usual, Igor was the first on the ground and crossed the distance to Valentina in an instant. No amount of mental preparation could ever prepare her for--\n\n\u0022Igor,\u0022 she squeaked, \u0022you have most odd way of hugging to very edge of broken bones!\u0022\n\nHe held her up and looked her over for a moment before setting her down, \u0022you are uninjured?\u0022\n\n\u0022I am fine, Igor.\u0022\n\n\u0022This one is nearly indestructible, Comrade Igor,\u0022 added Vasily, \u0022I think even to you, she would prove a challenge, no?\n\nIgor turned to Vasily, lowering his own massive head until it blocked out the sun, casting Vasily in shadow. The spacesuit-clad Kerbal just smiled up at him.\n\n\u0022**BOO**,\u0022 boomed Igor. \n\nVasily blinked, then went back to smiling. \n\n\u0022Why he no run away?\u0022 Igor thundered at Valentina. \n\nShe smirked, and gave Vasily a playful elbow, \u0022Vasily here may not be stronk like bool... but he is stubborn like ox.\u0022 Vasily shot her a look. \n\nIgor wrinkled his... face, and sniffed, \u0022and he smell like yak.\u0022\n\nAgainst all probablity, Vasily thrust a finger in the bigger Kerbal\u0027s face, \u0022now see here, if you had been sweating in the same clothing for three days--\u0022\n\nHe was interrupted as the rest of the caravan came to a dust cloud-spewing halt nearby. \n\n\u0022Greetings, Comrades! It is a most *glorious* day!\u0022 Said a familiar voice, \u0022papers, please.\u0022\n\nThe usual shuffling of documents commenced, Valentina again narrowly resisting the temptation to roll her eyes. \n\n\u0022Yes, yes, good, good... Really? That bad? How do you not run into things?\u0022 The Political Officer handed back her docket, but... \u0022As expected, all is... nearly in order.\u0022\n\n\u0022Comrade Kerman,\u0022 he gestured to a pair of stoned-faced Kerbs in absolutely unremarkable suits standing nearby, \u0022these Kerbs from the NKOTB would like to have a word with you, before your debriefing.\u0022\n\nVasily\u0027s smile evaporated, \u0022yes... well... I... I am sure...\u0022 Before he could say more, he was herded off toward an absolutely unremarkable black panel van. \n\n\u0022Wait, no! He hasn\u0027t done anything wrong!\u0022 Valentina moved towards him, but Igor\u0027s sausage-like fingers clamped on her shoulder, \u0022no, let go of me! Vasily! *Vasily!!!\u0022*\n\nIgor handed her off to the Political Officer, a look passing between the two larger Kerbs that might have frozen the seas of Eve. The Political Officer led her away as Vasily disappeared into the van. \n\nValentina struggled to remain calm, biting back harsher words, \u0022what is wrong? What is the problem?\u0022\n\n\u0022Problem, Comrade?\u0022 He waved a hand, \u0022there *are* no problems in the glorious Ussari Union!\u0022\n\nThen his hand squeezed her shoulder in a way that brought back unpleasant memories, \u0022and do you know *why* there are no problems in the glorious Ussari Union?\u0022\n\nShe tried to meet his gaze, but the wide brim of his had shadowed his eyes in an old, familiar way. All she could see was the grin beneath his mustache. \n\nHe spoke more softly, \u0022because such things... W*e. Do. Not. Speak. Of.*\u0022\n\nTurning to her fully, he took her other shoulder as his grin faded, \u0022this is a dangerous time to be asking questions. For you *may* find answers.\u0022 This last was barely a whisper. \n\n\u0022Now, kindly report to the field medic for your post-flight checkup,\u0022 all grins and grand motions again, \u0022Glory to Arstotzka!\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-19T05:03:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2016 05:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T11:20:44Z","Content":"\u0022**BOO**,\u0022 boomed Igor. \n\nHehehehehehe, love it lol.

Today, however, her eyes didn\u0027t see the furnishings. There must be some mistake! Vasily didn\u0027t do anything, he didn\u0027t do *anything!*\n\n*He saw.*\n\nShe froze. \n\n*They **think** he saw, so he saw,* the thought whispered, *you **know** how it works.*\n\nNo, there *must* be some mistake. This can all be put to right. \n\n***They** do not make mistakes.*\n\nShaking the thought away, seeking any distraction from it, she stepped up to the wall. This, she also knew all too well. She was surprised *they* still allowed it at all, but being the Flight Director did have its... privileges. \n\nHung on the wall was a simple corkboard, and at the top, a brass plaque engraved with the Roamin\u0027 words, *AD ASTRA PER ASPERA*. Several photographs were pinned below. Sergei, of course, looking so proud and unbroken. Then... Jorrigh, and his two comrades from the ill-fated mission to their space station. Valentina felt the old lump rise in her throat, somehow both comforting and rueful. Perhaps not as strong as it once was, but always there. Hanging from the pin holding Jorrigh\u0027s picture, was a tiny, well-worn stuffed bear on a keychain. \n\nA respectful distance away from the others, but close enough not to be overlooked, was a photo of Gene Kerman, standing before a rocket, shaking hands with--\n\n\u0022Tia?\u0022 Dibella stared as she stepped into the room, \u0022you should be resting after your flight, I was not expecting you until tomorrow.\u0022 She crossed the room and hugged Valentina, a bit more sedately than in days past. \n\n\u0022It is Vasily,\u0022 Valentina blurted out, \u0022they have taken him!\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022 Dibella blinked, \u0022who has?\u0022\n\n\u0022The NKOTB.\u0022\n\nDibella scowled, \u0022I was not informed of this! It must be a mistake, something with the papers.  Probably just a typo on his reentry visa, you know how careless they can be.\u0022\n\nValentina just gave her a pleading look. \n\n\u0022I will *not* have them harassing my Kerbonauts over clerical errors!\u0022 She moved to her desk, and began rapidly rifling through a stack of papers there. Then, her face fell. \n\n\u0022Indeed,\u0022 Dibella said with resignation, \u0022Vasily has been detained for questioning.\u0022\n\nMore to herself, \u0022but... why? He has always been a model comrade.\u0022\n\n\u0022I think I know,\u0022 Valentina admitted, \u0022we--\u0022\n\nDibella put a finger to her lips, and quietly closed the door before motioning Valentina on. \n\n\u0022We..*.I*... saw something,\u0022 she continued, \u0022something in space. A structure, bigger than anything I have ever seen before.\u0022\n\n\u0022Are you sure it was not just--\u0022\n\nValentina rolled her eyes, \u0022the KSA space station. Yes, very sure. I *have* seen the KSA space station from orbit, quite notoriously, if you will remember, this was not it. But it *was* in the same orbit.\u0022\n\nShe took a step closer, \u0022you know... things. Are the KSA working on anything... significant?\u0022\n\n\u0022No,\u0022 Dibella sighed, leaning back on her desk, \u0022they haven\u0027t been able to agree on *any*thing since their plans for Duna fell apart. Anything but the most routine flights.\u0022\n\n\u0022Could it be another agency? Or even Layland-Wutani itself, perhaps?\u0022\n\nDibella shook her head, \u0022not in that orbit. Gytep has been putting up some very big things, but they\u0027re not on the equator. And not even the Company is foolish enough to launch rockets over Cerima, not with them right next door. I...\u0022 She shrugged. \n\n\u0022What could do this?\u0022 Valentina pursed her lips in thought, \u0022something that large could not possibly stay a secret outside of the Union.\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know what to tell you,\u0022 Dibella thought for a moment herself, \u0022but...\u0022 She turned, and looked out the window, where the last vestiges of this very long day were rapidly fading. \n\nShe put a comforting hand on Valentina\u0027s arm, \u0022I will do what I can for Vasily, but I do not have the influence I once did. It\u0027s getting late...\u0022\n\nHugging Valentina close, she whispered in her ear, \u0022go down to the archives, in the sub-basement. The custodians should all be gone. Anything that\u0027s tracked in orbit will be there, even *they* love their bureaucracy.\u0022\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t worry, it will all work out,\u0022 Dibella stepped back with a reassuring smile, \u0022I will see you again soon.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Bong*.\n\nThis time Valentina *did* put a hand to her face, as she stepped out of the elevator. She swore the Union did some things *just* to be different from the rest of the world. Looking back and forth in the deserted hallway, it also occurred to her that the Cosmodrome seemed to acquire new locations she was unfamiliar with at a very convenient rate.  With a sigh, she set off down the white-paneled room. Here and there, distantly hissing pipes broke the smooth, finished walls. Why did they need sub-basement, anyway? Why not just build the... not-sub-basement big enough in the first place? It\u0027s not like there was any shortage of l--\n\nOne by one, the overhead lights clicked off, only leaving every third or fourth unit on, and plunging the hall into shadows. Valentina frowned. Fervently denying to herself the little itch between her shoulder blades was even there, she walked on. The paneling became more broken, and the hissing, now damp pipes more frequent as she moved along. The light fixtures took on an industrial look, and of course, randomly began to flicker. Another turn, and the hall paneling ended altogether, leaving her on bare concrete surrounded by a maze of metal tubes and conduits. Shadows danced as the light fluttered. This certainly was an odd place to put--\n\n***WHOOSH!***\n\nShe jumped back, stifling a scream as a jet of steam erupted from the pipe overhead. She chided herself at her own silliness. Deserted creepy location, dubious lighting, random startles from unexpected places, and ominous shadows. Now all that was missing was--\n\n\u0022Greetings, Comrade!\u0022\n\nDespite herself, Valentina yelped and spun around. The Political Officer was, without fail, cloaked in shadowy... shadows. \n\n\u0022Papers, please,\u0022 he grinned. \n\nShuffle, shuffle. How can he even *see* in this light? Or rather lack thereof?\n\n\u0022Yes, yes, good, good... my word, but you *are* putting on the kilos! You\u0027re going to lose your girlish figure.\u0022\n\nScowling, Valentina opened her mouth.\n\n\u0022Are you still sneaking into the cafeteria kitchen after hours to make cheeseburgers? How *do* you keep your cholesterol in check?\u0022\n\nValentina closed her mouth. \n\n\u0022Nevertheless,\u0022 he handed the docket back, \u0022everything is in order.\u0022 She tried to smile innocently. \n\n\u0022Now,\u0022 he grinned, \u0022what is a brave Kerbonaut like you doing in a dreadful place like this? And at such an hour, too.\u0022\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\n\u0022I... Er... Um...\u0022 She fumbled, \u0022was looking for the archives. To, ah... that satellite, there was an unusual discrepancy in the wiring...

She\u0027d already encountered one spider of *extremely* unusual size, its fangs must have been the size of her thumb! She looked down at the fang in her hand. Ok, maybe twice the size. She had wondered what the spider could *possibly* have been eating down here to grow so large, but then she\u0027d seen the rats. With a shrug, she tucked the spider-bit into her pocket. Maybe Lujorie could make a nice necklace out of it. She liked crafty things like that. If Valentina ever got out of here, that is. \n\nIt felt like she had been blundering about down here for hours. It had probably been less than one, truth be told, but creepy, shadowy places frequented by giant rats and enormous spiders tended to play with one\u0027s perceptions. And of course, no such place could be complete without that itch between her shoulder blades that told her she was being watched. \n\nShe hoped it was another spider. Fang craft usually works best when you at least have a pair. \n\nShe was just beginning to think *some*one was having a spot of fun at her expense, someone who would shortly be acquiring a spider fang in a tender place, when the corridor opened up into a large room. It was filled with row after row of shelves that seems to stretch on into the shadows forever. It would seem her search had only just begun. \n\nSighing, she stepped up to the closest shelf. A rusty sign on the end read, LAUNCH VEHICLES. At first this looked like a horrible place for an archive of paper documents, warm and damp. Then, she realized, this is the Ussari Union. This is the *perfect* place to keep documents... when you want them to go away. Down the first row, cones of light from fixtures high overhead spread somewhat-less-dim circles on the ground, that of course didn\u0027t *quite* reach the shelves themselves. \n\nFortunately, being a pilot, Valentina had a flashlight. \n\nShe clicked it on and examined the nearest shelf. Lines and more lines of boxes extended down its length to the far wall. This shelf read, *RETIRED*. *Shumno Kriket,* *Strannik.* The one above read, *CURRENT.* *KI-C, KI-3*, *Gora*. Above that, just at eye level, it was marked, *CONCEPTS*.\n\nWith another shrug, she pulled out a moldering box marked *N-1* and leafed through the papers inside. What an absolutely *silly* idea for a rocket! You couldn\u0027t *possibly* control fuel feed to that many engines with any shred of reliability. It was well that the Union had the good sense not to build it, it was the most ridiculous rocket idea she\u0027d ever seen. \n\nThen she looked in the box marked *SEA DRAGON*.\n\nWell, that was enough of that. She gazed to the shelf at the very top of the stack, a good 30 meters up. Smirking, she knew that whatever she needed, it would be on *that* shelf, up against the wall at the farthest end of the row, in the row that was most distant from where she was now, and in the opposite direction of which ever way she went. Cursing herself for being so genre savvy, and for not bringing a bit of spider to snack on, she picked a direction and started walking. \n\nThe very next row was labelled, *RADAR TRACKS.* \n\nThe eerie stillness was broken by the crack of Valentina\u0027s hand meeting her face. Ok, fine, but it was still going to be at the very t--\n\nThe bottom shelf was marked, *UNKNOWN CONTACTS.* \n\nAnother slap rang out in the darkness. Looking at the dates, she was at least right on one count. The most recent tracks would be at the back of the row. Next to the wall. The light overhead cast a dim, bisected circle on the that wall and floor, still not touching the shelves. She pulled out the farthest box, and started looking though it with her flashlight. A folder with *HIGH RESOLUTION COMPOSITES* caught her eye. Hmm, now this is interesting. Not what she needed, but...\n\nOn the paper, a grainy, monochrome image appeared to show an oblong box, not unlike a greatly oversized phone booth. \n\nTRACK DESIGNATION: TT-40-3  \n\nSIZE: 2.5M  \n\nDURATION: INDETERMINATE  \n\nCOURSE: TRACK DURATION INADEQUATE  \n\nANALYSIS: ASTEROID\n\nPages of nonsensical numbers followed. An oddly regular shape to be dismissed as an asteroid, she thought. She flipped to the next page. \n\nHere, the image showed a disc-like, slightly elliptic shape with a nub on one side. It rather reminded her of a cheeseburger with an olive on a toothpick stuck in it, which rather reminded her she was hungry. \n\nTRACK DESIGNATION: YT-1300  \n\nSIZE: 34.75M  \n\nDURATION: 11:38  \n\nCOURSE: HYPERBOLIC  \n\nANALYSIS: SPACE JUNK\n\nSpurred on by her grumbling stomach, Valentina flipped to the next page. \n\nThis one looked oddly familiar. Its most obvious feature looked to be a large dish. Smaller bits seemed to jut out from the main body, but the resolution was so bad she couldn\u0027t really tell. Another agency\u0027s space probe, perhaps?\n\nDESIGNATION: 1977-076A  \n\nSIZE: 3.7M  \n\nDURATION: 17:43:34  \n\nCOURSE: HYPERBOLIC  \n\nANALYSIS: COMET\n\nHmm. Comet. That didn\u0027t feel right. Neither, it occurred to Valentina, did the itch between her shoulder blades. Something had... shifted. Probably just another spider, she could handle that. The rats were smart enough to keep their distance. She shook the feeling away and flipped to the next page. Her eyes grew wide. \n\nThis. *This* is what she had seen! This radar image showed a string of huge spheres, dozens of them, together in a line. \n\nDESIGNATION: CLASSIFIED  \n\nSIZE: 403.2M  \n\nDURATION: 38:42:12, REPEATS  \n\nCOURSE: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E  \n\nANALYSIS: CLASSIFIED\n\nClassified. They *did* know. But... what could it *be?* The spheres certainly looked like propellant tanks, but there didn\u0027t appear to be any other structure to it. An orbital fuel depot, perhaps? That sounded logical, and quite... ordinary. Why go to such trouble to keep it a secret? It would be visible all over the world, something this big... Four hundred meters. Nearly half a kilometer. If not the KSA, then *who?* She shuffled the papers, and readjusted her flashlight. A thought, congratulating herself for her forethought in bringing one, had *just* started to form in her mind when the flashlight went dead. *P\u0426TI\u0419*. Batteries. She realized the *next* thing an instant before it happened, too. Every hair on her body tried to stand on end.\n\nShe spun around, and... there. Silhouetted in the shadow between two cones of light, a figure stood motionless. \n\n\u0022Oh, um, hello,\u0022 Valentina said nervously, \u0022are you the custodian, then?\u0022\n\nThe figure stood.\n\n\u0022Am I in your way? If so, I will be happy to move. I would not want to trouble you.\u0022\n\nThe figure stood.\n\n\u0022Do... do you speak Ussari?\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s breath caught, as it moved into the light. Wide, not-right eyes stared above lips pulled back into a slasher\u0027s smile. In its hand, something metal glinted. It stepped forward. \n\nSlowly drawing the spider\u0027s fang from her pocket, Valentina narrowed her eyes, \u0022you will not find me such easy prey.\u0022\n\nThe figure gave a high-pitched giggle that sent chills down her spine, then spoke in a strange accent she didn\u0027t recognize, \u0022on that, *mhysa*, I am counting.\u0022\n\nShe tensed, readying herself to parry the attack, when... a low, metallic *bong* rang out. The figure stiffened, its smile vanished, and its eyes tried very hard to look at each other as it toppled forwards. Standing behind, holding a length of steel pipe with an elbow on one end was--\n\n*\u0022Comrade Political Officer?!\u0022*\n\nInstead of his usual greeting, he dropped to one knee and flipped the would-be assailant over, setting down the pipe.\n\n\u0022Waters *drown* me, I did not think they would move so quickly!\u0022 He cursed as he started rifling through the other Kerb\u0027s clothing.\n\n\u0022Who? What is going on? Who is *he*?\u0022\n\n\u0022A Ceriman. We don\u0027t have much time.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ceriman?\u0022 Valentina shook her head, \u0022wait, where is *Vasily?* What have you *done* with him!?\u0022\n\n\u0022He is safe, if he is smart enough to keep his mouth shut, which I think he is. We need to go. There is a conspiracy--\u0022\n\n\u0022Conspira--,\u0022 she winced, \u0022against the Imperium?\u0022\n\n\u0022The *Imperium*,\u0022 the Political Officer spat, \u0022bunch of goat-faced fools strutting about proud as roosters in a barnyard. And twice as brainless.\u0022\n\nValentina clapped hands to her mouth, \u0022*Comrade!*\u0022\n\nHis hands never stopped searching the unconscious Kerb, \u0022this goes far, *far* beyond their foolery. Time is short, we must--*GAH!*\u0022\n\nHe toppled over backwards as the other Kerb rose, twisting the knife in his chest and smiling once more.\n\n\u0022NO!\u0022 Screamed Valentina. Something took her, and in an instant the pipe was in her hands and she swung it this way, swung it that way, swung it over her head, down on the attacker\u0027s, again... and again... and again... until he ceased moving and the impacts became spongy and yielding. Dark spatter stained the circle of light. \n\n\u0022No... no... Comrade...\u0022 the pipe clanged to the ground. She knelt by the Political Officer, blood flowing in regular waves from the wound.\n\n\u0022It... it is not bad,\u0022 she lied, \u0022I... will get help...\u0022\n\n\u0022No,\u0022 his hand caught hers with surprising strength, his other pressed an object into it, \u0022you are... great danger...\u0022\n\n\u0022Don\u0027t... try to talk... you will be...\u0022\n\nWords came in wet gurgles, sweat breaking out on his face, \u0022must... flee country...\u0022\n\n\u0022Comrade... no...\u0022\n\n\u0022Go to... Kerbin city,\u0022 his chest heaved and spasmed, \u0022find girl... trust... *no one*...\u0022\n\n\u0022I... I don\u0027t...\u0022\n\nEyes rolling in his head, his lips worked soundlessly. Choking gasps escaped his throat as he struggled once more to speak.\n\n\u0022G... g... glo-ry... to... Ars...\u0022\n\nHis face strained with effort.\n\n\u0022...totz...\u0022\n\nA final gasp, a last whisper.\n\n\u0022...tz...\u0022\n\nTears squeezed from his eyes, and his throat spasmed once more. Regret washed over his face, then... nothing.\n\n\u0022No... Comrade-- Comrade--\u0022 A particularly jagged knife twisted in Valentina\u0027s own heart. She never even knew his name. Lifeless, a limp hand slipped away from hers. \n\nShock, horror, guilt, shame... the tempest of emotion crashed into her. Breath came only in ragged, voiceless sobs. Despite this, a distant clatter drew her ear.\n\n\u0022Quiet, *p\u0027tahk*, something has gone wrong. We will take care of her, ourselves,\u0022 a voice hissed in that same unfamiliar, clipped accent. \n\nVoice now found Valentina\u0027s sobs. It became growls like rabid beast escaping past teeth bared in a snarl. A crimson shadow descended upon the world. Shoulders heaving, she stood, her hand gripping the steel pipe slicked with blood.\n\n*Oh yes. There \u003Cu\u003Ewill\u003C/u\u003E be blood.*\n\nShe took a step. \n\n***Tinka!***\n\nAnd froze. A voice, long dormant, whispered in her mind.\n\n*This blood has been shed for \u003Cu\u003Eyou\u003C/u\u003E... will it be in vain?*\n\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, driving tears from them, her teeth grating. Across her face, light and darkness played out in stark conflict. She raised her other trembling hand, to see the item in it, and nearly screamed again. \n\nIt was a bloodstained photograph of the Dead Girl that still haunted her nightmares. Turning it over, she found a name scribbled in Kerblish letters, which drifted in the fog just beyond memory. \n\nAnastasia Kerman.\n\n*...will it be in vain?*\n\n*...will it be?*\n\n*...will it?*\n\nSomething new now stirred. The M\u00FCnstone beneath her shirt, so long forgotten, seemed to burst into fire against her skin, and the crimson shadow fled.\n\n*No.*\n\n*NO.*\n\n*It would **not**.*\n\nReaching back to something from her youth, something else long dormant, Valentina set the pipe down without a sound, became one with the shadows, and disappeared into the night. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-21T05:26:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2016 05:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T17:08:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022G... g... glo-ry... to...
