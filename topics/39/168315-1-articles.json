The M\u00FCnlight turned the grasses and shrubs visible on Direc\u2019s Prairie silver and grey. The desk on one side of the room was covered in roughly a half dozen different paper models of lander designs. Under the models were dozens of designs and sketches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe walked around the drafting desk on the other side of the room. Aldald was focused on the sheet of paper secured to it. The drafting machine slid swiftly over the paper. The parts already drawn didn\u2019t match any of the models on the desk. The drafting machine knocked a set of french curves off the drafting desk. Direc caught it before it hit the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldald looked up as Direc placed the curves back on the drafting desk. Aldald took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank-you sir,\u201D he said. He leaned back in his chair and stretched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDesign number seven?\u201D Direc said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTwelve.\u201D Aldald gestured to the desk. \u201CThose are just the ones that made to modeling.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat removed them consideration?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAerodynamics mostly. On re-entry too much sticking out of the shadow of the heat shield, or too much drag on launch. It isn\u2019t too much of problem on launch. But on re-entry the parts outside the shadow will have a greater likelihood of burning off; cascade failure of the craft is likely to follow.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. I can understand how most pilots will find parts of their craft falling off a little bit worrisome.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldald snorted. \u201CUsually followed by the rest of their craft falling off of them.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou weren\u2019t able to adapt the Scimon-L for a kerbaled lander?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldald shook his head. \u201CI started there. But, once I added in the capsule and related support, it went into a mass spiral.\u0022 He rolled his shoulders. \u0022For all practical approaches\u00A0it\u0027s a linear programming problem. It\u2019s made\u00A0more interesting by the competing constraints of the heat shield shadow and surface stability.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CI\u2019ve probably got the best I\u2019m going to get. Launchers will have a ninety-five percent plus mass and the aero-section in the morning. Fab will have the design in the afternoon.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood, good.\u201D Direc moved to leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know,\u201D Aldald said. \u201CIf I could wrap this in some kind of shell it would be easier. At least for launching it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have no doubt. The folks at Parts Design are working on something. But, it won\u2019t be ready for a while.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldald shrugged and smirked. \u201CWell if it was easy it wouldn\u2019t be called rocket science.
