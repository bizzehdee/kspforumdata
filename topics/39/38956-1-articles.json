This would all too frequently lead to situations when a 10 ton satellite would sit on top of vehicle capable of lifting ten times as much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombine this with the combustion chamber lined with catalyst to make fuel-oxidizer mixture hypergolic, add a faulty valve and acceleration forcing fuel past turbopump and into combustion chamber and the rocket would soar right into solar orbit. Exactly this happened to their newest spy satellite KHrushka-1. It sat in an orbit just barely skimming the top of atmosphere at perikee and almost approaching Minimus at apokee. Krusskies were panicking at first, but after few days they concluded that within a month their failed satellite will either burn up or hit the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a prize on board of the doomed vessel \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 small electronic module containing their encryption software. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone from one of the unnamed intelligence offices came up with a daring plan. Send up a vessel to dock with Khrushka\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s resupply port while at apokee and therefore out of usable range of Krusskies radar, have an astronaut retrieve the module and change KHrushka\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s trajectory so it would completely disintegrate over Krussia, while the Murkian craft would take the long way home to avoid detection. If the commies fell for it, and didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t change their codes, Murkians would have access to all enemy communications. And even if they did change the codes, their encoder would be invaluable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKrusskies were not stupid though, they routinely monitored the whereabouts of Murkian space personnel and crafts. It was highly doubtful however, that they would care about a perpetually drunk and disgraced aglet salesman, so enter Kiran Kerman, the last man to orbit the Mun. Kiran had another advantage as well \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 he was old school and the only craft equipped with the old style docking port was even older \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a three man capsule used for the historic international rendezvous, currently residing in Kitsonian museum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple weeks later it sat wrapped in a radar absorbing shroud on top of KSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heaviest lifter, together with three other satellites serving as decoys. The capsule was gutted and retrofitted with supplies for the extended mission \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 at cost of capacity, as it would be a home for only one astronaut. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Two\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 We got ignition\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 One\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Lift-off. And that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s where the first failure happened. Some desk-jockey didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know his inclination from his heading. Another one didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t spot the mistake. Due to security there was no third and fourth desk jockeys to check the work of other two, so Kiran ended up in a completely wrong orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was no way he could continue with his mission, unless\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Kiran took a well-worn slide ruler and Orbital reference guide and after forty minutes of hard work he had a plan. He bounced a laconic text message off a deep space probe which he had to use for communications to avoid detection and carefully entered data into his flight computer. It would work. In theory. Maybe. If there was a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwartime reserve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in the tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen hours later the message arrived back on Kerbin after travelling for millions of miles it puzzled the controller. Orbit wrong. Fire the planner. Out of a cannon. I will get your thing, maybe even survive. Tell my wife I love her. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that time Kiran was soundly asleep waiting for his craft to approach the derelict. An hour before scheduled time, he went on EVA and removed the shroud. He considered jettisoning it, but in the end stowed it away in a specially prepared compartment. Everything was ready, and he could already see his target without instruments, so he headed back inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly after matching velocity he took time to assess the situation. KHrushka was hovering about hundred yards from his craft, and looking through a small viewport Kiran saw that the satellite suffered from a complete staging failure \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 its solar panels must have opened while in the atmosphere and now were trailing behind the craft like broken wings. The craft itself was venting atmosphere and fluids creating a comet-like tail of frozen crystals, resulting miniscule acceleration cauing it to tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it, it couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be KHrushka \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the craft was larger, more bulky. There were no docking ports he could see, and something deep in Kiran\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s unconscious mind told him \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cmilitary\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. He bounced another message to Mission Control, cursing the pathetically slow connection. He had to limit himself to roughly 160 characters, with every letter increasing transfer time in geometric proportion. Not our target. Docking unsuccessful. EVA to investigate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKiran prepared himself for EVA, cursing a long dead president, who after Krussian spacewalk, called tether cheating, and decreed a ban on using tethers in KSP. This was a bloody pattern with politicians. Krusskies had the best autopilots possible (so they could hold a glass in one hand and vodka bottle in other) while Murkian establishment considered any form of computerized control \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccheating\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Even the pathetic flight computers they allowed were frowned upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKiran approached the craft and stabilised it using his Personal Manoeuvring Unit. It was the easy part. Now it was time for hard work. He returned to his craft, which by the time drifted away, refilled his backpack fuel as the gauge was dangerously close to zero and opened the Good Book. He grimaced at his own blasphemy, but it was the only way to smuggle contraband onboard. Inside the hollowed out Kessnick \u0026amp; Kalliday was a 500 meter roll of aerospace tape, large army knife and a banana (don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even ask why they were banned, just don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t). He quickly fashioned a makeshift rope, attached it near the hatch and jumped to the other craft. He attached his tether to what he thought would be a suitable anchor point and flew back. He slowly pulled enemy craft closer doubling and then quadrupling his rope, as he knew that soon it would become brittle. Soon his catch was close enough, that he could connect his suit directly to his craft. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBloody Tennedy. Effin my pilots will fly only with basic parts and skill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, he muttered, when the connector slipped out of the socket for the tenth time. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJust admit that tethering is the way to go instead of making our life harder\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. He knew that the connectors were built this way on purpose, to provide oxygen and power without anchor to the craft, so commies couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t accuse KSP of cheating. In fact the development of the bloody things was twice as expensive as development of Mainsail engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe finally managed to secure the connection, and started carefully exploring his target. It was big. It had to be a new version, maybe KHrushka-2? It was completely different from Khrushka-1, so he had little idea where to start. He identified the main thruster block, fuel and RCS tanks, but he could not find any familiar structure on the large and almost featureless cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally he found quite large spring-loaded cover \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 he had been looking in a wrong place \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Most spy satellites had their primary optics fed by a mirror in one side, while this was more like a traditional telescope \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 with a circular opening on the front. Well, it made some sense, the optics could have larger diameter, and they could use gravity-gradient for attitude control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cover was jammed, probably because of the pieces of the fairing impacting it when the rocket suffered catastrophic staging failure. Kiran was prepared \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 mission planner supplied him with enough explosive to cut KHrushka in two, so he applied some to the stubborn cover, rotated the whole craft so it would point away from his ship and fired the explosive. He felt the loud thud vibrating through metal, and saw pieces of the cover flying away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he approached the explosion site, he saw that what he previously thought to be part of the craft was in fact hinged cover \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 now open like gigantic petals. He mused for a few seconds how thick the cover was, and how horribly expensive it must have been to send it to orbit, but then he saw the exposed structure. There was an access hatch, now clearly visible, but Kiran decided to investigate the lens first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was quite strange \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it looked more like a cupola from the X-Lab station, but with a huge hole through the centre. Then he noticed frozen condensation on the triangular windows, evaporating quickly now that it was exposed to the bright sunlight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not good\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he said to himself \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an internal coolant leak\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA coolant leak meant that most of the electronics would be already corroded. Kiran approached one of the windows, and pressed his faceplate against the window, trying to sneak a peek through misted glass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe wet himself when a face bumped into the window just inches from his eyes. For a moment Kiran thought the Krusskie was alive, as Kerbals could survive almost indefinitely if they had sunlight and water, but corpses ashen face left no doubt that it expired in a quite painful way some time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the window cleared Kiran saw that just before his death enemy cosmonaut attempted to break one of the reinforced panels on the narrow galley encircling the central shaft, succeeding only in marking the innermost layer. Kiran moved away from the window and towards the shaft, which was certainly large enough for him to move through, but red pictograms painted at intervals around the opening meant danger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoddamn commies had to use completely different pictograms \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 at one point \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Creverse krusskie arrow\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 on a turbopump inlet caused quite a lot of explosive problems for KSP. He tried to focus, and remember his training several years ago. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis would mean optical or visible, and this means radiation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he pondered \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CVisible radiation? Optical radiation? It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a bloody laser!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he exclaimed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2No wonder they sacrificed the crew.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKiran knew it was big. He returned to the craft, and swearing at the limits he bounced a message to Control. His computer would now send it several thousand times towards a Vagabond 2 probe just leaving the Kerbolar system, which in turn would bounce it towards Kerbin as part of its data stream. It would take several hours, so Kiran decided to go to sleep. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe felt too tired to remove his suit, only to put it back on when he awoke, so he decided to disobey the regulations (again) and removed only one of his gloves to attach heart rate electrodes. He knew he would soon overheat, so to keep the coolant circulating, he kept the tubes attached and his helmet closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe awoke to a sharp pain in his exposed hand \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it was swollen, and green liquid was seeping through his skin. There should\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been an alarm, but the craft was dark and silent, with only one tiny screen in the upper right corner of the instrument panel active. Kiran knew something really bad happened. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CDecompression!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 His own shout inside the helmet nearly deafened him. He frantically looked for his missing glove, spending precious minutes trying to force his swollen hand into now ill-fitting part. Finally he succeeded, but it cost him quite a lot of blood. Luckily the self-inflating cuff prevented the rest of the suit from depressurising, but it would leave a nasty bruise \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 still a small price to pay for one\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally he had time to look around. The craft was silent \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 no wonder in vacuum \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and dark, save for one screen, which should be displaying the status on secondary back up to the life support.

The only place where Kiran would find any significant amount of memory foam was the couch he was strapped to, so he quickly started ripping it to shreds with his knife. Throughout the foam there were pressurized containers, now seeping a red liquid. And detonators connected to a small box. He ripped the box out, but he knew that even a blasting cap could cause a disaster in over-pressurized capsule.

Kiran was well trained, so he knew how to reset the capsule, but there was a small problem of navigation. It seemed like the recorder which he used to recover didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t record the last burn. Kiran was old school enough not to giggle at the word sextant, and there was one built into the capsule, so he managed to get his position, not with a 100% accuracy but well enough to know what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe treacherous flight computer put his flight onto a steep re-entry patch which would ensure that debris burnt completely. The capsule might survive, but probably not intact. Kiran checked his status, it was far from nominal, but he had enough air and water left to survive. As to the fuel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Maybe a couple manoeuvres. He started planning, hindered by lack of paper and his slide rule, which was destined to burn high in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the on-board computer (although cautiously, as Kiran was extremely wary of it now) he managed to plot a course correction which would allow him to survive, and land somewhere in the unpopulated mountain region, quite near his cottage. Provided of course that It (Kiran started to think of the computer as of some malicious personality) didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mess up with parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t and the capsule landed in a bed of a dry stream mere thirty miles from his summer house. Kiran cut and buried the parachute and covered the capsule the best he could. He was sure that nobody traced him, as during his last EVA ever he wrapped his craft in the radar absorbing shroud, but someone would probably report the fireball in the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe knew that, with hunting and fishing seasons over, the region was nearly empty now. When he was here just a month ago with his wife, even the shop owner left for holiday in the tropical seas, leaving the honour system jar in place. Nevertheless Kiran travelled cautiously, avoiding roads and settlements. He came close to an empty house only once to steal clothes from a scarecrow, to replace his orange jumpsuit visible for miles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took him nearly a week to get home, and as he was nearer he started to have doubts \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it was a place they would definitely look for him. But he was so hungry and tired, he could not run forever. Not from everyone. Kiran crawled on top of a nearby hill, and watched for hours, before finally deciding to approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe nearly died when a pair of swallows darted from their nest over the door, but this \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and untouched spider nets on the door shown that nobody was in, so he entered. The doors were left unlocked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 as always in this area. You always left your main room and kitchen available for people in need. The only thing out of place was his wife\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s grandmother\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s witch figurine perched on a pedestal by the fireplace \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 he remembered knocking it on the floor last month, when he tried to bring all their bags in one go. He sent it to the best specialist in the country, but it would take half a year to repair \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 well maybe the old astronaut magic worked its charm again, to put him in front of the queue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKiran ran into the kitchen and stuffed himself full of baked beans, then went to sleep. In the morning he could not remember where they have hidden the keys to the rest of the house \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 last year they were under the large stone, so this year they should be in the tree stump? But the stump was empty, and Kiran remembered removing the keys from under the stone when they arrived and putting them into the hollowed stump when they left. Maybe it was his wife when she returned her beloved figurine. Anyway he would have to bathe in the stream, which wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t so bad. Later he would try to call Beth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBathing in the stream saved him from detection \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it was morning, and just as he left the house, he heard an approaching car. Kiran quickly ran to hide, looking for a position to observe his guest \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 his heart raced \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBeth!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was Beth, but she was with somebody \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 a man no doubt, but a reflection in the windshield prevented Kiran to see other man\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s face. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI know you think you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re a widow, but this is too soon honey.
