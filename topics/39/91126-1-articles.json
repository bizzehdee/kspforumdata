For one, Kerbals are highly intelligent, obviously. That means they probably have a comparatively large brain, which explains the very large head. The short stumpy body must certainly contain bone (or bone-like material) and muscle, as they move around and support their own weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that they have stumpy, slow bodies and are not at all concerned about the survival of their species might indicate that they have no natural predators. They must have evolved this way over a long period of time, so it makes sense to assume they may have never had any natural predators...in fact, they could be the top of a non-predatory food chain. We can guess that they aren\u0027t predators themselves, as violence and survival are not hard-coded into their DNA like Earth predators. This could help explain why they evolved the way they did, but without further evidence the following is a big guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best guess is that they are highly evolved hybrids somewhere between the Plant and Animal kingdoms. Being able to freely and safely evolve without interruption on their home planet, plant-like organisms began to move around in search of the best locations for photosynthesis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Simple plant-like creatures would first begin to develop muscle structure for movement. It would start out very simple, moving their stalks towards the sun.

This early form of intelligence was favored so highly, and reproduction happen so quickly, that these organisms began to resemble Earth-like animals in a short period of time. Though still relying on photosynthesis for nourishment, their movement and intelligence became more complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Soon, the ability to utilize natural materials for simple construction arose, and the organisms now had access to long-range transportation such as basic rafts. This trait, of course, was favored through reproduction and would eventually lead to a complex organism with limbs for manipulation of objects, fine motor skills, and an incredibly advanced nervous system with problem-solving and communication abilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--The Kerbals we see today are the result of this evolutionary path.
