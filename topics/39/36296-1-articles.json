I admit it took me quite a few minutes before I could assure myself that the creation was not simply an in-game screenshot. I am quite astonished of the fantastic use of colour throughout the entire picture. The stars very much show the need for discovery and science that the kerbal so desperately needs. I find the textures used upon the munner surface to be quite extrodanary, as the craters fit the surface in great detail. I do wish to see more amazing art like this in the future due to the extraordanary detail that must have taken so much effort to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T08:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.
