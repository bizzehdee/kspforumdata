Video game enthusiast Carlos booted up his top of the line gaming PC. It was the most exciting day he had in a while: the release date of Kerbal Space Program 1.0. He had played the game tons at his friends house for the past few years while it was in beta and fell in love with it. It became one of his favourite Steam early access games although he didn\u0027t even own it himself. Eager to play the fully finished version, so when he waited until midnight so tat he could play the new version as soon as possible, he . Once the game finished downloading, Carlos finished it off through the installation and launched the game. As soon as he pressed enter on his keyboard to start the game, Carlos was filled with shock at the sight of the message before him. Sitting in his dusty, unkept apartment, he leaned closer towards the screen. The screen read...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCONGRATULATIONS! YOU\u0027LL BE ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE OUR REAL LIFE KERBAL CREATION PROCESS... IN PERSON. OUR PLANS MUST COME TO FRUITION. TO CREATE AN EARTH OF KERBALS AND MAKE THE KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM A REALITY. ENJOY, THIS WON\u0027T HAPPEN TO THE PUBLIC FOR QUITE A WHILE.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDumbfounded, scared, but slightly suspicious, Carlos was about to close the message when a blinding flash of green light enveloped the room, temporarily blinding him. Firstly, his hair recolored to jet black, and recut into a simple only on top hairstyle, meanwhile his skin becoming a slimy shade of green. The majority of Carlos\u0027s facial anatomy disappeared until only his eyes and mouth were left, the eyeballs enlarging and gaining completely black pupils. His mouth became more suited to his new race. Carlos looked down to see his body had shrunk dramatically, his legs and arms feeling like stubs holding up his small torso. His body\u0027s feeling reorganised to fit, his body now feeling more like putty than skin. Carlos\u0027s hands and feet shrunk, as the most painful part arrived. His entire organ system and skeleton mixed and twisted, making all sorts of gross sounds, until it was completely that of a Kerbal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCarlos finally noticed his rectangular head shape forming, as he realised the end of his life was near. Thinking about his life, friends and family, he let the final changes occur to him. Soon, he was unable to think properly, and had a literal minus IQ. He could only speak in the Kerbal\u0027s own language too, and had completely forgotten ever being a human. Soon, he would be a she.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022vkfbvcklebrg;fbduicfdglfeovcdveospa\u0022 Valentina beamed, heading out to the location of KSP\u0027s secret base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-09T22:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome posts have been removed from this thread.
