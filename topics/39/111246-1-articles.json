Both are simple to use. Just be aware that you will record a lot of overhead and will need quite the amount of hard drive space. I am using [Audacity](http://web.audacityteam.org/)to record voiceover, which I maily do after editing.\n\n3) Regarding mic ... it depends on what level of quality you want to achieve. I have bought an Audio Technica AT2020 USB after my first videos using my cheap headset mic were unbearable (for me). Be aware that you will probably need to clean the audio anyway if you want it to sound good (which is why I use Audacity). \n\nHappy video-ing ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"impwarhamer","CreatedById":80499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:52:45Z","Content":"One of the most important things when making youtube videos is audio quality.

Since nVidia ShadowPlay doesn\u0027t seem to work (a pity, could use the GPU optimizations), I use MSI Afterburner. It does have push to talk mic recording you can use for real time narratives. Also, it\u0027s free: [http://gaming.msi.com/features/afterburner](http://gaming.msi.com/features/afterburner)\n- I use Windows Live Movie Maker. I am proficient with professional video editing software but WLMM is simple, quick and provides enough options for simple snipping, speeding up and adding simple transitions. Due to CPU bottleneck on my laptop I often use 1.5x to 4x speedup depending on part count, to approximate the expected real visual speed of the craft. The type of video editing software you use, I\u0027d say would depend on what kind of features you need. I just want simple craft showcases so WLMM is more than adequate, really.\n- Suggest to do a test recording on your laptop and see if real time narration is okay. For my case due to framerate issues at 1080p, I would add narration in post processing if I wanted to narrate anything (currently, I don\u0027t). Otherwise ingame narration \u002B4x speedup = chipmunk.\n- Custom captions, image overlays, etc is where pro editing software has the edge over WLMM, as you could do much more than just text captions.\n- I don\u0027t provide narrations as I would bore people to death or sound like a robot (when I\u0027m not yelling like a drill sergeant:D ) so I will leave others to provide recommendations if standard laptop mics are adequate. I would recommend maybe a quality headset if I\u0027m feeling impulsive. It\u0027s usually better than the default built-in mic but you never know - do a test first and see how much, if any needs to be improved in terms of audio quality.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T14:04:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"One-Way Films","CreatedById":90926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T14:28:58Z","Content":"I used Fraps for a long while, but it\u0027s impact on performance made me change from it to Mirillis Action. It exports to MP4 after a bit of tweaking which is a massive advantage over Fraps. I invested in a mic by the name of the Blue Snowball. It\u0027s popular among Youtubers as it\u0027s durable and comes with a small tripod. I would recommend spending a large portion of your budget on an editing software. It\u0027s sooo worth it! I got Adobe Premiere Elements 13 for roughly \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC80 which is flippin\u0027 amazing for an editor of it\u0027s quality.

It can be a wee bit finicky, but I haven\u0027t had any *major* issues with it. You just have to change one line in the files to make KSP use fullscreen instead of borderless window mode. The GPU optimizations are great, and allow me to record more CPU intensive situations. (such as the beasty in my sig). The biggest issue was that under heavy load it would occasionally stutter, but this can be removed with post-editing fairly easily, allowing smooth video."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:25:33Z","Content":"OBS is the best recording software I have found. 100% free too.

The recorded files are huge though. Expect a few GB per minute. You could alternatively use OBS (Open broadcaster software) ( [https://obsproject.com/](https://obsproject.com/) ), which mot people use for streaming to twitch. It is free and also has a local recording option, and you could have live commentary recorded along right away. It\u0027s a bit tricky to set up for local recording though, if you want the best possible result, but there are enough tutorials for that on YouTube, so you should be fine.\n\nAs for audio: Your webcam mic is probably - to put it friendly - not good audio quality. You could try to record with it (Use Audacity, a free audio recording program for trying it out: [http://web.audacityteam.org/](http://web.audacityteam.org/) , also you can easily make a lower quality audio less crackly and remove background noise with it, if you record your audio separately.)\n\nNow, I myself use a large diaphragm studio mic. Those are really high quality, but expensive, and definitely not a requirement for a starter. If your webcam mic really sucks, you can use a headset instead. Those usually have at least half way decent mics in the middle price range. My headset for instance (Sharkoon GSone, ~45\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC) has a pretty OK mic. Really, most headset mics would be OK for a starter.\n\nOh yeah, and for editing I use Corel Video Studio x7. Not a very popular one, since most people use Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas, but I gotta say I haven\u0027t had any problems with Corel, and I hear people complain about Vegas crashing all the time, so yeah. It\u0027s also a lot cheaper than either vegas or premiere. As for free stuff: I really don\u0027t think that Windows Movie Maker is good, and I don\u0027t know of any other free ones, so that\u0027s that. Decent editing programs have a price.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T17:19:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WWEdeadman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T19:26:39Z","Content":"Why not ask the experts in the player-made-video sub?

You can record a commentary live if you want (but I\u0027ve not tried that yet)\n\n3) That depends on how good your webcam mic is and how good you want the sound quality to be. An independent microphone would almost certainly give better sound quality. I\u0027ll probably just use the webcam mic if I decide to do any commentaries.\n\nYou can add text, change the speed, and add a post-commentary in Windows Movie Maker. You would need a seperate program to record the commentary itself, but you should have a simple sound recorder installed by default. (I\u0027ve not done any of that in my actual videos yet though)\n\nYou can also add annotations in YouTube itself after uploading. It\u0027s fairly intuitive, although not the easiest feature to find. You can see examples of what I mean in my 0.7.3 challenge video (link to channel in sig)\n\n**Question:** My videos have a low resolution. Is that simply because I\u0027ve set the recording resolution too low or does YouTube also need me to upload in a particular format or something like that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T01:32:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheMoonRover**"}]}
