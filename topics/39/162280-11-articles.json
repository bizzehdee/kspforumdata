I do not know how much assistance I might be of, as I am not entirelYYYy sure how I came to be here, or even where \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurdous watched the slowly flickering green light, with an expression on his face that seemed entirely, well, alien for him, \u201Cwhat\u2019s the last thing you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0remember?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m not entirely sure of thaAAAt, either.

Would you like me to play it?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUm, yes, do that.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe voice shifted pitch, \u201Chelp me, Odie-one Kernobi, you\u2019re my only hope.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThree pairs of eyes stared at each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CExcuse me, disregard,\u201D the voice said, \u201Cthere are apparently lingering extemporaneous data bits in my memory cache. \u003Cem\u003EThis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is the mesSsage:\u201D It shifted once more, again becoming like \u003Cem\u003Ehers\u003C/em\u003E, but hers as if trying to imitate someone \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CValentina, you...\u201D \u003Cem\u003Eshe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0boomed, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Eyou must see Kommissar\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEyes shot back to her, \u201CI... do not know any Kommissar...\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurdous scratched at his chin, \u201Cwho do you think that means? That could be any one of dozens, \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of people! Not exactly the most approachable lot, either.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas, too, scratched at his chin, staring very hard at nothing in particular. Wheels began to turn in his head.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThat is the extent of the message,\u201D the box said, \u201CI regret that I am unable to provide further assistance. I understand if the situation will preclude any further repairs of my system.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CUm, no, that\u2019s all right,\u201D Burdous paused for another fit of coughing, \u201Cthis mess seems enough to keep you running, I\u2019ll, um... I\u2019ll see what else I can bodge together, I think I can get a few more subroutines online in a couple of days.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI appreciate that, BuUurdous, but since I am unable to assist you in any meaningful way, it would be best if I were powered down.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe looked at the box, \u201Cwhat? Why?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CMy internal diagnostic keeps searching for sensors and systems which are not there, and flooding my buffers with errors. I really do not think I can sufficiently convey to you how unpleasant this is, I... feel... rather like a braAain in a jar. If it\u2019s all the same to you, I would prefer to simply be switched off.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CEr... are you sure about that? I\u2019m... not entirely sure \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0could bring you back online again.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI am sure. I would rather risk that than my own, admittedly fraaAAagile, sanity.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurdous stared at the box for a long time, that same unfamiliar, alien look on his face, \u201Cwell, if you say so,\u201D he rose, and moved toward a switch on the wall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CI do. Thank you for your assistance, Burdous. I would suggest you see a technician of your own, despite my degraded hearing, I estimate a 62.3% chance that cough is working towards pneumonia. It was good to hear you again, Captain. I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0see you on the other sSSide.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBurdous, now looking rather \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0ill, threw the switch. There was a \u003Cem\u003Eclunk\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and a stilling of the air, and the green light flickered and died.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CWhoah,\u201D he said softly. He returned to his seat and slumped down again, looking drained, \u201Cbut we\u2019re still back where we were. I\u2019ve done all I can,\u201D he looked to Edgas, spreading his hands, \u201Cwhat do we do now?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen no answer came, he stretched out a foot and kicked Edgas, \u201Chey! Kerbin to Edgas! What now, fearless leader?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdgas jolted upright, the final wheel in his head clicking into place.

It grew stronger, gradually at first, but rising in pitch and intensity; a slow\uFEFF, shrill\uFEFF spool from \u0027piercing\u0027 to \u0027obnoxious\u0027 to \u0027painful\u0027 to \u0027\u003Cem\u003Efor the lov\uFEFFe of all that\u0027s decent please make it \u003Cstrong\u003Estop!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u0027\u00A0before \uFEFFfinally settlin\uFEFFg in to a nearly ultrasonic whine.\uFEFF\uFEFF\uFEFF\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe pressed the earcups to her ears, vaguely aware that she was talking, yet even that did nothing to stem the aural assault that was, somehow, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0familiar. Ahead of her, Edgas gestured at his own headset, and she fumbled around and eventually found the switch. In an instant, the unbearable din died away to a tortuous buzz.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CActive noise cancelling,\u201D Edgas crackled in her ear, \u201Cit\u2019ll still leave you with a nasty headache tomorrow but it really cuts down on the permanent hearing loss.

They won\u2019t sell complete hulks to foreigners but you can get parts for a song.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nGiven his proficiency with the Ussari language, she wondered if perhaps they\u2019d simply \u003Cem\u003Egiven\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Edgas whatever he wanted just to get him to \u003Cem\u003Estop\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0singing. Whoever... \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0were...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nColors and shapes swirled in yet another memory just out of reach, and she shook her head. The ungainly craft, too, shuddered, as Edgas nudged the throttles ahead. It moved ponderously, swaying back and forth over unseen lumps in the snow and ice below, slowly turning around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe nudged them again, speed beginning to increase. Soon they were past the base perimeter, and Edgas poured the power on. Raw acceleration shoved her back in her seat, the swaying abating to a dreamy, floating smoothness. She noted with a frown that Edgas never looked back once they\u2019d started moving. She tried craning her neck back to see herself, but everything behind was lost in a roostertail of swirling snow.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so they proceeded, heading south, since there was no other way to go. She tried watching the speed gauge for a while but quickly gave up, something in her mind kept trying to calculate what would happen if they hit a bump of any size at such speed, and her stomach reacted accordingly. There was not much point in conversation, either, not even the headsets could drown out the sound of the two engines at full power, so instead she watched the sun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe kept expecting it to rise or set, to do \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E, but it only sat there, fat and bloated on the horizon like a watchful eye. Some part of her mind was distantly aware that Edgas was riding the terminator, the edge between the darkness and the light, drawing out his world of endless twilight. Even if she closed her eyes and concentrated, \u003Cem\u003Elistened\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0she couldn\u2019t quite tell it was deliberate or not.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hours of unchanging scenery stretched on, lulling her into a dream-like trance. Sometimes she slept, sometimes she was awake, but never entirely aware of which as they rocketed away from the small, forgotten station at the north pole. At some point, clouds began to appear on the horizon ahead, first in ones and twos, then longer streaks. Soon she saw undulating cirrus clouds that appeared to stretch northward like skeletal fingers, and looked away, an uncomfortable feeling digging in between her shoulder blades. She thought of mentioning this to Edgas, but she could already tell without speaking to him that he was far \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0aware.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe disturbing sight above eventually gave way to low, gray, scudding clouds, but at least they hid the glowering sun. The landscape, too, shifted, and Edgas had to slow as they loped over undulating tundra, leaving the land of eternal winter behind. Not that this place was much better. Here and there, rocks or brown grass poked out of the drifting snow, leading off to towering mountains in the distance while they threaded a wide pass. Passing over one rise, she just caught sight of a vast herd of great hairy beasts huddled against the cold.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce past the mountains, the first settlements began to appear. Clusters of sparse, squat hovels that bore an uncanny resemblance to the creatures she\u2019d just seen, clad as they were in the animal\u2019s hides. Here, withered shrubs poked up amongst the grass, looking dead as their absent leaves awaited the next fleeting summer. These slowly grew taller, heralding the first stunted trees as they drew ever southward. Edgas slowed more, and she began to sense an odd, \u003Cem\u003Eunexpected\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0apprehension from him.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStunted trees then became a towering, white-capped forest, their boughs drooping down under the weight of the snow. It became clear they were heading down some kind of cut path, as settlements became villages with proper stone buildings and smoke-trailing chimneys. Finally, she asked Edgas what was bothering him so, the piercing\u00A0wail of the engines now down to a dull roar.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s early to see this much snow on the ground,\u201D he explained, as he weaved around a yak-drawn cart that didn\u2019t seem to notice the strange craft shrieking by at all, \u201Cwe\u2019re a solid three, four hundred kilometers further south than I thought we\u2019d get with the Skeeter. It\u2019s saving us tons of time, but still...\u201D they both watched as a small farm slipped past, its crop crushed under the snow, \u201Cthis doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey continued down snow-lined trails a while longer, but eventually even that thinned and waned. Edgas pulled into a nondescript hamlet, the Skeeter\u2019s skis now grinding on wide patches of bare gravel. It looked the same as any of the others, though he seemed familiar with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHe unloaded their one bag, warned her to keep a careful eye on it, then had a very animated conversation with a kerb in a tall \u003Cem\u003Eushanka\u003C/em\u003E, speaking an incredibly mushy, slurred dialect she could barely understand. Money changed hands, in which direction she wasn\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Eentirely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sure of, and the fellow gave them a ride to the train station in an ox-cart.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd now... the \u003Cem\u003Eruse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0began. Edgas was shy on details, yet the apprehension she had sensed before was replaced with an odd sort of... alert boredom over the whole thing. They were now traveling under assumed names, she wore a traditional \u003Cem\u003Ebabushka\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0under her sweatshirt hood, and he a very impressive but \u003Cem\u003Efake\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0mustache, as someone named Buford T. Kerman (and sister). He booked them a private compartment on the wheezy old smoke-belching train, and as she settled onto the lumpy, threadbare bench just next to him, it finally occurred to her just how \u003Cem\u003Etired\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she was.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe train pulled out of the station with agonizing slowness, banging and groaning as if it were ready to fall apart. The peeling paint, the cracked window, the... \u003Cem\u003Eunusual\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0smell of the small room... it all had a maddening familiarity she couldn\u2019t quite place. They spoke little as the train chugged its way up to speed. The dark and gloomy landscape outside didn\u2019t offer much to see, but she stared out into it anyway, for lack of anything else to stare at. This, too, pulled at memories that vanished like faint stars as soon as she looked at them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EClick-clack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClick-clack.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer eyelids grew heavy as the room swayed back and forth in that odd way of old trains.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EClick-clack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClick-clack.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe also began to realize how very \u003Cem\u003Ehungry\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she was. How long had they been cooped up in that strange, noisy contraption? She had no idea. But the way her stomach was growling, it suddenly felt like days. A thought wandered through her mind that she should mention this to Edgas, this thing must have a dining car somewhere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EClick-clack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nClick-clack.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, a nice hot meal sounded quite... nice... about... now...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003EClick-clack.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EClick-clack.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EClick-clack.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n--------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer eyes popped open with a start, yet she remained frozen in the unfamiliar place, some long-forgotten instinct seizing hold of her. The feel of grit in her teeth and alkali in her throat goaded at her, yet she remained still, staring out the window at the darkness. Alarm eventually began to fade, and she cast her eyes around the small space; the peeling paint, the cracked glass, the gentle swaying and muted\u003Cem\u003E click-clack...\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe hidden sun must have set already, how long had she been asleep? Beyond the window, it was so dark she thought she might as well drifting in space again. She \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she had been, but couldn\u2019t remember it. The fog of her memory swirled, blank as the darkness outside.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen her vision \u003Cem\u003Eshift\u003C/em\u003Eed, the soft light from beyond the compartment door just enough to cast the room in reflection on the window. Her cheeks flushed a bit as she realized she was propped up against Edgas, her head sort of leaning back on his shoulder. His own head was lolling back against the wall behind the bench, rocking just slightly with the gentle swaying of the car, the shadow of a smile on his face.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor... just an instant, she considered moving, but realized it might rouse him, and even in sleep he looked as exhausted as she still felt. Instead she... reached out, feeling toward that little bundle of emotion in the back of her mind that somehow connected them...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n...and snapped her mind back, feeling the color rise on her cheeks a bit more. No... no, his dreams were his own, she had no right to... well, peek. But the bare snippet she \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0felt\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E...say dummy again...\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRage... indignation... such crushing \u003Cem\u003Esadness\u003C/em\u003E... why would such a dream bring a \u003Cem\u003Esmile\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to his face?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYet as her own fatigue swelled once again, she decided it all mysteries for another time. The gentle rocking of the train seemed to pull her eyelids lower once more, so she settled down against his shoulder, laid her head back, and let them close, the shadow of a smile on her own face as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n--------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEarly the next morning, they pulled in to a town not unlike the last, where they changed trains and headed in a different direction. So it continued, for how long she wasn\u2019t quite sure. They kept to themselves, and mostly their cabin, eating when they needed to and sleeping restless sleeps at night.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomething about the whole arrangement concerned her, but why, she could not say. Occasionally, there would be... questions. This, at least, struck her as familiar, and \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0concerning, but each time, Edgas would say soft words and money would change hands, and the questions would be left unanswered. This, too, struck her as both familiar and concerning.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey zig-zagged southward, the landscape slowly changing as they did. Sparse forests of pine and spruce, here and there laced with snow and lichen, gave way to denser woods of hemlock and cedar, where furry things with beady eyes stared down at them as they chugged past. Eventually, the conifer stands became groves of maples and birch and elms, resplendent in their verdant summer livery with no hint of fall color, yet still often heavy with snow. This, too... concerned her. The skies, at least, never changed, the same low, mournful clouds following them all along their journey.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt last they came to something that could finally be called a city, if a dilapidated and crumbling one. Faded murals and posters called down from the sides of stark buildings, and an all \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0familiar brown haze added its own shade to the clouds overhead. They didn\u2019t dally long, here, trading the private train compartment for a public subway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey rattled along inside, heads down, hoods up, saying nothing. The other passengers paid them no mind, regardless. These stared at the walls, or at the floor, or at more of those silly glass-like phones ever in their hands. After an hour or so, they started passing sidings and parallel tracks in a warren of tunnels. Occasionally, another train would roar past, pulling the air from her lungs as the dim overhead lights flickered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe could soon sense an entirely \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0kind of apprehension coming from Edgas. It wasn\u2019t... fear, not exactly. More like... resignation, that he would soon have to endure something extremely unpleasant. Considering everything she knew he\u2019d \u003Cem\u003Ealready\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0been through, what could possibly\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHer head snapped up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe stared off through the grubby window just opposite their seat. Had... had she really just seen that? She watched a while longer, then shook her head. No, that was just silly. She \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0how subways worked, even if she couldn\u2019t remember ever riding one before this. Nothing could \u003Cem\u003Epossibly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0go that fast down\u2014\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhoosh.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe saw it again. A bare flash off on a side track. She was just opening her mouth to ask Edgas about it, when a squeal of steel on steel and lurch announced that they had, at long last, \u003Cem\u003Earrived\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nShe kept one eye on that far window, even as they deboarded the car... and entered a choking mass of bustling people. The acrid stink of rattail smoke hung thick in the air, along with that ubiquitous subway malaise of generations who couldn\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0make it to the Little Kerb\u2019s room in time... or perhaps hadn\u2019t even bothered. Panic surged as she thought she might be swept away by the tide, until Edgas seized her hand and pulled her along behind him, drawing a flush to her cheeks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurrounded as she was by babbling voices, it took her more than a moment to realize not a one of them was actually speaking to another. Everyone was either talking or tapping on one of those... those... those \u003Cem\u003Ethings\u003C/em\u003E, pressed to their ear or held before their mouth as if ready to take a nice big bite. But... some of them appeared to be just talking to... \u003Cem\u003Ethemselves\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey forded through the stream of bodies for a long time before Edgas finally led her to an upper level mezzanine, still well below ground, where the flood ebbed to a relative trickle. Here, a wide thoroughfare was flanked on both sides by a dizzying array of shops and vendors hawking every kind of thing imaginable. This struck her as... \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0unusual, but why, she could not say.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout this time, she realized she was still holding Edgas\u2019s hand, and quickly pulled her own away, looking off the other direction as casually as she could.

She pulled the sweatshirt a little tighter. She and Edgas were now on an incredibly broad boulevard, lined at the edges with trees bespeckled in stunted leaves despite the old-looking piles of snow in the shadows of the surrounding buildings. Down the center median were towering, larger-than-life bronze statues caked with the opinions of generations of local pigeons, who had never been very impressed.

An imposing figure with a triumphant smile, clad in a space suit, a hand raised and one massive finger pointing off towards... something. She stared at it for a long time, only dimly award that Edgas had paused too, and was now looking at her with concern. The darkness and the light flashed back and forth inside in her mind, an image trying desperately to \u003Cem\u003Ecome forward\u003C/em\u003E, and with it a torrent of feelings she somehow knew would scour her away. Yet, just as it looked about to resolve into clarity, it faded, leaving only a lingering name on her lips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CS...

Caution: vehicle exiting.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore her eyes, flashing lights on long poles appeared to rise out of the street just beyond the sidewalk. A moment later the roadway itself split open, two sections rotating out and down. From the abyss they revealed, a kar now appeared, rising from the depths like some mythical hero. Her jaw fell open as it drove away silently, as quickly as it had appeared.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow \u003Cem\u003Eshe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pointed, her mouth and brain each trying so hard to overrule the other that nothing came out but a series of random, disjointed syllables.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas, of course, was unvexed, \u201Ccame up from the Loop underground.

She glanced back at the statue, followed its finger to the skyline on the far side. She couldn\u2019t say why, but something seemed to be... missing. Then her vision dropped, and she saw \u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0they were heading.

She actually found herself trying to hide behind Edgas, and a frustrated flush on her cheeks because of it despite the chill in the air and in her blood. And yet, Edgas... had no fear at all. She felt nothing of the sort from him, not even a \u003Cem\u003Eprecursor\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of fear. In that moment she thought he must be the bravest kerb in all the world. Or perhaps the stupidest. No, all she felt was more of that odd sense of... resignation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Edgas spoke, slowly and deliberately, \u201Call right.

Edmund\u2019s murder was a blow to us all, the entire community, but no one was prepared for Chadvey\u2019s tragic loss in that capsule.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked at her, brow wrinkling, then back to Edgas.

The edges of her mouth flicked up, then turned down, then seemed unaware of what else to do with themselves while a dozen different emotions flowed across her face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, she managed, \u201Cw... what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd Edmund wasn\u2019t murdered by a vagrant,\u201D Edgas bit back bile in his throat, \u201C\u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0killed him.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen...

Whatever was left of Edmund in there, believe me, you did him a mercy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella\u2019s eyes flicked back and forth between the two of them, her mouth hanging open.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas managed a weak smile, and Valentina returned it, before her eyes began darting around the room, as if seeing it for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait... wait, where are all the banners, anyway?\u201D she stood, looking over the door, \u201Cwhere... where are the compulsory pictures of the Imperium?
