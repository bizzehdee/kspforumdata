We were in the thick of it back then, with old fighters and bombers going out every day to the Kerbaic Ocean to fight the enemy, and we knew that the struggle wouldn\u0027t be over for a few more years. So, my choice was simple: either fight in the war, or tolerate \u0022Loose Lips Sink Ships\u0022 posters for the rest of our time fighting. And so, I found myself walking to the airfield, with my medical information in hand, ready to stick it to The Man overseas.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was I thinking? I had only ever been in an airplane once before, and it was parked on the tarmac for the little kids to see at the Kerbspoke Air Show during the Depression. I had only ever seen an airplane fly a few times before, and now here I was, ready to put my life in the hands of someone who knew nothing about flying-\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emy\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehands.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMy\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eignorance of flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe general was happy for the new recruit- but, darn it, he was a general, and he had to be tough. \u0022Sunny,\u0022 he grunted, \u0022you\u0027ve got basic training for three months, and then you ship out to Kambodia. You\u0027re in barracks 12; you\u0027ll find your uniform on your bunk.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022THAT\u0027S YES, SIR!\u0022 he bellowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022YES, SIR!\u0022 I replied, and saluted. Then I spun around on my heels, and marched to my barracks. I was already getting the hang of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went up in an old crop-duster for the first time the next day. My instructor showed me how to start the engine, move the rudder pedals to taxi out to the runway, and then he performed the takeoff with his own set of controls in his seat. Then, once we were at altitude, he said, \u0022Turn onto a southern heading.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI contemplated the stick and the rudder pedals, and deftly stepped on the latter. The plane lurched sickeningly as we jolted broadside to the slipstream. \u0022Sunny Kerman, what do you think you\u0027re doing?\u0022 The instructor arrested our sideslip and rolled the plane onto its side before pitching up. \u0022When you\u0027re in an airplane, you don\u0027t turn, you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebank.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest of the three months processed like that, with me graduating to bigger and bigger craft, until finally I was at the controls of a Knat-27 bomber, practicing touch-and-go on the old dusty runway. After one of our landings, I pulled back on the stick and only a few seconds later, I felt a vibration shudder through the entire aircraft. \u0022Engines two, three, and four are down,\u0022 the engineer said. \u0022I think we\u0027ve hit some birds.\u0022 Without even thinking, she feathered the engines and I turned around and landed back at the base. Thus I had handled the first in-flight emergency of my long career. Next time, however, there would be dozens of passengers counting on me to get them down to a runway intact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI climbed out of the bomber, and then the general delivered some bad news. \u0022Sunny- you\u0027re not shipping out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 I cried.\u00A0I couldn\u0027t think of what I\u0027d done wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Apparently the scientists down in Las Kruces, or Kalamagordo, or some place in some desert were working on a super-bomb. The war in the Kerbaic is over.\u0022 I was stunned. I had spent three months preparing to fly, wanting to fly, and I \u003Ci\u003Ewould fly.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sir,\u0022 I said, \u0022I\u0027m in the top of my class. Talent like this doesn\u0027t come along often. What can I do now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe thought for a minute. \u0022Well...\u0022 he muttered, \u0022wherever kerbals go, destruction will follow. There will be another war soon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was ignorant and naive, and I didn\u0027t think there would be another war for a long time. Later, when I was older and wiser, I knew that the wars would never end. But I was still young and stupid, and back then, there was one mother and one father and one son and one daughter in every family, plus a dog, and people drank alcohol from glasses that could hold a lot more bourbon and ice than they put in, and there wasn\u0027t any security at the airports, and people were too busy smiling and generally eating the spam-in-a-can that suburbia\u00A0served then to fight in another war. So I said, \u0022I don\u0027t really want to wait around for that, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, then that reduces your options. You know some people are starting to use the airplane to get from one place to another? You know, like a train.\u0022 I said I did know. \u0022In that case, I heard Trans-Pan Airlines is looking for pilots. Go there, Sunny, and you\u0027ll be a rich kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so I left Kerbspoke Air Force Base, and I went to Kerbspoke Airport, and I said, \u0022Gimme a job. I\u0027ll fly for fifty years.\u0022 And in the end, it was actually sixty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-31T01:26:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2017 01:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Confused Scientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamnavoePer","CreatedById":160271,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-29T21:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis already has Potensial.

It was based off of a modified Knat-47 airframe, and it had the distinctive dual-propeller and tail-dragger characteristics of that bomber. The OW-1 was so large that those of us who had gotten into the new industry of flight called it the COW-1 because of its sheer mass; we joked that it \u0022flew like a cow.\u0022 It could hold thirty kerbals on a journey about a quarter of the way across the country.\u00A0It was about half the size of a modern short-range airliner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of all of my training on the Knat-47, I started flying the COW right away, in the left-hand seat. On my first flight, I stood by the cockpit door as the passengers got in through the rear hatch and climbed uphill to their seats. They were dressed in suits and dresses, and each carried one suitcase. Every single one was smiling, looking forward to when they would become the lucky one percent and take to the skies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please fasten your seatbelt when you sit down,\u0022 I said, noticing how most of the passengers just peered quizzically at their safety belt, \u0022and please do not smoke on this aircraft.\u0022 A chorus of moans chased me back into the cockpit as I sat down and began to start the engines. \u0022What in kraken\u0027s name is that!\u0022 one ignorant passenger yelled as the propellers began turning. \u0022Trans-Pan flight 0003, please taxi to runway 043, northeast facing,\u0022 the controller called. My copilot replied, \u0022Roger, northeast on runway 043,\u0022 as the engineer checked the hydraulic pressure on the flaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI turned and started the long, five-minute taxi to the other side of the airfield where the appropriate runway was. We had to wait for a minute as a crop-duster landed on a runway we needed to cross, and then we joined a long line for Runway 043, the only one that could handle the COW. We were fifth in line, but there were also three planes on approach to the runway. Nearly ten minutes later, we were second in line, but the passengers were getting restless. \u0022Why are you just sitting here?\u0022 one lady yelled through the door. \u0022We paid two months\u0027 salary for this!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ma\u0027am, return to your seat,\u0022 I heard the steward say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lady cursed. \u0022You don\u0027t have to sit down on the bus. Why do you have to sit down here? And I want to smoke! Why can\u0027t I smoke?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you don\u0027t return to your seat we will not be able to take off and you will be removed from the airplane.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat kerbal\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewas\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eremoved from the airplane, swearing and threatening to sue as she was dragged out the door. That delayed our takeoff by another twenty minutes. Then I turned out onto the runway, gunned the engines, (passengers yelled about how they \u0022couldn\u0027t hear themselves think\u0022) and climbed to our cruising altitude of four kilometers. Then I left the cockpit and looked out at the passengers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey argued among themselves. They jostled for a view out the window. They complained about the noise of the propellers. \u0022Attention, everybody!\u0022 I yelled. All at once nobody spoke. The drone of the engines was the only sound.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We have reached our cruising altitude of four kilometers. None of you have been so high up in your life. This machine is traveling at over half the speed of sound. You took off from Nendo City at 7:43, and you will land in Jendo\u0027s Crossroads at 10:02.\u0022 Years later, I would fly the same route in under an hour. \u0022This machine is the most expensive thing you\u0027ve ever seen in your life. You will probably never fly on an airplane again.\u0022 After I made the record run from Nendo City to Jendo\u0027s Crossroads, a study was published showing every kerbal in the country had flown at least twice. \u0022Look at that window while you can- and try to enjoy it.\u0022 I smiled. \u0022And thank you for flying Trans-Pan\u00A0Airlines.\u0022 I retreated back into the cockpit, and for the rest of the flight I never heard the noise of the passengers again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe landed at Jendo\u0027s Crossroads and the passengers disembarked- at least, that\u0027s the official word.
