It was once a living world. Now it was an airless ball of molten rock. The watchers had seen it change over the \u00A0billions of years since they were created. In the early days they observed as life adapted to the changing environment. They saw the oceans retreat and evaporate, and they saw species go extinct one by one, until there was no life left. They watched as the planet\u0027s atmosphere became thick with water vapor clouds, and saw the water clouds dissapear as they were split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation. The hydrogen was lost to space. The rest of the atmosphere was blown away by solar wind soon after. They watched as the planet melted. The end was coming. In about two billion years the planet would be swallowed by its sun. This world was all that remained of a once thriving planet called Kerbin.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-08T14:42:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2017 02:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Laythe Squid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
