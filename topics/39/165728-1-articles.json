With a range of 30 kilometers, it was a formidable, cheap weapon.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to the military advances in rocket artillery, KARA was able to procure a number of them for their own program.

The Charlie was simply the combination of Able and Baker into the first two-stage rocket on Kerbin.
