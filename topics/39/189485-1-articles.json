The sound of a launch rolled through the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know these school trips are important. But why do we need to host these school trips?\u201D she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou know the list,\u201D Dowig said as he peeked around his cubical wall. \u201CEncouragement, wonder, science, etc. And then there\u2019s the most important reason, director\u2019s orders.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah I know. I just wish it wasn\u2019t so exhausting. Three hundred kids each in thirty minute question sessions. The older kids aren\u2019t too bad. It\u2019s the younger ones that are the problem. They ask such simple questions with such horrible complex answers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike what?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike, why don\u2019t we fly a plane to the stations? Because there\u2019s no air for the engines up there. So why not bring some? That\u2019s basically what we do with rockets. So why not use the air for the rockets in a jet engine?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDowig snorted with a suppressed laugh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt would dissolve the engine,\u201D Hilrina continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFollowed by the plane and then the pilot,\u201D said Dowig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo why not use regular air? We considered it for a while. But the amount of air needed would have been larger than a rocket that went at the same speed. Which ended it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood answer\u2026 did we actually do the calculations?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo\u2026 not that I know of anyways. I think it wouldn\u2019t work anyways. It\u2019s more than just burning fuel. I think most of the air gets used as part of the exhaust medium, rather than combustion.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, one of the jet guys would know. I\u2019ll drop a line to one that I know.\u201D Dowig leaned back in his chair. \u201CThough I hear Jeb\u2019s gotten a Hopper up to angels 60.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWith a vee of zero up there. It takes more than angels to make orbit.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI know. You need 2.2 k sideways at 70.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo way to squeeze that out of a jet. The Wheesley barely breaks 250 at 10.\u201D Hilrina sat up in her chair. \u201CThough don\u2019t the jet guys have something in prototype territory? The Panter, Breather, something like that. They figured out a how to get five times the thrust for ten times the fuel.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStill won\u2019t be enough.\u201D Dowig said, sitting up in his chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrue. But if you can get up to angels 13 or so and a good 1 kps\u2026 we would just need to bolt it around a rocket. It would cut the fuel needed in half.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt least half. I\u2019ll ring up that jet guy. See what numbers he has.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis could be an interesting bird to design.\u201D Hilrina smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what they said about the Gull and the Hopper. They\u2019ve both done us well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
