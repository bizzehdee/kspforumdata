After considering my evil deeds for awhile, I decided that Mama and Papa weren\u0027t bad enough. The universe needed a evil-er villain. Evil-er than evil. Evil-er than evil-est! I decided that I would be that villain. My new name (because Bo isn\u0027t bad enough) would be..... THE KRAKEN! It was perfect! THE KRAAAAAKENNNN! DUN DUN DUNNNN!

It was an unnerving feeling. Through all her past missions, there had always been the reassurance of a reliable Zarya capsule standing by to make a quick return if something went wrong, even though she realized catastrophes were rarely that simple. Now, even that had been denied, as she floated in orbital darkness. If she made it back this far, she would have to find that tiny metal construction controlled only by a computer running far beyond its design specs, and even on the M\u00FCn, it was a very big sky. \n\nBut first, she faced the more pressing task of finding *another* metal construction, this one abandoned and derelict for two years, and whatever... else, was down there. MechIVAN would be little help here, this revision had never been updated with landing subroutines. And yet, she found an odd sort of anticipation floating around her mind. She had once made a career out of landing things with dubious expectations, now, after all these years of flying cargo, she was a pilot again. Clinging to that thought, putting out of her mind where she was going, Valentina checked her numbers one last time, and fired the thrusters. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe lander settled to the surface with a light bump. Valentina busied herself safing the engine and throwing various switches before a wave of vertigo nearly made her stumble. The gentle downward tug did not abate with the loss of thrust, and it took her brain a moment to recognize and rebel at the odd sensation.\n\nFortunately, there wasn\u0027t enough room to stumble in here. There was barely enough room to *stand* in here. Valentina had just enough space to stand before the controls in her bulky EVA suit. The rest of the hull was filled with equipment. In the tiny space, she vainly *wished* for claustrophobia, to feel the hull closing in. Or anything to make going outside seem preferable. She *could* feel the press of this place, every cell in her body was screaming at her to leave. Now. While she could. \n\nAwkwardly, she turned around toward the hatch as another wave of dizziness washed over her. Valentina was beyond comfortable in microgravity; she had spent more time in orbital freefall than anyone else alive. The crushing acceleration of a launch barely registered anymore, it was simply part of the job. Steadying herself, she held a pen in front of her face, and watched as it fell to the floor in slow motion. She knew *why* it did, she understood all the physics behind it completely. But that didn\u0027t make seeing it any less *wrong*. Despite her comfort in zero gravity and excess gravity, this one-sixth gravity was affecting her in ways she hadn\u0027t anticipated. \n\nOr perhaps, she thought, glancing back toward the derelict M\u00FCnbase framed in the landing window, it was this *place*. She kept expecting some *change*, some measure of excitement, perhaps a feeling of profundity, even simple curiosity. After all, only seven other people had ever set foot here. Yet all she could feel was a pervasive sense of wanting to be anywhere *other* than here, and a cold dread that seeped into her bones like the taiga winter. \n\nSo no sense in drawing it out any longer than she had to. Valentina made her last few checks, and hit the cabin vent switch. She felt her suit inflate as the noise of equipment died away, until the only sound left was her own breath thundering in her ears. With one final check, she swung the mercifully large EVA hatch open and stepped out onto another world. \n\nShe paused on the cylindrical shroud over the huge toroidal fuel tank. It gave her a moment to collect herself as this other world spun while she clung helplessly to the lip of the hatch. If the vertigo didn\u0027t pass soon, she was going to have a big problem. It was a long walk. \n\nAfter a while, Valentina\u0027s brain and eyes finally agreed on the situation, and she was able to take in the surroundings. She raised a hand to shield against the glare from the stark, grey desolation beyond, then remembered to slide down her copper-tinted sunscreen. The landscape looked no less foreboding tinted orange-yellow. \n\nThe walls of the expansive crater stretched high on every side, leaving no discernible horizon. That and the sheer emptiness of it all battered her with a bizarre mix of claustro- and agoraphobia. Valentina looked up, and gasped aloud in spite of herself. The gibbous blue globe of Kerbin shined down on her. As always, it was beautiful, but looking unarguably *up* at it only reinforced the feeling of being *down*, as if she had descended to some stark underworld. \n\nShe shook the thought from her head, and instantly regretted it as the entire world seemed to shake along with it. Slowly, all her movements loose and uncoordinated, she made her way onto the ladder and began the short descent. She paused again at the last rung, glancing down to the grey surface below. Ordinarily, this was the part where the intrepid explorer would say something profound and gracious, for all Kerbalkind. There would be none of that for Valentina, after all, she was already dead. Even her familiar snarkiness had evaporated with the last of the air in the lander cabin, lost in the conflicted gravity of this place. No, there was no humor here. \n\nWithout a word, stepped off the ladder. \n\nShe worked her way around the fuel tank, feeling very wobbly, a hand braced against it as if stumbling in the dark. From around 300 or so meters away, she surveyed the facility. The cylindrical base itself towered above the surrounding terrain. It was painted in a broad checkerboard pattern, the black patches melding with shadows, dark as pitch, cast by the sun hanging low in the equally black sky. The rest had once been white, but two years exposed on the M\u00FCn had left it coated with dust, turning it a dingy tan. The odd contrast gave Valentina the impression of a dilapidated building that had partially collapsed. \n\nFinally, with no more support to cling to, she set out across the open surface. She toppled over right away, having an unusually long time to contemplate the powdery grey dust before her faceplate hit it. Working shakily back to her feet, she pushed on through sheer will. It was maddeningly slow progress. The prototype EVA suit was stiffer than she was used to, it worked with the low gravity to turn all her motions into clumsy flailing. Trying to watch the landscape was no help, either. Objects didn\u0027t fade and blur in the distance, everything seemed absolutely crisp. These strange perceptions made it hard to judge distance; she tripped over a rock that still looked meters away, stumbled across flat ground while expecting a shallow crater. Even based on all she\u0027d read, everything seemed *off*. Exaggerated. Dream-like. The surreal proportions, her awkward motions like she could barely move, it was like a\u2014\n\nBreath caught in Valentina\u0027s throat as she whipped her head to the side. She stood motionless, not even daring to breathe, staring off towards a hill. For a moment, just a moment, she could have sworn she saw...\n\nA long sigh escaped her lips, leaving just a hint of fog on the plexiglass. She shook her head. Just her mind, playing tricks. Looking again at the ominous structure ahead, Valentina realized what was so familiar. This place, it was like a nightmare. The one where the monster chases, and you can\u0027t run away. \n\nWhen she finally made it to the base proper, sweat was clinging to her face like a greasy syrup in the low gravity. Here, much of the regolith was disturbed with footprints and trails, making it a little easier to get her bearings. The shadows were still wrong, though; still too dark. She went out of her way to avoid walking through any. \n\nStaying here during the long M\u00FCnar night must have been *horrible*.\n\nRising nearby like silent sentinels were two enormous descent stages. *Isfjell* landers. The solar-powered one still had its floodlights on, she noted. A large rover was parked by the main ladder, good. She would need it to get to the anomaly. Hopefully it still ran. Everything here other than that one lander stage was nuclear powered, but none of the exterior lights were on. She *could* see light in one of the base windows, however, so *some* systems must still be--\n\nHer breath caught again. Despite the sweat, a chill chased up her spine. \n\nIn that window... something moved. \n\nNo, impossible. No one had been here in two years. Without maintenance, the whole place probably depressurized months ago. Something in the window shifted again, and she could see it was just a flickering light. There. Nothing to worry about. Perfectly expected, why, the place was probably *filled* with flickering lights. \n\nThe weight of that thought slowly sank into her. An abandoned, crumbling building filled with flickering lights. A certain word kept trying to worm its way into her mind. She dared not even give it thought. \n\n*Come now, if you believe in monsters, it\u0027s no stretch to also believe... in ghosts.*\n\nShe tried to push the thought away. Besides, no one actually *died* in there. \n\n*No, if even half of what you\u0027ve heard is true, what happened in there was far, **far** \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003Eworse\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.*\n\nValentina tried to swallow, only to find her mouth suddenly dry. Must be this dehumidified, recirculated suit air. Again she gave her head a hard shake, stumbling over to the ladder as vertigo surged once more. Once everything stopped spinning, it looked like a long way up to the hatch. Taking the uprights in her gloved hands, she clawed her way up. \n\n*You are not welcome here. You are alien. You are trespassing. Trespassing in a hau\u2014*\n\nShe smacked her helmet so hard the world spun again.\n\n*P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS,\\* I nearly thought it out loud!*\n\nDibella always loved foreign movies, especially scary ones. Valentina had sat through many with her, quietly trying not to giggle. Now, every single one came rolling through her mind like a macabre parade. They didn\u0027t seem so funny anymore. \n\n*Stop it, you\u0027re just scaring **yourself**, giving your mind leave to play its tricks.*\n\n*That\u0027s exactly what someone in one of those scary movies would say, right before the ghoul appeared!*\n\nVoices chided back and forth within her mind. \n\n\u0022*Shut up!*\u0022 Valentina cried out, squeezing tears from her eyes. As she flailed, her boot slipped off the ladder, and for a brief instant she was weightless again. Even in the low gravity, the mass of her suit and its equipment pulled her down, wrenching at her arm as she caught herself. She swayed there, scrabbling, trying to find purchase before embracing the ladder once more. Panting, just trying to hold herself up, she looked around at the shadows, as if expecting something to have heard. \n\nFinally, she managed to climb up to the outer hatch. Maybe... maybe the hand crank wouldn\u0027t turn. Yes, maybe the base *didn\u0027t* lose pressure, maybe the departing crew deliberately repressurized the lock to keep anyone *else* from entering. If it was still pressurized, the crank wouldn\u0027t turn and there\u0027d be no way in. Just give it a little nudge, and she could forget this whole nonsense and go--\n\nThe crank spun effortlessly, smooth as glass. \n\nSilently, she cursed. \n\n*Too* smooth. Maybe... the mechanism was broken, and the hatch wouldn\u0027t even--\n\nThe hatch swung inward, creaking ominously. \n\nWait, did she really *hear*..?\n\n*This isn\u0027t like you. You\u0027re doing this to yourself, letting some silly movies and a stressful situation get the best of you. You didn\u0027t hear that hatch creak open, you didn\u0027t see shadows move. Stop being ridiculous.*\n\n\u0022Yes, of course. Ridiculous...\u0022 Valentina gave a weak laugh, and hauled herself into the airlock. But not before taking another uncertain look at the shadows outside. They seemed... longer. The lander was little more than a speck across an empty sea of grey. Empty, except for the shadows. She could almost see them... no, that would be ridiculous. \n\nShe stepped back from the open door, watching it, as if afraid it might close on its own. The lock was dark, of course; several lights had stopped working. There was no telling what color the walls had been originally, in only a few weeks of service they had been scoured and coated by m\u00FCndust until they simply blended into the darkness. Off to one side was a pile of worn-out handtools. \n\nThere was a window in the inner hatch. With one last glance to the open outer door, Valentina approached with caution. This, too, had been scoured by the abrasive dust, frosted until only vague shapes could be seen in the other room. Breath thundering loud in her ears, she stared into it, moving her face closer.\n\nSomething moved.\n\nValentina gasped and jumped back. No... no that\u0027s quite impossible. Nothing could *possibly* be alive in there. Just more mind tricks, shadows, perhaps another failing light. Steeling herself, she crept close once again. Her breath sounded like the pounding of the ocean in the small space of her helmet. She craned her head this way, then that, trying to peer into the murky space. There, see? Absolutely nothing to\u2014\n\nSomething thumped against the glass. \n\nShe stumbled back, a scream barely contained. For a moment she flailed, helpless and off balance in the low gravity. Her head whipped around just in time to see the outer hatch slam shut with a resounding, shuddering crash. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-15T04:53:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2016 04:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"}]}
