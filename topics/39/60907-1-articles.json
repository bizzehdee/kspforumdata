I have been streaming KSP for a while now but I can only manage to get 2 followers. I have gotten up to 6 viewers and my streams are pretty good quality. Any suggestions on how to improve a stream or how to get my name out there? I would take suggestions from streamers or viewers who would like to add their input on what they think makes a KSP stream good. I am under 18 so sadly I will not be joining the KSPTV team for another 3 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Twitch: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/cupojoepro\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/cupojoepro\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E btw: I also stream Rust and Beamng Drive, so any suggestions about that would be nice as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
