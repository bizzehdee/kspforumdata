I have been a fan of Kerbal Space Program for the longest time, but never really got to play enough of it in earlier versions. I recently decided that it would be the perfect game to make a new series on for my channel, since I love the game so much. I would really appreciate if you guys could check me out and give me some feedback, and maybe even a like if you enjoyed. My channel is pretty new and small, so every little bit counts and I know how great the Kerbal Space Program community is, so I know you guys will help me out! Thanks everyone for reading this and helping me out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Come join me as I play career mode for the first time and probably look like a complete idiot!
