He was one of the many kerbals at Kerbal Space Center. Jebediah was most known for his never ending grin. He smiles and smiles, even in a catastrophic rocket failure. He is also 27. He had 2 brothers who also worked with Jeb at KSC. One of them was Bill, who was the oldest of the 3 brothers at 30, and the other was named Bob who is 19, and he is always scared when Jeb is around because Jeb always thinks life should be like action movies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 1: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHey Jeb, where did Bob go\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Bill. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUhmmm, I dunno\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Jeb. Ever since they landed on Duna, Bob has always been scared and keeps hiding. Suddenly, Bob popped out of nowhere. However, he looks a bit scared. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBob, why are you so scared?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Jeb. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to go to Laythe.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bob said. He is scared because in 10 months, they will land on Laythe and establish a base where they will live, along with 6 other kerbals, where they will be staying for 10 years. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSo, we should get to the simulator to practice for the landing and stuff\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Bill. And off they went to the training centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 months later\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHey, is it just me or did summer come early?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 asked Jeb, out near the shore near KSC with his 2 brothers. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CUm, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think so.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said Bill, playing volleyball with Bob. When they looked up to Kerbol, it had grown 3 times larger than 5 months before. They went to KSC and checked the Kubble Space Telescope\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s camera. They zoomed in on the place where Moho is, but that area was covered in Kerbol! They then zoomed out to Eve and surprisingly, Kerbol is about to eat up Eve! They ran to their boss\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s office and said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKERBOL IS GETTING BIGGER, IT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2S GONNA EAT KERBIN UP, WE GOTTA RELOCATE EVERYONE ON KERBIN TO LAYTHE SINCE IT\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2S THE ONLY OTHER PLACE WITH AN ATMOSPHERE!!!!!!!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 but the boss just said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNo it isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t, we checked\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 so they asked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow long ago?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 so then he had no answer. So they said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExactly.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 They then all ran to the design room to make a new ship that can fit all of Kerbins population. A month later, their design was being built, but it would be estimated to be finished in 5 months. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C5 FREAKING MONTHS? KERBOL\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2LL EAT KERBIN UP IN 2 MONTHS, WORK FASTER!!!!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said the Boss when told it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll take 5 months for it to finish.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 But we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working at full speed, if you want us to work faster, why not hire the entire population?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 said a worker. Suddenly, the Boss had an idea. He traveled around Kerbin in an SSTO piloted by the one and only Jeb in less than a week, putting up flyers in every country. Each flyer said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKSC wants YOU to help save Kerbin. Apply at KSC in the South-East part of Kafrika and save the world!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Soon, KSC was filled with 5x more workers and the estimated time of completion is in 1 month, 29 days! 1 month, 29 days later, the ship was complete with built in missiles from Danny2462 Co. and were there for killing the kraken if it happen to come near.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the day of the launch, everyone on Kerbin gathered at KSC and boarded the ship. However, recent data shows Kerbol will eat up Kerbin on the day after the launch! So once everyone on Kerbin boarded, they went at full throttle and lifted off with 100000kn of thrust! It was enough to exit the SOI of Kerbol in less than 30 seconds. Once they got far from Kerbol (Like, at Eeloo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit) they relaxed for the 20 year journey to another system. Suddenly, the Kraken came behind them! They all floated to the front of the ship, since it was attacking from the back, but there was nothing they could do! But Jeb remembered they had Danny2462 Co. brand missiles which were guaranteed to banish the kraken. So Jeb targeted the missiles at the kraken and fired, but it weakened it slightly. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re getting a refund on those\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Jeb said. Suddenly, he remembered there were escape pods on the ship with SRB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s attached to them, so Jeb used one and piloted the pod to the kraken. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNO JEB, NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 cried Bob and Bill, watching the pod near the kraken. Finally, Jeb fired the SRB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s at the kraken and flew into it, killing it. Everyone on the ship was saddened at the loss of the greatest hero of Kerbin, Jebediah Kerman. He sacrificed himself to save them all, so Bill grabbed an MMU and got Jeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s body. His body was lifeless. Then Bill and Bob planned a funeral for him, one with his real body sent into space, and a 3D printed copy of his body for burial in the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so, the fearless space hero lived up to his name\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFarewell, Jebediah, you will be missed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECredits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad for KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe for the story (shameless self promotion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP for the inspiration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, Jebediah Kerman, who always has a place in every KSP player\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heart and will always be remembered every time he dies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeedback is always appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want more, just ask, it\u0027s as simple as that!
