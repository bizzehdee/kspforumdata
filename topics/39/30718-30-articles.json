Twin engined, squat bodied and built for range rather than aerobatics, the old transport aircraft had rapidly acquired the less than flattering nickname of \u0027Airhog\u0027 from border patrol pilots used to faster - and nimbler - machines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal hated it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe glanced at the artificial horizon and hauled her aircraft into a fractionally tighter turn. The flight direction indicator drifted reluctantly around, bright white digits marching slowly past the red inverted V that marked the Airhog\u0027s nose. A thin smear of light from the Doreni port glowed sullenly on the real horizon, fainter patches of light from other towns dotting the coastline to the north and south.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vinenut three, Val.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe rolled level, tipping the aircraft onto its opposite wing in a stately bank; threading the needle between the patches of light. Staying out of conceivable searchlight range whilst getting close enough for the racks of passive sensors stuffed into the Airhog\u0027s belly to do their thing. Or so the flight planners said. Plotted on the navigation charts, their routes resembled the erratically bulbous contours of a fresh vinenut and one of the early reconnaissance crews had promptly labelled all their waypoints accordingly. The joke had stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anything down there, Sig?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Picking up the usual harbour radars,\u0022 her navigator replied. \u0022Shouldn\u0027t be a problem at this range. Nothing bigger or pointed in our direction - guess the Doreni aren\u0027t bothering to throw money down the same gronnek warren as the Wakirans.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yet.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yet,\u0022 Sigrin acknowledged. She snorted softly. \u0022They\u0027ll probably just pay Rockomax to launch them a nice satellite instead.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal sucked in her breath sharply. \u0022They might. Or borrow that fancy mapping satellite from the KSA.You should kick that up the chain, Sig.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a thoughtful silence from the back seat. \u0022I think I will,\u0022 Sigrin said slowly. \u0022It\u0027d beat flying round in lopsided circles, that\u0027s for sure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With nothing else to do than limp away in a straight line if anyone sees us,\u0022 said Val sourly. \u0022Wish I knew what the Kerm is holding up the Humilisia airstrip. We could fly the Cloudrunners out of there in broad daylight and the Doreni couldn\u0027t do a damn thing about it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Still takes a lot of concrete to build a proper runway,\u0022 said Sigrin. \u0022Even if we don\u0027t care whether the Doreni are watching...ahhh here we go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ELINT system chimed twice in Val\u0027s ear. Behind her, Sigrin hunched forward over her instruments, streaks of light from the screens washing over her face, eyes flicking back and forth between the radar and infrared displays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well - they\u0027re still there. They\u0027ve shuffled them around a bit but I\u0027m counting the same number - and same types - that BB reported. Patrol boats mainly with a couple of bigger vessels for variety. Better take a swing past vinenuts four and five anyway to cover the angles but I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll need another full circuit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal automatically checked her kneeboard as she eased the Airhog into a shallow climbing turn. The softly glowing figures simply confirmed what she\u0027d already committed to memory. She glanced at the fuel gauges, nodded and shuffled back in her seat, trying to find a more comfortable spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You sure, Sig? I was starting to enjoy the scenery up here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSigrin\u0027s snort echoed in her earphones as the Skyhauler droned onward through starlit Doreni skies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun\u0027s breath smoked in the freezing air. Sand crunched under his boots, loose grains skittering across the ice-glazed walkway and trickling over the edge in thin, gritty drizzles. The air smoked hotter with muttered curses as one foot skidded on the frozen planks, throwing him hard against the safety rail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, lifting his feet as high as possible in his stiffly awkward leggings and setting them with down with exaggerated care, Jerfun stepped into one of the low embrasures set into the log wall. From atop the palisade he stared down the road at the distant cluster of figures, black specks against the leaden evening sky. Silently, the guard passed him a pair of binoculars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeen up close, the figures were a curious blend of traditional and practical; grey woollen robes belted around the more usual Wakiran cold weather garb. One of the robed figures was carrying a grey pack, another twelve were toting larger, dark brown bundles. The remainder carried conventional mountain gear, most of them festooned with far more than a single kerbals-worth of equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun\u0027s heart sank. \u0022Have you seen any vehicles?\u0022 he asked quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, Ambassador. They haul their own loads.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun leaned on the parapet to steady his hands, peering intently through the binoculars. The robed figures wore snowshoes, their companions were equipped with long, cross-country skis. Now that he was looking for them, both the sleds and the bundles of white fabric lashed to them were plain to see. Equally plain to see were the chunks of ice bobbing on the surface of the stream next to them. He straightened up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll hold the watch. Take word to the village, return with fuel, wood and two days supplies for forty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Supplies, Ambassador? For Kolans?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerfun scowled. \u201CTruly? They carry no flag - of Wakira or Kolus. And if we cannot let them pass then neither are we barbarians.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe guard nodded tersely. \u0022My gun is yours, Ambassador.\u0022 She unloaded her hunting rifle, presented the empty weapon and its ammunition to Jerfun, and turned away. The steady scrape of boots on coarse sand faded into the background as he automatically inspected the rifle, reloaded it and, snapping the safety catch on, propped it against the parapet within easy reach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly, the band of Walkers drew closer. Jerfun made his way along the walkway, speaking briefly to each of the guards, before returning to his own embrasure. He checked his rifle, watching the Walkers milling around the base of the palisade, then set it aside and cupped his hands around his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What can I do for you, good kerbals?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a brief conference and then one of the grey cloaked kerbals stepped forward. Jerfun was unsurprised to see the grey pack on his back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We weren\u0027t told about this... roadblock, good kerbal!\u0022 \u00A0the stranger called out, the rounded consonants in his accent clearly audible. \u0022May I ask its purpose?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Truly, a regrettable necessity,\u0022 Jerfun answered. \u0022But new villages require protection in these troubled times.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003ECertainly against your like.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Surely not against a group of Walkers and their companions? Come now, good kerbal, we merely pass through and our time-honoured journey is an urgent one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood Ambassador,\u0022 said Jerfun pleasantly. Along the palisade, the other guards reached for their weapons. \u0022And truly your journey must be urgent if it has led you here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I fear that I don\u0027t quite understand...Ambassador.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Kolus border is several days away by foot,\u0022 said Jerfun. \u0022Were I in your party, I would be minded to verify the date on my maps.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a pause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022May we request an escort through your Grove, Ambassador?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You may not. You may shelter beneath our palisade tonight and if you wish we can offer transport back to the border in the morning.\u0022 Jerfun surveyed the loaded sleds beneath him. \u0022We can spare you fuel for tonight and - in honour of your journey - spare you two days of supplies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That is... generous, Ambassador. Our thanks go with you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It is no more than any Wakiran,\u0022 the emphasis on the last word was unmistakeable, \u0022would do in my place. And no more than any honorable kerbal would do for a new Kerm. I have already sent word to my village for your supplies.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnely tightened the belt of his grey cloak, shivering in the salt breeze. He dipped his hand into the grey pack at his feet, reaching for the Kerm seed within; twining his fingers through its fibrous husk for reassurance. His companion Walkers stood around him; tough, weatherbeaten kerbals, hardened by a lifetime spent in the semi-arid wastes of central Wakira. Growing crops under such conditions, even desert adapted species like pepper cactus, taxed the determination and ingenuity of Kerm and kerbal alike. Those that did banded together in close-knit, self-reliant communities, usually remaining kermol for their entire lives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Bay of Dazj loomed on the horizon, choked with the boats and barges shuttling supplies and workers ashore from the small flotilla of transport ships anchored further out to sea. Flanking the bay, the twin volcanoes of Dazji Isle rose forbiddingly into the sky. Long dormant, the outpourings from their last eruptions had finally been sufficient to join them into a single island. Centuries of erosion had since carved out a spectacular natural harbour, each horn of the crescent bay guarded by a steep, cloud-wreathed peak. Further west, the Maldonian Archipelago tailed out in the jagged Pillars of Dunlin and a string of smaller volcanic islands; all uninhabited save for thriving seabird colonies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike an gigantic, broken eggshell, a half completed radome loomed above the eastern headland, the antenna inside motionless for the moment but pointed unerringly at the eastern Maldonian islands. Nearby, a cluster of dark grey buildings stood wrapped in forests of scaffolding, their concrete walls made with local black sand. A steady stream of vehicles trundled along the coastline between the building site and the harbour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe younger Walkers watched in fascination as the \u003Cem\u003EAdelan Kerman\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s crew hauled the second of her two enormous skyfoil sails onto the deck and set about detaching it from the winch lines. The first skyfoil was already stowed on the opposite rail, runnels of water dribbling out of its folds and tubes and splashing into the sea below. The older Walkers and Enely paid no attention, instead staring impassively at their new home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCeded from the newly formed Forseti Confederacy towards the end of the Age of Sail, the western end of the Maldonian Archipelago had nominally belonged to Wakira for centuries, although for much of that time it had lain abandoned, save as a line on a map. Dazji Island itself was barely habitable, the twin volcanoes trapping just enough moisture from the prevailing winds that its thin soil could support a sparse collection of hardy grasses and low, thorny shrubs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe deck thrummed softly underfoot and water suddenly churned around the \u003Cem\u003EAdelan Kerman\u0027\u003C/em\u003Es stern. Slowly she crept forward, cautiously edging towards her allotted berth at the bay entrance. Enely patted the Kerm seed one last time for luck and hoisted his pack onto his shoulders. The higher pitched whine of the ship\u0027s motor shifting into reverse was followed by a heavy splash and the clanking rattle of chain running through hawse pipe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWe\u0027re here.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder the bosun\u0027s watchful gaze and blunt orders, the Walkers began boarding the ship\u0027s boats. Enely watched the deck crew wrestle back the heavy, folding cargo hatch and start unloading the hold. He recognised the bales of flat-packed shelters for the new village - \u003Cem\u003Emy new village\u003C/em\u003E - but most of the other equipment and supplies were stowed in blandly anonymous crates, the stencils on their sides unreadable from where he stood. Suddenly there was a respectful tap on his shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeeper?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe spun round to face the bosun. The older kerbal looked at him curiously for a moment then nodded. \u201CStern seat, Keeper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you. And please convey my thanks to the Captain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTruly. You choose a harsh place to live, Keeper - I wish you and your Kerm good fortune.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThank you,\u0022 said Enely quietly. He tightened the buckles on his pack, glanced around the deck and clambered into the boat, clutching the gunwale nervously. The davit arms swung out and down. Enely braced himself for impact as the \u003Cem\u003EAdelan Kerman\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s hull sped past but much to his surprise, the boat slipped into the sea with barely a jolt. The motor started and they purred away towards Dazji Island.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe siren wailed, numbingly loud even through the blockhouse wall. Val rolled off her bunk, grabbed her flight helmet and hit the ground running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh volume compressors screamed to life, as the pilots sprinted for the hangar. A rapidly building roar joined the scream, both overlaid with a piercing banshee howl. Val burst through the hangar door into a wall of noise. She jammed her flight helmet over her head, glanced at the ominous shape of the Mark 3 fingrillin already slung under her aircraft and reflexively checked the hangar floor for debris. She raced past the starter-jockey sprinting clear of her aircraft, scrambled up the cockpit ladder and flung herself into the ejection seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ground crew hauled the start-cart away. Val plugged in her communication leads, reaching for the canopy lever with her other hand, eyes racing over the instrument panel. The aircraft rumbled under her, like a gronnek straining to be let off its leash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHydraulics - check. Breakers - in. Caution panel - clear.

Inside the cockpit, Val\u0027s head swivelled back and forth, eyes intent. Satisfied, she pulled out the safety pins on her ejection seat, held them up to the canopy and stowed them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFlight controls - check. Brakes on.

Proceed to apron.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the hangar entrance, an orange-jacketed kerbal lifted two circular paddles over his head and flipped their green surface round to face Val. She eased her throttle forward and released the brakes. The engine pitch rose a notch, deafening in the enclosed space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVanguard is rolling.\u0022\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAnd the day I need a chaperone to get me out of here without clipping my wings is the day I quit flying.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour Cloudrunner single-seater jet aircraft emerged from their hangars, waves of shimmering air rolling off their engines, the dawn sun gleaming from their prominent bubble canopies. Originally designed as high speed aerobatic and racing planes, the heavy torpedoes slung under their bellies added an air of menace to their lightly swept wings and gaping nose intakes. One by one, they surged forward onto the taxiway, swung lightly round, then catapulted down the runway, engines howling louder than the alert siren, hardly making it to the halfway marker before leaping nimbly into the air and vanishing into the clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vanguard is airborne, four by four. What\u0027s the drill, Control?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No drill, Vanguard. The Doreni fleet slipped anchor at 06:00 this morning and, until further notice, are to be considered hostile targets. Your orders are to make best speed for Humilisia and provide air support for Commander Gusden.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re not going to get a lot of loiter time, Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022With luck you won\u0027t need any, Vanguard. If Gusden gets his way you\u0027ll either be too late for the shooting or just in time to buzz the beach barbecue he\u0027ll be throwing for our friendly Doreni neighbours. Until then, you\u0027re the big stick. Get in, drop the fish if and where you\u0027re told to and get out. Joker is grass on Humilisia.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood. Vanguard out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden scoured the horizon, shifting his weight from foot to foot as the cutter surged and swayed under him. Already, the salt spray was working its way under his headset, making it chafe uncomfortably against his scalp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kolan fleet was drawn up in two parallel lines, facing east towards Doren. A skirmishing force of cutters led the way; all vessels abreast; their crews, like Gusden, searching the horizon for Doreni vessels. Behind them, a defensive formation of heavier torpedo boats stood off the Humilisian coast. Two picket groups circled the islands, keeping a wary watch for any flanking attacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Eyes right!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden\u0027s head snapped round. A surprisingly small cluster of black shapes, just barely distinguishable as ships, were steaming into view. Gusden blinked, then realisation came crashing in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All crews - rotate the line! Centre pivot! End crews - watch for envelopment chances!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe roar of marine engines split the air. Gusden nodded in satisfaction as the nearest cutters heeled over in opposite directions, churning the waves into foam as they swung round onto their new course. He tapped a button on his headset, shouting for his seconds in command but heard only faint voices over the din of engines. Swearing, he ran for the deckhouse, yelling orders as he went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anchors?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe responses were muffled but audible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Swinging south, sir! Line\u0027s holding!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Swinging north sir! Line\u0027s holding!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden scowled out of the window, watching the cluster of Doreni boats uncoiling across the distant water, racing south at flanking speed, then slowing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAye, that won\u0027t help you. Cut \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E line would you, ya crawling slasherns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reports rattled in in quick succession, both seconds in command crisply confirming the new heading for their halves of the skirmish line. Gusden opened his mouth to reply, only to be cut off by a flat crack echoing across the water, which was swiftly followed by a distant fountain of spray. He tapped his headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ranging shot! All crews - hold the line and \u003Cem\u003Ehold your fire!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two lines of cutters, both now stretched out west to east, faced each other across the waves. A second shot smashed into the water, a third, then a fourth, all falling well short of the Kolan vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It takes more than wasted shots to rattle a Kolan!\u0022 Gusden shouted. \u0022All ahead - steerage way!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs if in reply, the Doreni line surged forward, trailing foaming V shaped wakes behind them. The Kolan line wavered, one boat after another breaking formation as more shots crashed into the sea around them. All, Gusden noted, aimed \u003Cem\u003Ebetween\u003C/em\u003E his forces. A single shot flew the other way; one panicking Kolan crew returning fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hold your fire!\u0022 roared Gusden. \u0022They are \u003Cem\u003Eplaying\u003C/em\u003E with you. Do not enga...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden watched in horror as another incoming shell ripped into a Kolan cutter, tearing into the deck and hurling equipment and screaming kerbals into the sea. \u003Cem\u003ESingle shot\u003C/em\u003E one corner of his mind yammered. \u003Cem\u003ENot a volley - stray shot.\u003C/em\u003E Dimly, he heard himself issuing orders, bringing his own vessel about, powering ahead through the engulfing melee towards the figures bobbing in the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeck guns thundered in a continuous barrage as the opposing battle lines dissolved into chaos. Cutters from both forces darted this way and that, chasing each other across the waves, jinking as best they could to throw off enemy aim. Fountains of spray marked missed shots; inexperienced gunners and fast moving targets ensuring that very few shells found their mark. Gusden hung tightly onto the cabin rail, bellowing orders into his microphone as he tried desperately to make some sense of the battle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anchors - pull back and reform your lines! Pick your targets and cut across their bows - get both your popguns into the fight! And for Kerm\u0027s sake hold your fire for any vessel making a pickup. I don\u0027t care if they\u0027re Doreni or pink-skinned Dunans - you \u003Cem\u003Edo not shoot at them\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of his crew dashed into the cabin, stumbling against the doorway as a wave caught the cutter amidships. Gusden wheeled round, catching a brief glimpse of bleeding kerbals sprawled on the deck, two of them missing legs, eyes rolled back into their skulls. Another of his crew knelt by them; tending to his comrades, seemingly oblivious to the gunfire raging overhead. Then Gusden finally took in the bloodless face and wide eyes of his aft gunner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Commander,\u0022 he choked, \u0022The north...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden\u0027s head snapped round. \u003Cem\u003EWhat in the seven smoking hells...\u003C/em\u003E He jabbed at his headset, gesturing to the gunner to get back on deck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Fingril line - sitrep!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In position but observing fire! Your orders sir?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden stared bleakly at the ordered line of Doreni reinforcements sweeping down on his forces. \u0022East, half ahead,\u0022 he replied. \u0022Load all fingrillin tubes and stand ready to lay down screening fire.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA handful of burning boats dotted the sea. Pools of flaming fuel dispersed rapidly on the waves but not rapidly enough for the charred figures floating by the wreckage; some barely recognisable as kerbals. Gusden clenched his teeth, dry heaves wracking his body. He swallowed hard, acid stinging the back of his throat. Then he issued the order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All crews pull back to the islands. Flanking speed. Fingril line will provide covering fire.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe retreat, Gusden reflected, was a bitter tribute to all the kerbals under his command. The Kolan forces slipped neatly from the jaws of the Doreni trap, a single line-ahead roaring towards the comparative safety of the Humilisian islands and the waiting line of torpedo boats. His seconds in command joined him in bringing up the rear; the three cutters harassing the pursuing Doreni vessels, offering themselves as targets to buy the others more time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lead Kolan cutter fled through the line of repurposed fishing vessels. Gusden glanced fore and aft, gauging speeds and distances. \u003Cem\u003ETime for one fingrillin salvo before we\u0027re back to deck guns.\u003C/em\u003E He tapped his headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vanguard - ETA?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a brief pause then Val\u0027s voice crackled crisply in his ear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ten minutes out sir, Orders?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re falling back to the islands, Vanguard. Your weapon passes are westbound, repeat westbound. Target the command vessels - bulbous bows, twin radio masts at the stern. Two releases on the first pass, give them time to retreat, second pass only if required.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, sir. Vanguard out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden\u0027s spirits lifted briefly as the two cutters carrying his seconds in command raced past the advancing line of torpedo boats. The instant his own boat reached safety he gave the order. The response was immediate, keyed up kerbal gunners reacting instantly to his words. A wave of fingrillin arced out over the sea in a rush of rapidly expanding air and disappeared beneath the surface almost as one. Sweating deckhands struggled .to reload torpedo launchers as the ungainly vessels swung due west, trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the oncoming Doreni.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal hissed in dismay, hardly hearing the sudden oaths from the other Vanguard pilots. Wreckage strewed the sea beneath her, kerbals hanging grimly on to the shattered remnants of sunken boats. Other boats sped towards the wreckage, crews already throwing ropes over the side, glancing up only briefly at the Cloudrunners screaming overhead. Still other boats burned furiously, sending ugly plumes of oily black smoke into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So much for the barbecue.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal swallowed hard, bile rising at the back of her throat as she realised what she\u0027d just said. Hands shaking, she toggled her microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cal - you\u0027re with me. Ferl, Gil, take the second pass. Remember what the boss said - give them a chance to retreat before going in.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EAlthough they sure don\u0027t look interested in retreating\u003C/em\u003E she added silently, hauling her aircraft skyward. Sea and sky wheeled past dizzyingly, blood rushed to her head; then she was through the half-loop, rolling the Cloudrunner upright and searching for her target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ETwin radio masts. There - and there.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cal, break left. I\u0027ll go right.\u0022 Val threw her aircraft into a tight, spiralling dive, levelling out at rock-throwing height above the waves. Steel glinted in the corner of her eye; the enemy guns swinging down and round to follow her, a sudden muzzle flash throwing shadows over her ejection seat. Then she was through, finger convulsing against the weapon release trigger, the Cloudrunner lurching under her as the weapon pylon sprang open. Val hauled back on her flight stick, her other hand wrenching the throttle hard against its stops, clawing for every last metre...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusden screwed his eyes shut against the sudden actinic glare. The cutter bucked under his feet; throwing him against the deckhouse wall. Black spots danced in front of his eyes as he squinted out of the window. One of the spots resolved into a tiny figure, flailing wildly as it tumbled through the air, trailing thin ropes behind it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sprinted for the deck rail, hand over his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnnoticed, four aircraft flew overhead, heading due west, two of them still carrying torpedoes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-116-blackout/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=1999795\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 48\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-116-blackout/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2143743\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 50\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-29T14:33:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2020 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minepagan","CreatedById":132643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T20:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E.....what just happened?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m conflustered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T22:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s the last part that\u0027s conflustering, that particular story arc has been brewing for a while.

She patted her stomach. \u201CMind you, a bit of frost in the air can work it\u0027s charms too - can\u0027t it dear?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThombal coughed. \u201CIt seems so,\u0022\u00A0he said dryly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a chorus of congratulations from everyone in the room. Joenie popped her head around the door inquisitively, arms full of cushions.

Now - how about you and me go and help your mummy bring everything through from the kitchen?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnlie wedged a cushion behind her back. \u201CSo, what is it that you do, Jenrie?\u0022 she asked, \u201Cor rather, did?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJenrie put her mug down. \u201CProject management for Stratus Ltd.,\u0022 she said. \u201CHelping to set up the new production facilities near Foxham.

Water cascaded into the bowl on top of his pedestal. \u201CJust put it in the wine cooler here. \u0022He glanced at the wall clock. \u201CAnd speaking of tiny fingers, we\u0027d better round them up. Show\u0027s about to start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnlie got to her feet and leaned around the door. \u201CGildas!\u0022 she called, \u201CSpaceship time!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdbas and Joenie hurtled into the room in a thunder of small feet and flung themselves at their parents. Gildas ran in after them and flopped onto his cushion, frantically shushing the other two kerblets. Ferry waited until all three were settled down and a plate of snacks put in front of each, then flicked on the television.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHello and welcome to this very special episode of Engines and Engineers. With me in the studio today are two kerbals who need no introduction to any followers of kerballed spaceflight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerke Kerman was one of the Rockomax Corporation\u0027s first test pilots and flight-qualified the R1 capsule with fellow pilot Jondon Kerman. He flew into orbit aboard the Next Step for its historical joint flight with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s Eve 1 spacecraft. He\u0027s taking a break from training to be with us today - training for the command seat on Pioneer 3.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBob Kerman is a founding member of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society and flew on the Kerbal 1 alongside Bill and Jebediah Kerman. He is the chief engineer for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Rockomax\u0027s Munar lander development program and he\u0027s been chosen as a crew member for Pioneer 7. Good kerbals, please put your hands together for Kerke and Bob Kerman!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob took a sip of water and smiled at the enthusiastic applause. Across the table, Kerke looked cool and relaxed despite the heat from the studio lighting. As the applause died down, he nodded minutely at Bob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s a pleasure to be here, Tom.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe pleasure is all ours, Bob. Now, I know there\u0027s one question on everyone\u0027s mind - how is everything up there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBetter than we dared hope to be honest, Tom. We had a pretty ambitious set of tests scheduled for Pioneer 2 but the crew have done a fantastic job in working through them. Especially Tommal, who volunteered to sleep in the lander for the first three nights on orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTesting the life support systems, Bob?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAbsolutely, Tom. We couldn\u0027t fit a full duration test into the flight plan - the lander is designed to support two kerbals for a two day stay on the M\u00FCn - but we reviewed the consumables data on day four and all the systems had worked as planned. Incidentally, to answer your question from last week\u0027s show, the lander uses the same air scrubber cartridges as the main capsule, so we we have redundant supplies in case of an emergency.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s good to hear, Bob. So what else have you been testing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust about everything we can think of, Tom and few more things after that. Kerke can take us through the details but basically we\u0027ve simulated almost a full Munar landing whilst staying in Kerbin orbit. Kerke?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke cleared his throat. \u201CThat\u0027s right. We had three primary objectives for Pioneer 2. Firstly, and most importantly, we wanted to practice docking the Munar lander to the CSM - that\u0027s capsule and service module. Secondly we wanted to flight test the lander as a standalone spacecraft. And finally, we\u0027ve been checking that the navigation and flight control systems on either spacecraft can handle the complete stack.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo am I reading this right, Kerke - you tested the engine on the lander whilst it was docked to the rest of the ship? Why would you need to do that on a real Munar flight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, hopefully we never will, Tom. The main reason for doing it was so that we could test a complete thrust pattern for the Munar descent. If we\u0027d tried that with the lander alone, it would have ended up in some crazy high orbit, but because the lander was pushing all the extra mass of the CSM, the orbit wasn\u0027t affected nearly as much. But we were also testing an emergency option - if something went wrong with the service module engine on a Munar flight, could we get the crew back from the M\u00FCn using the lander engine alone?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike a lifeboat?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExactly. And the answer looks to be yes - we can use the lander as a lifeboat if we had to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, that sure is a relief to me, Kerke, and I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s a relief to everyone watching.\u0022 Tom looked towards the camera. \u0022We\u0027ll be talking more about the lander engines after the break - including the all new, deep-throttled descent engine. But right now, we have some footage for you from the very first part of the flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton glanced at the three kerblets sitting on the floor. Joenie and Adbas were staring raptly at the screen and Gildas had shuffled so far forward that Jonton was surprised he could still see everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom of the picture was filled by \u003Cem\u003EPioneer 2\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s blunt conical prow, gleaming against an azure blue sky streaked with iridescent white clouds. Dead ahead, a shining white tube hung in space, it\u0027s hollow tip pointed towards the camera and shrouded in shadow. The picture drifted this way and that, the kerbonauts making final course corrections as the two spacecraft swam ever closer together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe end of the booster stage loomed over the watching kerbals, the dark maw of the docking adapter reaching out to engulf the end of the capsule. The camera shook briefly then steadied to reveal the two vessels snugged neatly together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C...on a Munar flight, the spacecraft would now be ready for trans-Munar injection and the crew would spend the next two orbits checking over their systems and setting up for the burn. What you\u0027re about to see would normally happen after TMI, once the spacecraft was on its way to the M\u00FCn...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tapered end of the booster split into four immense segments, each pivoting smoothly back and out, to reveal an ungainly looking heap of equipment inside. Jonton peered at the screen in confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C...protects the docking mechanism during TMI. You can see sections of the brace at the tips of the shroud sections. Those are hydraulically actuated - the engineers didn\u0027t want to risk explosive detachment this close to the docked capsule - each powered by two Roncott actuators driven by an open-loop hydraulic system...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf scratched his head. \u201CThey\u0027re plannin\u0027 to land on the M\u00FCn in that? Or on that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGildas bounded over to the television and started prodding at the screen excitedly. \u201CThe kerbonauts sit in there, with the big engine behind them! The little engines are for steering...\u00A0this is the radio. There\u0027s one of the legs! Look, look!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFredlorf grinned at Ferry. \u201CGlad somebody knows what its all about,\u0022 he said. \u201CYeh could probably make one fer him out of a coupla tin cans and a cardboard box. Probably fly about as well as the real thing too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt can\u0027t fly,\u0022 said Gildas, \u201CThere\u0027s no air on the M\u00FCn so it\u0027s got rockets to land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton burst out laughing. \u201CYou listen to the lad, Fred - he\u0027ll set you right.\u0022 He turned his attention back to the television which was now showing a starry sky and a very much smaller spacecraft in the middle of the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C...jettisoned the descent stage and started a series of manoeuvres to rendezvous with the CSM.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThombal tapped his earpiece. \u201CAnd we\u0027ve just had confirmation from Mission Control that the lander, with kerbonauts Neling and Tommal Kerman aboard, is on final approach to the waiting CSM. He turned to the camera. \u201CWe\u0027re now going live to the Pioneer 2 .capsule and kerbonaut Calzer Kerman...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s one lean, mean flying machine you\u0027ve got there, Pioneer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yep, we stripped this hot-rod all the way back to the metal. Looks like we forgot to pack a heat shield though - thanks for the ride home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Pioneer. Good to see you too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view through the camera jogged sideways, tipped back and forth and then settled. Calzer tapped it, noting the blinking light on its cover. \u0022Flight, Calzer. How does the TV look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Squared away, Calzer. We can just about count the rivets.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander slid closer. Originally designed as a single piece shell, the crew compartment had been through several weight-saving redesigns and now resembled a flat, circular can studded with antennas, thrusters and other equipment housings. Incongruously, an ordinary aluminium ladder - available at almost any hardware shop - stretched from just below the crew hatch to beyond the protruding ascent engine nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Pioneer. Beginning inspection manoeuvres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCalzer stared intently out of the capsule window as the lander spun slowly about its axis. \u003Cem\u003ELooks good so far, fingers crossed... ah...\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u0022Pioneer, Calzer. Give me a plus forty yaw please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShadows drifted over the rear of the lander, pooling in creases and folds of crumpled metal. Calzer cursed under his breath then glanced guiltily at the communications panel. \u0022Pioneer - give me a minus ninety yaw.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowly the lander pirouetted around. Calzer keyed his microphone, keeping his voice carefully matter of fact. \u0022Okay, Flight, I\u0027m seeing some buckling on the commander-side staging mounts. The thermal shield is a little creased up but be advised that I am not, repeat not, seeing any damage to the gimbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight, Pioneer. That\u0027s consistent - we haven\u0027t noticed any off-nominal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E response under thrust. If there is any gimbal misalignment, the flight control systems have been coping.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy, Pioneer. We\u0027ll review the TV footage and flight control telemetry but right now, Lander and Guidance confirm. Please proceed with docking at your convenience.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sombre Thombal turned away from the screen and towards the two kerbonauts seated opposite him. \u0022Crumpled mounts, damage to the thermal shielding - that can\u0027t be good can it, Bob?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, like Geneney said, Tom, we\u0027re going to be reviewing the TV images and telemetry downloads very carefully indeed, but right now, I don\u0027t think this is anything that should give us too much concern.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerke nodded. \u0022The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E valves are quite loud from inside a spacecraft - you quickly get a good feel for how much they\u0027re working during manoeuvres. If the guidance systems \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E compensating for damaged engine gimbals, the crew would have definitely picked up on the altered thruster firings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob rubbed his chin thoughtfully. \u0022From Calzer\u0027s report, my immediate thought is that the decoupler between the two lander stages didn\u0027t separate cleanly, transmitting an offset load to the ascent stage. If that\u0027s right - and until we\u0027ve reviewed the spacecraft data it\u0027s simply too soon to say for sure - there are any number of ways we can work around that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you don\u0027t think this will affect the Pioneer 3 flight plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I hope not, Tom but it\u0027s just too soon to tell. If we need another Kerbin orbital test-flight before sending another Pioneer to the M\u00FCn - that\u0027s exactly what we\u0027ll do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smacked his lips and rolled the water around his mouth appreciatively. The pleasant smell of fresh coffee drifting in from the kitchen tickled the back of his nose but, for once, failed to elicit even a momentary twinge of regret. \u003Cem\u003EOh, that\u0027s much better. Maybe a trace of root rot left if I tried hard, but I really think that\u0027s fixed it.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sleep room door swung open and a thoughtful-looking Joenie wandered in. Jonton watched her fondly as she walked up to his trunk and brushed her hand over it. Solemnly, she rubbed one of his leaves between finger and thumb, then sniffed them, nose wrinkling at the pungent cinnamon aroma.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDaddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes, popkin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie scowled at him. \u201CDaaaaddy! You \u003Cem\u003Epromised\u003C/em\u003E you wouldn\u0027t call me that when I went to school!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton kept his face straight with an effort. \u0022I did, didn\u0027t I. Sorry pop...Joenie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie glared at him for a moment before curiosity got the better of her again. \u201CDaddy - why are you always talking to your tree?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton blinked. \u201CWhatever do you mean, Joenie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alby-at-school\u0027s daddy has a tree but Alby says he doesn\u0027t talk to it all the time like you. And mummy has a tree but she doesn\u0027t talk to it very much at all. Why do you talk to your tree all the time?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh Kerm.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u201CIt\u0027s a bit complicated, sweetheart,\u0022 Jonton said carefully, \u201CDo you remember when the tree was sick?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded hesitantly. Jonton smiled at her. \u201CAnd \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E remember that you were big and brave and told the tree to stop hurting me.\u0022 He paused to gather his thoughts. \u201CI had to talk to the tree for a long time to help it get better. And by time it was all better, I\u0027d been talking to it for so long that I was part of the tree myself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton waved at Joenie before tapping the side of his head. \u201CI\u0027ve got arms and legs and a head and eyes.\u0022 He rustled the leaf cluster next to Joenie\u0027s hand. \u201CAnd now I\u0027ve got a trunk and branches and leaves too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie leapt back from his trunk as if it were suddenly hot to the touch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s okay, Joenie, it\u0027s okay!\u0022 Jonton held out his hand and wiggled his fingers at his daughter. \u201CI can wiggle my leaves just like I can wiggle my fingers. Look I can wiggle these leaves,\u00A0or these ones, or these ones.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie watched wide-eyed as the leaves above Jonton\u0027s head slowly wafted back and forth. She pointed a trembling finger over his head. \u0022Those ones, Daddy - wiggle those ones.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton craned his neck towards the ceiling. \u201CThese ones?\u0022\u00A0he asked, flexing the nearest cluster that he could see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot those ones - the other ones!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThese ones?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo! The \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E ones. Stop teasing me, Daddy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not teasing you, sweetheart,\u0022 said Jonton, \u201CI just can\u0027t see where you\u0027re pointing.\u0022 A thought struck him. \u201CAm I hot or cold?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCold!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow about now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie giggled. \u201CGetting warmer, Daddy,\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about...these ones?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie bounced up and down, blowing on her fingers. \u201CHot, hot, hot!\u0022 she exclaimed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh-ha,\u0022 said Jonton, \u201CYou meant \u003Cem\u003Ethese\u003C/em\u003E ones?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded happily, then suddenly scrunched her face up in thought. \u201CWhen I helped Mummy plant all the red flower seeds, she told me that they would grow boots to drink water with. Do you have boots, Daddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton smiled. \u201CRoots,\u0022 he said gently, \u201CNot boots. I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E have lots of roots though - the beetles keep tickling them. \u0022He took hold of Joenie\u0027s hand and quickly ran the fingers of his other hand up her arm. \u201CLike this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTickly beetles?\u0022\u00A0Joenie giggled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CTickly beetles. And when they tickle me I have to talk to them and tell them to stop. They don\u0027t understand Kerba though, so I have to talk to them with smells. Do you remember your birthday butterfies?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie rolled her eyes. \u201CButter\u003Cem\u003Eflies\u003C/em\u003E, Daddy.

With the right smells, I can ask them very nicely to sit on my branches and wait for you to come and say hello to them. The tree is teaching me to talk to lots of other animals too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo the animals talk to you?\u0022 asked Joenie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA little bit,\u0022 said Jonton. \u201CThey tell me when they\u0027re hungry or scared and sometimes they can tell me where they\u0027ve come from and where they\u0027re going. The tree is teaching me how to make sure all the animals that live in the soil live in the right places to make all the plants grow properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTree school!\u0022 exclaimed Joenie in delight. \u201CI\u0027m going to kerbal school and Daddy\u0027s going to tree school.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton laughed. \u201CI suppose I am, sweetheart, \u0022 he said. \u201CI suppose I am.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCould I go to tree school too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton\u0027s jaw dropped. \u201CI...I don\u0027t know,\u0022 he said. \u201CMaybe - if we ask the tree nicely.\u0022 Hastily he dug back through his memories. \u003Cem\u003EPre-Age of Madness...group Communing...did kerblets...?\u003C/em\u003E Something stirred in a deep and distant corner of his mind. He prodded at it tentatively but the memories seemed curiously blurred, almost \u003Cem\u003Esoft\u003C/em\u003E as they skated away from underneath him, leaving a lingering echo of happy anticipation in their wake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;small kerbals good\u0026gt;\u0026lt;not Kerm\u0026gt;\u0026lt;good, not danger\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDimly, he felt something tugging on his arm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDaddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. \u003Cem\u003EI guess that\u0027s a yes. I\u0027ll need to be even more careful than I was with Gerselle though.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u201CUh - yes you can, sweetheart. I think that would make the tree very happy.

Then I want you to lie on the pillows so that your head just touches those leaves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie grabbed a pillow, flung it on the bed and flung herself after it. She squirmed under the leaf cluster, reaching up curiously to touch it. Jonton gathered himself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStop touching the leaves please, Joenie.

Now I want you to pretend you\u0027re watching a beetle and keep very still in case it runs away.\u0022 Jonton took a deep breath and lowered his leaves around Joenie\u0027s head, gently probing for a connection. Joenie flinched as the leaf hairs brushed against her skin, then lay very still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood girl.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHair after hair slipped slowly into place. Jonton reached out through them, hyperalert to any response. A fleeting connection formed on the very edge of his awareness and he froze. \u003Cem\u003EGently...gently\u003C/em\u003E. The connection wavered and then held. Faintly, Jonton sensed white light, curiosity and trust layered over fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s all right, Joenie,\u0022 he whispered, \u201Cit\u0027s all right...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDaddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bond intensified. Images swirled past him: a kerblet racing through a cornfield amidst shrieks of laughter; a procession of kerblets walking through a doorway, the rest of the building an indistinct blur; a bright airy room, colourful pictures on the wall, toys and books scattered over low tables; a picture book seen up close, with a voice murmuring in the background. Jonton let the images wash over him, allowing himself to sink into placid receptivity, reluctant to touch his daughter\u0027s mind any more than necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDaddy??\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m here, Joenie.

The bunks rushed towards him then skittered \u003Cem\u003Epast\u003C/em\u003E him before the image abruptly whirled around and he found himself staring down a vertiginous drop. A moment to catch his breath and then the world plummeted upwards exploding into a shower of cushions and muted giggles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ELet it go.

A tousled head peeped over the top, blinking sleepily. Two hands appeared, lifting the kerblet out of it\u0027s pouch and holding it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIs that Meleny\u0027s baby?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe image receded, woven background becoming an ordinary poncho wrapped around...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMummy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s right, sweetheart.

Now - who do you think this is?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe image blurred briefly then snapped back into focus. A blue poncho had replaced the grey one, the outstretched arms now holding a bald and distinctly grumpy looking kerblet. Jonton sensed puzzlement washing over the link.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI don\u0027t know, Daddy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, who do you know that always used to wear a blue poncho?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGrandma?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s right.

She poked her head around the sleep room door. \u201CJonton - have you seen Joenie this morning?\u0022 Then she saw the small figure lying on her bed and froze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhat are you \u003C/em\u003Edoing\u003Cem\u003E Jonton Kermol!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust then, Joenie chuckled to herself. \u201CSilly Daddy,\u0022 she murmured, \u201CSilly Daddy eating soil.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle\u0027s eyebrows shot up. She walked over to the wall of bunks and, slipping quietly into the nearest space, lifted her head up to the waiting leaf cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took longer than normal for Jonton to respond and when the white light faded, she found herself standing in front of a radiant young kerbal dressed all in green. A semicircle of beaming Witnesses stood behind her, all dressed in their best and some discreetly dabbing the corners of their eyes. Further in the background, Gerselle sensed a much larger crowd of well-wishers. She looked around but received only a vague impression of dozens of happy faces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pair of hands reached out and placed a golden torc around the young kerbal\u0027s neck. Hesitantly, she stepped forward and the image dissolved into a blur of warm green skin, silky dark hair and rustling fabric, all overlaid with a melange of musk and flowers. A welter of emotions poured down the link: happiness, relief, joy and overwhelming love, some bright and immediate, others tinged by a subtle incomprehension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGerselle.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJonton?

A smooth current of reassurance rippled over her together with an image of a familiar kerblet head on a pillow, with a cluster of Kerm leaves just barely brushing against its skin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle caught the faint, pleading undercurrent. \u201CDid he, sweetheart?

A sudden splash of water on stone caught his attention; he turned round to see Jonton taking a deep draught from an earthenware mug, before wiping his lips with the back of his hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s better - thanks.

Everywhere else has been zoned for overlapping Groves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CThe nearest site used to overlap with my range,\u0022 he said, \u201CBut not any more.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatbro\u0027s eyes widened as Jonton quickly described how he\u0027d learned to watch over the land around his Grove and his struggle to relinquish control over even a small part of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027ll need to be careful, but the poppy line should be enough of a marker.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd there won\u0027t be any overlap?\u0022 said Patbro hoarsely. \u201CNo Blight, no sparks, no...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, \u201C said Jonton softly. \u201CNo sparks, no struggle. Tivie\u0027s new Kerm should have all the room it needs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUpside-down?\u0022 Lodan looked disbelievingly at Dunney. \u201CHow the Kerm did they manage to install the blighted thing upside-down?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney dropped his creased and rumpled jacket on the seat of the chair and dropped himself on top of it. The smell of sweat and unwashed clothing clung to him like a miasma and the bags under his eyes spoke of far too many sleepless nights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAn infelicitous design choice compounded by too many late nights of adrenaline and coffee, multiplied by Kerm knows how many weeks of work without a day off,\u0022 he said wearily. \u201CWe managed to catch the other slip-ups but one finally got through the post-assembly checks. Frankly, I\u0027m astonished it\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E one that got through.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe instrument packages are modular. Power connectors on one end, data connectors on the other. Put them on a standard chassis and you can build whatever payload you need in short order. Testing and troubleshooting is nice and straightforward - just keep on swapping out modules until you find the duff one.\u0022 Dunney sighed and rubbed his eyes. \u201CUntil you drop one in upside down and short the main power supply through the IO bus. That just gets you a bang, a couple of crispy circuit boards and about three weeks work straight down the Wak.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhen we get a minute to breathe we\u0027ll redesign the connectors. For now we\u0027re just painting yellow warning stripes on the sparky end of each module. Before they\u0027re assembled I might add, to stop some sleep deprived engineer painting the wrong end of a finished one. Was there anything else, Director?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI was just going to ask how long it\u0027s been since you got any sleep yourself?\u0022 Lodan said mildly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat day is it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s about what I thought, \u0022Lodan poured a glass of iced water and slid it across his desk to Dunney. \u201CI\u0027d offer you coffee, but under the circumstances I don\u0027t think it would go down too well.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney grunted in agreement. Lodan looked at him thoughtfully, steepling his fingers over the bridge of his nose, before resting them on the edge of his desk. \u201CI remember,\u0022 he said carefully, \u201Cthinking long and hard before setting up Probodyne as a semi-autonomous KSA department. In the end I thought it was the right decision, and that putting yourself in charge of it was also the right decision.\u0022\u00A0He looked directly at Dunney. \u201CI still do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney finished his glass of water in one swallow. \u201CWell that\u0027s something at least. But would you get to the point. Celestial mechanics - least of all launch windows to Duna - wait for no kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan opened his mouth, then closed it again. \u201CVery well,\u0022 he said at last. \u201CAs of this minute, I am rescinding Probodyne\u0027s autonomy. I am closing down all Probodyne manufacturing facilities and suspending your staff pending two full nights of sleep and one compulsory day of rest and relaxation. Once I am satisfied that all members of staff are in a fit state to return to work, your autonomy will be reinstated. I trust my point is made clear, \u003Cem\u003EProfessor.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney lunged to his feet, planting both hands squarely on Lodan\u0027s desk and leaning towards other kerbal. \u201CQuite clear - \u003Cem\u003EDirector\u003C/em\u003E! And don\u0027t you ever...\u0022 He pulled up short at the sight of Lodan\u0027s raised eyebrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh - reinstated you say?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan just looked at him. Dunney sat down again and picked up his glass before noticing it was empty and putting it down. Quietly, Lodan refilled it and leaned back in his chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPoint made, Lodan, point made.\u0022 Dunney sighed. \u201CWe can make up the time. Rework the schedule, run extra night shifts...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COr we can bring in some more staff,\u0022 said Lodan, \u201CI\u0027m quite certain that Jebediah or Ademone will be able provide some help in that regard.\u0022 He saw the look on Dunney\u0027s face and sighed. \u201CI know it\u0027s not ideal, Dunney but I\u0027m sure they can send you one or two kerbals capable of holding a soldering iron and following instructions. Rockomax do have a very large satellite team of their own and even the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E managed to put a probe around the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRight - and we\u0027re going to be putting \u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E in orbit around \u003Cem\u003EDuna\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m not proposing to put them in front of a console and help you fly them.\u0022 said Lodan patiently. \u201CJust to help you build them. I know as well as you do that we can\u0027t afford to miss the next launch window - and I can\u0027t afford to burn out my scouting party either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe corner of Dunney\u0027s mouth twitched. \u201C Plenty of time before the Eve launch window opens,\u0022 he said, \u201CEspecially as I decided to skip the one before that.\u0022 He lifted a finger warningly as Lodan opened his mouth. \u201CI trust you\u0027ll agree that scouting out Eeloo is not an immediate priority?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u0022 said Lodan, \u201CNo, you\u0027re right of course.\u0022 He sighed. \u201CGo on - go and tell your team to take tomorrow off. And if I catch anyone on the assembly floor tomorrow, you can let them know that they\u0027ll be suspended indefinitely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWispy trails of ice crystals streaked the sky overhead, like a gauzy veil cast over the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar below, the grasslands and conifer forests of northern Kolus were gradually giving way to tundra. Even so, fingers of cultivated land still sprawled into the wilderness, in a patchwork of irregular fields, dotted with the inevitable Kerm Groves. On the western horizon, the very tallest peaks of the Northern Range shouldered their way through into the sky; their massive granite ramparts draped with folded bastions of dense white cloud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal swallowed the last mouthful of pressed sunfruit bar, made a face at her water bottle and hooked her oxygen mask back over her face. \u003Cem\u003EThe less time I spend in a wetsuit, the better. Though it might cushion this damn seat a little.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe waypoint indicator chimed and clicked over from three to four. Val glanced at her kneeboard, nodded to herself, and eased the Cloudrunner into a gentle bank. Rolling her wings level, she pushed the control stick forward, nudging her aircraft into a shallow descent towards the distant mountains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to the historical records, kerbals had inhabited Kenar Vale since the Age of Sail and probably long before that. Sheltered by the eastward curling tip of the Northern Range and watered by mountain streams, the valley was both fertile and well defended from the elements. Iskenar had begun as a small mountain community sheltering in the natural cave formations at the back of the valley. The city had long since outgrown its roots, although the original cave dwellings were still in use and a popular destination for the more adventurous kerbals from the southern reaches of Kolus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome fifty kilometres outside the city and situated at the mouth of the valley, Iskenar airport had been deliberately built at a safe distance from mountains and the often turbulent winds around them. Built from local greystone like the city itself, the roofs of its sculptured buildings planted with plots of grass and wildflowers, it blended seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. From the air, only the surrounding network of roads and runways saved it from almost invisibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Cloudrunner swooped down the outermost runway, flared gracefully and touched down with the barest jolt. Partially deployed airbrakes folded all the way out as the nose wheel kissed the tarmac. The little aircraft braked rapidly, swung smoothly around and rolled back up the runway, brakes and flaps retracting into its wings. With a final, expertly judged tap on the wheel brakes, Val turned the Cloudrunner\u0027s nose into the wind and shut down the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a sudden, deafening silence. Val removed her flight helmet, scratched her head and stretched as best she could in the confined cockpit. Then she reached down and pulled the canopy release lever. A freezing wind swirled through the cockpit, cutting through her sweaty flight suit like a knife and plastering the suddenly icy fabric against her skin. Cursing, she jerked the canopy shut again, and twisted the cockpit heater up to full. She scowled through the fogged up plexiglass, shivering as the clammy suit moulded itself to her legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pair of headlights appeared at the far end of the runway, dazzlingly bright as they raced towards her. Val blinked as the olive green car screeched to a halt and a figure leapt out, barely recognisable as a kerbal under its greatcoat and furred cap. She braced herself, pulled the lever and threw herself out of the cockpit, grabbing her windcheater as she went. The metal ladder stuck unpleasantly to her gloves as she scrambled clear of her aircraft and ran for the car. Her escort thrust an armful of heavy woollen fabric at her before dashing over to the Cloudrunner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal hastily pulled on the greatcoat and turned to see the stranger closing and locking the cockpit canopy before swinging easily to the ground. He jogged over the car and gestured at the door nearest to Val before jumping into the driver\u0027s seat and slamming his own door shut behind him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Welcome to Iskenar, Commander. Good to have you here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal snorted. \u0022Wish I could say the same.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a chuckle from beside her. \u0022Even on this pleasant autumn day without any snow falling?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only because it\u0027s too damn cold,\u0022 Val muttered, hunching down in her seat. \u0022What\u0027s the weather report from the border?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022About the same, Commander. We\u0027ve been lucky.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And the squadron?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The last of them flew in yesterday. Mountain rescue pilots mainly and more used to choppers than fixed wings. Most of them do hold a dual license but they\u0027ll be out of practice and none of them have any...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Combat experience,\u0022 said Val bleakly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. Officially we\u0027re to be a reconnaissance team of course but if the situation does go Humilisian on us...\u0022 he shrugged. \u0022That\u0027s why they asked for you, Commander.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal glanced at him, taking in his creased and weatherbeaten face and the insignia on his collar. \u0022What\u0027s your take on it, Sergeant?\u0022 she said at last, staring out of the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Messy ma\u0027am. The Wakirans have been pi... sorry - disappointed - with us ever since that idiot Keeper tried to take a shortcut through their mountains. Firesvar hasn\u0027t made any overt moves yet but we think it\u0027s only a matter of time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal closed her eyes. \u0022Great. Just great. Is the armaments and refitting team on site yet?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Waiting for us in the hangar. I\u0027ll be flying them, and the last of their gear, out in the Airhog tomorrow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It sounds like you have everything in hand, sergeant.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I try, ma\u0027am. Fuel truck is on its way - you\u0027ll just about have time for a coffee and a - well it\u0027ll be hot, ma\u0027am, that\u0027s about all I can promise - whilst you\u0027re waiting to get airborne again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stared into his empty cup, the Doreni Blue coffee sitting heavily in his stomach. \u0022We\u0027re doing our best,\u0022 he said at last. \u0022Making the lander lighter \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E stronger hasn\u0027t been easy. And the last thing we need is a repeat of the Pioneer 2 result - or worse - in Munar orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know that - and for what it\u0027s worth, I agree.\u0022 A flicker passed over Lodan\u0027s face.\u0022But without the inspiration of a Munar landing to prop it up, the colonisation program is going to look impossible. How long, Gene? If Pioneer 3 goes to plan, how long before Pioneer 4?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney caught the pleading look in Lodan\u0027s eyes and bowed his head to hide his shock. \u0022Six months at the earliest,\u0022 he said. \u0022Realistically, more like eight. The hardware shouldn\u0027t be a problem - booster assembly is going well, the capsule is almost ready for final outfitting, and Ademone is confident that KDS4 will be finished in the same timeframe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked up to see the KSA director\u0027s usual imperturbable expression firmly back in place. \u0022The training and flight planning is another matter though. I\u0027ve barely started roughing out the contingencies and aborts list, Nelton and I are starting to think that we\u0027ll need an actual trainer vehicle for the landing, rather than simulating it in the Whirligigs, and the trajectory team still haven\u0027t got a good handle on the mascon problem.\u0022 He paused. \u0022Sorry, mass...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan\u0027s lips twitched. \u0022Mass concentrations? I\u0027m familiar with the term - the Probodyne team have made quite sure of that.\u0022 He shook his head at Geneney\u0027s hopeful expression. \u0022Not as far as I know, Gene but I\u0027ll check.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That would be helpful,\u0022 said Geneney. He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u0022To be honest though, it\u0027s a small problem compared to the rest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan nodded. \u0022Could you send me an outline?\u0022 he said. \u0022A memo would do; I don\u0027t need the details, just something I can put in front of the Council to give them some idea of what\u0027s involved.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can do that,\u0022 said Geneney carefully, \u0022but I can\u0027t promise them a landing for Pioneer 4. They do realise that, don\u0027t they?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, the desk phone rang. Lodan reached out to pick it up. \u0022Direct line,\u0022 he said briefly, \u0022I\u0027d better take this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lodan.\u0022 He paused. \u0022Both separated and deployed? Excellent - please pass along my congratulations and thanks to the whole team. And Hope 1 and 2? Very good. Indeed but it\u0027s always reassuring when the universe decides to agree with us. Yes, he\u0027s with me as we speak, so if you wouldn\u0027t mind. Yes, I\u0027ll come over to Probodyne once we\u0027re finished. Thank you, Dunney.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLodan put the phone down and for the first time that afternoon, permitted himself a small smile. \u0022Hope 3 and 4,\u0022 he said. \u0022Both completed their injection burns to Duna and separated from their boosters on schedule. My thanks to your team as well, Gene - having Bill to help made things considerably easier.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGlad we could help.\u0022 Geneney looked at him soberly. \u201CBetween you and me, unless Duna turns out to be a complete disaster, it\u0027s going to be our best hope, whatever we get from the Laythe probes. But back to the M\u00FCn - the Council do understand that we can\u0027t guarantee a landing on the first attempt don\u0027t they?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s what they\u0027d tell you if you asked them in public,\u0022 said Lodan. \u201CIn private...well that\u0027s my problem not yours.
