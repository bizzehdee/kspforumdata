The mission: to land on the Mun, plant a flag and return home. So far, the planting of the flag went without problems. The landing itself turned out to be more like a crash though, which left Jeb\u0027s command module without either fuel or an engine to burn it with. This meant that the \u0022return home\u0022 part of the mission had to wait for just a little longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/903252542558540660/E96654C1285D7785BF981F1B174C636346FB649F/\u0022 alt=\u0022E96654C1285D7785BF981F1B174C636346FB649F\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EJebediah posing in front of what\u0027s left of his rocket\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot too long ago, a remote controlled rescue pod had actually safely landed on the Mun, but the landing was performed in darkness so it ended up more than 12km away from Jeb\u0027s current location. Bringing the pod closer would burn too much fuel and the risk of that going horribly wrong (and knowning his luck, probably killing Jeb) was too great. Jeb had to come to the pod. Walking was not an option. Not even Michael Kerbson had ever moonwalked for 12km\u0027s straight. It would probably be the death of Jeb.

To the great surprise of the scientists, mounting a 2 tonne vehicle on top of a rocket caused some stability issues early in flight. The scientists unanimously agreed that the C.A.R. itself could not be the issue, because it\u0027s design could be nothing short of perfect. Eventually, the decision was made to mount RCS thrusters on the rocket which would help the SAS module to keep the rocket stable at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902127097100688203/3EA0AB79CE3FADFB3AD2D6685EC0044D346AF1F6/\u0022 alt=\u00223EA0AB79CE3FADFB3AD2D6685EC0044D346AF1F6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThe Crapollo 3 mounted C.A.R.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter these modifications, the launch itself went pretty smooth. Achieving orbit around the Mun was no hard feat either. Landing the C.A.R. with it\u0027s mounted rocket was a problem though. It turned out that during descent, the C.A.R. was not in direct sunlight which meant its batteries were drained before it could touch down. Suffice to say, the C.A.R. crashed and burned. This caused great aggrevation between the KPL scientists and the Crapollo team. The KPL scientists blamed the Crapollo team for not including additional batteries on their rocket while the Crapollo team blamed the KPL scientists for not being able to power their own remote control module. The Kerman Appreciation Foundation (set up by Bill Kerman, not Jebediah, or Bob) was just happy that Jeb didn\u0027t get killed in the incident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith both parties eager to prove that it wasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E fault, a second C.A.R. was mounted on a Crapollo rocket. Not being confident that the Crapollo team could solve the issue, the KPL scientists mounted additional solar panels on the C.A.R. Packing enough power, everything was sure to go right this time. And indeed, descend to the Mun\u0027s surface went great. Up to 100 meters from the surface that is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902127097100406480/C23071CF10112A26748E824FFF8CCA7148175F4D/\u0022 alt=\u0022C23071CF10112A26748E824FFF8CCA7148175F4D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThe C.A.R., still mounted on the last stage of the Crapollo 3 carrier rocket, descending towards the Mun\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Sputtle* is the last sound the engine made. The folks at Mission Control looked at each other in horrified surprise. The lander had ran out of fuel. Angrily the KPL scientists looked at the Crapollo team who, in turn, appeared to be involved in a game of \u0022who can whistle a tune the most non-chalantly\u0022. The C.A.R. started to plummet towards the surface of the Mun. At least it was going the right direction. Then, a miracle happend. The C.A.R. crashed on top of the engine and fuel tank it was mounted on, which snapped off and exploded. The C.A.R. tumbled around but came to rest on its wheels. No critical systems were damaged, although one of the wheels failed to function.

The Crapollo team realized that they had been wasting their time all along. Their original rescue pod mission may not have been such a disappointment if the landing wasn\u0027t done in the dark. So the decision was made: a new lander would be mounted on a new Crapollo 3 rocket and be sent to the Mun to save Jebediah!
