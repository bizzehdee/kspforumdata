The conversation is usually going from funny to weird so we started making up Kerbal prayers. ZedNova made Kerbal rendition of \u0022Hail Mary\u0022 (my favorite), and I did the \u0022Our Father\u0022 and \u0022Gloria Patri\u0022 ones. Title for \u0022Our Father\u0022 was gpisic\u0027s idea.\n\n*Our Player*\n\n*Our Player, Who art in LKO, hallowed be Thy fuel, Thy science come, Thy will done on Kerbin as it is in LKO.*\n\n*Give us this day our daily boosters, and strenghten our struts as we strenghten our rockets,*\n\n*and lead us not into crash,*\n\n*but deliver us from Kraken.*\n\n*Kamen.*\n\n*Hail Jeb*\n\n*Hail Jeb, full of snacks.*\n\n*Our capsule is with thee.*\n\n*Blessed art thou among pilots,*\n\n*And blessed is the fuel of thy rocket, Kerbal X.*\n\n*Holy rocket, lifter of things,*\n\n*Transport our probes,*\n\n*Now and at the hour of our launch.*\n\n*Kamen.*\n\n*Gloria Kermani*\n\n*Glory be to von Kerman*\n\n*and to Gene,*\n\n*and to Mortimer:*\n\n*As it was at the launch,*\n\n*is now,*\n\n*and ever shall be,*\n\n*TWR above one.*\n\n*Kamen.*\n\nPresumably that\u0027s what some Kerbals recruits scream (in their gibberish Kerbal language, of course) while their capsule is hurling through the atmosphere enveloped in plasma.\n\nThere\u0027s more to come, we just need to find the original ones. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T23:50:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T23:28:17Z","Content":"Is this even allowed?
