A giant papermodel of a KSP craft im very fond of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ratsYVp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ratsYVp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Fouglas FC-8 is one of my older designs, the first one i built when the new MK-3 cockpit arrived along with some of the other revamped parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a very exiting time. The first thing after checking out the new parts that i wanted to do, was to build some form of a 4-engined passenger/cargo-plane and this is what i came up with. Looking at it now, i still really like the overall design, even tough it definitely has it\u0027s flaws.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs-well as being really fond of this design, there was another important aspect that made it perfect this sort of thing. Because it was built at such an early stage, the offset and rotation tools hadn\u0027t been added yet. It\u0027s all nice and easy to do ingame, but try offsetting a bunch of paper part\u0027s inside one-another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack then i didn\u0027t really care about the overall size of the project, i wanted something big and that\u0027s exactly what i got, and then some. The model had 23 pages of parts, with a lot of them having to be duplicated many times, added to that was the Shuttle that had 10 pages of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe length of the model is prettymuch exactly 100cm, the wingspans is also brobably about 90cm\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs i mentioned above, i started this project 4 years ago, back then there where no issues with space, as at that point i had basically the entire upstairs of our old house all for myself. I worked on the project for a while until it went on a pretty long pause. By the time the project continued, we had already moved to that small apartment in the edge of city that was way too small for me, and witch could not have fit a model of this size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow i finally again have the space for such a thing, as-well as the time and motivation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002201iiGpf.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/01iiGpf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the state of the project after those 4 years. Bit\u0027s and pieces of the model where stored in 4 different places, and im amazed everything was still there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was the assembled fuselage with the nose-gear installed, the box of assembled small bits, skins for the elevators and rudder, and finally the pile of bits that form the skins for the main-wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, the wing surfaces where so massive i had no choice other that to build the piece by piece just like in the game, tough i had to technically do it twice as i had to build the lower and upper surfaces separately. The elevators and rudder followed the same theme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRest of the aircraft was also built pretty-much like in the game, piece by piece. The nose gear for instance has 2 tires, two I-beams, two small cubic struts, and a rokea lamp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy original plan for the wings was to cut a piece of cardboard and glue the skins on to that, but i decided to instead make some wing-spars from 1mm thick iron-wire and some cocktail-sticks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe model is still a real pain to try and store as it is simply massive. It\u0027s also pretty-much on a clock right now, as im pretty sure it\u0027s going to share the same fate as the giant airship model, tough this time i have a plan. By just cutting some bits of tape, i can quickly slide the wings and the wing-spars off. The fuselage itself is really strong, aswell as the landing-gears, but the wings are simply too large and don\u0027t have the appropriate supports in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dQyApHs.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022900\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dQyApHs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neven if the thing does fall apart, it doesn\u0027t really matter, im just super happy i actually got the thing built and to stay together in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the main function of this aircraft kinda turned in to that of the SCA, i taught it\u0027d make sense to build a shuttle to go along with this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022thQ9so5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022674\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/thQ9so5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI taught that recreating my original shuttle would not be the best idea as it would result in a lot of repetition as it\u0027s built from a lot of the same parts, so i chose the KOS shuttle instead.\u00A0 Tough now that i look at it, it looks a little too cartoony on top of the FC-8. Maby one day i will design something special to go on top of the FC-8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe version of the FC-8 you see in that pick, is actually a special \u0022papercraft\u0022 version i made of the aircraft. It\u0027s a mix and match of the different features that appeared on the different versions of the FC-8. I basically kept on upgrading it as new revamped parts appeared. It was also built in a way that would make it even more papercraft friendly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there it is, another version of my fondest design, i hope you enjoyed taking a look \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: i doubt ill make anymore KSP related papermodels, but i do have some more 3D-printable stuff on the works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cynthia","CreatedById":208639,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-13T13:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks so cool!!!
