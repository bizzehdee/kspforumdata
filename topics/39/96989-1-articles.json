A little taken back by such an extravagant order by my normally exconomical space program, the sales rep started to tally up the total bill. Just as he was about to give the quote, Gus--who can be a real hardS when he needs to be--interupted him. \u0022By the way, you should know that we have had a shift in management philosophy at the KSC. We are now the big space agency in town and we will pay what we think is fair.\u0022 With that he dropped 60% of the funds on his desk and wheeled out the detectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see Bob thought that the gravioli detectors worked by amplifying the force of the negative graviolis, and by bringing enough of them together on the launch pad they might levitate. One day leading to booster free spaceflight (Jeb was horrified).

Instead of 10:1 science to funds conversion ratio I can 500:1 for a modest 150k funds launch. Contracts late game also offer so much rep and science that I can barely launch enough rockets to keep my reputation well under the 1000 ceiling. The only problem is that it completely destroys the desire to build economical launchers in favor or outrageous bohemoths because that gives me the best value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how have the admin strategies changed the way you play KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vrana","CreatedById":79915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T20:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI mostly play carrer these days and other then the inital few clicks on the building I have ignored strategies almost completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploits and lack of balance aside...
