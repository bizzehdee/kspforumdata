The wind and he were old comrades, after all, and had long since come to an... understanding.

Towards the center, led by a pair of massive nuclear-powered icebreakers, the rest of his flotilla circled. The cruiser \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E, two frigates and a handful of destroyers, the only remnants of the once-mighty Yaltik Sea Fleet that could be dragged out of mothballs on such short notice. It was thought, not that long ago, that they were no longer needed. Relics of another time, now an unjustifiable drain of the people\u2019s resources. Even the grand Tethys Sea Fleet had been mostly deemed surplus to requirements, and now all that had not lay at the bottom of that sea... or upon the beaches.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Admiral closed his eyes, the barest shake of his head nearly invisible as his coat ruffled in the wind. He, too, was a relic, and that he well knew. And his ship...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne gloved hand clasped the railing before him, softly, almost tenderly. The \u003Cem\u003EAdmiral Kermanitov\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was... never a grand ship to begin. Called a \u003Cem\u003Epocket battleship\u003C/em\u003E, she had been built to comply with some treaty or another when the power of the \u003Cem\u003EEver\u003C/em\u003E-Glorious Ussari Union had begun to scare the Foreigners across the sea. Her trio of turrets bore only a pair of 30cm guns each, her flanks were strong but her decks hardly armored at all, as it was thought what she lacked in strength she could compensate with speed. \u003Cem\u003EShe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0would need no icebreaker escort from the harbor. Built specifically for these cold waters, her hardened steel hull and sharpened prow could slice through even the thickest ice with sheer brute force.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe railing began to vibrate, and the Admiral\u2019s eyes drew open. The starboard engine coming to life, hesitant in the cold, the number 15 cylinder sluggish as always. No kerb alive or dead knew these decks better than her current Master. Indeed, it was on these very decks that the now-Admiral had taken his first duty cruise decades ago, following the tutelage of Admiral Kermanitov himself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, he knew, that would not be enough.

It grew in intensity, now coming through his feet as well... and then drawing greater still. The very air seemed to resonate, and soon a sound emerged from the reverberations: a low droning, a thing so loud it was nearly more force than sound. It rose higher and higher, digging into the Admiral\u2019s ears like blades, in time\u00A0sending even the howling wind to flee.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Admiral looked up, as a trident of Kuploev-95D bombers lumbered overhead, their counter-rotating propellers clawing at the air for every scant meter of altitude astride their heavy burdens. He watched them go, taking their sound with them, eventually disappearing into the cloud deck heading southeast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis orders, the ones on paper, and recorded on every traceable source in the vast bureaucracy, were clear. But the Secretary had given him very \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0orders, for his ears only, even as she handed him the envelope. Orders that, even if he was successful\u2014 \u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0if he was successful\u2014 would see him and his crews disowned, cast out as rogue agents, denounced as traitors and warmongers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBreak the blockade at any cost.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet if they were not successful, the burdens those bombers carried would come to bear, and he among a scant few people knew exactly what they were. A desperate act, to outmatch the unmatchable: a monstrosity created only to see if such a thing could even be done, a ship whose builders were far more concerned with whether they \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than if they \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E... the most fearsome warship the world had ever known, \u00A0crafted without purpose, and the Admiral had seen enough in his long years to know that a weapon made without purpose... eventually found one. It was an ultimatum for which the Ussari Navy, modest even in the best of years, simply had no answer. The Ussari Air Force, perhaps, could answer, but only with a slight which could not be taken back, an offense so grave as to shake nations and shatter worlds... if the Admiral did not succeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was... \u003Cem\u003Eimpossible\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last vibrations of the droning finally died away, yet the Admiral stood there, his eyes still cast skyward. Presently they drifted to the mainmast, where the tricolor naval ensign clung stubbornly to it against the raging wind. Once, beneath a very different flag, he had spent what years he did not spend on these icy waters hunting Erakonian partisans hiding in converted fishing trawlers. But now... those same defiant kerbs and kerbelles were allies and neighbors, and that frightful crimson banner had been relegated to its rightful place in a museum of shame.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had \u003Cem\u003Eseen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the impossible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had lived through the impossible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps... he could even \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the impossible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnbidden, one gloved thumb moved to feel the golden band on his finger.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, there was always... a price.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet the Admiral set his jaw, and mounted the last few steps to the bridge.

So,\u201D he glanced to her, \u201CI just started walking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd that was... more of an accomplishment than it sounds,\u201D Cal reached down, wrapping a final bit of white tape over his bandage, \u201CI guess raw sewage is not the best thing to marinade an open wound in. It hurt, \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0hurt, but I was pretty much a zombie at that point. No, not that kind. I just kept walking, for lack of anything else to do, still expecting to become a \u003Cem\u003Ereal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0zombie at any moment. I\u2019m not sure when the red streaks starting working their way up toward my knee, or when the ruined landscape became a fever dream that I couldn\u2019t tell from reality anymore. When I found the truck, I... thought it was just another hallucination.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal shuffled around on his own pile of soft, fluffy blankets, until he could lean back against the steel wall and stare up at his distorted reflection on the ceiling, \u201Cor... maybe it was worse than that. When I \u003Cem\u003Esaw\u003C/em\u003E, I remember thinking, maybe this is the demon waiting to take me down to the next Hell.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CW... what?\u201D Lolli peered at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CInfection is bad,\u201D he said to shifting specter overhead, \u201Cbut burns... burns are \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bad. I think the windshield stopped some of the thermal, but not all. He must\u2019ve been looking right at it when it went off, and...\u201D Cal suddenly threw his arms up in front of his face, as if warding. Then slowly, his open hands dropped to his lap, his eyes following them, \u201CI... thought he was dead... no person could \u003Cem\u003Esurvive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like that... and then he moved, and I thought I might just lose my mind then and there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe\u2019d been sitting there the whole time, days... I dunno,\u201D Cal flexed his fingers, \u201Ccouldn\u2019t even open the door. Couldn\u2019t see even if he could. But he could still talk. Mostly. No, not a demon, that kerb was... an angel. He was a doctor from way down south. Somehow he\u2019d found a way around the roadblocks, had his truck loaded with food and water, medicine, even a portable AutoDoc. Was determined to find a way into the city and help however he could, no matter what the government said. It was all... gone, of course, everything but the medical bag on the seat next to him.\u201D Cal\u2019s eyes drifted to the pack with the white cross at his feet. He drew it nearer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHe told me how to fix up my leg, how to reconstitute the maggot eggs, how much Cheeflex to take so I didn\u2019t die of sepsis just standing there.\u201D He produced a little glass vial from the bag, and began turning it over in his fingers, \u201Cand a little of this to take the edge off.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecters continued to dance above as Cal leaned back again, still twirling the little bottle as he watched them, \u201Cyeah, burns are bad. Don\u2019t really hurt much, all the nerve endings are gone. But... the bacteria just naturally on your skin, there\u2019s nothing to keep them out anymore, and they find a microbial paradise. Then once they get into your blood, they get everywhere, eating you from the inside out. Lactic acid builds up in the muscles, turning every movement into agony. Organs shut down one by one. If you\u2019re lucky, your mind is already gone when you start gasping for air. If you\u2019re lucky.\u201D He squeezed his eyes shut, shook his head back and forth, \u201Ceither way, your last conscious moments are nothing but pain, and... fear.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal\u2019s eyes drew open again, finding the little vial in his fingers, but looking straight through it, \u201Cthis... incredible stuff. Just a little bit, and you stop hurting. A little more, and you stop caring. A little bit \u003Ci\u003Emore\u003C/i\u003E, and you stop breathing. I, um...\u201D Cal\u2019s throat gave a twitch, \u201Che had a whole crate of the stuff. Wouldn\u2019t let me give him a single drop. Insisted I save it for people it could actually help.\u201D His eyes now turned to Lolli, dark and heavy, \u201Ctrust me, infection is a really lousy way to die.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA soft, mournful wind rose up outside, causing the structure to sway just slightly, as the two sat in silence by the ruddy glow of surplus oxygen candles. Cal crumpled back against the wall once more, deflated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI stayed with him a few more days, until... until there was no more point,\u201D he said, \u201Cjust another pile of rocks in the wasteland. I tried going north, towards the border, but it\u2019s impassible. I dunno what happened there, somehow... it looks even worse. Dozens, maybe \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of craters layered on each other stretching all the way to the sea. So I tried going south again, thought I could find whatever was left of the chain of command towards Capitol City.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, that\u2019s the \u003Cem\u003Elast\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0place you want be,\u201D Lolli quickly shook her head, \u201Cit\u2019s \u003Cem\u003Eworse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than a war zone. You, um... heard?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal nodded, glanced to a stack of old newspapers in the corner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLolli drew her feet up until she could hug her knees, \u201CI... never thought it would be like that. I never thought it would \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at all, it felt like... everything was going so \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0until this year. I... watched Bangkong tear itself apart on live TV, eating cheese doodles and sipping Chablis with my friends on a big leather sectional, scrolling through Twits on my phone and saying \u2018how awful!\u2019 before going back to another stupid Mugbook \u2018What\u2019s your Omish name?\u2019 quiz. Then the rest of the world started coming apart, and I thought, \u2018it\u2019ll all blow over, it\u2019s all \u003Cem\u003Eover there\u003C/em\u003E, not \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0The President gave his resignation speech, and all the talking heads on TV could do was yell at each other about it. Things started getting \u003Cem\u003Eweird\u003C/em\u003E, but it was always somewhere \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E, it felt so far away, y\u2019know? And all the while, the talking heads kept arguing, calling each other awful things all \u2018cuz they didn\u2019t agree on how to spend other people\u2019s money and thought \u003Cem\u003Etheir guy\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0needed to be the one in charge, that was all that mattered.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u2019t listen for an answer, just shook her head, \u201Cand then, one day, just like that, all the stores were out of toilet paper.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait what?\u201D Cal raised an eye... bulge, \u201C\u003Cem\u003Etoilet paper?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA nod, \u201Cstupid thing, right? The talking heads kept saying awful things, and \u003Cem\u003Edire\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0things, and everybody just started hoarding toilet paper.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrabbing the stack of newspapers, Cal ruffled through them, but only looked back at her more confused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI laughed about it, Twitted out a bunch of stupid jokes, told people \u2018stop buying toilet paper!\u2019 and \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was saying \u2018stop buying toilet paper!\u2019 but people just kept on buying toilet paper. And like...\u201D her hand rose up, just below her throat, \u201CI started getting this weird feeling in my chest, I thought it was just indigestion from too many cheese doodles\u2014 \u003Cem\u003Eplenty\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of those still around\u2014 but... it never went away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then... the stores started running out of rice, and chicken... the Governor tried to shut everything down, implement rationing, went on TV and told everyone \u2018the situation is under control!\u2019 But this little... spot, right here, just kept getting \u003Cem\u003Eheavier\u003C/em\u003E... like someone was reaching in and squeezing my heart, all the time. I took a-a couple of Darnitol\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsEmoji\u0022\u003E\u2122\uFE0F\u003C/span\u003E just to sleep at night. People started fighting over toilet paper, and then... then they started \u003Cem\u003Ekilling\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0over it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd the talking heads and the pundits and the Twit Lords just egged them on, said it was okay as long as they were the \u003Cem\u003Ewrong kind\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of people who thought the \u003Cem\u003Ewrong things,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and I just kept watching from my couch, eating and drinking, saying everything was fine while this lump got heavier and heavier. The fighting moved from the stores to the streets, these huge crowds throwing rocks and bottles at each other, and then sticks and clubs. And the TV kept showing it, and it was always some place \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E, and then everything started burning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI sent the staff home early, told them everything would be back to normal in the morning, and I just sat there and watched it all. But not \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E. Can\u2019t happen \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0And then... the power went out.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLolli stared down into the glow of the oxygen candles, as if trying to burn away the shadows and specters that still danced upon the metal walls, \u201Ceven then, I tried to convince myself it was just a circuit breaker, a blip in the system... it\u2019ll come back on any minute now... just any minute. I sat there in the darkness, staring at a blank wall, feeling my heart beating faster and faster while something squeezed it tighter. And that was the first time I realized... I was \u003Cem\u003Eafraid\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike,\u201D she gagged down a dry lump in her throat, \u201Clike I never had been before. Kerbonaut training was scary... the first time I stepped up to the microphone before that chanting crowd... signing my first check with more zeros than my last family reunion,\u201D she shook her head, \u201Cbut... nothing, ever, like what I felt that night... and still do right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd then the fires came, and I tried to get everyone out, but... I just made it worse. I... shouldn\u2019t have waited but I needed to \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E, see with my own eyes,\u201D Lolli squeezed those eyes shut, leaned back a bit to drive the heels of her hands into them, \u00A0wiped her face on a sleeve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey, um...\u201D Cal slid over next to her. He reached out a hand, hesitated, then gave her a soft but awkward pat on the back, \u201Cyou\u2019ll be okay. This isn\u2019t easy, none of it, but you\u2019ll make it though.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shook her head, \u201Chow can anyone? The whole world has gone mad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI didn\u2019t say \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E,\u201D he gave her a nudge, \u201CI said \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EYou\u2019re\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0gonna get through this, but We the People are pretty much boned.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI didn\u2019t think it would be like this,\u201D she said to the floor, \u201CI didn\u2019t think it would... \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at all. And here I am, sitting in a milk truck with a strange kerb eating dog food by candlelight.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal shot up, \u201Cwait, you, um, \u003Cem\u003Eknew?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe barest, most fleeting shadow of a smile crossed her face as she glanced up at him, \u201CI buy the same stuff... I\u2019d know that can anywhere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt crept into a smirk, \u201Ctry not to think about it too hard, right? At least it\u2019s not seafood flavor.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201D Cal chuckled, \u201Cyou\u2019re a survivor, like me. You\u2019ll do fine. And since you\u2019re not coughing yet I guess I\u2019m not contagious, either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWait, \u003Cem\u003Ewhat?!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D Lolli shot back from him, \u201Cyou mean you weren\u2019t \u003Cem\u003Esure?!\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell I... it was a theory!\u201D his arms went up, \u201Ccan\u2019t exactly do clinical tests out here, y\u2019know? I might be immune but there was still a \u003Cem\u003Esmall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0chance I was a regular Typhoid Larry, but no, I wasn\u2019t sure. Thanks for confirming my research, though.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe grinned widely at her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe threw an empty dog food can at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u2019re a lousy medic, you know?\u201D she glared at him over crossed arms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, I\u2019m not really a medic, I\u2019ve just had some training.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?!?\u201D Lolli\u2019s eyes shot wide, then dropped to her bandaged hand, \u201Cbut-but... you know suturing... and Cheeflex... and Lucile staccato!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003ELucilia sericata.\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat too!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe scowled, \u201CI thought you were one of those guys using the reserves to pay your way through med school!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal followed that with a long, bitter laugh, \u201Cmed school? No, never been. Med schools usually prefer if you\u2019ve been to college first, and colleges usually prefer if you\u2019ve actually, well, graduated high school.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou... didn\u2019t?\u201D she said a bit more softly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shook his head, \u201CI... have trouble reading. The letters get all... turned around.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA chilling thought occurred to her, \u201Cbut... if you can\u2019t read then how did you know which vial to\u2014\u201C\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CRelax,\u201D Cal rolled his eyes, \u201Cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with my memory. If I see something once it\u2019s locked in my head like I\u2019m a walking filing cabinet, I know which bottle is which. But, that only gets you so far taking a test, or trying to write something.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSilence stretched out before she spoke again, much more softly, \u201Cso, um... what did you do, \u003Cem\u003Ebefore?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHm?\u201D he started, \u201Coh, I was a janitor. The hours are crap but the pay is... well, pretty crap too. But I got to meet Edmund Kerman.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat?!\u201D Lolli shot straight up, \u201Chow did you meet Edmund Kerman? \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0never even met Edmund Kerman! Well, not officially...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal leaned back again and sighed, \u201Cwell, it was a long time ago. Right after that thing on the M\u00FCn but before he got, y\u2019know, \u003Cem\u003Esick\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0I was cleaning a building where he\u2019d leased an office, and one night I found him in there working late. I offered to come back later but he was real personable, invited me right in and we chit-chatted while we worked. He found out I was in the service and called me a crayon-eating blue rocket cornflake, so I called him a primped-up numpty chairforce zoomie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLolli could only blink and stare.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr stare and blink.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCal laughed, \u201Cand \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it was like we were old buddies, he whipped out some dusty old highland \u003Cem\u003Enaln\u003C/em\u003E\u2014 the \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stuff, in the fancy bottle\u2014 and we traded stories for a while. You remember Hurricane Bertha, smacked up Zaroeka \u2018bout fifteen years ago?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course, how I could I forget \u003Cem\u003Ethat?\u003C/em\u003E\u201D she raised an eye at him.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was my first call-up after basic, though by the time I got there it was... just a recovery operation. But it turns out Edmund and I were deployed to the same airbase, not far from here, actually. He\u2019d been flying rescue missions since\u00A0day 1. We\u2019d probably walked past each other dozens of times without realizing it. Even ticked off the same obnoxious Coastie Captain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe chuckled to himself, found his old flask and turned it over in his hands, \u0022yeah, real class act, that guy. Edmund, not Captain Underpants. We shot the scat a little bit longer before I had to move on, but not before he looked me right in the eye and said he said he knew a guy who knew a guy, and he\u0027d put in a good word for me.

With barely a stretch he unpinned a metal ladder from above and swung it down before climbing up and fiddling with a hatch. Lolli grunted and threw up a hand against the burst of dazzling light that suddenly appeared, but by the time she could look again, Cal had vanished. She frowned after him, looked down at her bandaged hand, and had just started wondering if she could climb with it when something slammed against the metal wall. She recoiled back from it, and it returned with a ringing staccato toll of steel against steel. Her good hand closed around something solid just as more blinding light met her eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CC\u2019mon, it\u2019s all clear,\u201D Cal said from a new hole at the far end of the room, \u201Cand don\u2019t you go throwing my dog food around, that was hard to come by.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLolli glanced down at the can in her hand.

I haven\u2019t seen airplanes in weeks,\u201D Lolli mumbled as she looked off after them. She glanced back to Cal, whose face was drawn with confusion. Before she could ask, the sound once more returned, only far louder and \u003Cem\u003Ebigger\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than ever. An ear-splitting mash of roaring and whining and droning that forced her hands to her ears, yet even so burrowed into her skull until it was somehow spinning in circles inside her mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that was brushed away in an instant by what now passed over the trees. Sheer awe drove away any thought of pain, or any thought at all, at the sight of something that at first appeared to be little more than an enormous, bulbous wing. Details emerged as she stared, an equally huge fuselage was slung below the wing, barely longer than the wing was wide, sprouting a pair of rudders almost as an afterthought at the rear and lined all along its belly not with wheels but massive tank treads.

They passed more trucks, some with glinting paint and still clad in their protective wrappings, others burned to unrecognizable hulks. Off across a street jammed with cars yet eerily silent, more skeletal buildings and boarded-up storefronts leered at them. Soon they reached the trees, and Lolli saw it was not a thicket but a once-manicured greenbelt, the overgrown brush already dead and brown. She hugged herself tighter against an icy breeze rising around them. The far edge of the trees followed quickly, and she nearly gasped as they huddled against one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom this cliff overlooking the sea, she could see for leagues and leagues off across the slate-grey waters.\u00A0Waters which were... far from empty.

Even with what little I have known of that kerb, any other who could best him is dangerous indeed,\u0022 she regarded her friend for a moment, \u0022yes, I think \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are the entire reason anyone made it back at all, and our adversaries were denied their prize, and that is what matters most.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer eyes wandered to the wobbly end-table, \u0022is... is that it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas made an annoyed grunt from across the room. He trundled over, took the gilded scepter from its resting place and handed it to Dibella.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stared at it a long while before speaking, \u201Cso much trouble... so many \u003Cem\u003Elives\u003C/em\u003E... for this...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA soft \u003Cem\u003Eclick\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0drew their attention, and the three turned to find the Empress coming forth, Burdous supporting her by her elbow, looking worried. Her face was calm and assured, as unreadable as stone. The gold and diamond tiara on her head was set just so, and the thick, pale braid upon her shoulder was neat and even, but the rest her hair and makeup gave subtle tells of being hastily put back in order, the red around her eyes not quite hidden. She approached the group, pausing a moment to smooth her voluminous skirts, before fixing each one in turn with her eyes, finally landing on Dibella.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI must beg your pardon,\u201D the \u003Cem\u003Eslightest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bow of her head, \u201Cthe emotional flow of the Bond is very strong.

The Empress took it with a nod, her eyes casting over the shining gold, gleaming jewels, and impossibly intricate engravings and filigrees adorning every centimeter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, casually tossed it onto the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few more jewels went clattering off across the marble to join various piles of debris. Four mouths fell open in unison. But then, as the eyes above those mouths watched, the little island of space on the floor debris surrounding the scepter suddenly grew wider.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStand back,\u201D the Empress cautioned, her eyes fixed upon the golden shaft, \u201CI am not strong in Earth, this will... take some effort.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe produced an unremarkable, dull-colored ring, slipping it on the first finger of her left hand and then touching it to the blue m\u00FCnstone around her neck. For a time... a long, uncomfortable time... nothing at all seemed to happen. The Empress stared down at the scepter, her brow creased in concentration, her eyes making subtle little motions as if she were seeing something no one else could. Edgas had just cleared his throat and looked about to speak, when a tiny jewel \u003Cem\u003Eping\u003C/em\u003Eed from its setting and skittered off across the floor. Another followed, and then another, and more simply fell down onto the marble. The delicate gold filigrees softened and grew indistinct, and then the entire scepter wilted to the tile. It began to take on a dim, ruddy hue... and all at once kilograms and kilograms of solid gold simply became liquid, and spread out in a gleaming, shimmering puddle of wealth. The marble beneath let out a loud \u003Cem\u003Ecrack\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in protest.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost unnoticed, the Empress gasped and stumbled, and for a moment Valentina thought she might collapse, but then her eyes grew wide and alert, fixated on what now lay in the golden pool. Her face edging on something like awe, the Empress reached out a hand, only to snatch it right back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo,\u201D she said softly, \u201CI should not even touch it.

She tapped the object once... tapped it again, then picked it up with the smallest effort and a faint \u003Cem\u003Eclick\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe... expected... \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Ething.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter everything, she thought there \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be... a brilliant sunbeam shining from a break in the clouds? Subtle, otherworldly music as the entire world paused in awe?

The Staff in her hand was maybe half a meter long, utterly featureless, and of such pure white Valentina could not tell if it was just \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0white or maybe glowing slightly. One end was a couple of centimeters wide, tapering along its entire length to a sharp point, so that it was more a very long cone than a rod. She flipped it around to gaze at that point. For a moment she thought of testing it with a gentle finger, and then thought again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhoah,\u201D Burdous breathed next to her, his eyes wide, \u201Cwhy do I get the funny feeling that if you looked at that thing under an electron microscope, the tip would be only a single atom wide?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFar less than that,\u201D the Empress intoned, \u201Cthe Power can manipulate the physical in ways you have not yet glimpsed.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u201CWhooooah...\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas peered closer, \u201Chm...

Dust motes hung in a sunbeam through the window. Dibella\u2019s hand rose slowly to her mouth. Burdous\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change much, the same squiggly little smile, his wide eyes perhaps a bit wider, and... \u00A0not quite looking in the same direction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore so than usual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlightly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe silence was soon broken by a shrill keening from deep in the back of his throat.

A helmeted head squeezed through the ragged hole in the door, scanning around the room until it found them. It let loose an ear-splitting shriek that grew and grew in intensity as it struggled unsuccessfully to squeeze its shoulders through.

Air so thick and muggy that for an moment she thought she was suffocating. Sweat instantly broke out on her forehead from tropical heat, and she stumbled forward on something soft and yielding. Her brain struggled to comprehend the bizarre mix of signals her senses poured into it. The look of terror on Edgas\u2019s face barely cut through it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CBehind you!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain she turned, to find a bloodied Child loping through the void they\u2019d just come through. It snarled and raised its rifle. Once more motion simply \u003Cem\u003Ecame\u003C/em\u003E, and to her own horror she found herself reaching for the rifle barrel. There was a \u003Cem\u003Esound\u003C/em\u003E, she felt like she\u2019d been punched, yet she somehow managed to use the leverage of her smaller stature to \u003Cem\u003Etwist\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and \u003Cem\u003Epush\u003C/em\u003E, catching the Child off balance and making him stumble backwards. He fell, there was an awful \u003Cem\u003Ewet\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0noise that turned her stomach, and the snarling abruptly ceased.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CClose it!\u201D Valentina spun to the Empress, \u201Cwhatever you did, \u003Cem\u003Eun\u003C/em\u003E-do it!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Empress nodded, did... \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Ething, and the glowing hole in the air reversed as it had grown, then winked out to nothing. Valentina stood there, panting, staring at where it had been. She raised the rifle still in her hand, which somehow felt lighter. It just sort of... \u003Cem\u003Estopped\u003C/em\u003E, about halfway along its length. Where it was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E, she could clearly see the inner workings\u2014 those which hadn\u2019t fallen out onto the ground\u2014 even the cordite powder trickling out from cartridges in the magazine. Everywhere the metal ended, it gleamed in the peculiar light, as if polished to a mirror shine. She threw the rifle down, tried not to look at what was there \u003Cem\u003Enext\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to it, and hoped \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was the source of the growing feeling of \u003Cem\u003Ewrongness\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sweeping over her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina turned to the others, her breathing growing shallow but not slowing. They stared back from three masks of horror.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYour \u003Cem\u003Earm\u003C/em\u003E...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe raised her arms... but only one hand appeared before her eyes. Somewhere, there was an awful grating sensation, and \u003Cem\u003Epain\u003C/em\u003E, but it belonged to someone else, a thousand lightyears away. The sweat on her brow grew icy, and the vague awareness came that she was going into shock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI will pass out now...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs shadows began to dance around her vision, the Empress came forward, and clapped hands to her cheeks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe bone is shattered... but, the pieces are there... mostly,\u201D she said softly, her eyes making little motions, \u201CI can \u003Cem\u003EHeal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this...\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn instant later every muscle in Valentina\u2019s body seemed to snap taught at once, as white-hot fire coursed along her nerves. She cried out in a loud voice, but as quickly as it came, it ended. The two kerbelles stood there, staring at each other, panting in the humid night air. Then Valentina sat down \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E, and the Empress collapsed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo!\u201D Burdous rushed over to her, while Edgas knelt by Valentina.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou... alright?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe held up her other hand before her face, flexed it a few times. It felt weak and tingly, as if she\u2019d been sleeping on it, but it seemed to follow her command. She nodded a vague assent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas turned, \u201Chow is she?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s... not that bad...
