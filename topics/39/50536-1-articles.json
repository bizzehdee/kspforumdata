Here\u0027s a 3 part series of my trip to Eeloo using a mothership design with a lander and probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m uploading the first part as the second and third are being processed so I\u0027ll be updating this post as those come out of the cooker. It\u0027s fairly long, I wanted to show all the nitty gritty details of what these trips entail so that our newer players aren\u0027t too disappointed when they attempt to fly out there and realize that 3 minute video they watched of cinematic postcards had so much stuff going on behind the scenes. Let me know what you think and enjoy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/SkdWSQc-c0E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/SkdWSQc-c0E\u003C/a\u003E part 1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vencaslac","CreatedById":57518,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/SXHc4KsWYbY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/SXHc4KsWYbY\u003C/a\u003E part 2 where Jeb and Bill land on Eeloo and do some science\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meithan","CreatedById":76123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T16:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just watched Part 1, and I must say: great work!
