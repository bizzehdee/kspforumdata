After the landings the interest in space travel quicly dropped and people interested on the field became fewer over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway this quiet and cold morning was different, it was the launch day of a tiny probe that was the first time anything builded by kerbals will leave LKO in a long time, all of the workers woke up early in the morning, and went to the facility, one of the workers, named Solong kerman, was on the typical routine that follows a launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe woke up early on the morning, earlier that any other day, went downstairs trying to not wake up his family, did some exercises and then ate his breakfast, but today was not an ordinary day for Solong, he was thinking of applying for the astronaut training program, it was his dream since he had memory to go to space, it didn\u0027t matter if just to orbit or to the mun or crash into the sun, her only cared about getting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elater in the morning, Solong took his kids to school and then drove all thw way to ksc, he was very nervous as he was one of the people responsiple of the rocket\u0027s functioning, after all he was involved in the designing and building of it, and if something failed he was going the be one of the first people blamed, also the idea of being rejected from the astronaut training program didn\u0027t really help to his nerves, also he was thinking how was going to tell that to his wife, she definitely wasn\u0027t going to like the idea, but he tried his best to remain calm and entered throught the big gates that announced he was inside KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMorning, Solong we where waiting for you, said the receptionist without looking away from here screen. Morning, replied Solong, as he started running to the mission control building, he entered and started to wonder why everyone was smiling maliciosly, SOLONG! said mission control commander the recently 89 years old Gene Kerman, you\u0027re late again we almost had to cancel the launch!, so-sorry sir i had to left my kids at school, Gene said it was the last time he was going to forgive him, he sat on his chair en everyone started he pre-flight checklist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe coundtdown started, and when the clock hit 0 the engine roared in fire and the lauch clamps relelased the beast as a giant cloud of smoke formed around the launchpad, the whole mission control watched the craft as it asccended across the atmosphere, some time later they could hear a might boom as ir crossed the speed of sound, a minute later they confirmed stage separation and the flight perfomed flawless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ei131Wg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ei131Wg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yt35lLz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Yt35lLz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E they all celebrated their success when Gene said something: Alright, we have some important news, it seems the president has come personally to inform us, he\u0027ll be here in 6 minutes so get ready and go to the conference room, we\u0027ll wait for him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolong wondered what was so important that the president come himself to tell them, must be special, he grabbed his belongings and went to the conference room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: thank you for reading my first story, its the first time i ever write something and i need your help,tell me my mistakes so i can correct them!, a word bad written or anything else!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
