The first vessel to see the benefits of this decision was my newest model of fuel tanker (built explicitly for refueling my transfer stage from the Munar Flyby mission).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe deciding factor was the low, low cost of tank volume in the new version of Procedural Parts (version 0.9.19), which finally makes the MUCH larger tank volume needed for such a low-density fuel cost-effective.

I settled on a mission profile based on having three stages, the first and last of which are reusable, and the middle of which is disposable. The reason for this is simple- the first stage can return directly to the KSC, and the last stage can perform a full orbit or two before returning, but the middle stage is stuck in an unhappy medium- it neither has enough velocity to make it around Kerbin, but too much velocity to simply turn around and head back the way it came. It also has to deal with re-entry heat (with Deadly Re-Entry installed), which adds cost and complexity to building in recovery-capabilities. Which makes recovery far less worthwhile, when it travels halfway around the planet first...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that being said, the main reason the middle stage wasn\u0027t worth recovering was simply because the parachute alone would have been almost as expensive as this part of the rocket- with a small engine (cost approx. 400) and a Procedural Parts fuel tank (cost less than 50), adding a parachute (cost 422) and a guidance system (cost 700 for a radial MechJeb unit- can be brought down a bit with inline fairings and an Okto probe core instead) would have actually LOST me money after recovery- and that\u0027s not even accounting for any reduced payload capacity...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you saw, though, the middle stage was over-engineered, and actually made orbit along with the upper stage/payload. The problem is, without a larger-diameter rocket engine, or an engine-cluster (which I didn\u0027t unlock the Procedural Fairings part to allow me to build thrust plates for until AFTER this launch- all I had access to was a NovaPunch 2.75 meter thrust plate), I couldn\u0027t have built a monolithic upper stage with a good enough height-to-width ratio to not fall over and explode after landing... So I decided to concentrate all the expensive parts (guidance systems, docking ports, reaction wheels, etc.) in the upper stage, and just abandon the middle stage (I\u0027ll try to de-orbit it for roleplaying though, even if doing so is going to cost me...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnough analysis though. I tend to get a little carried-away with explaining the reasoning behind my decisions (sometimes I think I should work for NASA, where this kind of careful analysis is necessary- I already love space- but unfortunately I did not major in a field like aerospace engineering or physics...)

Do you *KNOW* how heavy nukes are in RealFuels mod with \u0022Stockalike\u0022 settings? Because \u0022Stockalike\u0022 attempts to replicate real-world TWR\u0027s and ISP\u0027s, but doesn\u0027t change engine thrust, they become ridiculously heavy (real NERVA engines had quite a bit less thrust). A probe mission would be far too small to justify using a nuke (other than one of the KSP-Interstellar particle bed reactors- which are based on later reactor designs for nuclear propulsion after NERVA that had better TWR than the original NERVA project.

For one, they \u003Cstrong\u003Ecompletely\u003C/strong\u003E missed out on the distinction between high-ISP, low-TWR rockets, like almost any form of Nuclear Thermal Rocket (including Timberwind), and engines that are actually \u003Cstrong\u003Euseful\u003C/strong\u003E for launch vehicles rather than just orbital maneuvers and long-burn upper stages...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/03/us/secret-nuclear-powered-rocket-being-developed-for-star-wars.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/03/us/secret-nuclear-powered-rocket-being-developed-for-star-wars.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you read the Wikipedia article closely, you will notice that the Timberwind rockets, unlike NERVA, actually did have enough thrust to lift their own weight- a TWR of about 30. But the specifications PALE in comparison to the TWR (and raw thrust figures) for comparable-sized chemical rockets, which can easily reach a TWR of over 100 and more than 12 times the raw thrust of the largest Timberwind rocket designs. so definitely NOT a good heavy launch stage. The largest Timberwind design had a diameter almost as large as Saturn V (8.9 vs. 10 meters) and a sea-level thrust of \u0022only\u0022 1,912 kN, with an 8.3 metric ton mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I currently have access to Timberwind-style reactors (my Kerbals, unlike fools like Mr. Aftergood, don\u0027t have overblown fears about nuclear rocketry- which is *FAR* less dangerous than atmospheric nuclear warhead tests), but I don\u0027t intend to use them for any missions just yet. The best-ISP fuel for a Nuclear Thermal Rocket is LqiuidHydrogen, and that has serious boil-off problems in RealFuels (even the alternatives, LqdMethane and LqdAmmonia, still boil off at a slow rate). My plan is to wait for generators and Dreadicon\u0027s final KSP-I/RealFuels integration config, and then send up LqdWater as a stable storage medium for hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also use the Oxygen component for an afterburner-like effect to increase the thrust. Using LOX decreases the ISP substantially, but you actually get more Delta-V for the same fuel tank volume this way than just carrying LiquidH2 due to the much higher fuel-density (and substantially better thrust thane using the electricity for plasmodynamic engines- while still exceeding the ISP of LH2/LOX or especially Hypergolic chemical rockets...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T00:14:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T00:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy tanker mission was a success, and I\u0027ve got a couple albums of screenshots to show you guys for it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first album, I show rendezvous\u002Bdocking, and the fate of the dropped middle stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hPbOW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
