Do a little project. It\u0027s a little embarrassing because I know there are so many other talented builders and video editors around that would put this video to shame, but I think the video\u0027s message is a lot nicer than the product itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUs humans have gotten pretty far in terms of tech and our accomplishments as a whole, of course, we\u0027ve only scratched the surface of what we can know, but in just a short amount of time, we\u0027ve made leaps and bounds in advancements. I am also an avid metalhead, so I thought this song, The Galaxy by Dethklok, seemed very appropriate. This game is so much more than just a game, I bet it teaches people more about physics and aerodynamics and in a much more entertaining way than school ever could in my opinion. Especially when you take into account all the mods that give you specific details about what you\u0027re building and how you\u0027re flying, etc. It\u0027s a learning experience than just a super radical game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this video is just a small showcase of our human endeavors, even our failures (in the beginning of the vid), into space and the worlds beyond our own through the vision of Kerbal Space Program. And as the song states, \u0022This is the beginning, it\u0027s all starting now.\u0022 Enjoy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/b9HjKHnqMBQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
