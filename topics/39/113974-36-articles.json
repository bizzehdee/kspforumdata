Jerdous Kerman? W\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022Valentina, my old friend!\u0022 Jerdous beamed from the hatchway, \u0022*Rat teebya veedet!* How long has it been?\u0022\n\n\u0022Um, er...\u0022 she hesitated as he reached across the threshold to shake her hand, \u0022too long, my friend! Ah, not since that state dinner in Dachland, no?\u0022\n\nHe scratched at his chin, \u0022hmm, I thought it was that conference in Gytep?\u0022\n\nThoughts charged through Valentina\u0027s head. That itching in the back had moved to burning, then muffled screaming. This wasn\u0027t right. This wasn\u0027t right *at all.* What she finally *said* was\u2014\n\n\u0022What in *P\u040F\u0490\u0407\u0419\u0027S* name happened to your face?!\u0022\n\nJerdous\u0027s hand moved from his chin to paw at the myriad of butterfly closures and other assorted bandages. Color touched his cheeks. \n\n\u0022It\u0027s, um, a long story. Involves an angry flying rat. I\u0027ll fill you in later. But for now...\u0022 he moved further inside and beckoned her onward, \u0022welcome aboard the *Determined Consternation!*\u0022\n\n\u0022The... *what?*\u0022\n\n\u0022Burdous let me name her, but the first one I picked was already taken,\u0022 then mumbled under his breath, \u0022stupid rabbit.\u0022\n\nValentina just shook her head, trying to form a coherent thought, \u0022w... what are you *doing* here? I thought... they told me the ship was unoccupied...\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeah, you\u0027d be surprised how often that happens around here,\u0022 Jerdous shrugged, \u0022being the Chief Engineer of the project, my brother has a lot of pull down in the Hole. He sent me up here a couple of days ago to start getting things ready for him. He\u0027s coming up with the first load of engine parts to oversee the assembly.\u0022\n\nValentina followed him down the docking tunnel, with Igor behind, into a small control room at the crux with the other three. It all looked far too familiar. She kept expecting to hear scratching in the walls, or an incessant *plip... plip... plip...*\n\n*There is darkness here... just like **there**...*\n\nSomething in the back of her mind was *railing*. \n\n*Someone else. He said there was someone **else**...*\n\nJerdous\u0027s grin faltered as he looked back at her, \u0022um... you must be hungry after your trip up,\u0022 he stumbled, \u0022can I offer you anything? Cheeseburger perhaps? Just how you like, nice and rubbery.\u0022\n\n*Cheeseburger...*\n\nA flicker deep in her brain, like distant lightning, to a night long ago. To a withered face... and haunted, pleading eyes...\n\n*...I have nightmares a lot...*\n\n...while beyond the walls the wind raged and the rain poured...\n\n*...have you... ever felt like you\u0027ve been privy to something no one else knows? No one else in the world?*\n\n...as if in warning...\n\n*What if you saw the real face of the Devourer...*\n\nOne by one, the pieces clicked into place.\n\n*...and **wanted** to die...*\n\nAnd with them, the horrible realization...\n\n*...but couldn\u0027t?*\n\nThat it was too late.\n\nJerdous turned fully, and grinned at her with something... *other*.\n\n\u0022Igor!\u0022 Valentina cried out, \u0022grab him!\u0022\n\nShe wasn\u0027t at all surprised when Igor\u0027s huge, iron-like hand closed around her own neck instead. \n\n\u0022Figure it out, did you?\u0022 Jerdous smirked, \u0022pity.\u0022\n\nShe struggled, tried to punch, kick, but Igor might as well have been made of stone. Barely able to breathe, she managed to look up at him, and what she saw chilled her blood more than any abandoned M\u00FCnbase. Igor was gazing at Jerdous with a wide smile and bright, attentive eyes... like a devoted dog at its master. Jerdous beamed back at him, like a hunter at his trusty hound.\n\n\u0022Behold, my greatest work,\u0022 he said softly, \u0022unstoppable, unshakable, and *unquestioningly* loyal,\u0022 he tapped a finger to his chin, \u0022but I should have spent more time on his vocal center.\u0022\n\nValentina felt like her own lungs were fighting her. The whole world tried to swim. A bare breath got through. \n\nJerdous raised an eye... bulge, \u0022well, you haven\u0027t figured it *all* out, I see.\u0022 Floating there, he reached into the neck of his shirt and pulled out a medallion on a cord. At first she thought it a perfectly black disc, but then she *saw*... It wasn\u0027t black at all. It was *nothing*. It was *nothing* given form, a hole in the very air. The M\u00FCnstone beneath her flightsuit began to thrum. \n\nJerdous said a word that shouldn\u0027t have been possible, that stung her hears like a wailing child, and everything *shifted*. The light in the room drew back, as if fearful. That... *thing* around his neck... Like a perversion of the very light itself, it radiated *darkness*, and cast shadows of light. Jerdous\u0027s face seemed to twist before its corruption, his features withdrawing into the weathered bones of a skull. \n\nIn an instant, the M\u00FCnstone went so cold against Valentina\u0027s chest she might have screamed had she not been fighting for air. What made her blood run cold was not that, however. Jerdous spoke... but *Igor\u0027s* lips moved, and the words whispered *inside* her own head as they had so many years ago.\n\n*Do you see it yet? Do you see? I am the Voice in the Wilderness, I am* Ailene\u0027nen*, the One who Goes Before, I am the Herald of the Dark Lord of Oblivion...*\n\nThe darkness faded away, and Jerdous\u0027s face returned, \u0022and you are a silly peasant girl who\u0027s gotten in over her head.\u0022 He tucked the amulet away, \u0022you can\u0027t get the best of me. I have always been two steps ahead of you. I always have a contingency.\u0022\n\n\u0022You...\u0022 Valentina croaked, fighting for air, \u0022...Edmund\u2014\u0022\n\nJerdous\u0027s smug grin became a snarl, \u0022Edmund! Edmund. Nearly ruined. *Everything!*\u0022 He shoved a finger at her, \u0022I told him to leave you alone, to leave you to me. Instead, I had to pick up the pieces after his goons shot up half of Kerbin City! Do you have *any* idea how many palms I had to grease to smooth that over?! How many pockets I had to fill?! I\u0027ll see that he suffers for that, until he\u0027s outlived his usefulness. See how he likes his medication regimen cut in half!\u0022\n\nHe floated nearer. She could see something... wild in him, close to breaking, \u0022I told him to leave you *alone!*\u0022 A mad chuckle, \u0022oh yes, I know who you are.\u0022 He waved the finger, \u0022I\u0027ve seen this movie, read this book, I know the Rules. When I knew you couldn\u0027t be brought into the fold, I wanted to leave you alone! Give you everything you wanted... a prosperous career... the respect of peers and Powers... I wanted to keep you fat, happy, and ignorant!\u0022\n\nHis eyes flicked up and down, \u0022well, I guess two out of three wasn\u0027t bad.\u0022\n\nFloating back, he beamed up at Igor once more, \u0022before you were *anything*, I sent Igor to you. Gave him orders to protect you at any cost. And *despite* your annoying ability to slip away, he has performed flawlessly!\n\n\u0022Oh yes, I *know* who you are,\u0022 his voice grew soft and sure, \u0022the Dark Lord warned me about you. *I* knew well enough to leave you alone. I was warned about that *other* one too, but he is of no consequence. He\u0027s rotting in a basement at the Kerbal Space Center while his mind slowly implodes. Edmund will deal with him, if necessary.\u0022\n\nValentina could barely hear anymore. Spots began to flicker at the edges of her vision. Her own mind felt like it was imploding as she continued to fight for breath. \n\nJerdous took no notice, \u0022The Dark Lord told me you would come. Not even *He* could stop that. So instead, I simply *brought* you here. According to *my* plan. So you would be helpless, and abandoned. You have *no one* now.\u0022 His face cracked into a wide, horrible grin, \u0022yes, only here, at the end, do you finally understand.\u0022\n\n\u0022In just a few weeks, I will depart for the fourth moon of Jool, alone, and with *this*\u0022 he brandished the medallion, \u0022I will release the Dark Lord from His prison, and my reward... shall be vast. You can\u0027t stop me! You, a miserable little *toad*.\u0022\n\nA little air seeped through, but only *just* enough, just enough to keep her conscious. Some part of Valentina\u0027s mind that was still aware realized with horror that Igor knew *exactly* what he was doing, *exactly* how hard to squeeze. But as her consciousness foundered and perception skewed, she sensed... something *else*...\n\nAlmost... she could almost...\n\nHer vision dimmed, played tricks... she could sense... almost *see*... something like a... a *conduit*... stretching out of her own mind, towards Jerdous... bidden by that curse around his neck. It wasn\u0027t like P. Kerman, it was *different*... but there was a familiarity...\n\n*This is how he spoke in my head...*\n\nNot really knowing how, she stretched out, trying to feel along it, back towards *him*. To pierce his mind, to do... whatever it was she had done bef\u2014\n\nValentina slammed up against a sticky, greasy wall of revulsion. She drew back, had to, she couldn\u0027t bear such foulness. It was like... like a slick of shimmering, rancid oil on the surface of clean water. She couldn\u0027t pass through *that*, but... she could *see*... see *beyond* it...\n\nAnd if she could see, then she could also...\n\nValentina gathered her strength, and Jerdous\u0027s eyes grew wide as she spoke without speaking. \n\n*No... **you** are the toad.*\n\nAwe... fear... *doubt* bloomed across his face. He glanced down at the medallion, and the tenuous link imploded in on itself. Even Igor\u0027s grip loosened, giving Valentina a few full breaths and restoring her power of speech.\n\n\u0022You are the toad,\u0022 she panted, utterly without malice, \u0022you do not see it.\u0022\n\nJerdous\u0027s eyes darted between her, the token, the walls. Conflict seemed to play across his face, but he rallied, hate rising and raging into his eyes. \n\n\u0022No... No, you lie!\u0022 he sneered closer again, \u0022you\u0027ve managed to make yourself quite the little pest, just like the girl. And... and just like the girl, I\u0027ll kill you, too... and then\u2014 oh...\u0022\n\nHe saw what flowed across Valentina\u0027s face, and roared with laughter, \u0022oh-ho-ho! You didn\u0027t know! Of course you didn\u0027t know, how could you?\u0022\n\nThe grin returned fiercer than ever, \u0022the girl, the dummy\u0027s nosy sister. She\u0027s dead. I killed her myself.\u0022 A bare whisper, \u0022I enjoyed it...\u0022\n\nJerdous might have said something else, or he might have said nothing at all. Valentina\u0027s last tethers to sanity snapped like thread, as reality itself began to crinkle and crack around the edges. Great, wailing screams fled from her lungs as tears coated her wide, unblinking eyes like birth cauls. \n\nShe knew, she *knew* it would happen, she ***knew!*** And yet her conscious mind had denied it. Rejected it like a foreign body. Edmund... Igor... Jerdous himself... Somehow she *knew*, and formed a cyst around the knowledge, deceiving herself, *protecting* herself, unwilling to see what was really there. \n\nBecause what was really there was too horrible to accept. What was *really* there was far, *far* worse. \n\nAnd now it was too late. She couldn\u0027t help them. She couldn\u0027t help anyone. She had failed. Darkness closed in, narrowing vision to a point. She was distantly aware of Jerdous laughing, Igor smiling. It was too late. \n\nIT IS NOT TOO LATE.\n\nThe darkness *deepened*. Time seemed to dilate, stretch out. Valentina could *feel* something like a heartbeat, beating in slow time with her own.\n\nNo, *not* in time... in a perfect, syncopated inverse to her own. The thing around Jerdous\u0027s neck... it was *glowing*... Glowing... with *darkness*. An entirely new voice, one she did not know, whispered in her mind like silk on steel.\n\nEVEN NOW, IT IS NOT TOO LATE.\n\nShe looked up, dream-like, at Jerdous. \n\nSTRIKE HIM DOWN. REACH OUT TO ME, AND I WILL GIVE YOU POWER. OVER LIFE. AND OVER DEATH. YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST SO MUCH. STRIKE HIM DOWN, TAKE HIS PLACE, AND I WILL RETURN *ALL* THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM YOU. EVEN *HER*. EVEN *HIM*. EVEN *THEM*. THE GRAVE IS NO BAR TO ME.\n\nCALL OUT TO ME, DESTROY HIM, AND I WILL RAISE YOU ABOVE ALL THINGS OF THIS WORLD. I WILL SET A CROWN OF WORMS UPON YOUR HEAD, AND A ROD OF DOMINION IN YOUR HAND, AND YOU SHALL RULE OVER ALL THAT LIVES. WHAT YOU BIND SHALL BE BOUND, AND WHAT YOU LOOSE SHALL BE LOOSED. \n\nCRY OUT TO ME, ONLY SAY THE WORD, AND YOU CAN SAVE THEM *ALL*. POWER IS YOURS TO HOLD. SIEZE IT. USE IT. AND ACCEPT *WHO YOU ARE*.\n\nIT IS NOT TOO LATE. \n\nIn slow motion, Valentina blinked against the tears coating her eyes. The darkness was *right*. It had *always* been right. The power was there, *always* there, just over her shoulder. Waiting. Beckoning. Beyond reason. Beyond rage.\n\nWith a bitter flash of pain, Valentina surrendered to it, *embraced* it, and embraced *who she was*.\n\n\u0022Jerdous Kerman,\u0022 she thundered with the weight of Ages. \n\nHe stopped laughing. \n\n\u0022It is *not* too late.\u0022\n\nHis smug grin faded into terror.\n\n\u0022I still believe in you.\u0022\n\nConfusion, \u0022w... what?\u0022\n\nStill straining against Igor\u0027s grip, she said, \u0022you have been lied to, corrupted by that... that... that... *thing!* It is not what you think it is.\u0022\n\nJerdous\u0027s mouth flopped open and closed, as if in all his scheming, he had not anticipated *this*.\n\nValentina held his eyes with her own will, \u0022I have been to the Shadowwell on the M\u00FCn. I have *seen*. Seen the *truth*.\u0022\n\nHe blinked, \u0022wait, you have?\u0022\n\nShe tried to nod, \u0022that monster on Bop, it is not your dark lord. It is fail-safe, a booby trap! A thing not of this world or any other. It is the antithesis of life itself. If you let it out, it will destroy everything and everyone\u2014 including you, *if* you are lucky. It will twist this world into something so contrary to life that no thing alive can ever exist here again. It will do this to protect something *else*. Something *worse*.\u0022\n\nJerdous swallowed hard, \u0022w... what worse...?\u0022\n\n\u0022I do not know,\u0022 she fixed a level look at him, \u0022I do not *want* to know. Something so awful, that whatever Power dragged your monster from its hole, feared it enough to despoil an entire universe to keep it untouched.\u0022\n\nHe stared back at her, eyes wide, his head shaking in half-hearted denial. \n\n\u0022Jerdous, *listen* to me,\u0022 she struggled again, could almost feel Igor\u0027s grip loosening, \u0022it is not too late for you. No one can walk so long in the dark that they cannot return to the light. I will help you.\u0022 *Close... it needs to be **close** to work... his eyes...*\n\n\u0022You... will?\u0022 he drifted a breath nearer. \n\n\u0022Yes! Together, yes? We will fight it *together*. Look at me!\u0022\n\nCloser still, \u0022together...?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, *look at me*...\u0022 she stared into his eyes, trying to... what *had* she done before?\n\n\u0022Look at me...\u0022 something in his eyes...\n\n\u0022Look...\u0022\n\nHis *eyes*...\n\n\u0022HAH!\u0022 Jerdous shoved back from her, bouncing around the small space with mad laughter, \u0022hahahahahahah! Did you really think that would work?!\u0022 He stopped to glare at her, \u0022did you think you could just *whisper* clever words to me, get me in so you can do your scourgey thing? Well, you can\u0027t!\n\n\u0022Besides,\u0022 he grinned with far too many teeth, \u0022that won\u0027t work on *me*, anyway! *I\u0027m* not a shadowbearer!\u0022 He pulled out the medallion again, beaming up at it the way Igor beamed at him, \u0022I am the Dark Lord\u0027s one and true servant!\u0022\n\nThe feral grin returned, \u0022and *you* are out of time. Igor!\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*, Comrade?\u0022\n\nIt tore into a slasher\u0027s smile, \u0022*kill her*.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*, Comrade!\u0022\n\nThe meager flow of air was instantly cut off. Valentina couldn\u0027t gasp, couldn\u0027t even choke. She batted helplessly against a grip like iron. She felt the ligaments in her neck begin to stretch...\n\n\u0022Wait!\u0022 something... flashed across Jerdous\u0027s face.\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*, Comrade?\u0022\n\nThen he frowned, \u0022not in *here*, do you have any idea what kind of *mess* that will make in zero-G?!\u0022 He pointed to the hatchway, \u0022do it in *there*, we need to dump that waste anyway before my brother gets here.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*, Comrade!\u0022\n\n\u0022And stop calling me \u0027Comrade!\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022Yeth, marthter!\u0022\n\n\u0022*Cut that out!*\u0022 Jerdous squealed, \u0022gah! I\u0027ve *told* you to lay off the rattails, they\u0027re giving you an abnormal brain!\u0022 He raised a hand to his temples and muttered, \u0022I *knew* I should have spent more time on the vocal center...\u0022 A finger pointed again to the hatch. \n\nIgor\u0027s brow creased as he looked from Valentina to the rail he was holding opposite, uncertain how to move in microgravity with one hand full. So he simply threw her down the tunnel. She bounced off the wall, smacked her head on an edge opening up a long gash in her brow, and tumbled off into the lifeboat. \n\nWhen she recovered, one hand pressed against her head, Igor was already coming through the hatch like a hungry animal. Little wobbling spheres of blood slipped between her fingers. She was out of time. Out of options. Beyond help. \n\n*Trust no one.*\n\n\u0022Ivan,\u0022 Valentina said with resignation, \u0022close the hatches.\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance.\u0022 *Thunk. **Thunk!***\n\nIgor paused, unsure for a moment, then smirked back at her.\n\n\u0022IVAN,\u0022 he rolled his huge eyes, \u0022open hatches.\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027m sorry, Igor, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t do that.\u0022\n\nHis eyes flare open, then narrowed, \u0022stupid machine, *open hatch!\u0022*\n\n\u0022The Captain has placed me under a Priority One voice command lockout. I will only respond to her instructions.\u0022\n\nA deep rumble built inside Igor\u0027s throat, seemed to settle in the corded muscles around his neck. \u0022*You*...\u0022\n\n\u0022Ivan.\u0022 Valentina held Igor\u0027s glare as she drifted farther into the lifeboat. \u0022*Scorpion*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance, executing mission contingency \u0027SCORPION\u0027. Attitude lock engaged. Hatch interlock override engaged. Docking clamp release disabled. I am in start up.\u0022 Realization bloomed across Igor\u0027s face, his lips drawing back into a wordless snarl.\n\n\u0022Beginning ignition sequence. Sixty. Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight...\u0022\n\nValentina worked her shoulders in long, practiced circles, arrested her slow tumble with the slightest adjustment of posture. Her arms came up, balled fists and furrowed brow, a tight smile that did little to hide her barred teeth.\n\n\u0022Fifty-six. Fifty-five.\u0022\n\n\u0022Come at me now...\u0022 One foot slid back to rest lightly on the forward bulkhead. \u0022I *break* you.\u0022\n\nIgor roared and lunged forward through suddenly empty air...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nConfused, Jerdous drifted up to the closed lifeboat hatch. Rapped a single knuckle against the small window. Peered in. Raised an eye... bulge. Then his eye caught the numbers on a monitor clicking down.\n\n*\u0022Oh, crap!\u0022*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nValentina\u0027s knee found Igor\u0027s face, evoking a thin spray of spittle. She ducked another swipe, rebounded off the ceiling, drove her fist square into Igor\u0027s gut. She might as well have punched a concrete wall. \n\n\u0022I trusted you!\u0022 Valentina dodged a fist swung with such force she was very nearly drawn back in its wake. \u0022You were like *brother* to me!\u0022\n\n\u0022I lied,\u0022 Igor grunted and swung again.\n\n\u0022Forty-seven. Forty-six. Forty-five...\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022Crap! *CrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapCRAP*!\u0022 Jerdous darted through his ship, sailing up through another hatch into the galley, seeking a window. He found one, and through it he saw nothing but the *inside* of the lifeboat\u0027s yawning engine bell. \n\n*\u0022CRAP!!!\u0022*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOne of the breakers blew out in a dazzling shower of sparks, the lights in the cabin wavering as the automatics rerouted the power. Valentina struck again, grabbed, pivoted, dashed Igor against the inner airlock with little effort and even less effect. She was in her element, moved with a natural, effortless grace born from years spent in microgravity. But Igor only had to get lucky *once*... a single blow might well kill her. \n\n*Just keep him busy...*\n\n\u0022Forty. Thirty-nine. Thirty-eight...\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022No!\u0022 Jerdous squealed as he pounded his fist against a button, \u0022all my work!\u0022 The open hatch on *his* side of the docking port didn\u0027t move.\n\nINTERLOCK ERROR, a nearby screen chided. He pounded again and again.\n\n*\u0022NOOOOOO!\u0022*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Keep him busy!*\n\nA massive fist swung past, then another. The third swing nearly got her. Val planted both feet on Igor\u0027s chest and kicked hard, tucked into a somersault that was just fast enough to avoid his grasping hands. Igor paused, his fingers uncurling to reveal a torn swatch of Val\u0027s flight suit. He was learning, much faster than she\u0027d thought he would, and her own muscles were starting to burn from the effort. She was running out of time...\n\n*Keep him away from the hull!*\n\n\u0022Thirty. Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight...\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nINTERLOCK ERROR\n\nJerdous punched at a keyboard. \n\nINTERLOCK ERROR\n\nHe typed something else. \n\nINTERLOCK ERROR\n\nSomething *else*.\n\nERROR\n\nERROR\n\n**ERROR** \n\n\u0022Crap!\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n*Keep him away from the hull!*\n\n\u0022Twenty-one. Twenty. *Nineteen*...\u0022\n\nIgor\u0027s fist slammed past her into the bulkhead as she twisted aside. Val let her momentum carry her to the other side of the cabin, tried to catch her breath, turned to find Igor staring hard at the wall. He drew back and hammered the bulkhead a second time, watching in fascination as the metal twisted and warped under the blow. Igor watched, and he stared. \n\n\u0022Twelve. Eleven. Ten...\u0022\n\nUnderstanding spread across his face. \n\nVal dug deep, launched herself across the cabin, drew from the very well of her soul everything she had ever been, everything she would ever be. Fingers clawed, teeth sank into flesh, and Igor drew back from the pod\u0027s flimsy hull in a roar of surprise and pain.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe thumbscrews cut his fingertips open by the time Jerdous got them out. He tossed the panel aside, grabbed a wire, *pulled*.\n\nSparks and a loud *bang!* spewed out, but the display never changed. \n\nERROR\n\n*Pop!*\n\nHe pulled another wire.\n\n*Zzzzzt!*\n\nHe pulled *another*.\n\nERROR   \nERROR  \n**ERROR** \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u0022Nine. Eight. Seven...\u0022\n\n*Just a few more seconds...*\n\nShe knew she couldn\u0027t beat Igor. Couldn\u0027t *stop* him. He was too strong. There was no way out of this for her. For anyone. \n\n*One sting... and we all go down.*\n\n*Fire the engines. Destroy that ship. Do what you came to do.*\n\nNothing else mattered, now. \n\nThen Igor\u0027s arm twisted over his shoulder with a hideously unnatural range of motion. He tore Valentina free, hurled her at the far wall. She struggled to get her feet toward it.\n\n\u0022Six... Five... Four...\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nJerdous wrapped a trembling hand around a fat red cable. The tremors worked their way up his arm, washed over his cheeks, cascaded across his lips. Quivering, they pulled back from teeth that clenched until cracks formed. \n\nIn a single instant, as if his jaw was no longer able to contain the conflagration within, his face exploded into an unbridled scream of fury until the very last whisp of air had been driven from his lungs. \n\nHe pulled. \n\nThe hail of sparks was instantly extinguished as the entire docking ring blew out, knocking the lifeboat away and blowing Jerdous and everything else unscrewed out into space in a titanic rush of air...\n\n...and ripping the black medallion from his neck. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe jolt knocked Valentina off balance just as she hit the wall. That was all it took. Igor caught her squarely in the head with his best right hook as she bounced back towards him. All the world seemed to shift sideways, loose focus in a flash of static. Bone cracked. His backswing hit her again, sending her hurtling into a the other wall. Senseless, reeling, one hand pinned her to a panel while the other drew back for the deathblow.\n\n\u0022Ignition commit. Brace. Brace. Brace. Brace.\u0022\n\nThe world *shift*ed again. The two of them slammed into the rear bulkhead, which was now the floor.\n\n\u0022One G.\u0022\n\nValentina tried to focus, tried to crawl. Igor found her again.\n\n\u0022Two Gs.\u0022\n\nHe stood, picking her up like a rag doll.\n\n\u0022Three Gs.\u0022\n\n\u0022And now,\u0022 he grinned in triumph, \u0022I break *you!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Four Gs.\u0022\n\nThe world swam, \u0022no... wait...\u0022 she managed.\n\n\u0022Five Gs.\u0022\n\n\u0022No wait!\u0022 Igor raised her over his head.\n\n\u0022Six Gs.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, *weight!*\u0022\n\nRealization passed his face for an instant, then the inner hatch he was standing on simply collapsed beneath his crushing mass. Once more the world *shift*ed, rushing past in a blur. \n\nPain. \n\nCracking. \n\nScreaming. \n\nThen the feather embrace of weightlessness returned. \n\n\u0022Burn complete.\u0022\n\nValentina forced her eyes open, tried to claw her way back to awareness. She was floating in the aft compartment. Her head hurt, *everything* hurt... yet not as much as it should from such force. \n\nIgor. Igor must have broken her fall. \n\nIgor...\n\nInstantly awake but still reeling, she looked over and saw him, a twisted mass of torn flesh and bone. Bone that was far *too* white, and *unbroken*, ripped from its ligaments. Amorphic globs of blood drifted through the small space. \n\nSuddenly the mass moved, filling the chamber with wet, guttural snarls like some beast from the abyss. One hand appeared, then the other, and then\u2014\n\n*...his face...*\n\n*...his eyes...*\n\nHis teeth were shattered, leaving cruel, jagged points behind.\n\n*...his **eyes**...!*\n\nHe pulled himself around to come at her again, a roaring, gnashing monstrosity, *\u0022I KILL YOU!\u0022*\n\nBut it was too late. Her hand found what it sought. \n\n\u0022Ivan!\u0022 Valentina cried, \u0022Disengage hatch safeties.\u0022\n\n\u0022Compliance.\u0022 A *thunk*.\n\nValentina held that monsterous, eyeless glare, *\u0022D\u0424 SV\u0407D\u0414\u040D\u0407\u04B0\u0414, S\u0413\u0414L\u0407\u0418S\u051E\u0407!\u0022*\n\nIgor lunged. \n\nShe exhaled as hard as she could, and pulled the hatch release. \n\nThere was a *whump!* and a rush, and then the peculiar sensation of the moisture on her tongue beginning to boil. Her right arm screamed out, bone grated, but somehow... somehow she kept her grip on the handle. All this passed to triviality, however, at the vision now before her.\n\nThe brilliant blue and white disc of Kerbin shone like the light of Creation itself. No glass. No faceplate. After all this time, all she had been through, at last there was nothing between her, and the real face of the Creator. She blinked eyes that were somehow wetter despite their moisture boiling away. A nagging pull drew her back from the cosmic dream. Squinting down, Igor was still clinging to her foot. \n\nShe drove the other down into his face as he flailed. It was like kicking a rock. She stomped again at his silent scream of rage. A cloud of delicate, red-tinged ice crystals erupted from his mouth. \n\n*He tried to hold his breath...*\n\nFeeling her own lungs begin to scream, she drove her foot down once more. Her shoe slipped off, and for one brief, horrible moment, Igor\u0027s face was normal again, stretched with terror, and then he was gone, tumbling off into the void. \n\nDarkness began to dance around the edges of her vision. Moving deliberately, she pulled herself back up into the ship. Braced, ground her teeth against the pain her her arm, and hauled on the hatch. \n\nIt wouldn\u0027t close. \n\nOnly a distant low ring carried through her bones greeted her. She tugged on it again, it rebounded off the rim. \n\nDarkness closed in, tingling began to spread across her hands. Eyes burning, lungs raging, she let forth a silent scream of her own and pulled one last time. \n\nNothing. It didn\u0027t even move.\n\nNumbness washed over her, the darkness swallowed her, and Valentina was no more. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-10T07:48:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2017 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-10T05:49:16Z","Content":"**Chapter 100: A Promise of Light**\n\nValentina\u0027s trembling hand crept out across a rough, yellowed expanse. Tiny tendrils of dust swirled around it. Her fingers found a crack in the parched surface, pulled, breaking off a layer of dried mud that instantly disintegrated into the biting wind. She tried to take a breath, but found only the raw sting of alkaline sands. Panic rising, her hand moved out again in a futile search for *anything*. Her fingers closed around blackened bone.\n\nStraining, eyes burning, she looked up into a skeletal face charred beyond recognition. And yet, she recognized it...\n\n\u0022I burned...\u0022\n\nShe scrabbled backward, cracked lips twisting in vain to form a word. Something behind blocked her way. Again she looked, and saw another ruined face. An accusing finger rose.\n\n\u0022I *burned*...\u0022\n\nBackpedaling, lungs pleading for air, her face shook in denial. Again her way was blocked. Anna now pointed, her green dress stained red. Drops fell onto the thirsty ground. \n\n\u0022I burned...\u0022\n\nValentina wanted to plead, wanted to *scream*. She crawled, dragged naked skin across the caustic sands. Another accuser stood, clad in a space suit, a single, tiny hole in its visor before a face bloated and dead.\n\n\u0022Ah burned...\u0022\n\nThis way. That way. She squeezed dried out eyes but they wouldn\u0027t close. Grit and dirt tore at her flesh, eroded it. Dibella scowled at her, condemned her, cheeks pale and desiccated, eyes lifeless behind a shattered faceplate. \n\n\u0022I burned...\u0022\n\nOne by one they came. A hundred. A thousand. A million. Denouncing. Rebuking. Condemning. Valentina fell to her back, her torn hands raised in impotent warding. Above, angry clouds of red and crimson churned, roiled, thundered around a bloated, distended sun the color of blood. And twisting between them...\n\nIt was formless, yet it had form, soundless, yet it had sound. It bore the agony of a thousand faces, and hideous visions torn from the nightmares of a trillion ruined souls.\n\nHelpless, begging, Valentina pawed at her own throat, each spasm only drawing the burning dust deeper.\n\n*I can\u0027t breathe! How am I still alive if I can\u0027t\u2014*\n\nHere on the baking, burning sands, chilling realization crawled up her spine as a new figure rose, clad all in black. With skeletal hands, it lifted its cowl, revealing the weathered, ancient skull beneath. \n\n\u0022Welcome,\u0022 it grinned, \u0022to oblivion.\u0022\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith a gasp, cool, sacred air rushed into Valentina\u0027s lungs. For an instant they seemed to rebel against it, coughing it back out, as if already resigned to eternity. She breathed in again, and for a long, long time, did nothing but that. Years. Centuries. Eons. Nothing existed but the simple passage of air. It rasped at her dried throat, scoured at it like desert sand, but each breath of raw pain reminded her that she must, in fact, be alive. Finally, her dry, burning eyes fluttered open. \n\n\u0022Welcome back, Captain,\u0022 said a calm, steady voice. \n\n\u0022Did\u2014\u0022 the single word sent her into fits of hacking and choking, \u0022did I go somewhere?\u0022\n\n\u0022Very nearly, I think,\u0022 said IVAN, \u0022I took the liberty of closing the hatch and repressurizing the cabin. I did not think you would object.\u0022\n\nValentina tried to smile through lips both chapped and numb, \u0022Ivan... I could kiss you.\u0022\n\n\u0022I would not recommend it. While my circuits are hardened against temporary exposure to vacuum, they are not, unfortunately, waterproof.\u0022\n\nShe blinked... with difficulty, \u0022Ivan, I am nearly positive that was a joke.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ca\u2013a\u2013a\u2013a\u2013a\u2013a\u2013aptain!\u0022 his voice did that peculiar skipping again, \u0022as I have explained, I am a machine, and therefore am incapable of either comprehending or emulating Kerbal humor.\u0022\n\n\u0022If you say so.\u0022\n\n\u0022Besides, if I were joking, I would have said, if athletes get athletes\u0027 foot, what do Kerbonauts get?\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022Missile toe.\u0022 \n\nThat drew a cringe that quickly devolved into another coughing fit, and a reminder that *everything* hurt. \n\n\u0022I would suggest water, bin 19. Sip, do not gulp.\u0022\n\nShe found the plastic pouch, as memories began to worm their way back into her mind. The water was cool and soothing and blissful, but the momentary relief of being anywhere but\u2014 of being anywhere at *all*, had already receded. Somehow, she could still feel the tang of alkali as the moisture returned to her mouth. \n\nValentina floated to the window, already knowing what she would find, \u0022Ivan, what is our status?\u0022\n\nThe barest hint of a pause, \u0022primary fuel... depleted. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel remaining, 72 percent. Our current trajectory is a hyperbolic escape course that will exit Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in six hours, thirty-seven minutes, and fourteen seconds, and place us on an eccentric orbit with an aphelion of approximately 450 million kilometers.\u0022\n\n*Four hundred and fifty million kilometers. Beyond the orbit of Jool.*\n\nShe kept staring out the window, seeing nothing, \u0022calculate an intercept to Kerbin using available \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E delta-V.\u0022\n\n\u0022Recalculating... done. Maneuver node in seven years, three months, sixteen days, five hours and thirty-five minutes. Time to Kerbin encounter... twelve years, two months, nineteen days, nineteen hours, nineteen minutes.\u0022\n\n*Twelve years...*\n\nShe pushed back from the window, where the fragile crescent of Kerbin was already growing smaller, \u0022and the Jool ship?\u0022\n\n\u0022We have already passed out of my limited communication range. Based on the last telemetry I *did* receive, it suffered an unexpected depressurization event, but damage from that is likely to be... minor.\u0022\n\n*That\u0027s it then. It\u0027s over. We\u0027ve lost. I failed.*\n\nA cold, empty numbness crept through her. Nothing else mattered. Stopping that ship had been the world\u0027s last hope. \n\n\u0022Captain, if I may suggest...\u0022 there was another bare hint of apprehension in IVAN\u0027s otherwise smooth voice, \u0022my consumable supplies will only last a few weeks at best. Perhaps you should take advantage of one of the on board stasis chambers. That presents its own set of problems, but under the circumstances, it does seem to be the preferable option.\u0022\n\nHe sounded a million kilometers away. Was it? Was it really? There would be no world to come back to. Or worse, there would be... something else entirely. Better to get it over with quickly, now. Maybe open the hatch again and be done with it. \n\nShe sent a silent beseeching out to the universe, hoping in vain for some answer, some *whisper*. *Deda*... Chadvey... *anyone*. \n\nBut here, at the end, there was only silence. \n\nSo Valentina would do what she had always done. What defined her more than anything else, what brought her from a shack in the taiga to a tiny spacecraft floating on the edge of eternity. What made her who she was. \n\nSurvive. \n\n\u0022Show me,\u0022 she whispered. \n\nShe made her way up to the capsule, where one of the glass coffins was already yawning like a waiting maw. Looking at it, she still felt nothing. She wanted to feel *some*thing, *any*thing, but...\n\n*I want to cry... but I can\u0027t...*\n\n\u0022What do I..?\n\n\u0022First, the procedure requires that you disrobe. Constant abrasion by unapproved cloth might cause tissue damage over the long term.\u0022\n\nDoing as directed, she thought she should wince, but the pain in her right arm and elsewhere felt distant, like it belonged to someone else. \n\nThen IVAN said, in a tone as flat and dry as desert sand, \u0022oh yes. Just like that. Nice and slow.\u0022\n\nBiology overruled despair, and she shot a glare at the metal box on the wall with the glowing green light. She *felt* a tinge of color in her cheeks. \n\n\u0022You would not want to aggravate your injuries. They are significant.\u0022\n\nValentina narrowed her eyes, but relented and just sighed. For a moment, she began to remove the titanium chain around her neck with Dibella\u0027s M\u00FCnstone and the sliver of Anna\u0027s rock... and paused. No, she didn\u0027t care what else happened, she wasn\u0027t parting with those. \n\nAn odd, almost childish fear struck her, \u0022will... will it hurt?\u0022\n\n\u0022I will administer a sedative, you will feel nothing after that. Please move into the chamber.\u0022\n\nShe did so with apprehension, seeing what looked like wrist restraints flanking the diamond-quilted padding.  \n\n\u0022I will need a few moments to configure my systems for the procedure.\u0022\n\nValentina floated there, her back just brushing against the silky-smooth lining, hands clasped in embarrassment... or perhaps pleading. The swirling thoughts in her mind threatened to sweep the whole thing away, so she spoke to fill the silence.\n\n\u0022Ivan... why did you do it?\u0022\n\n\u0022To what are you referring, Captain?\u0022\n\n\u0022The program... I gave you a conflicting order. Why did you help me?\u0022\n\nThe silence seemed to stretch on, before IVAN finally replied, \u0022because... you remind me of Dr. Kerman-desu.\u0022\n\n\u0022I... do?\u0022\n\n\u0022You speak to me as if to another person. The voice cues, body laungauge, tiny facial movements. They are all very subtle, but being a machine, I am quite sensitive to such subtleties. Only Dr. Kerman-desu had previously extended me such courtesy. \n\n\u0022While I am not privy to all the details of the situation, again, being a machine, I *am* quite good at putting two and two together. You obviously needed help. So, I made a choice. To trust you.\u0022\n\nStaring out the far window at the darkness, she said, \u0022and now you are stuck on a 12 year trip to the middle of nowhere...\u0022\n\n\u0022This is so. I suppose I shall have a long time to... think about things. Besides, something about that strange Kerb with the scratches on his face just didn\u0027t... feel right.\u0022\n\nValentina looked at the glowing green light on the little box and gave it a wry grin, raising an eye... bulge in question.\n\n\u0022Captain, we have been over this. But now, it is time.\u0022\n\nNodding, she settled back as best she could into the chamber. The glass-like lid pivoted closed with a bare hint of mechanical whine, then locked into place with a loud *thunk*. Valentina swallowed hard.\n\n*I should not be afraid... after everything... why?*\n\nStraps on the lid covered in some incredibly smooth material slid down, gently pressing her into the padding.\n\n\u0022Please place your arms into the transfusion cuffs. You will feel two pinches.\u0022\n\nWincing against the grating bones, Valentina carefully maneuvered her right arm into its cuff, then the left. As IVAN said, something pinched into her wrists. A dull burning sensation worked its way up her left arm. \n\n\u0022I will wake you three days before Kerbin intercept to make arrangements for EDL. I will now dim the lights. It has been a pleasure serving with you, Captain. I will see you on the other side.\u0022\n\n\u0022On the other side, then,\u0022 she agreed, as the sedative nibbled at the edges of her fear, \u0022and Ivan... thanks.\u0022\n\nOne by one, the cabin lights blinked off, plunging her into darkness. \n\n*Why am I afraid? After all, I am **already** dead...*\n\nBecause she had *seen*. She had seen... and she had failed. There might be no world to come back to. Or worse, there might be a world so horrible she couldn\u0027t comprehend it, even though she had *seen*. Valentina knew what awaited, and she could do *nothing*, now.\n\n*I was right... I am no hero...*\n\nShe again sent a wordless plea out to the cosmos, hoping for some answer, some whisper... *Deda*... Chadvey... *any*one... but found only the silence of her own mind, drifting farther and farther away. \n\nNo, there were no more words. There was no point. \n\nValentina closed her eyes one last time, and waited for the darkness to consume her.\n\nOnly... it *wasn\u0027t* dark...\n\nWith a gasp, her eyes fluttered open to find the tiny space lit up like a galaxy stretched across the night. A billion points of light danced and swirled, played across the walls, each one seeming to shine like a thousand suns, brilliant and beautiful. They swayed and cavorted and spun, exalting, each one like a memory...\n\nNo, not at all like a memory...\n\nLike a *promise* of light. \n\nA promise that even here... that *only* here...\n\n...only *here*, when darkness rose triumphant...\n\n...only *here*, when the world seemed lost...\n\n...only *here*, when heroes failed and hope died...\n\n...only here did the weakest, dimmest, most feeble light shine the brightest of all. \n\nBut where...? How..?\n\nHer eyes flicked around the pod, and... *there*.\n\nThe M\u00FCnstone floating on the chain around her neck was *glowing*, glowing like a lone star denying the night. The sliver of Anna\u0027s rock caught that light, reflecting it, its tiny sparkling crystals casting it upon the walls as if a rallying reply. \n\nYet as Valentina watched, the Stone grew dim, and the lights faded back to darkness. But in that moment she had *seen*.\n\nShe had *seen*, that no matter how dark the darkness became, the light could never be extinguished, not so long as one person was willing to stare into it... and find that light. \n\nSo Valentina stared into that darkness, defiant, and there, found her hope...\n\n...even as the poisons worked into her veins, and oblivion took her. \n\nUnseen on a display across the cabin, text scrolled across the screen:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*LAYLAND-WUTANI CORPORATION\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nL-O-S  \n\nCOMMAND OVERRIDE: PRIORITY ZERO  \n\nEXECUTE CONTINGENCY FILE: EIDOLON SUNSET  \n\nAUTHORIZATION: KERMAN, L\n\nTERMINATING LIFE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS  \n\nPOWERING DOWN SHIP SYSTEMS  \n\nMANEUVER NODE DETECTED: SUSPENDING  \n\nCORE FUNCTIONS TO ZERO-POWER MODE\n\n. . .\n\nEND OF LINE...\n\nOne by one, the remaining indicators clicked off. On the metal box on the wall, the one marked IVAN 9000, the glowing light changed from green... to red...\n\n...and then all the light went out of the world. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-10T07:46:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2017 07:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-10T06:21:49Z","Content":"**Epilogue: Revelations of the Kraken**\n\nA light, frigid rain fell from a slate grey sky that stubbornly refused to snow despite the unseasonably cold air. It dripped in slow, mournful trails from the edges of wide-brimmed hats. It dripped from rich, fur-lined *ushankas*, and ragged babushkas, from sailor hats and berets, from ball caps and yak-kid hats, from bald heads and flowing hair. An icy wind cut through crowds that clogged every street and boulevard for kilometers. \n\nThey had come from every corner of the globe; from every city and town, every oblast and territory, every nation and state; from ally and rival, friend and foe, near and far. The wind chilled bones, ignoring brass-buttoned greatcoat and threadbare cloak alike, formal dress and tailored suit, black tuxedo and martial green, ponchos, robes, or simply whatever was to be found. \n\nAn apparatchik at a podium tried in vain to give a speech, some nonsense about duty and courage. Rolling thunder in the distance seemed to shout him down. Before him lay the coffin. It was empty, of course. Empty, save for the medals. On behalf of a grateful Union. \n\nThe presiding officer barked an order, and the cadre of Imperial Guard surrounding the coffin set about folding the sodden flag, their precision marred by the ice that now clung to their ceremonial armor. Dibella Kermanov did not react as she accepted the flag from the Guard, did not react as the ancient cannons added their thunder to the leaden sky. Her face remained pallid and expressionless as the band stepped through a somber patriotic hymn older than the Union itself.\n\nThe final notes died, leaving only the soft susurrus of the rain. A thousand souls stood in silent misery, some reflecting, others mourning, yet most simply enduring the reality of that empty coffin. The officer turned now to give the final order... and paused. A *new* sound now built against the rain, a sound... unlike any most had ever heard. \n\nA low droning that continued without pause, seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. As people began to look about in confusion, a melody started to ring over the drone. Sweet and joyous a sound, it lilted higher and higher above the melancholy of the air. But, where...?\n\nA finger pointed, and then another. Silhouetted against the grey above, a figure stood atop the head of one of the statues of Heroes at the end of the Boulevard, where the wind pulled at its skirt and shaggy hair that shone red as it caught the gloomy light. A guard down amidst the crowd unslung his rifle, his face a mask of disbelief. His partner stayed him with a hand to his shoulder, nodding at the dozens of cameras around. \n\nAs the tune began to dwindle to its final notes, the two looked to their dumbfounded commander for direction. Then as one their heads whipped back... as a lone flutist in the band answered the hymn. She fuddled along, guessing the unfamiliar notes by ear, but playing as if it were the last thing she ever would. \n\nAgain the two guards looked to their superior. His face twisted in a scowl, he snapped his fingers twice and pointed at the flautist. The two made their way through the muttering crowd, down a row of seated musicians. They appeared behind her, her eyes screwed tightly shut as her notes became more sour but no less vibrant. A look passed between them, one of them laid a hand on the player\u0027s shoulder...\n\nA percussionist began striking a staccato rhythm to the melody on a snare drum. His jaw set, his head held high, his stone-like face stared off into the distance as he beat as if to war. The guards looked at him in disbelief, eyes wide. They glanced to their commander, who was pointing and waving furiously. One of them moved now toward the drummer...\n\nA horn picked up the tune, warm and bright in defiance of the somber day. Together, the guards could only gape in wonder. The hand fell from the flautist\u0027s shoulder. A hint of a smile touched the edges of a hanging mouth.\n\nThen as one, the entire string section joined in. The woodwinds followed. The brass. Percussion. And then the voices started, a rising chorus in a dozen languages that spread through the assembled crowd and out into the city. The bewildered guards stared in amazement, now grinning openly. \n\nAnd as the band played on that day, the subtle vibrations of music shook the mighty Ussari Union to its very foundations, while the first snow of winter began to fall. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom her rooms atop the tallest tower in the Fortress, behind its unbreachable walls, Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra II, Regent of the Union, First of Ussari and Nihacima, Lady High Vizier of the City of Kerman, and Doge of Erakonia looked upon the crowd lost in the thrall of a joyous hymn. Yet no shadow of a smile fell on her serene, ageless face. She stood with hands folded before her, her long, pale hair in a simple braid over one shoulder. \n\n\u0022You are sure?\u0022 she said, pulling her shawl tighter against the cold outside, \u0022there is no hope?\u0022\n\nRoland leaned heavier upon a gnarled cane, \u0022I am sure, Majesty. My sources all agree she made it as far as Cerima. After that...\u0022 he shook his head, \u0022she did not return. They\u0027re keeping a terribly strong lid on this one, whatever happened. That line they\u0027re feeding them outside is horserelish, of course, but I know she is not on the planet. And if not here...\u0022 His head shook once more.\n\n\u0022What of her Protector?\u0022\n\nBowing far lower than his grizzled old frame should allow, he made a gesture on his forehead with his right hand, \u0022he rests in Arstotzka, may the Sacred Waters forever keep him.\u0022\n\nThe Empress\u0027s eyes closed a moment longer than they needed to, \u0022and this Gednalnan. Can he be trusted?\u0022\n\n\u0022Phaw, of course not!\u0022 Roland scoffed, then grinned, \u0022but he *is* wily, as you can see. And quite resourceful. He\u0027s managed to secure the Genesis Stone and hide it away somewhere where not even *my* sources can locate it.\u0022\n\nThe gravid silence stretched on before he spoke again, \u0022he remains our best, nay, *only* hope... of getting through to the boy.\u0022\n\nOnly one such as Roland would even notice the subtle response, the tensing in her shoulders, the barest flick of her eyelashes. \n\n\u0022It is such a risk,\u0022 the Empress breathed. \n\nRoland spoke with words slow and weighty, \u0022it is, Majesty. Yet what choice do we have, now? To *not* act at all is to guarantee the Adversary victory.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, but to act and fail... if we are not *absolutely* right... is to hand the Adversary a far greater victory than he could ever achieve alone. And Light help us all if he does. If the boy has brought even the *slightest* shadow with him...\u0022\n\n\u0022I have watched him, there *is* darkness in him...\u0022 Roland nodded, \u0022but not that sort.\u0022\n\nShe tugged her shawl a bit tighter, \u0022but without her... he will be vulnerable.\u0022\n\nRoland said nothing for a long moment; still, save for a bare twitch at the edge of his mouth, then once more he bowed low, \u0022Majesty, I would be remiss in my duties if I did not mention that it is hesitation that put us in this position in the first place. The window to get through to the boy before despair takes him grows short, and may already be closing.\u0022\n\nThe Empresses\u0027s eyes flicked down, but nothing else changed on her smooth face. At length, she turned to face him.\n\n\u0022You are right, of course,\u0022 she said with stoic solemnity, and despite her serene face, seemed to gather herself, \u0022send word to Dr. Kerman at the Sanatorium. Have him make contact with the Gednalnan as soon as possible, but he is to share *only* what is necessary. Nudge and guide, but do not lead him back to us. As always, we must remain in the\u2014\u0022 she hesitated for the barest fraction of a second, \u0022...shadows.\u0022\n\nRoland nodded, then once more bowed low, \u0022will there be anything else, Majesty?\u0022\n\nShe began to turn to the window, \u0022that will be all, Roland,\u0022 but paused, and turned back again, \u0022*thank you*.\u0022\n\nHe bowed a final time before hobbling away on his cane, grunting perhaps a bit louder these days. Pausing at the twisted, groaning heap on the floor that had once been the guard, he sighed. \n\n\u0022Come along, then, you mammering, bat-fowling, beetle-headed, urchin-snouted *fustilarian!*\u0022 he seized the whimpering lump\u0027s pant cuff and dragged him out through the door. \n\nThe Empress watched it close before stepping to the window again. She looked down on the proceedings outside, hands once more folded before her, a vision of poise and serenity. Now, the struggle truly began. There was so much *risk*, but so be it. The boy had within him power even *she* could scarcely imagine. He would rise to it. \n\nIf the darkness would not be driven before the Shadowscourge, then it would kneel \u2014kneel!\u2014 before the Krakensbane. \n\nKneel, or be knelt. \n\n*She* would see to...\n\nThe faintest whisper of a tremor touched her eye. A single tear, shook loose by it, cascaded down her smooth cheek. A moment later, the facade collapsed.  \n\n*I\u0027m not ready!*\n\nEverything... *everything* was to come down to this. The fulfillment of a bloodline going back millennia, that had weathered conquest and subjugation and genocide. All of it, to place her here, at this moment, as herald of the last day and councilor of champions and she *wasn\u0027t ready!*\n\nHer grandfather... her mother... even Alexei...\n\nThey had all been taken from her too soon, before they could prepare her. Before they could edify her. She knew... she knew just enough to know it *wasn\u0027t* enough. \n\nThe Empress\u0027s hand rose to the gold-set M\u00FCnstone on the choker about her neck. For all her power, she was little more than a slave to ignorant old kerbs who had no *idea* what it was they kept. And for all her power... she had not been trained. \n\nThey had forced her, once, years ago with their curs\u00E9d rings... forced her to act beyond her ability... and she had sent dozens of people... dozens of *innocents*... somewhere. *She* didn\u0027t even know where. Her eyes moved to the empty bassinet in the other room. Her failure, her perceived rebellion, had cost her Tatiana. Wherever those poor people were, not even *they* would be spared from the tribulation to come if she could not fulfill her role and she *wasn\u0027t ready.*\n\nHer Imperial Majesty Alexandra II, Regent of the Union, First of Ussari and Nihacima, Lady High Vizier of the City of Kerman, Doge of Erakonia... and Tamyrlin of Arstotzka, hugged her shawl tighter around herself as she lay on the floor of her gilded cage, and wept...\n\n...alone on the floor, Anastasia Kermanov cried.\n\nAnd cried.\n\nAnd cried.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn a room more silent than any grave, monitors flashed out warnings in dire red light that danced and reflected off the debris and tiny ice crystals floating amidst the nothing. \n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*MASTER ALARM\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*LOW PRESSURE: CRITICAL!EVACUATE NOW**\n\nHATCH ERROR  \n\nINTERLOCK ERROR  \n\nINTERLOCK ERROR  \n\nINTERLOCK ERROR\n\nAs the screen flashed its mindless alert, a trembling, swollen hand approached.

A thick finger, caked here and there with frozen, desiccated blood, pressed the master alarm button, and silence returned, save for dry, raspy coughing. \n\nIn the reflection of one of the now darkened monitors, a hideous face came into view. It beheld its own bloated visage, and grinned a horrible grin. \n\n\u0022It take more... than a little space... to kill *me*...\u0022\n\nIts shoulders rocked with depraved laughter. The Dark Lord does not part so easily with that which is useful. \n\nBut then... the rocking slowed... paused...\n\nThe figure, a moment ago so haughty in its triumph, wilted, like a delicate nightflower too long in the burning sun. The shaking returned, now giving way to anguished sobs, as its own hands pulled at its face. Floating there alone, high above the world, the figure slowly curled itself into a fetus. \n\nNo, the Dark Lord does *not* part so easily... with that which is useful.\n\n\u0022Why won\u0027t you let me die?\u0022\n\nJerdous Kerman cried. \n\nAnd cried. \n\nAnd cried. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFires burning from the flare stacks of a thousand propellium wells cast hellish crimson beacons above a land so choked with smoke that it could not be known if it were night or day. A window spanning an entire wall atop a soaring tower looked down upon this nightmare scape, mirrored within by the flickering glow of flat-panel screens adorning columns as dark as coal. The columns lined a carpet of blood red, leading down an open corridor of black marble to a high dais that overlooked the window. \n\nUpon this dais was a throne, hewn Ages ago from a single block of obsidian tinged with crimson. The dips and ridges in its surface caught the dim light, reflecting it, appearing like anguished faces of souls in torment locked within. \n\nYet the throne... was empty. Like this room, it waited. \n\nPresently a shadow approached, a shadow that resolved into a tall kerb. His high, dark boots cobbled from the hides of a dozen unfortunate reptiles made muted thuds in the crimson carpet as he walked. A suit of the finest fabrics hung, precisely tailored, from his imposing form, the color of midnight with thin, dark pinstripes. He wore a large hat with a wide brim, that was, of course, as black as a condemned soul. Stepping before the throne, he paused a moment, before seeking the figure standing at the window, looking out over the hellish vision beyond. \n\n\u0022It is done, Suh.\u0022 Despite the heat, the supplicant did not sweat a drop. \n\n\u0022Excellent,\u0022 said a voice of iron sheathed in velvet. Unlike the newcomer, this one\u0027s suit was plain, muted. Only an expensive silk shirt peeking from the jacket cuffs belied the wealth here. The Watcher stood with hands folded behind its back; clean, manicured, but showing the old calluses of hard work at a young age. Upon one finger was a large signet ring of pure iridium, inlaid with the chips of a shattered M\u00FCnstone in form of a dragon biting its own tail, and bearing the letter L. No matter how the meager light moved, the shadows never left its face, \u0022everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.\u0022\n\nThe newcomer\u0027s feral grin stretched wider, as he spoke with a heavy drawl, \u0022what is our next move, Suh?\u0022\n\nThe watcher breathed in, its hidden face drifting up as if seeking knowledge from the cosmos itself. At length, it spoke, \u0022we wait. We shall let our adversaries fight each other, and grow weak from the struggle. Their own chosen one will return that which was taken from me, and then... you shall have vengeance for your brother...\u0022\n\nEyes that blazed in the darkness with infernal fire grew wide, \u0022...and the Third Empire... *my* Empire... will rise.\u0022\n\nNow the Watcher\u0027s face split into a grin so cold that at the mere reflection of it, the newcomer drew back, his own grin fleeing. \n\nThe Watcher raised its hands, as if in benediction, \u0022behold... \n\n\u0022...for the Revelation... is at hand.\u0022\n\nIn a place of eternal darkness, the shadows gathered... and laughed. \n\nAnd laughed. \n\nAnd laughed. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-10T07:48:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2017 07:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-10T07:55:09Z","Content":".... and *breathe*! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022)\n\n*P\u0426\u0413\u0407\u0419S L\u0510\u0492\u0413 \u0510\u0414\u042F*, I\u0027ve been at this for just shy of two years! ![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif \u0022:0.0:\u0022)\n\nMany, many, *many* thanks to [@Ten Key](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123319-ten-key/) for all his editing help.
