What is happening when I EVA a \u0027naut and then go do other things leaving him floating in space for 6 hours? What motivates a crew to board the third ship in a test line when the previous two have exploded on the launch pad? What happens to a Kerbal who has been orbiting some distant moon alone for a year? I wondered just enough to write this short about a hapless being trying to get by in a universe which isn\u0027t built or run with his happiness, freedom or even survival in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally conceived of as a radio play, the first episode ended up as a film. The results are patchy I think, as I\u0027m learning how to make films in KSP as I go, but hopefully it makes someone laugh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E___\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEpisode 1: New year\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/PPYg5gIA61E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently two more episodes are planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E___\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have included every addon I used in the credits but if I missed something let me know so I can credit appropriately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as this is the first post of a long time lurker, I\u0027d like to say that squad have made a truly great game which has attracted a great community. This cartoon emerged from playing the game a lot, toying with a great many addons and sharing flights with friends over twitch. Many MANY happy, crazy, confusing, frustrating, enlightening, fun hours have been spent by me in this vast and tractless sandbox.
