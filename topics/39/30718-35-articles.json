(config bashing was fun for me, so I liked the semi-complex nature of the design.)\u00A0 The theory of operation was that the jet engine ran like, well, a jet engine up to its physical flame-out limit.\u00A0 It\u0027d climb while sucking in air, spraying in fuel, igniting it, and spraying the resulting hot gasses out through the center of the engine, between the rocket nozzles.\u00A0 As the air thinned out (a use for that Atmosphere gauge in the cockpit), the pilot would throttle back to make the most of the jet engine (remember, this was 0.90, where jets could almost get to orbit with this trickery), run until (nearly) engine flameout, yank the blue lever in the cockpit, and brace for acceleration.\u00A0 The theory there was that by pulling the lever (usually Action Group 1 for mode switching), you\u0027d cut the fuel supply off of the jet engine, dump that fuel into the rocket\u0027s combustion chamber (obviously more complex than that, but I\u0027m not as knowledged in rocket sciences and the technical parts), activate the oxidizer flow as well, and ignite the resulting mixture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result in game was a heavy, awkward engine that failed to match the elegance of the RAPIER, but could be gotten much sooner, required an action group to manually switch over the engine, had a stall-period on switching from rocket to jet, drank fuel and oxidizer at an astounding rate while being a rocket, and had obnoxious quirks in jet mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe quirks: Because I\u0027d forgotten to install an alternator in the engine config file, there was no power generation in either mode.\u00A0 The in-lore reason for that \u0027missing\u0027 part was simply that there was no longer any room in this engine housing to fit an alternator, and that it\u0027d only be functional in jet mode anyway, so why bother with the added weight.\u00A0 The engine alone, without any supporting hardware, was 4 tons.\u00A0 It had a fuel-consumption equivalent to a Mainsail while providing the thrust of two LVT-45\u0027s in rocket mode, and because it was me who had bashed it together, the center of mass was not adjusted forward like the RAPIER, thereby it always resulted in a large amount of weight sitting squarely on the back of the airframe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned before, I\u0027m sorely tempted to try bashing together a new MACE with the updated parts.\u00A0 Especially now that I should, at least in theory, be able to enable thrust-reversing if I use the right engine body.\u00A0 I\u0027ll just have to remember to tell my pilots not to thrust-reverse when in rocket mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Okay, it\u0027s crazier than I thought.\u00A0 Found an old config file, and it\u0027s not the revised and refined version mentioned above.\u00A0 This thing\u0027s insane, but with some balance in mind.\u00A0 4 tons of engine, a lot of thrust in jet mode (that will be getting tweaked because this thing puts out some insane thrust), and 400 kN of thrust in rocket mode, though I think it\u0027s actually balanced...\u00A0 To do that, it chugs down twice as much oxidizer as any other rocket does compared to the liquid fuel consumption.\u00A0 So much, in fact, that it\u0027s actually set up to show Oxidizer as the fuel resource being consumed in the lower left hand corner.\u00A0 It\u0027s crazy, but I love it.\u00A0 Oh, and that rocket mode has spool-down, too.\u00A0 Makes precision a nightmare because it takes two or three seconds to spool down from full power.\u00A0 But, it\u0027s a tool of pure brute force, not elegance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and I made myself laugh because of my own flavor text from so-long-ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Manually Actuated Combination Engine.\u00A0 A hybrid of rocket and jet. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will go to space today.\u00A0 While screaming.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been working to revise it for the new parts, and other than some quirks which showed up (not surprising seeing as how old this config file is), I think I\u0027m happy with it.\u00A0 It can and will throw spaceplanes into orbit, it\u0027s still just a little too overpowered (that will be fixed soon enough.\u00A0 This thing climbs like a 0.90 jet... Which means in the modern aero and, um, frictional heating... Yeah, I destroyed four planes trying to fly this engine.\u00A0 When you\u0027re getting re-entry heating on the way up, that\u0027s not a good thing.) but I\u0027m working on that, and I think I\u0027m gonna keep it in my game.\u00A0 Crazy as it is, and quirky as it is, it does the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd reverse thrust is officially NOT better than airbrakes.\u00A0 Awesome as it sounds to punch through thick enough air for the engine to breathe, then pop the reverse thrust, it\u0027s not... not that effective at slowing the plane down.\u00A0 Great at slowing the engine down, but not the plane...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T10:36:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Madrias\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound one of the old config files, it\u0026#039;s crazier than I thought.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T20:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222411393\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002230718\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455567327\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022123319\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ten Key\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 15 February 2016 at 8:15 PM, Ten Key said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was a wonderful way of playing on the \u0022Earthrise\u0022 phenomenon.

Stacks of bricks and timbers sat on wooden pallets under lean-to shelters, their corrugated steel roofs extensively guttered. Other pallets held woven plastic sacks of sand, gravels and assorted other aggregates. Yellow-hatted kerbals squatted by the sacks, checking the labels stencilled on their sides in thick black type. Others were slitting open the sacks, dumping their contents onto shallow steel trays before wheeling them over to a row of heavy, free standing electric kilns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA buzzer sounded. One of the workers hauled a kiln door open, pulled a tray out on its runners and began shovelling hot gravel into a wheelbarrow. Behind her, pairs of sweating workers loaded new trays into another kiln. Nearby, a row of smoking barrows stood by a pair of portable concrete mixers both resting on heavy weighing platforms. Directed by a clipboard wielding supervisor, a team of kerbals were busily loading the mixers, taking great care to shovel in just the right amount of sand or grit from each barrow. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove their heads, a Hope interplanetary probe hung from its towering scaffold, jointed metal legs and folded sample arm looming over them. The last of the array of plateaus, steps and angled ramps used for the drop tests had finally been chipped away and the space beneath the scaffold now resembled nothing more than a kerblet\u2019s sandbox, albeit one large enough to satisfy even the most demanding kerblet. For the moment though, it was empty, with only traces of dark brown grit scattered over the neatly joined boards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rumbling, scrape-hissing noise stopped. With an effort, a pair of workers trundled the concrete mixers over to the scaffold and dumped their contents into the sandbox. The dirty gravel bore only a passing resemblance to Dunan soil but Dunney was unconcerned.\u003Cem\u003E Good matches on mineral composition, rheology and particle size distribution are all I care about. We can throw some dye in later if we need it to look pretty too.\u003C/em\u003E He watched the simulation team spread the heap of gravel into an even layer, one of them walking slowly over it, stopping at regular intervals to jab a slender steel spike into the mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDunney clambered over the newly built brick wall surrounding the scaffold and knelt down beside the sandbox. He scooped up a handful of simulated soil, letting the now cool, dry grains run through his fingers and listening to spadefuls of fresh aggregates thudding into the mixers behind him. Tracing a line in the dirt with one finger, he watched the edges of the shallow groove crumble and subside. Hmmph - doesn\u2019t look too bad. Let\u2019s see how it does on the sample arm tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConcrete gushed ponderously around the rebar, between the formwork panels, and over the heavy plastic sheeting that lined the bottom of the shallow, rectangular pond. The thick grey stream quivered jelly-like as it hit the already poured mass, too liquid to stand, too solid to splatter. A gang of kerbals armed with long-bladed spreaders, stood in the wet concrete, shovelling it into place and smoothing off the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin watched them work. Across the field, a group of great domed glasshouses were slowly taking shape, five arranged in a cloverleaf pattern, linked by tubular walkways, three others standing apart from the main complex. Cranes reared up against the skyline, steel girders suspended from lattice-work jibs, poised over the nest of scaffolding that surrounded the glasshouse frames. Construction crews swarmed over the steelwork, bright yellow hats dotted over the structures like clumps of flowers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRows of low-slung, corrugated steel sheds squatted at the edges of the construction site, providing equipment storage and temporary accommodation for the workers. Much of the fresh produce from the Berelgan agricultural research institute had been requisitioned for the on-site canteen and Erlin strongly suspected that the building work had been deliberately timed to coincide with the harvest season for most of their main crops. In the distance, a line of trucks wound slowly along the narrow country road leading to the Berelgan, bringing more construction materials for the Project.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomebody coughed politely. Erlin turned to find Halsy accompanied by Gusemy and another kerbal, both very obviously equipped for outdoor work. He clasped Gusemy\u2019s hand briefly in greeting before studying his companion curiously, taking in the shortened grey cloak worn over a heavier jacket. \u201CErlin. Pleased to meet you, Keeper.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stranger nodded. \u201CAnd you also, Professor.

We couldn\u2019t save the new sapling either - we think it was probably weakened by its battle with the older Kerm and by the time we got a team to it, it was beyond their ability to heal. What remains of the Grove is under quarantine - the Department was actually hoping for your advice on how best to reclaim it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin lifted his head. \u201COf course,\u201D he said, \u201CI don\u2019t have any immediate ideas I\u2019m afraid but I\u2019ll put a working group together as soon as we return from Barkton.\u201D He looked at Halsy. \u201CWould you mind?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy nodded. \u201CI\u2019ll get right on it, boss. Mallas is away until next month and most of Lowig\u2019s group are at that conference.

Not that there\u2019s a great deal to see at the moment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll the better for a short tour then,\u201D said Gusemy. He eyed the cement truck behind them, concrete still pouring from its hose. \u201CIt\u2019s a lot bigger than I was expecting for all that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s bigger than \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E was expecting,\u201D said Erlin ruefully. He pointed at the glasshouse frames in the distance. \u201CWe\u2019d been working on it for quite a while of course - the KSA commissioned the Project after Pioneer 2, as a facility for developing biological life-support systems for long duration spaceflight. Director Lodan carefully avoided saying too much about the flights he had in mind but from the size of the facilities he wanted and the system specifications that he asked for, we had a pretty good idea that we were looking at voyages to Minmus and quite probably a M\u00FCnbase of some description.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin gave a short laugh. \u201CThen came Pioneer 4. And Obrick\u2019s Speech. And all the updates to the Project plans.\u201D He flicked his fingers at the construction crews busily levelling the freshly poured concrete. \u201CWelcome to the first of our eventual low pressure laboratories.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett frowned for a moment and then nodded slowly in understanding. \u201CYes - and it would make more sense to have two.\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA reduced pressure and a low pressure,\u201D agreed Erlin. \u201CCrop plants aren\u2019t going to grow at six percent atmospheric but the lower the pressure we can grow them in, the easier it\u2019s going to be. And if we can get anything to grow at six percent - we\u2019re thinking lichens at the moment - \u00A0it\u2019ll be a valuable boost to soil conditioning and nutrient capture.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy\u2019s face cleared. \u201C\u003Cem\u003EDuna,\u003C/em\u003E\u201D he said incredulously, \u201Cyou\u2019re talking about building a Duna simulator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Erlin simply. \u201CSelf contained glasshouses - or as near to a glasshouse as we can manage for the low pressure lab. We may have to use artificial light to compensate for the smaller window area, although that might just make for a better mimic of ambient lighting on Duna.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CThat\u2019s one of the first things we\u2019ll need to test once it\u2019s built. Anyway, the idea is to have self contained buildings, isolated from the local environment - especially the local soil - that we can use to develop a Dunan agronomy. I suspect the KSA will also want to use it for kerbonaut training at some point.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat are you planning to use for soil?\u201D asked Obrett. To her surprise, Erlin just grinned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe KSA have got a whole research team mixing up sands and gravels to put under one of their spare space probes. According to Dunney, they\u2019re testing each mix using the same set of tests that they\u2019ve already run on Duna and comparing their results with the data they got from Hope 4. He thinks they should be able to whip up the next best thing to actual Dunan soil at the actual colony site.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett blinked. \u201CThat sounds\u2026feasible,\u201D she admitted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin nodded. \u201CEven if Dunney\u2019s crowd don\u2019t get it quite right, it should be a pretty good approximation.\u201D He checked his watch. \u201CAnyway, we\u2019d better get moving if you want to see any of the Project up close before we set off.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThink that\u2019s about all I can do for now. At least the gingergrass is good for cooking even if it\u2019s not crowding out the damsonwire as well as I\u2019d hoped. Or the wretched knotweed. Seem to spend half my life keeping that under control.\u003C/em\u003E The kerbal\u2019s eyes snapped open and automatically turned towards the ceiling, checking for spots on the leaf clusters overhead. Its hands fumbled for the tap on the pedestal in front of it and then, more confidently, reached out for a mug.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sipped his water, scratching absently at the ridged weals running across his stomach. He briefly contemplated refilling the mug then, with a sigh, put it back on its shelf. \u003Cem\u003EFour mugs a day keeps the green spots away. But they don\u2019t do a thing to balance the pollinator beds. They\u0027d survive for one more day though. Bet the breadfruit fields could use a good working over instead. Hmm - just like the sapwoods needed checking last week. And the leatherbarks the week before that.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shook out his branches. \u003Cem\u003EGuess I\u2019m starting to run out of excuses and Fred\u2019ll never forgive me if I let the prickleberry season run late again.\u003C/em\u003E Reluctantly he let his awareness drift outwards through leaf and root and then down, down through the myriad scented soil. The kerbal\u0027s head slumped against its shoulders, eyes closing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s odd.\u003C/em\u003E Jonton floated amidst the invisible latticework, brushing gently against its strands, letting its forms and patterns come to him, feeling for a balance that already seemed to be there. He shifted, testing the food webs, the scented gossamer threads of prey and predation, nutrients and water; alert to any ragged patches, any unravelling or over-tightening. \u003Cem\u003EThe pollinators are fine. Better than fine in fact. Maybe I am building that muscle memory because I definitely don\u0027t remember doing any of this.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCarefully, Jonton drew back from the lattice, slipping wraithlike through its nets, then letting them fade into his subconscious. He cast his thoughts back to the breadfruit vines and sapwood trees, to the herbs and newly blossoming sunfruit. Something tugged at a corner of his mind - something about the sapwoods taking longer than usual - but the more he tried to remember, the more his thoughts slipped out of reach. The memories seemed curiously soft somehow, like a half-remembered tale of something else long forgotten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head. \u003Cem\u003EHowever I managed it, I certainly made a good job of it. A pity there won\u0027t be any silverlace for Joenie\u0027s birthday though - I\u0027ll have to find something else to show her. His branches rustled in happy anticipation. Which reminds me - I\u0027d better have a look at Gerselle\u0027s worm trap. \u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy leaned against the gate and inhaled deeply, letting the mingled scents of leatherbark and sweetleaf fill his lungs. The scene was as idyllic as any on Kerbin, clouds scudding across a clear blue sky, casting dappled shadows on the meadows below. Kermol working the fields, their ponchos distant splashes of brown agains the greenery. Insects dancing in the grass, flitting from flower to flower, their soporific droning a melodic counterpoint to the rustle of branches in the wind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd none of it made the slightest bit of sense. Least of all the star poppies by his feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy stared at them, curving away into the woods and, he knew, out the other side. Behind him, the trail of scarlet flowers marched unbroken across the landscape, shrinking to a thin red line before vanishing over the next hill. He caught a flicker of movement from the corner of his eye and looked up to see Erlin and Obrett walking slowly towards him, eyes down, following the line.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin squatted down, running his fingers over the nearest poppy, tugging gently at it\u2019s petals. Obrett shook her head and joined Gusemy at the fence. She saw his raised eyebrows and spread her hands helplessly. \u201CAs far as we can tell, they\u2019re absolutely fine.\u201D She picked at a splinter of wood. \u201CEven the sapwoods - and their surface roots are normally the most vulnerable.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin straightened up. \u201CI\u2019d want to take samples to be sure,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut everything looked fine to me too. Trees looked healthy and well cared for, good mix of undergrowth species, no obvious fungal overgrowth, dead spots or insect attackers. No trace of Blight at all in fact.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We are in the right place aren\u0027t we?\u0022 said Gusemy. \u0022These are the right woods?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett nodded. \u0022No question. That new Grove was exactly where we expected from the KSA map. These woods should be dying but it seems that the KSA were right about that as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jonton,\u0022 murmured Erlin. He looked at the others politely enquiring expressions. \u0022The Keeper that we\u0027re due to visit. According to Lodan - and Kerm knows how he got mixed up in it - Jonton survived a Blight incursion but became \u0027unusually dependent\u0027 on his Kerm in the process.\u0022 He tapped his fingers against a fencepost. \u0022I got the distinct impression there was more to it than that - and Lodan admitted that that was his impression too but he\u0027d told me everything he knew.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe it was bad enough that he managed to persuade his Kerm to pull back from a second battle,\u0022 mused Obrett. \u0022Drew up a border and agreed to keep out of the other Kerm\u0027s way.\u0022 She saw Erlin\u0027s bewildered expression. \u0022I know - it doesn\u0027t make any sense to me either. The poppies are at about the right distance from the new village and they\u0027d make a pretty distinctive border from a Kerm\u0027s point of view. I just don\u0027t understand why Kerm would need such a visual borderline.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It sounds too good to be true,\u0022 said Erlin. \u0022We\u0027ve been searching for a Kerm repellent ever since the first Blight reports - and now it turns out you can just ask them nicely not to fight?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 said Gusemy thoughtfully, \u0022And you contacted us before Pioneer 4 and, more to the point, before Obrick\u0027s speech. Project Starseed wouldn\u0027t be such a priority if we could prevent any further Blight that easily.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Agreed,\u0022 said Obrett. \u0022I think there\u0027s more to this than we - or Lodan - have been told. I\u0027m very much looking forward to talking to this Jonton.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can\u0027t see them, Daddy - I can\u0027t see the worms!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know, Joenie, I know. Let me think for a minute.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EKerm, learning to see again is even harder than learning to not see. Okay, soil and worm trails\u003C/em\u003E. Jonton let the earth scents fill his \u00A0mind, leaning back into the synaesthesia that he\u0027d taught himself to suppress. Colours bloomed in the darkness; blurred pastel greens, blues and greys rapidly overlaid by a dizzying lace filigree woven from a hundred clashing hues. Hastily he clamped down on his link to Joenie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry sweetheart - are you alright?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I saw rainbows, Daddy but they\u0027re gone now.\u0022 To Jonton\u0027s relief, Joenie\u0027s mental voice just sounded disappointed. \u0022Do the worms live under the rainbows?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sort of, Joenie.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003ERight - soil only. Minerals, water, humus. Nothing else.\u003C/em\u003E He let the pastels wash over him, struggling to stay focused. Dimly, in the background, he heard ragged breathing, which gradually slowed to a more measured pace. Gathering himself, he opened the link again, feeding a thin trickle of colour along it. \u0022Can you see anything?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie sounded puzzled. \u0022I can see the sea, Daddy but worms don\u0027t live in the sea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It does look like the sea,\u0022 Jonton agreed. Slowly the colours drifted past, blurring and streaking. \u0022Do you remember the little sandpit you made with Mummy last week?\u0022 He \u00A0sensed Joenie nodding. \u0022Well this is what the sandpit looks like to the tree.\u0022 He and Joenie floated over a rectangular patch of greenish grey. \u0022Sand looks grey and water looks green. Your sandpit is nice and wet after the rain yesterday, so it turns into that funny greeny-grey colour. Now let\u0027s get a bit closer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton let the rectangular patch swim towards them. Closer up, its edge was ragged, almost frothy, with shades of blue churned up and swirling into the grey-green; here like the foam on the crest of a wave, there like stirred milk, spiralling into a glass of sapwood. Feathery, pastel tunnels insinuated themselves deeper into the sand, twisting and turning for no readily discernible reason. Joenie stared entranced at the patterns. Gently, Jonton steered them towards the nearest tunnel, before checking their slow drift and waiting patiently. Before them, the tip of the tunnel turned blocky, jumping forward into the soil in abrupt fits and starts, grey-greens fading into colourlessness and emerging again, some distance away, all churned up and flecked with blue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why is it going longer, Daddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because it\u0027s a worm tunnel, sweetheart. Can you see where it changes colour? That\u0027s where the worm is - it\u0027s eating the sand and mixing it all up before... passing it back out again.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where\u0027s the worm?\u0022 said Joenie, \u0022I wanted to see the worm.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m afraid the tree can\u0027t see the worms,\u0022 said Jonton gently. \u0022It can only see where they\u0027ve been, where they\u0027ve eaten the soil or where they\u0027ve been talking to each other.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden wave of curiosity washed over the mental link. \u0022What do the worms talk about, Daddy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mostly about food,\u0022 said Jonton. \u0022Or sometimes one worm wants another worm to chase it.\u0022 He sensed Joenie frown as she turned the idea over in her head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do the worms want to play, Daddy? Like when I want Mummy to play chase with me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think they do, sweetheart. Or maybe they just get lonely and want another worm to keep them company. Shall we see if we can listen to what they\u0027re saying?\u0022 Jonton felt the link flicker suddenly. \u0022Remember to talk to me please, Joenie. Moving your head too much will pull the leaves out.\u0022 Carefully he reached out into the sand, straining to find the subtle chemical cues \u00A0without letting the great clamour of other signals intrude on his thoughts. Slowly, a string of irregularly shaped amber beads appeared along the worm tunnel, most of them pale and transparent, a few dark and rich where one of his sensory fibres happened to cross the pheromone trail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There you go sweetheart. The worm is playing chase - it leaves the yellow beads for the other worms to follow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie giggled. \u0022I want some yellow beads for Mummy to chase!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you\u0027ll have to ask her first, \u0022 said Jonton. The image of the worm tunnel flickered for an instant. \u0022Hello, love.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mummy! Look at the worm talking, Mummy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can see it, sweetheart but we have to say goodbye to the worm now. It\u0027s lunchtime for intrepid explorers and Daddy needs to get ready for his important guests.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECinnamon. Nowhere near as bad as at that first village but bad enough. \u003C/em\u003EObrett listened to Gerselle with half an ear, staring curiously at the rows of bunk beds as they walked past and into the sleep room. A pleasant-faced if somewhat careworn looking kerbal greeted them from his place by the Kerm trunk, legs and waist mostly hidden by unusually dense foliage. He raised a hand in greeting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Everyone, this is my partner, Jonton,\u0022 said Gerselle, \u0022Jonton, this is Professor Erlin Kerman from the Berelgan Institute, Keeper Obrett Kermol from the Accident Investigation Department...\u0022 Jonton looked up sharply as Gerselle continued, \u0022and Ambassador Gusemy Kermol,\u0022 She looked at Gusemy apologetically, \u0022Although I\u0027m afraid I didn\u0027t catch the name of his Grove.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Welcome to our Grove,\u0022 said Jonton, \u0022Forgive me for not coming over to join you but I\u0027m rather indisposed at the moment.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett eyed the water stand placed conveniently next to him. Jonton noticed the direction of her gaze and sighed. \u0022We might as well get this over with I suppose. How much have you already been told?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That you and your Kerm survived a Blight incursion,\u0022 said Obrett carefully, \u0022and that you\u0027d become unusually dependent on your Kerm as a result.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind her, Gerselle snorted softly. Jonton nodded. \u0022That\u0027s one way of putting it,\u0022 he conceded, \u0022even if it\u0027s a little simplified.\u0022 He twitched his branches to one side and Obrett\u0027s eyes widened. Gusemy\u0027s jaw dropped for a moment, snapping shut with an audible click. Erlin swallowed hard, staring at the vines wrapped around Jonton\u0027s torso and legs. Tentatively, Obrett stepped forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They look like healing vines,\u0022 she said, voice only betrayed by a faint tremor, \u0022but I\u0027ve never seen them so developed. Was there an accident?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head and Obrett\u0027s eyes widened again at the mass of Kerm leaves anchored to his scalp. \u0022Not a physical one, no. The vines attend to my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003Eker\u003C/abbr\u003E... to my needs whilst I remain in Communion.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re in Communion \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022 said Obrett, \u0022Whilst you\u0027re still talking to us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In a manner of speaking,\u0022 said Jonton, \u0022It\u0027s a long story.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But one we need to hear I think,\u0022 said Gusemy quietly. \u0022Especially if it concerns the line of star poppies along the edge of your Grove, Keeper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It does,\u0022 said \u00A0Jonton, \u0022but please - take a seat. I have water here if anyone needs it.\u0022 He waited until his visitors were settled before clearing his throat. \u0022Before we start, you should know that the Twelve Pillars - through Chief Ambassador Donman - are already aware of the early parts of this story and have passed judgement on it. You see, it all begins with me breaking the Law of Territory and it doesn\u0027t get a great deal better from there.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton sketched out the struggle against Gerselle\u0027s Kerm, watching Obrett wince at his description of the sparks. He described the decision to plant a thirty-eighth Kerm in his Grove, the black leaf spots, the Shattering and it\u0027s aftermath. He told his horrified listeners about the melting shards, the beginnings of his slide into madness and eventual decision to go an-Kerm. Gerselle blinked back tears as he described the silverlace, Joenie\u0027s birthday and the anchor to kerbal reality that she was to provide. Finally he described the long process of learning to be Kerm, the mass Communions and planting the thin red line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy rubbed his eyes. \u0022That,\u0022 he said, \u0022is a catch and a half.\u0022 He saw Jonton\u0027s raised eyebrow. \u0022Sorry - we were discussing your poppy line before we arrived. It seemed like such an easy solution to the Kerm crisis that we thought there had to be a catch somewhere.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jonton,\u0022 said Erlin. \u0022You deliberately pulled back your territory to give that other Kerm room. I don\u0027t suppose you know any way of doing the opposite \u00A0- of peacefully repelling a Kerm from your own territory?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head. \u0022I\u0027m afraid not,\u0022 he answered. \u0022Not without causing it permanent damage.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin sighed. \u0022We were beginning to suspect as much,\u0022 he said. \u0022My team at the Berelgan have been searching for a repellent - something we can use to close-plant Kerm whilst keeping them apart - but without any appreciable luck.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m not sure how much this helps on a Kerbin-wide scale then,\u0022 said Gusemy. \u0022With respect, Jonton, I think you\u0027ve been extremely lucky.\u0022 Jonton nodded in heartfelt agreement as Gusemy ticked off the points on his fingers. \u0022Assuming we could get enough volunteers to try going an-Kerm and even assuming they were all successful, there\u0027s a huge moral and ethical issue here.\u0022 He looked at Jonton. \u0022For a Kerm of thirty-eight trees and one kerbal, you seem remarkably kerbal-like to me. Which makes me wonder what happened to your awakened Kerm personality.\u0022 Gusemy lifted his hands. \u0022You weren\u0027t to know and you did your best, but to even contemplate the possible destruction of nascent Kerm minds on a global scale.\u0022 Gusemy\u0027s voice shook. \u0022Nobody could - or should be forced to - countenance such a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton and Gerselle stared at him bleakly. Erlin was pale. Obrett just looked grim. \u0022That might be an easy choice if it comes to it.\u0022 She nodded at Jonton and Gerselle. \u0022I\u0027ve seen the aftermath of Kerm struggles that did not go as well as your own. Better one dead Kerm than two dead Kerm and a pair of insane or dead Keepers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin swallowed the bile at the back of his throat. \u0022Then let us hope it does not come to it.\u0022 He cast about for a change of topic. \u0022You told us about learning about your umm, duties, as a Kerm, Jonton. I would very much like to hear about that if you had the time. Kerm micro-ecologies are a study of mine you see - actually being able to discuss them with a Kerm face-to-face would be a tremendous boon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And I,\u0022 added Gusemy, \u0022would be extremely interested in visiting your history of Kerbin if we had the time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s another long story I\u0027m afraid,\u201D said Jonton. \u201CAlthough you\u0027d be more than welcome to stay the night and sit in with the first group tomorrow.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022First group?\u0022 asked Gusemy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes,\u0022 said Gerselle, \u0022Somehow, word got around after he shared our history with the rest of the village. Ever since then, we\u0027ve had a steady stream of visitors hoping to see it too.\u0022 She pointed at the rows of bunks lining the wall. \u0022We had to make special arrangements.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy\u0027s face cleared. \u0022Ahhh,\u0022 he said, \u0022I think we spoke to some of them on the way here. \u00A0They were looking for the Sage of Barkton - I presume we\u0027ve just met him?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stared at his feet. \u0022Yes,\u0022 he admitted. He looked up at Erlin. \u0022You wanted to know about being a Kerm? If you don\u0027t mind a rather simple example, I could show you that now?\u0022 Erlin nodded enthusiastically. \u0022In that case please take a bed and make yourself comfortable,\u0022 Jonton looked at Gusemy and Obrett, \u0022Please - you\u0027re welcome to join us, although I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be nothing new to you, Obrett.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett was the first to lift her head into the leaf cluster above her pillow. Encouraged by her example and by Gerselle\u0027s assurances, Erlin and Gusemy followed suit. Even communing with her own Kerm hadn\u0027t - couldn\u0027t have - prepared her for Communion with two other kerbals by her side and Erlin and Gusemy were thunderstruck. The link wavered, began to fragment, blown this way and that by excited tempests of \u00A0thought and spiralling emotional storms. Eventually, aided by Obrett, they were able to form a stable bond and Jonton fed them a first tentative thread of colour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As I said, it\u0027s a little simplistic,\u0022 Jonton said apologetically, \u0022but Gerselle and I only intended it as a first lesson for Joenie. Our daughter,\u0022 he added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrett decided not to comment. \u003Cem\u003EWhat is there to say - I\u0027m communing with two kerbals and some kind of... Kerm, whatever Jonton is now. Communing with children seems almost normal compared to that\u003C/em\u003E. She turned her attention back to Jonton, who was describing Joenie\u0027s sandpit. For a fleeting second, the landscape around her flickered into a familiar tangle of colour and she sensed Erlin and Gusemy reeling back in shock. The colours blanked out, replaced by a thick scattering of orange droplets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Worm pheromones,\u0022 said Erlin wonderingly. \u0022You know what this means, Gus? With enough time we could unravel everything. Entire micro-ecologies, mapped out to the last detail, ready for us to duplicate on Duna.\u0022 His voice glowed with enthusiasm. \u0022Experimental ecology - like this sandpit here, with an experimenter who can tell us what\u0027s happening in real time! No more clumsy sampling. No more fiddling around with chromatographs!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022An experimenter who still has an entire Grove to tend,\u0022 Gusemy reminded him. A wave of awed disbelief rolled through the link. \u0022But still - today we learn that the deepest secrets of the Kerm are ours to decipher. Yesterday we \u00A0watched kerbals walking on the M\u00FCn. And tomorrow we visit the forgotten depths of our history. We live in an Age of wonders my friends - I only wish it were a more tranquil one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Imagine how much the kerbals could learn about their history, or their environment! This could be as big a paradigm shift as the day a kerbal sets foot on the Mun.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E- JakeGrey.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2408801\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 58\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022text-align:left;text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;text-decoration:underline;word-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2506400\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 60\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-01T14:24:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2020 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ten Key","CreatedById":123319,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-13T21:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove the symbolism here.
