Faster and I won\u2019t have to wait for the shuttle in the rain.\u201D She looked at her watch. \u201CA ten minute dash has turned into a three hour tour. And we all know how that ended.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked up, checking again for any signs. There was still only the old-style conical sheet tin reflectors around old incandescent bulbs dangling down. The ceiling itself lost in the shadows untold meters above. She looked down at the floor, bare, sealed, dust-free concrete with regular metal spacers. Again, she saw no markers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u2019s like a labyrinth,\u201D she thought not for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned around looking for a signpost or something familiar, and again didn\u2019t see anything. Her walls were large pieces of equipment covered in thick, yellowed dust covered sheets of plastic. The dust hid whatever details the plastic failed to obscure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe walked over to one of them and pulled aside on sheet of plastic. It exposed the end of a large piece of pale enamel green equipment. The black and steel plate pinned with rivets identified it as an \u201CIntegrated Derivatives PID-10 Electronic Computer.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t look like any computer I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026 even in the movies,\u201D she thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe opened the access door underneath the plate. Inside were neat loops of patch cables and several boxes of resistors, capacitors, and inductors according to the labels. She looked at the manufacture date on the back of the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u201CThis is from the early days. I didn\u2019t think computers had been developed yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked at the cables and components. On the section marked \u201CBank 1\u201D there as a large switch and holes where the cables could be plugged in. There were smaller switches between the several pairs of holes. \u00A0She opened one of the boxes of inductors. They looked like they would fit into the pairs of holes and could be stacked. She put the box back and picked up the book inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the first page was an advertisement, \u201CFor best results interfacing Integrated Derivatives computers with E.G.O. Industries products use our Super-E line.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe flipped though the book. Most of it was circuit diagrams and differential equations. There was nothing she recognized as the parts of traditional computer. At the back were tables of KaPlace transforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CElectronics was a fly-by,\u201D she thought. \u201CAnd I barely passed differential equations.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe turned suddenly when she heard a pair of taps of wood on the concrete floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHello little one,\u201C an old kerbal said as he leaned on his cane. \u201CSorry if I startled you. Usually this thing give a bit of warning to people as I approach.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, I was \u2026\u201D she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old kerbal chuckled. \u201CYou got lost trying to take a shortcut. \u201C He walked over, each step marked with a tap of the cane. \u201CAnd wondered what you\u2019ve been walking by all this time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAh. An ID PID 10. Katherine never understood the electronics part of these things. But, she did think\u00A0of them as an elegant solution, and appreciated their place. Some of her computers thought these tin spaghetti boxes will put them out of a job. It just ended up changing it for those that could change.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow did it work? I don\u2019t understand anything in here.\u201D She tapped the book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe shrugged. \u201CI never did either. I was a pilot before my last flight.\u201D He tapped his leg. \u201CAnd an administrator afterwards. But, I\u2019m certain there are still some that do.\u201D He closed the door and moved the plastic back into place. \u201CBring it with you. You can internal mail it back to Vault admin when you are done.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned back to her. \u201CWhere you were headed miss\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMargo,\u201D she said. \u201CThe Computer \u00A0Complex.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe chuckled again. \u201CI could have guessed. Come I\u2019ll show you the way. The Vaults can trap the unwary or the unprepared.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey started down one the corridors between the equipment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe gravitas of technological history twists space from what we expect,\u201D he said. \u201CIt gives even me some trouble from time to time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe gave him a puzzled look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell,\u201D he said. \u00A0\u201CIt is better than I\u2019m losing my memory or these old things are moving on their own.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes\u2026 I can see that,\u201D she didn\u2019t really. But, given her wanderings she couldn\u2019t discount it either.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou mentioned Katerine\u2019s computers earlier,\u201D she said. \u201CI didn\u2019t know the program had computers that long ago.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh? We\u2019ve always had computers. We had about 200 between the corp and accounting. They\u2026 \u201C He paused and chuckled. \u201CRight, right. Back then, computer wasn\u0027t a device, it was a job description. \u00A0Not a bad one either.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSo why is all this down here?\u201D\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStorage against need, either academic or practical.\u201D He chuckled. \u201CInstitutionalized pack ratting other have called it.\u201D He gestured around. \u201CBut, here deep under Direc\u2019s Prairie we have lots of space. So there is little harm in keeping the odd bits and bobs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused and turned right. \u201CAh. Here we are.\u201D He gestured straight ahead. \u201CKeep straight and you\u2019ll come up under the complex. The cafeteria if I recall correctly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe looked down the corridor. \u201CThank-you. \u201C She turned back. \u00A0\u201CI didn\u2019t get your-\u201C she stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was gone. She hadn\u2019t heard the tapping of his cane as he left. She realized she hadn\u2019t heard it when he arrived either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
