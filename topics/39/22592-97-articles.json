Apart from fringe lunatics, most Christians would actually cope quite well with news of alien intelligence AFAICT. The fringe lunatics would cause problems, but I doubt we would reach 15 000 injured. I don\u0027t know about the Muslims, but assuming that the extremists would be boosted, their style is more terrorism than violent protests - so far most of them were shut down before acting, but the odd cell is regularly dismantled. With this kind of events, counter-terrorists would probably be overwhelmed, though, and the resulting violences would probably outshadow protest injuries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, the government would use this to come down hard on Christians for various reasons (mostly political - most Christians vote for the opposition). This could result with Christian protests against \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E, and some troubles would be to be expected, but they tend to be pretty calm protesters here. Of course, a few extremists and/or anyone giving orders to the police can (and did) engineer troubles, but this would conduct mostly to (possibly mass/arbitrary) arrests, and probably not that many injuries. I would expect bigger and violent anti-Christians protests, as well as aggressions and vandalism, to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith another government, I would expect some other form of incompetence, be it coming down hard on the Muslim (less probable but possible - with similar results) or simply letting the varied extremists (both religious and anti-religious) gain momentum until things blow up - but then again, most of the violence from protests would be between opposed groups more than with the police.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E probably be Hell Lite, simply not involving the antiriot police that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what, I\u0027m glad the middle of an alien-discovery world crisis, however awesome this would be otherwise.
