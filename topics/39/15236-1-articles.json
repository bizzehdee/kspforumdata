I have a story for you which is based on my first and second flight to minmus in 1.6. The first one had some problems, landed, but never returned. The second one went pretty smooth. My english is not the best, so the story is beeing told from the view of Dimitri Kerbal who also doesn\u0027t have perfect english. I also have some pictures so it\u0027s not as boring to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus Research Program\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHello, my name is Dimitri Kerbal. I am the director of the Minmus Research Program. You probably know about the Minmus landing from the year N208. Well, what would you say if I told you that it wasn\u0027t the first Minmus landing? The first rocket to go to minmus was finished in N198 JU8. It was a modified version of the Mun Alpha I which landed sucessfully on the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. It could carry enough fuel to go to minmus, and back to Kerbin while making a stop at the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. This masterpiece cost 850 Million Kerbs.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere, this is a picture of the first Mun Alpha which landed on the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi45.tinypic.com/9hrhci.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229hrhci.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe rocket launched on JU18. It could carry one person. This person was Kenmund Kerman. Everything seemed to be alright, but on the second day we noticed a deviation from the course, but our experienced workers could correct the course with minimal fuel waste. On JU32 the space craft approched minmus. It was time to decouple the main rocket from the lander. The headquarters gave the command to decouple, but even after 5 minutes both parts were still attached. Only after another 5 minutes the headquarters received a signal. The decoupler failed. The headquarters gave the command to abort the mission but Kenmund left the rocket and detached the lander manually. After he entered the lander he send the message that one engine was damaged by the detached rocket. This made the rocket unstable and it was unable to maneuver anymore. First he disabled the outer engines and started the middle engine which is used to get home, but the engine was not powerful enough. So he decoupled the outer landing engines and the lander got into the return stage. In this stage he went into an orbit and tried to land. Since the rocket doesn\\\u0027t have any rcs thrusters it would be impossible to position the rocket perpendicular again if it would have fallen over. And since the return stage doesn\u0027t have any landing sturts it would have to balance on the actual engine. Nonetheless he tried to land anyway. And he actually made it. The rocket landed on some kind of frozen lake, and it still had enough fuel to return to kerbin. He left the rocket and set foot on minmus. He send a photo of himself with the rocket on minmus. It\u0027s very blurred because it has been send from minmus to kerbin. Here, take a look.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi47.tinypic.com/91fq8n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002291fq8n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis is the last photo of him. He was never seen again. Two hours after this photo was made we lost the connection to him. We still had connection to the rocket, all the tools were still working, but Kenmund was just gone. Just like that. We don\u0027t know what happened, where he was, what he did. No sign of life. It seemed liked Minmus was a lifeless planet again.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis mission was kept secret of course. We can\u0027t just tell the people that we lost an astronaut just like that. It was kept secret just as all other failed space missions. We told the family that he died in a plane accident. The Mun Alpha II was never officialy launched. At least until N208. Ten years later, another Mun Alpha launch. This time everything went perfect. Officialy this was the first flight to minmus. The pilot was supposed to take a soil sample and research some of properties of the moon. He of course did that, but he was also supposed to check the first Mun Alpha rocket. It was night when he landed. The place where he landed was close to the first rocket. Everything is documented. We also have some photos.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAs you can see here the emergency light of the old rocket was still glowing, even though the battery should have died about 5 years ago.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi50.tinypic.com/11lihj8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211lihj8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe rocket is positioned exactly how it was documented from the first landing.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\\\u0027s a picture of official lander.

The cosmonaut even reported that the engines were still glowing red due to the burned fuel, but I don\u0027t know how far this is believable.

The food however was still there and it was fresh, even though the capsule was filled with oxygen, which is also weird because the oxygen tanks should have run out after one year even if theres noone inside. Suprisingly all the instruments were still working. Even after scouting the area no sign of life was found. After that all the official photos were taken.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi46.tinypic.com/156be3t.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022156be3t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENowdays we have a satelilte orbiting minmus, but even after numerous of scans we weren\u0027t able to find any sign of Kenmund.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat\u0027s all I can tell you.
