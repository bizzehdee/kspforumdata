Kerman\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman stared up at gleaming white rocket towering above him. He stood at the base of the crew tower next to Chadvey Kerman, his helmet under his arm. Buford T. Kerman was a wealthy industrialist from Exast, a propellium baron whose disposable income could pay the national debt of a rather large country. So vast was the fortune of Buford T. Kerman, that if it were all gathered into one spot and placed in a bin, Buford T. Kerman could swim through it like a short, pudgy, green dolphin. Even the laws of physics that said doing so would actually be quite impossible could be made to look the other way for Buford T. Kerman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it was really a fairly simple thing for Buford T. Kerman, or rather his concierge, to arrange a private tour of the space station, on extremely short notice, and with none other than the legendary Chadvey Kerman (no middle initial) along as his guide. It turns out administration officials could actually move \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E quickly when obscene quantities of money were not only waved in their faces but also used to slap them around some. The flight had been arranged in only a few days, a few days \u003Cem\u003Ebefore \u003C/em\u003EBuford T. Kerman had even been aware he was taking it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were only a couple of problems. First, Buford T. Kerman\u0027s truly ridiculous wealth existed only on paper; and even then only because of math so fuzzy one could amass a comparable fortune selling it to small, wide-eyed children around a certain spring holiday, after which it would end up in a shelter and appear in heart-wrenching commercials featuring washed up musicians. Second, until he showed up at the Space Center with Chadvey, no one had ever actually \u003Cem\u003Eseen\u003C/em\u003E Buford T. Kerman, despite his signature being all over several important documents. Buford T. Kerman looked an awful lot like Edgas Kerman (middle initial J) with a truly awesome but fake mustache.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman had been advised to say as little as possible during the lengthy check in process at the Kerbonaut Center, while ID\u0027s were examined, documents were verified, extremely accelerated training on Kerbonaut things was administered... and large wads of real money surreptitiously changed hands. The staff had likewise been admonished that Buford T. Kerman was a Kerbal of few words, that he shouldn\u0027t be pestered with matters of such banality, and any questions should instead be directed towards his highly respected and quite infallible chaperon, Chadvey Kerman, who was after all still the Deputy Director of Flight Operations, and pestering \u003Cem\u003Ehim\u003C/em\u003E might be deleterious to one\u0027s career at the Space Center. Chadvey himself was all smiles and handshakes, of course, hi-how-are-the-kids-grow-up-so-fast-don\u0027t-they-say-hi-to-the-missus-for-me and other such banter like a politician on the campaign trail. By the time Buford T. Kerman and his escort had passed through any room, no one was quite sure what had just happened. At long last the pair were dressed down, suited up, and shuffled off onto the short bus that would take them to the launch pad. By the time he was looking up at the massive white rocket, Buford T. Kerman was looking decidedly green...er.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cadre of white-clad technicians with hair nets checked them over, checked them again, then crammed them into the small elevator for the slow ride up. Buford T. Kerman watched the rocket\u0027s smooth flank slide by. MUL/Colossus-R5. It was the old workhorse of the space program. Over many dozens of launches, the Colossus booster had launched everything from Kerbals to interplanetary probes, and had received only minor revisions since its inception back in the early days of crewed flight. Not to be confused with crude flight, which was also quite common at the time.\u00A0The Manned Utility Launch spacecraft, affectionately called the \u0022mule,\u0022 had been the first KSA craft to carry more than a single Kerbal. It was cramped, utilitarian, and dated, but reliable as the dawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the elevator reached the final level, they were surprised by the sight of a lone helmetless Kerbal in a space suit coming at them with an outstretched hand and very eager face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi guys!\u0022 He said, with a high-pitched, nasally, slightly gravely voice, \u0022I\u0027m Captain Kerman and I\u0027ll be your pilot today, ayuh!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilot? Buford T. Kerman, not knowing what else to do, took the stranger\u0027s hand. \u0022Um, hi....\u0022 He glanced at the name patch, \u0022Derpy Kerman?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn less than an instant, that friendly, eager face was replaced by a heavy-lidded frown, with the chin just slightly raised, the voice several octaves lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s prrrronounced..,\u0022 a hint of trill on the \u0027r\u0027, \u0022...Door-\u003Cem\u003EPAY\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s Dachlandish.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, Dachland. Land of cheese, wine, and unnecessary letters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, um, I\u0027m sorry,\u0022 said Buford T. Kerman, feeling quite red, \u0022you don\u0027t sound Dachlandish.\u0022 The grip on his hand suddenly increased to crushing levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m\u003C/em\u003E not, the \u003Cem\u003Ename\u003C/em\u003E is.\u0022 Then, quicker than an electron changes orbitals, the eager, happy, ear-grating voice was back, and Derpy was shaking Chadvey\u0027s hand like a small, furry quadruped might shake a favorite chew toy, \u0022oh and I\u0027m ever so glad to meet you sir ayuh its a real real honor I\u0027m your biggest fan really I am I\u0027ve read all your books overnovernover again even the ones without pictures and I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m really here shaking your hand such an honor sir...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman stood there for a moment, his hand sticking out into thin air and throbbing, not quite comprehending. Derpy didn\u0027t seem to breathe. And Chadvey looked... troubled. More troubled than one should look with a small, obnoxious pest viciously attacking one\u0027s hand, that is. It was subtle, but it was there. With difficulty, Chadvey finally managed to free his brutalized extremity while remaining diplomatic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well now, the honor\u0027s all mine lad, always glad to meet a reader,\u0022 he managed to cut in, \u0022tell me, er, Captain, memory\u0027s a bit foggy after bein\u0027 b\u0027hind a desk so long, er, \u003Cem\u003Ehow \u003C/em\u003Emany flights is this for ya?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh this\u0027ll be my very first flight I\u0027m so excited I\u0027ve been with the corps forevernevernever but never made an actual mission my crewmates always got sick right before launch and never made it through a countdown but I dunno why I\u0027ve never been sick a single day in my life ayuh I always show up for training every single day and I know everything so don\u0027t you worry I\u0027ll be the very bestest pilot you ev--\u0022 he stopped in mid screech without slowing down first and looked at his watch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ohboyohboyohboy almost time now I gotta go start getting ready don\u0027t worry the Q-tips will you get you guys all taken care of and then we\u0027re all going to space today ayuh WOO HOO!\u0022 And with that he disappeared through the outer hatch in the launch shroud and into the capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman and Chadvey Kerman both stood there looking dumbfounded. A moment later, the elevator returned carrying the white-suited technicians with their white hair caps. Chadvey leaned in next to Buford T. Kerman\u0027s ear, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u0022stay in character this time,\u0022\u003C/span\u003E and immediately took one of the technicians aside and began speaking to him very animatedly. Buford T. Kerman was shortly swept up in yet another flurry of activity as he was herded into the pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had some idea why Derpy\u0027s former crewmates came down with such sudden illnesses. He was starting to consider kicking Derpy out of the hatch as soon as the opportunity presented its self.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-07T06:07:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2017 06:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T19:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003EChapter 23: \u0027So Much Universe, and So Little Time.\u0027\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDedicated to Sir Terry Pratchett\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApril 28, 1948 - March 12, 2015\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#252525;\u0022\u003EAT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hQBCYqg.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hQBCYqg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman actually \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E know the procedure. Even after all these years, having done it over and over again in training, it never left. But he was supposed to remain inconspicuous, as inconspicuous as a multi-bazillionaire foreigner with a Truly Awesome but Fake mustache could be, anyway, so he sat back, and let things happen to him. He was wedged into the couch farthest from the hatch, away from the most important buttons. Hoses were connected, lines were purged, straps were fastened, and cords were plugged, all by a swarm of technicians who somehow managed to move with otherworldly grace and ease in the claustrophobic capsule. Finally his helmet was secured, then with a rap on the top and a \u0027thumbs up,\u0022 they moved on to Chadvey in the center couch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey, however, would have none of it. Buford T. Kerman couldn\u0027t hear a thing through his helmet, but he saw hands batted away, connections made slowly and awkwardly, and someone lecturing someone on telling someone how to do someone\u0027s job. With a tap on the top, another \u0027thumbs up,\u0027 and a slightly forced smile, the technicians simply... left. A moment later, Derpy swung in with feline fluidity, plopping\u00A0into the couch next to the hatch. His mouth was moving, but Buford T. Kerman very thankfully could not hear. To his continued shock, however, Derpy seemed to flow like liquid. He moved with an agility and precision that made the technicians just look, well, derpy. Within moments, all his connections were secured, most without even looking, and the tense-looking technician just outside the hatchway breathed a visible sigh of relief once Derpy\u0027s helmet was on and the foul emanations ceased. This also marked the end of Buford T. Kerman\u0027s comfort, however, as a moment later the intercom sparked to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...wow this is so cool can\u0027t believe this is finally happening oh yeah oh yeah feel it unh unh we\u0027re goin\u0027 into spa-ace we\u0027re goin\u0027 into spa-ace...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA surprising relief came shortly, as the radio now crackled to life from Launch Control, \u0022good afternoon, gentlekerbs, radio check please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd once again, quick as a quantum state change, \u003Cem\u003EDerpy\u003C/em\u003E changed, his voice becoming calm, professional, and several octaves lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pilot Door-PAY Kerman, on radio, five by five.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good copy pilot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just as quickly, Derpy was back to his incessant, nasally banter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey followed, \u0022Chadvey Kerman, on radio, five by five.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good copy Chadvey.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EStay in character this time.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T.

Kerman turned a new and previously undocumented shade of green.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA technician quickly appeared and saved him any further embarrassment. The tech pointed at his wrist, raised a single finger, gave a final \u0027thumbs up,\u0027 then disappeared out the hatch. A moment later it was shut with a thud that could be heard even with helmets on, and just after that, the outer hatch in the launch shroud was bolted closed, shutting out the last bits of daylight. The capsule was now lit only by its interior lights. Buford T. Kerman looked out his small, round window, seeing only the textured inner surface of the composite shroud. He laid his head back on the headrest of his couch and took a deep breath, now feeling very much like canned seafood. He\u0027d forgotten how much he hated space travel. He glanced at the mission clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nT-1:00:00. One hour till liftoff. Buford T. Kerman strained and looked over at the checklists Derpy was loudly and madly running through.

He inserted it into a hole in the control panel, turned it 180 degrees, pushed it in slightly, flicked a small lever next to it and turned a knob.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022EDS is armed, mode zero.\u0022 He said, then leaned over and also armed the emergency hatch release. The Emergency Detection System constantly monitored a multitude of the rocket\u0027s systems and sensors. Out-of-spec numbers on any one of them would cause the EDS to activate the large launch escape tower mounted to the shroud over the pod, pulling it away from the failing rocket to safety. Well, hopefully. Or the crew could pull the handle Derpy had just installed. Buford T. Kerman noticed it was conveniently just out of his reach. Chadvey could reach it easily enough if he had to, and-- wait, was Chadvey \u003Cem\u003Esleeping?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Commencing fueling, confirm flow rates \u003Cem\u003EBounty\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flow rates look good,\u0022 Derpy said, watching gauges and flicking switches. Buford T. Kerman licked his dry lips with an even dryer tongue. At least that meant he couldn\u0027t taste that blasted... \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E for now. Through his couch, he could feel the rocket groaning and pealing as its structure began to bear the weight of thousands of liters of highly explosive fuel. The core stage, in particular, burned an unorthodox mixture of liquid oxium and propellium hydroxide, instead of the more common pure propellium. This gave it a moderate boost in efficiency but was known to be... unstable. There had never been an in flight failure from it, but still. Buford T. Kerman again looked longingly towards the abort handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nT-46:00\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDerpy was demonstrating himself to be a surprisingly competent pilot, at least. Everything he did, he did with authority and confidence, no hesitation, before returning to his incessant blabbering during lulls in communications. Buford T. Kerman was just along as a passenger, he had no role to play, all he could do was watch and pray for deafness. But maybe he was being too hard on the guy. He did seem to know his stuff after all.

Kerman let his mind wander. The further it wandered from Derpy the better. The frayed reality sensation still followed him like a distant cloud. Was any of this really real? This morning he was in jail, now he was in a... rocket? He wondered if he was really sitting in a padded cell back at the Sanatorium having a psychotic episode. Chadvey seemed... too perfect. Showing up just in time to talk him back, but not soon enough to help Edmund. Or Billy. It all seemed very convenient. And now he was on a rocket to the space station? Dr. Kerman had warned him there was an adversary. A cunning one. And an advocate too. An angel in his pocket, a devil by his side. But which one was Chadvey? Or is this what madness felt like? There was Derpy too. Surely only a delusional mind could come up with him. Chadvey seemed surprised at his presence, like he\u0027d been thrown in at the last minute by... someone else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tee minus thirty minutes, weather?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA different voice, \u0022weather is go, skies clear surface winds calm, light high altitude clouds, winds aloft three two at one three zero.

Outside, as the four giant PropelOx boosters neared the end of their fuel supply, they shut down in unison. Explosive bolts severed their struts to the core stage and small rocket motors pushed them away from the ascending stack.

The propellium hydroxide main engines ran much smoother than the boosters. As long as they didn\u0027t explode. He could see the displays again. Now Derpy was singing something about a magic carpet ride. The scientist in him was morbidly fascinated. Surely the sounds coming from Derpy\u0027s mouth were a violation of the laws of acoustics, let alone the biological limitations of vocal cords.

He reached over and shut off the radio, then began quickly and methodically flipping switches and pulling circuit beakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHe\u0027s.... He\u0027s powering down the ship? Why?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally he switched the main buss breakers, and the lights went out, leaving the pod illuminated only by small red emergency lights hidden away somewhere. To Buford T. Kerman\u0027s continued shock, Chadvey then switched off his own suit life support. He brought his face in close, mouthed the words,\u003Cem\u003E breathe shallow\u003C/em\u003E, another click, and then, utter silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman was surrounded by silence the likes of which he had never imagined. Without the annoying, familiar whisp of air over his face from the circulation fans, the only sound in the world was his own light breathing. He just stared at Chadvey, too shocked to even move. From somewhere, Chadvey produced a small, black box with two red-covered toggle switches. He flipped the cover on one, flipped the switch, and a small red light came on, glowing brightly in the darkness. He flipped the cover on the other, flipped the switch, there was a \u003Cem\u003Etingle\u003C/em\u003E, then even the emergency lights went out, and darkness swallowed the pod. It was a thick, heavy, constricting darkness like he\u0027d known back on the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuford T. Kerman tried to swallow with a dry throat. He could feel the darkness pressing in all around, squeezing him, choking him, trying to steal the breath from his lungs. He was sure he was about to panic, flail and scream use up the tiny bubble of air left in his suit, when Chadvey ever so gently gripped his helmet and moved his face to the small, round window next to him. Buford T. Kerman\u0027s breath \u003Cem\u003Edid \u003C/em\u003Estop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShining there in the darkness outside the lonesome pod, the stars blazed like eternity. In their thousands upon thousands, they seemed to swarm down upon the ship like the beacons of an Army of Light, arriving in the last desperate moment to rescue the fortress defenders when the walls had fallen and all seemed lost. He had seen stars before, of course, had spent long hours observing them from the space station, but always sullied by light seeping in from somewhere. Never like this. Never with such power. They exploded before him with color and life. The thought occurred to him, that only in the darkest times could the light shine the brightest. For that fleeting moment, he lost himself, and for the first time in a very long time, the hint of a smile touched the corners of his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the interior lights came back on, and Buford T. Kerman was drawn back to reality. Chadvey was quickly powering the pod\u0027s systems back on, obviously avoiding the radios and telemetry. Finally he dragged the floating umbilical back in, leaned out and pulled the hatch shut, and quickly disabled the emergency release. He turned some knobs, the reedy sound of rushing air indicating that cabin pressure had returned. Chadvey finally pulled his helmet off, then motioned to Buford T. Kerman, who suddenly realized he hadn\u0027t had any oxygen in quite some time. He quickly yanked his own helmet off and was left panting and sweating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, he was sure annoying, want he?\u0022 Said Chadvey with a grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u0022 screamed Buford T.

Said if he couldn\u0027t give her the M\u00FCn, he\u0027d at least give her something that\u0027d been \u003Cem\u003Eround\u003C/em\u003E the M\u00FCn, When he--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey tensed, as if realizing Edgas was there for the first time. It took him a moment to continue, \u0022er, anyways, Jorrigh was the MUL pilot in orbit, relaying the signals. Then there was Jerdous and Burdous, as representatives of the corps, Gene, the Chief Administrator--\u0022 his voice tried to catch again, sheer will seeming to be all that prodded him on, \u0022and the acting Flight Director, and a Robert Kerman from Layland Heavy Industries, who had provided the hardware under contract.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWheels in Edgas\u0027s head began to turn. A year after the landing, Layland Heavy Industries merged with Wutani-Kokuki to become the mega-conglomerate Layland-Wutani. Who financed Edgas\u0027s own mission to the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gears clicking, aren\u0027t they?\u0022 said Chadvey with a wink, \u0022bet this\u0027ll stop up the works. Right about the time the merger became official, Jorrigh died in the malfunction on the space station, and Gene died in a plane crash. A very convenient coincidence. Which, incidentally, set a policy in motion that, also very conveniently, prohibits the Flight Director, or any of his deputy staff, like yours truly, from being on the active roster...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...and if you\u0027re not on the active roster, even a deputy Flight Director needs a pilot,\u0022 said Edgas, his eyes growing wide with realization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye! And guess when that policy just happened to go into effect, all the right paperwork in place the whole time, just \u0027overlooked.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas didn\u0027t need to. \u0022But wait, so what happened on the M\u00FCn then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah found something. Two somethings, actually, but Ah brightened up b\u0027fore Ah told anyone about the second. There on the surface, not far from where Ah landed, was a small pedestal. It was either very big, or very heavy, \u0027cause it was firm in the ground. No Kerbal could have put it there. Aye, Ah can see ya doubt mah word.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom somewhere, Chadvey produced a small object wrapped in a cloth, \u0022this is what Ah didna tell them about. Sitting on that pedestal, Ah found \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe handed the object to Edgas. He unwrapped it, so amazed he let the cloth float away. It was actually two objects, that looked like they had once been one. A pure white disk, about the size of Edgas\u0027s hand, perfectly smooth yet not shiny. It was broken in two by a jagged, random line with many sharp edges. Other than the crack, it looked absolutely pristine and perfect. It felt extremely light, which was an odd thing to think in microgravity, but there it was. What was it made of? Porcelain perhaps? And some sort of strange, angular markings etched along the rim of one half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What....?\u0022 Edgas wondered absently, turning the objects over in his hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah took it to the lab, and the machine shop. Tried every drill bit, abrasive, cutting agent, chemical, multi-gigawatt laser, even a furnace that can melt titanium. Nothing so much as scratched the surface. Ah canna tell ya what\u0027s its made of \u0027cause Ah canna even get a sample to analyze. But Ah do believe what ya have in yer hands there, is absolutely indestructible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas moved it around in his hands. It felt so fragile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah ah, dunna try t\u0027 break it, you\u0027ll only hurt your thumbs. Dunna ask me how Ah know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at him, then looked back at the jagged, broken edge. He considered running a finger along it, then thought the better. Instead he took one piece, reached out and dragged the broken edge against one of the titanium ribs of the pod. It cut a small gouge, just enough to draw up a long curl of metal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s.... impossible....\u0022 Edgas said, still looking at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, that\u0027s just improbable,\u0022 Chadvey said with a wink, \u0022the truly impossible is yet t\u0027 come. You\u0027ve noticed the writing there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked more closely, \u0022so it \u003Cem\u003Eis \u003C/em\u003Ewriting? And you have no idea what it says, right?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, but Ah do,\u0022 Chadvey retorted, \u0022took me years to transliterate it, because at first Ah didna believe what Ah had. Ah\u0027ve scoured the historical record, that script does not exist anywhere, from any era. You\u0027re familiar with the ancient temple half buried in the desert?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at him, confused. The Temple of Nahtdahtunkhamun, the Boy King, and his bride, Queen Ahmahoyep the Fertile. According to legend, she bore thirty-three sons, none of whom bore the slightest resemblance to Nahtdahtunkhamun. The succession crisis upon his death was... interesting, to say the least. But what did that have to do with...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When they were excavating the place,\u0022 Chadvey continued, they found a stone tablet that had been used as building material, much older than the temple itself. Written on it was the same inscription in half a dozen different ancient languages. Nobody paid much attention to what was written on the back, since that one was already a dead language when the tablet was made.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas ran his finger lightly over the straight, angular markings. Why did they seem so familiar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The script on the tablet, and on that disk, are similar, but not identical. But it was enough for me to glean the basic phonemes, to read the sounds, as it were. Ah thought Ah\u0027d made a mistake, what Ah had transliterated couldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Epossibly\u003C/em\u003E be right. Spent years tryin\u0027 prove meself wrong.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA connection kept floating around on the edge of Edgas\u0027s consciousness, like a light so dim it disappeared if you tried to look directly at it. He\u0027d seen these shapes somewhere before. Wait, why did Chadvey keep saying...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Transliterated?\u0022 He asked, \u0022don\u0027t you mean translated?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey had an odd twinkle in his eye, \u0022get ready to have yer mind blown, lad. The \u003Cem\u003Ewriting\u003C/em\u003E is ancient, but the \u003Cem\u003Ewords\u003C/em\u003E it spells out...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are in Kerblish.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas\u0027s mouth dropped, \u0022wait, what?! That\u0027s...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...impossible?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes!\u0022 They were speaking Kerblish right now, it couldn\u0027t be, because... \u0022Kerblish is only a few hundred years old. That tablet would be--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thousands. And if mah hunch is right, what ya have there,\u0022 Chadvey said, pointing towards the disk, \u0022is much, much older.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas stared at the broken disc again. Where had he seen markings like that before? \u0022What does it say?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0027That is not dead, which can eternal lie.\u0027 And no, Ah haven\u0027t the foggiest what it means.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas rubbed his chin, turning the words now over in his head. His eyes lost focus, wandered about the cabin as he thought. Eternal lie, what could---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022THERE!\u0022 Edgas shouted, pointing at something on the console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?! What\u0027s wrong?\u0022 Chadvey said, startled, \u0022my gauges are all--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, \u003Cem\u003ETHERE!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Edgas wasn\u0027t pointing to a gauge, it was right there on the panel its self. \u0022I knew I\u0027d seen markings like that before! Look...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022 Chadvey leaned in closer. Now it was his turn to stare wide-eyed. \u0022By the stars,\u0022 he said softly, \u0022Ah must have seen that a thousand times by now, and never made the connection.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was right there all along, staring up at them from between the gauges. It wasn\u0027t perfect, but once noticed, the resemblance was unmistakable. The thin, angular lines of the Layland-Wutani logo could have come right from the writing on the disc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You found this on the M\u00FCn?\u0022 Edgas asked. It didn\u0027t make sense. \u0022No one could have beaten you there and planted it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ahm pretty sure we in the Kerblish-speaking world would have noticed if someone would have been to the M\u00FCn in the last few hundred years. Bit hard to hide footprints up there y\u0027know,\u0022 Chadvey said, \u0022but there is a connection you\u0027re still missing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Think about it... what were the coordinates of mah landing?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh that\u0027s easy, zero degrees forty minutes thirty-six seconds south, a hundred fifty-six degrees thirty-two\u003Cem\u003EGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Edgas stared wide-eyed as the realization hit him.

When I found it, it was still whole. Nothing could even scratch it. It broke, on its own, the day Edmund and Billy-Bobrim went there.

It\u0027s....\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Beyond our ability to comprehend?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye, lad. No matter how bad ya think it is, the reality is much much worse,\u0022 Chadvey said with a grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas thought. For a moment, he let a piece of the seal drift and tumble slowly in front of him, until it reminded him he was shortly due for his traditional bout of post-launch space sickness. The scientist in him was screaming, railing about the ridiculousness of it all, of some fairy tale m\u00FCn monster. The practical Kerbal in him was simply standing against the wall, arms folded, with a smug look on his face that said \u003Cem\u003EI told you so.\u003C/em\u003E Edgas closed his bulging eyes, and rubbed at the wide flat place between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You sent us there,\u0022 he finally said, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eyou \u003C/em\u003Echose the landing site, and the Company financed it. I remember your name specifically on the documents. You chose Edmund, Billy, and me specifically, yet you never gave us a word of warning. Why? You seem to finally be the one with all the answers, so why Chadvey?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye, Ah did,\u0022 he replied, staring very hard at nothing, \u0022Ah wanted to go back m\u0027self, do... something m\u0027self. But then they promoted me. Made me an Assistant Deputy Director. Ah didna want it, not at all, knew Ah\u0027d be stuck planetside. There\u0027s someone else, ya see. Dr. K. may have told you about him. He\u0027s been at this for longer than I have. Has his hand in everything. The more I realized the situation, the more he was able to cage me. It took years of research, chasing leads, following hunches, to glean what Ah\u0027ve gleaned about that seal, and about what it had bound. Ah have a scarce few on mah side, Dr. K. was one. He knew what he was getting into with Billy-Bobrim, knew what it might eventually do to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But Ah\u0027m ramblin. It\u0027s been all move, and counter-move, for the last many years. Ah knew I couldn\u0027t get back there m\u0027self, and honestly, I wouldn\u0027t have and still don\u0027t know what to do, not exactly. Ah picked you three deliberately. Edmund was a good friend, Ah\u0027d flown with him many times, including right after the sabotage on the station that took poor Jorrigh. He was clever and cunning, but he\u0027d never endanger his crew, not him. Ah didna know about his illness. It changed him, made him reckless, ambitious. Ah thought he would keep you out of trouble. But Ah knew you\u0027d find trouble anyway, so Ah sent Billy-Bobrim. He could fix anathin, if anyone could get you out of trouble, it would be him. And he didna have a mean bone in his body. What better to play against the sum of all evil, than the incorruptible? And finally, there\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 he turned to Edgas, \u0022you\u0027re smart, lad. Smarter than me, smarter than most anyone here, but you\u0027ve got heart too, tho\u0027 yah may not ken it. Ah thought, if anyone could find a solution, without even knowing the problem, to put together everything Ah\u0027d spent years figuring out together in just a short time, when it was most needed, it would be you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey\u0027s face was now drawn, and contrite, \u0022Ah was wrong. What was there, Ah understand it now, sort of. If you had gone with them, it would have gotten you too, then we\u0027d all be lost.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What??\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whatever was there wasn\u0027t the Kraken. More like a...a...\u0022 Chadvey waved a hand in the air as he searched for the word, \u0022an essence. A distillation. A trap. It got into Edmund, and Billy-Bobrim, but because of their unique... circumstances, it couldn\u0027t do whatever it is it wants to do. If it had gotten into you, maybe even some of it has...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas\u0027s thoughts darted between a million places at once, \u0022you mean Edmund... saved me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye. Whether he knew was he was doing at the time, or it was just the innate discretion I\u0027ve always admired him for, he did.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But... he did all those awful things...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As Ah said, I don\u0027t think there was much of Edmund left anymore by then. Whatever got into him was more like a shade, a shadow. A shadow has no substance, it can\u0027t touch the world directly, only influence and guide. Edmund, in turn, was in a perfect position to spread that influence, he had the ear of many powerful people.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what about Billy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah don\u0027t know lad, I really haven\u0027t the foggiest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas gave him a dirty look, but then a thought occurred as he mentally went back over Chadvey\u0027s words, something he\u0027d missed. \u0022Wait, you just said the station was \u003Cem\u003Esabotaged\u003C/em\u003E. Not an accident.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Give ya three guesses who built the core module. And that wasn\u0027t the last time Layland-Wutani had an \u0027irregularity\u0027 with the quality of their hull seals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go on...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You work in the contracts department, dig theirs up for the M\u00FCnbase hardware, specifically the rover. Buried deep in the fine print is a stipulation that if the crew has to abandon the facility for a medical evac, or if they just happen to die on a sortie, the Company is immediately entitled to a very large sum of money to cover the loss of their \u0027assets\u0027 in situ. Several times what said assets actually cost to produce.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas\u0027s eyes grew wide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMicrometeoroid! ...put a hole in the hull somewhere too, but damned if I can find it.....\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHad to make the trip back on suit ox... starting to run low....\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey entered more numbers into the computer, fired the thrusters again. Edgas let the thoughts float around his head as he glanced out the window. \u003Cem\u003EAren\u0027t we unusually high for a space station rendezvous?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What does it all mean? I\u0027m still missing the connection,\u0022 Edgas said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah dunno, but the Company\u0027s mixed up in it somehow. On paper, they went there looking for magnetite. Magnetite has some value, but barely enough to justify going to the M\u00FCn to get it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas could feel that awful taste creeping back yet again, and grimaced. Chadvey noticed this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ya dunna trust me, do ya lad?\u0022 he said with that constant, wry grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, actually...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well good,\u0022 Chadvey said with a wink, \u0022if Ah were you, Ah wouldna trust anyone. \u003Cem\u003EEspecially\u003C/em\u003E me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas stuck his tongue out against the taste, scraped it against his teeth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now what in the blazes are you...\u0022 Chadvey began, then his eyes widened, \u0022ach, ya fell asleep by the lake didn\u0027t yah?\u0022 He shook his head incredulously, \u0022never fall asleep by the lake, every first-year recruit knows that!\u00A0You\u0027ll wake up with a RatSquirrelFish playin\u0027 kissy-face, they\u0027re frisky this time of year.

On a space ship? Ach, hang on,\u0022 he said, as he rummaged around wherever it was he kept producing odd things from, \u0022here, chew on this.\u0022 He handed Edgas a small, round, lump of brown... something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment Edgas though to question, but... he popped the lump into his mouth and chewed. \u0022Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! This is horrible! It burns! What on Kerbin is it?!?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah\u0027ve absolutely no idea,\u0022 Chadvey said, \u0022it collects around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports some times. But you dunna taste the wee beastie any more do yah?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas didn\u0027t think he\u0027d taste anything else ever again. And for the moment, wasn\u0027t complaining about it. He looked out the window again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aren\u0027t we way too high to reach the space station?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, we\u0027re not going to the space station, lad.
