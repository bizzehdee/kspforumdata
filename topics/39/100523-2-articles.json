If you go into the node setup for the background (In cycles render engine) you should see a simple image texture going into the background node, then into the World output. If you add a Texture Coordinate and a mapping node in front of the image texture you will now be able to control where and how that picture shows up. \n\nSo it will go Texture Coordinate --\u003E Mapping --\u003E Image Texture --\u003E Background --\u003E World Output\n\nConnect either the Generated, Window, or Camera option in the Texture Coordinate to the mapping node. Then play with the location, rotation, and scale values to move your image around.\n\nOr, an easy quick virtually full proof method to add a \u0022background\u0022 behind your scene. Go to user preferences and then addons. Enable the Import Images as Planes addon and save your preferences. Now when you go to the import menu you will see the option to import an image as a plane. So, import a background type image and it should magically appear on a plane with the node setup already to go on a nice flat plane. Next move that plane to the back of the scene facing the camera. Boom, one easy and quick background. A very easy way to fake a background. The only problem with this method is it does not provide any global lighting to the scene. You\u0027ll have to adjust your lamps match the look of the background.\n\nA great tutorial on using HDR backgrounds here\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgfw2QwXtA4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nLots of good tutorials on that channel.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T17:31:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by esinohio**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T18:00:55Z","Content":"Thanks, also where can you get all of the textures for all of the parts?
