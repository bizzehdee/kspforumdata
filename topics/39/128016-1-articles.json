I had \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/dsimkora\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etried something similar\u003C/a\u003E with The Sims 3, and while I recently went back and read through all my sim tweets and laughed a lot and had a great time reading them I never managed to amass any sort of real following whatsoever, despite The Sims having a huge fictional community writing stories on the forums similar to KSP - but not enough bothered with twitter it seemed. My only hope in regards to KSP was that where my Sims followers would mostly have to also be interested in The Sims, all people really needed to be attracted to my KSP account was an interest in science, space, gaming in general \u003Cem\u003Eor \u003C/em\u003EKSP. In other words, I had a much broader audience I could reach out to, which is why I worked so hard to make it not just about KSP and be sure to mix in real science and astronomy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompared to my Sims account, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E@KSA_MissionCtrl\u003C/a\u003E has been a huge hit. 2k\u002B followers, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NIztZWI.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexchanging tweets\u003C/a\u003E with and being \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bdKzmHD.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eretweeted by\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E space agencies \u0026amp; astronauts, and an active and responsive follow-base (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/NqafF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis still makes me smile so hard\u003C/a\u003E) - not to mention the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/lists/other-agencies/members\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E50\u002B other KSP twitter accounts\u003C/a\u003E that have come along since I began.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, it was just an experiment.

So the general feeling at this point is \u0022well, that was fun, good job, time to move on\u0022 - but in this case \u0022moving on\u0022 means going back and starting fresh based on everything I have learned and developed over the last two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESeeking Stability\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my major hurdles over the course of this project has been continuity. I\u0027ve put a lot of effort into maintaining the look and feel of things since I started with KSP v0.23. If you look at the oldest images posted you\u0027ll see the ugly white horizon from the surface of Kerbin but that\u0027s pretty much the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E thing that visually changes over the course of the KSA. Besides the visual look, both major and minor updates have brought enough changes with it to require copious amounts of time making sure everything I have in operation is still working okay. Knowing what breaking changes are coming down the road (such as wheels) has restricted me in what I can do and hope to carry forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is at full release now but the pace of change in the game hasn\u0027t let up, especially in the mod community! Holy crap have you seen the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/103963-wip-scatterer-atmospheric-scattering-v00215-05122015-ocean-shaders-get-them-while-theyre-hot/\u0022\u003Enew ocean shaders\u003C/a\u003E?

And this is all \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E Unity 5 hits and brings with it even more options I can\u0027t even fully comprehend at this point. Really, the v1.1 Unity 5 update is what really forced me to think seriously about a reboot. A lot of long-toothed mods that don\u0027t see much active development anymore might not even make it to v1.1. The new signal relay system could really shake up the RemoteTech community. I\u0027m just tired of trying to keep up based on what I started with in 0.23, as proud as I am I managed to hold things together this far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo What Happens to the \u0022Old\u0022 KSA?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously I\u0027m not going to toss two years of work into the trash. I\u0027ve already created the archive.kerbalspace.agency sub-domain that will host everything you see on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe website\u003C/a\u003E right now (including all the mission logs, plot synopsis, etc I still have to add) while the www.kerbalspace.agency site is stripped to bare bones content. The archive sub-domain will also host its own Flight Tracker and Crew Roster and all the data for the old craft. Once I download my December twitter archive, all tweets will be erased and the archives will be hosted on the sub-domain. I can\u0027t set flickr albums to private, so the albums will be deleted but the images will all remain and have an \u0022archive\u0022 tag added to them so that when searched from the Flight Tracker or Crew Roster under the sub-domain they appear while the newer KSA images do not once they start being uploaded. I will include the old photos in a Wordpress gallery on the sub-domain as well. Youtube videos will all be made private so that they don\u0027t appear in the channel but direct links and embeds continue to work from the sub-domain. Instagram will be cleansed as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically the public and front-facing KSA appearance will be a clean slate while retaining all followers and subscribers, but everything that came before will still be accessible if you know where to look (in the sub-domain, which will be linked from the main domain).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the \u0022New\u0022 KSA?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe core concept remains the same and game days will be locked to real days. The only difference is the game\u0027s 0 epoch will remain 2/16/14 for a number of reasons. One is simply because I don\u0027t want the planets all going through the same thing I\u0027ve already experienced. Another is that I plan to keep all of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/photos/kerbal_space_agency/albums/72157659924474130\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eastrophotography photos\u003C/a\u003E that don\u0027t show the KSC and those would have happened in the past. Finally and most importantly I plan to keep the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AF0pQGzGpyKYzQDDjbgW8Z2JiTYZbhu4Okl-2k5Eb2o/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAsteroid Tracking Network data\u003C/a\u003E intact, which relies on the game\u0027s starting time also staying the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen will it begin? That\u0027s up to Squad and when they release v1.1. \u003Cem\u003EI want the barn\u003C/em\u003E. If it\u0027s not in v1.1 I will wait for it. When I first began, there was a lot more real story happening in regards to the KSA finding its feet. But having such a professional-looking facility that is obviously capable of so much more always bothered me, and I even eventually fell into a more \u0022professional\u0022 mindset in how things were being handled. I really want to get back to putting more character development into events and I want the space center to be a character as well, not just a static set piece that says \u0022NASA\u0022 to anyone who looks at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow will things progress? Well the main change is I plan to mostly put away the joystick and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61827-105-kos-scriptable-autopilot-system-v0182-20151126/\u0022\u003Eprogram my rockets\u003C/a\u003E. One of the reasons I started this whole thing right after first playing the game instead of gaining any experience was so that I would actually make all the newbie mistakes while still being a newbie space agency. Although this time around I\u0027ll have a lot of experience flying rockets up into space, I still don\u0027t have any real experience programming rockets to fly up into space, so all the struggle I will have doing that will be real. The Community Tech Tree is also a great thing, and will give me a much better progression now that I can also \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-105-community-tech-tree-22-last-updated-221115/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2317598\u0022\u003Eproperly tune\u003C/a\u003E my science intake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to all this the other major change is I also plan to add \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/93999-105-outer-planets-mod-181-neidons-moons-get-biomes-and-blurbs-8-nov/\u0022\u003EOuter Planets\u003C/a\u003E to the mix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving forward, until the new KSA begins I will continue to finish developing the Crew Roster and the launch telemetry streaming.

So I\u2019m left to conjecture about the exact nature of the confusion surrounding these tweets (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://twitter.com/KSA_MissionCtrl/status/677095909289672706\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexample\u003C/a\u003E) and the best guess I have is people didn\u2019t understand how they applied. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious the tweet is telling you the sun will rise at this time and set at this time \u2013 but people may have been confused about what the times meant, not understanding that events I tweet about play out in real time? The idea of these tweets was so I could say \u201Claunch will be after 2nd sunrise\u201D in order to use a general time rather than a specific time. People could then reference the timetable tweet to see when 2nd sunrise is. You could also use the times to better take certain tweets into context knowing when it is night and day at the time of the tweet. I also think the tweets gave a nice sense of progression since the times change based on Kerbin\u2019s position around the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there were some tweets that seemed to be from one of KSA workers rather than official KSA tweets\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty sure this was a reference to my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/TtmuO#12\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enight janitor sub-plot\u003C/a\u003E, which did confuse a couple of followers who thought I got hacked or something.
