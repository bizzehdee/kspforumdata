I hope some of you stick with me and decide to read this entire thing! \n\nSince the KSP forums are the nicest, and most helpful gaming community I\u0027ve ever been a part of I figured I would start by asking here. I have a Youtube channel which I am trying to grow its fanbase and I believe with enough hard work it is possible. (will link it below) Since KSP forums has the best community I am asking for your help! With the youtube channel comes the need for a cover photo to represent your channel along with a cool looking logo! See where this is going yet? I have very very limited image editing and enhancing skills and could use some assistance in creating a cover photo and a cool logo. Both of which will need to represent my channel which covers video games but mainly KSP. (right now waiting for the KSP 1.0 update to upload any more KSP videos.) \n\nI do want to apologize ahead of time if the mods frown upon this thread, I just didn\u0027t know where else to ask for help from the mass KSP community. \n\nIf your still reading you must be a little interested at this point right? So you may be wondering, \u0022Okay, well what kind of design do you want?\u0022 See... I do not know, I am not that creative of a person and really just would rather be surprised by what you all can come up with rather than me trying to describe what I would want when I doubt it will look as good. \n\nLast paragraph! You may be wondering, \u0022Whats in it for me?\u0022 I cannot promise payment, (yes I am asking out of the goodness of everyones heart.) However, I can promise recognition. For example, mentioning your forum name on my website plus in a new video after the pictures have been updated. Also if you have a forum thread where you do image editing and making images look all pretty. That will be linked in a overlay in a video, on the website and mentioned in video.\n\nAgain guys, I\u0027m just asking for a little help when I could use it! Thank you for reading!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T17:01:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 7499275**"}]}
