Unworthy to set foot inside She who watches over us.\u201D He raised his arms and five Kerm vines erupted around him in a shower of earth. Three of them snaked over to the figure still lying prone on the ground, the other two rose to caress his fingertips, before bending and unfurling into a double ring of needle-sharp teeth. Slowly, almost languorously, the glistening inner tendrils emerged and waved at the commander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI am the Speaker to the Unworthy.\u201D He gave the commander a mocking smile, before prodding the fallen figure with his toe. \u201CI could kill her with a thought. I could kill all of them with a thought.\u201D Two of the tendrils twisted together into a point. The vines on the ground curled around the prone figure\u2019s head and plucked the circlet of leaves from her brow. \u00A0\u201CAnd as for you, your foolish masks will not save you here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething glinted from the eaves of the Keeper hut and Gusemy looked up sharply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStand down.\u201D The commander\u2019s voice was suddenly ragged. The Veiidans lowered their weapons, fear showing in more than one pair of eyes. Their sergeant took a step back, her tongue moistening the corner of her mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy cleared his throat. \u201CIt would be a difficult shot for me,\u201D he said. \u201CBut I don\u2019t imagine it would present a challenge to any of my companions.\u201D He pointed at the hut in the centre of the clearing. \u201CYour Keeper is good but she will find it rather harder to control the vines without a camera to see them with.\u201D He gave the Veiidan commander a grim look. \u201CWith that level of control, we\u2019re dealing with a Kerm which can see through its Keeper\u2019s eyes and is intelligent enough to take instructions.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe commander\u2019s eyes widened. \u201CAwakened then. But the Children wouldn\u2019t break the law of\u2026\u201D He turned back to the crowd and the look on his face caused his sergeant to take another step back. Behind her, the Veiidan troops raised their weapons again. \u201CI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done here,\u00A0 but you will take me to your Keeper. Now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo his utter astonishment, the other gave him a lopsided smile that wasn\u2019t quite a sneer. \u201CAre you sure you want to, my kermbal minsathona? We are not blasphemers here, who would break the most sacred Law. We keep to the old ways \u2013 the forgotten ways.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEnough of this!\u201D The commander whirled and pointed at four of his troops. \u201CYou, you, you and you. With me. And you, Ambassador.\u201D He beckoned Gusemy over before spinning round to face the Children. \u201CLet\u2019s go.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the waving vines bobbed up and down in an unmistakeable nod. The Speaker looked at the soldiers, malice dancing behind his eyes. \u201CLet us go indeed.\u201D He walked over to the hut, flung open the door and bowed. \u201CAfter you, good kerbals.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe four Veiidans piled through, Gusemy and their commander close behind. They found themselves in a wedge-shaped room, with doors on both of the long walls and a Kerm trunk visible at the far end. A sparsely furnished kitchen area ran down one side of the room and a scattering of homespun sack chairs around a low table occupied the other side. The cinnamon laden air caught the back of Gusemy\u2019s throat making him cough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe commander waved two of his squad over to one door and took up a position at the opposite door with the others. He gave a low whistle and both doors crashed open, propelled by the shoulders of the largest soldiers. Gusemy hurried in after them and stopped in dismay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the middle of the room by the Kerm trunk, a naked kerbal sat on a hewn wooden throne, her modesty preserved by a short loincloth and the profusion of vines wrapped around her legs and waist. Her head rested against a forked branch, swathed in multiple clusters of Kerm leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGusemy glanced around the room, barely hearing the pungent oath from one of the troopers as he took in the rows of bunks curving out from either side of the throne, each of them occupied by a small white-robed figure, head nestled within a leaf cluster. Almost absently, he noticed their blank-eyed stares, their sandaled feet barely reaching the end of their bunks. Then his mind caught up with what his eyes were telling him and the acrid taste of bile rose in the back of his suddenly heaving throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was answered by creaking branches and a gust of cinnamon. Then an all-too-kerbal voice replied from amidst the Kerm leaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis one I speak through was the first. The older ones broke and were shed but the young ones were resilient. They joined with me and then they became me.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWho are you? What are you?\u201D The commander spoke through clenched teeth, whether through anger or the need to control his own stomach, Gusemy couldn\u2019t tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have no need of names. I am Kerm.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside the hut, the five vines whisked back under the soil. The kerbal on the ground picked herself up and looked around warily. The Speaker waited for a moment then, when the vines remained out of sight, raised his arms to the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022She calls! To me, my brethren - to me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt his cry, the still-silent crowd came to life, scurrying towards the Keeper\u0027s hut, which was rapidly surrounded by a ring of bodies several kerbals deep. One figure, robes streaked with dirt and her cheek still sticky with saliva squirmed her way to the front door where she stood behind the Speaker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Clear the entrance!\u0022 The Veiidan sergeant cocked her weapon. \u0022Clear the Blighted entrance!\u0022 Seeing no movement from the crowd, she fired a single shot over the hut roof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stand and be true, my brethren! They cannot harm us in Her sight!\u0022 The Speaker folded his arms over his chest. \u0022Would you kill us all? Females and children too? I named you well, \u003Cem\u003Ecoward.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA small part of Gusemy\u0027s mind began to pick out the details in what he was seeing. The rivulet of drool escaping from the corner of the Keeper\u0027s mouth, eyes staring at a screen suspended from the ceiling. The splashes of colour adorning the wrists of the motionless kerblets on their bunks. The Kerm vines openly coiling around bedsteads and kerbal flesh alike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...so many kerbals. I only have so many vines and most are needed to keep their bodies alive. But there are always more kerbals, and with care...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Keeper\u0027s gaze snapped round. A wet, tearing noise plucked at Gusemy\u0027s ears followed by the thump of bodies hitting the ground. They convulsed, bloodstains blooming against the whiteness of their robes, then lay still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...I may regain the use of enough vines for the purpose.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGore streaked tendrils slashed at Gusemy, the needles around their base strung with gobbets of tissue and shreds of green skin. With an inarticulate cry he reeled back, arms thrown up to shield his face. The needles scored parallel grooves across his sleeve, snagged against his elbow pad and ripped free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHit the dirt and let my lot deal with it..\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E Gusemy dropped to the floor, arms curling protectively around his head. He felt a second and then a third vine lash against his armour before coiling around his boot and pulling. Panic rising, he kicked out with his other leg, scissoring one boot against the other. The insidious tugging relaxed and he rolled away, yells and then barked commands sounding overhead. He crashed into the side of a bunk, swearing as he struck his head, and then gunfire made any further thought impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite himself, the Speaker flinched at the gunshot, it\u0027s deafening retort only slightly muffled by the hut wall. \u0022Stand, my Brethren! The Vines will protect us!\u0022 Sporadic shots crashed out, accompanied by shouts and yells. \u0022Feel their panic! Smell their fear of Her wrath!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd began to shuffle, twitching at the muffled sounds of combat from inside the hut, flinching at every shouted order. The Speaker\u2019s gaze flicked from side to side. \u0022Stand! Or be forever cast out as Unworthy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother burst of gunfire crashed out and the crowd broke. Seizing their opportunity, the Veiidans charged, knocking fleeing figures aside as they went, before kicking down the hut door and dashing inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe ran.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnoring the fleeing Children around him, doing his best to ignore the furious cries and promises of eternal suffering at Her hands, he ran. Part of him flinched with shame at every screeched imprecation, knowing that deep down at the core of his being, he was indeed unworthy. Another part of him noted the lack of pursuing vines and knew that his worst fears had come true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forest enfolded him, vast and comforting, and yet another part of him slipped into the familiar routines, avoiding fallen twigs that would give him away, skirting around the animal trails, stepping around the soft ground that could reveal a stray boot-print, snatching up a handful of mud to smear over his clothing or a fallen bough to brush out the signs of his passing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Unworthy were not lacking in skills of their own but they did not have his intimate knowledge of this forest. He wormed his way into a patch of thorny bushes and waited, mud-smeared clothing blending in with the shadows. Eventually, satisfied that the chase had been abandoned, he drifted back to the village breaking off every so often to circle his own trail, alert to any signs of lingering pursuit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreeping from tree to tree he made his way to the edge of the village clearing, anger rising at the sight of his brethren herded like kaya and watched over by stony-eyed Unworthy.\u00A0 Then he caught sight of the white-robed figures laid out in a row in front of the hut and anger congealed into fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven without the bands of green at her collar, the very size of one figure, when set against the rest of the Blessed, would have been enough to give her away as his Keeper. His eyes flitted from one set of forlorn robes to the next, scanning the patches of colour at their sleeves. A flash of yellow caught his eye and he stiffened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe chequered band seemed to taunt him, its uneven pattern a mute testament to his inexperienced needlework. He felt her arms around his neck, her voice reassuring him that the Kerm wouldn\u0027t mind and that she didn\u0027t care anyway because yellow was her favourite colour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFear erupted into blazing fury. He tensed, lips writhing in a silent snarl, poised to hurl himself at his tormentors, hooked fingers ready to gouge and tear until the cowards could finally put an end to him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDon\u0027t be silly, Daddy.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fury collapsed. Shaking with grief and self-loathing he crawled back into the forest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cars drew up at Jonton\u0027s front gate. He watched the driver climb out, followed by a pale-haired kerbal whom he recognised as Gusemy\u0027s aide. Finally, the ambassador himself emerged, face drawn with weariness and something else that Jonton couldn\u0027t put a name to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a strained lunch, during which the ambassador\u0027s mind was very obviously on other things, his staff retired to their rooms upstairs. Gusemy stood listening, head on one side, then at the quiet click of two closing doors, turned to face Jonton. \u0022Is Elton available?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I spoke to him immediately after your telephone call. He\u0027s expecting us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good. I have no desire - or intention - of going through this twice.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded and held open the sleep room door. \u0022After you, Ambassador.\u0022 He watched Gusemy approaching his bunk with a curious reluctance, lips moving soundlessly as he arranged his pillows and lay down. For a long moment he stared at Elton\u0027s leaf cluster over his head with what looked like revulsion before finally closing his eyes and submitting to their touch. Brow furrowed with concern, Jonton lay down on his own bed and joined them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe emerged above a similarly furrowed mindscape, which thrummed across his nerves like the air before a thunderstorm. A dark, hunched figure stood alone, tension radiating from him in waves. Jonton sensed Elton\u0027s presence maintaining a discreet distance and wondered why the Kerm wasn\u0027t doing more to reassure the obviously distressed ambassador.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I have tried. Any closer and my presence causes him too much fear to contain\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFear?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;I do not understand either, First of my Keepers. I would have you ask him, kerbal to kerbal, whilst I listen from a distance\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI think that might be for the best\u003C/em\u003E. Jonton broke his private connection to Elton, letting himself drift forward towards Gusemy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CIs he listening?\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYes, but he\u0027s promised not to come any closer. He seems to think you\u0027d prefer it that way.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGiven the choice, I\u0027d prefer to be as far away as possible from any Kerm, let alone a sapient one\u003C/em\u003E. A harsh laugh scraped across their mental link. \u003Cem\u003EBut since when have my duties ever been so obliging.\u003C/em\u003E Gusemy gathered himself. \u003Cem\u003EYou told him the release word?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYes, and he will honour it, although he doesn\u0027t understand why it should be necessary\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHe will. You both will\u003C/em\u003E. Black loathing flooded down the link like a tide of raw sewage and Jonton swallowed the bile that rose in his own throat in response. \u003Cem\u003EBut I can promise that neither of you will like it.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn image of armoured figures standing around an olive green off-roader appeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027d been working with the neo-Kerman - visiting their camps and doing what I could to persuade them that we were serious about giving them a voice before the One-Twenty. We thought - hoped - that we could also persuade the Children of Kerbin that were serious about throwing ourselves on the wisdom of the Kerm...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the final image of discreetly covered corpses being gently lifted into the back of that same off-roader, faded away, Gusemy felt his mental links with Jonton and Elton widen fractionally and then a little further, the Kerm clearly trusting that he\u0027d be able to keep his emotions in check once more. The mindscape had turned a uniform slate grey, ominous thunderheads building up in the distance, sensed rather than seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhy?\u003C/em\u003E Jonton shook his head.\u003Cem\u003E Wrong question. How?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFrom what we learned speaking to the villagers, a wilful and reckless lack of control.\u003C/em\u003E Jonton sensed that the ambassador was deliberately retreating behind formal language. \u003Cem\u003EWe already knew that a sizeable faction of the Children held a... romanticised view of a kerbal\u0027s place before their Kerm and apparently that was reinforced by your historical revelations.\u003C/em\u003E Gusemy felt Jonton blanch. I\u003Cem\u003E\u0027m afraid so - at least one of this particular village had Communed with you which, unfortunately, reinforced their worldview. Even more unfortunately, it introduced them to the notion of mass-Communing as part of that worldview.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI\u0027m not sure I like where this is going.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo. They revelled in their first mass Communion believing it to be a long-lost gift from the Kerm.

Can we tie her sheet on, Dad, in case it falls off?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course we can.\u201D Jonton walked over to her and sat down cross-legged beside her, staring unseeingly at the vines curled around the bedframe. \u201CI don\u2019t think I want to see it either.\u201D He plucked at the sheet, twisting a fold of it between his fingers. \u201CI\u2019m not sure that tying it on will help though. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201D Glad of something to do, he patted Joenie on the shoulder before leaving the room and returning with his mending basket. \u201CLet\u2019s start by tucking the sheet in, as much as we can. I\u2019ll do this side and you do the other one? Don\u2019t pull it too tight \u2013 I\u2019m going to cut out some windows for the vines.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay.\u201D Joenie set to work. Jonton waited until she was finished before smoothing the sheet over Gerselle and tucking it in on his side. \u201CThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m going to need two pairs of hands for the next bit. Can you hold it here? Little bit further from the vine? Perfect.\u201D He retrieved a fabric pen from the basket and made a mark. \u201CSame on the other side\u2026 and a mark across the top.\u201D He looked at Joenie anxiously. \u201CAre you alright doing this?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo. Not really. But I don\u2019t really want to talk to Jonelle right now and I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded. \u201CThat\u2019s about how I feel too, sweetheart. Come on \u2013 the quicker we get this part done, the quicker we can go into the living room and finish it off. Maybe over a sapwood coffee or a prickleberry juice and mint?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI suppose.\u201D Joenie shook her head before giving him a wan smile. \u201CSorry. That would be nice, Dad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresently, the sheet covering Jonelle was decorated with a fringe of pen marks. Jonton stood up and helped Joenie to her feet. \u201CI\u2019m going to take the sheet off now. Do you want to go and make a drink and I\u2019ll come through in a minute?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie nodded and left the room, closing the door behind her. walked over to the bed, pressed his fingers to his lips and brushed them against Jonelle\u2019s cheek. \u201CShe\u2019s so very much like you, you know,\u201D he said softly. \u201CShe\u2019s going to make us both proud \u2013 I just wish you were here to watch her do it.\u201D He slid the sheet off her, being careful not to snag it against any of Jonelle\u2019s vines, and gazed at his wife\u2019s closed eyes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s no good.\u201D Jonton fetched the covers from the spare bed and draped them over her, tears prickling the back of his own eyes. \u201CCouldn\u2019t just leave you there getting cold.\u201D He balled up the sheet, hands knotted within the tangle of fabric. \u201CJust\u2026 couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not doing this very well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EYou\u2019re doing it just fine, seeing as you\u2019re keeping it together for my daughter\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Emy father.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI should go and help Joenie.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhy don\u2019t you do just that, Jonton Kermol.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton inhaled deeply, letting his breath out through his mouth. Then he slung the sheet over his shoulder, picked up his mending basket and left the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe walked into the living room to find Meleny and Adbas sitting with a red-eyed, Joenie, both hands wrapped around a mug of juice. Giving Meleny a grateful look, he spread the sheet out on the floor and began cutting along one of the pen marks decorating its border. Meleny watched him cut out a strip of fabric and set it to one side before starting on the next set of marks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDo you have any spare scissors?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton didn\u2019t look up from his work. \u201CTwo, I think.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJust right for these two spare pairs of hands sitting next to me. This is for Gerselle isn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton nodded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought so. Now why don\u2019t you hand over your scissors to me and make yourself useful putting a hem down that slot you\u2019ve just cut. If we\u2019re going to do this, let\u2019s make a proper job of it. Adbas \u2013 you start on that side. Joenie \u2013 you go and work on your Dad\u2019s side, and I\u2019ll start here.\u201D \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe received a watery grin in reply. Adbas gave Joenie an anxious look as she sat down beside her father, before taking up his own scissors and peering at the edge of the sheet. Jonton retrieved a needle from his basket and began threading it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time that Thombal arrived, scissors had been swapped for needles and thread all round. He took a seat in the corner and watched Adbas finish a line of stitches, tongue poking from the corner of his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFinished, Mum.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m finished too.\u201D Joenie put her needle back in its box and sat cross-legged on the floor, staring at her feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think we\u2019re all done.\u201D Jonton put his own needle away before tidying up everyone else\u2019s tools and gathering up the sheet. \u201CThanks, Meleny, thank you, Adbas.\u201D He squeezed Joenie\u2019s shoulder briefly before getting to his feet. \u201CI\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a murmured conversation with Joenie, Adbas, disappeared into the garden, leaving Meleny and Thombal in an awkward silence that was only broken by Jonton\u2019s reappearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou can come through now, if you\u2019d like.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey followed him into sleep room, to find Gerselle\u2019s body draped with the sheet, its edges tucked neatly away, and Jonelle\u2019s vines disappearing under it through the hand-stitched slits. Thombal and Meleny bowed their heads in respect, before Adbas tiptoed in and handed Joenie a pair of flowers. She stepped forward, jaw clenched, and arranged them on her mother\u2019s chest, bowing her own head for a moment before walking back to her father\u2019s side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe day of the funeral dawned bright and clear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lack of funeral cars available for hire, even to the Sage of Barkton, had been a sobering reminder that, for so many others outside his Grove, life was only just beginning to return to normal after the war. In the end he had made do with Fredlorf\u2019s old tractor and trailer, both cleaner than the day they\u2019d been bought, and draped in black. Somewhat to his surprise, Gerselle\u2019s father had wholeheartedly approved of the impromptu arrangements, reminding anyone in earshot that his daughter had been a hard-working lumberkerb before she became a Keeper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtop the trailer, Gerselle\u2019s body lay in repose, wrapped in the traditional white linen on a bower of fresh Kerm branches donated by both Elton and Jonelle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn one Grove, villagers lined the sides of the road to bid farewell to their Keeper. In another, they turned out to the last kerblet to escort one of their own to her final resting place. They walked alongside the trailer, the muted rumble of the tractor\u2019s electric motor providing a sombre accompaniment to their footsteps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end of the field, at the edge of the Grove proper, the sweetblossom pole stood against the skyline, the officiant\u2019s podium already set up in front of it. The tractor drove through the gate and stopped; its escorts already making their way across the field to take their places by the graveside, leaving six figures standing by themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton climbed onto the trailer and lifted one end of the bower. Fredlorf and Thombal caught the other end, passing it back hand-over-hand to where Gusemy and Enely stood ready. The four bearers stepped back, careful to keep their burden level, to give Jonton and Ferry room to climb down and take up their end of the bower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey marched across the field in lockstep, all heads turning to follow them as they made their way through the centre of the rows of villagers and set down the bower by the graveside. Jonton knelt by Gerselle\u2019s side for the last time, picked up her burial mask from its Kerm wood stand and gently placed it over her face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix black ropes were tied onto the bower frame, the bearers taking the strain and then lowering it into the ground, the eyes of the mourners upon them all the while. The village Keeper bowed to Jonton from behind the podium. He counted the spades set out in a row beside him and cleared his throat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals. We are gathered here today to celebrate the life and mourn the passing of Gerselle Kermol. She was kerbal, and as she came forth from her Grove, so in the presence of us all, does she return\u2026\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton let the words flow over him, soothing in their rhythm and intent. As they came to an end, he picked up his spade and waited for the remaining four bearers to join him. Head down, he scooped up a load of earth and sprinkled it over Gerselle\u2019s mask, before the others joined him with their own spadesful of soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe eulogies seemed interminable, the line of mourners from both his and Gerselle\u2019s villages moving slowly forward to be introduced to the crowd and handed the microphone. Jonton was surprised, and touched, by the messages from President Obrick and Chief Ambassador Donman. Then, all too soon, the last villager stepped down from the podium and the Keeper was beckoning him forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood kerbals.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thank you all for your kind words today. My name is Jonton Kermol and Gerselle was my beloved and irreplaceable wife. She leaves me an equally beloved - and just as irreplaceable \u2013 daughter, Joenie Kermol.\u201D Jonton looked up to see Joenie staring back at him, clutching Meleny\u2019s hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI cannot possibly hope to say anything that hasn\u2019t already been said about Gerselle today but I would ask you to remember that in a very real way, she leaves us all with so many more sons and daughters. The Kerm awakening across three, maybe four now, Regionalities,\u201D Jonton\u2019s shoulders lifted. \u201CThey too are her children \u2013 and her legacy.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3766061\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 111\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cu style=\u0022color:rgb(53,60,65);font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:underline;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0b0114\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-115-now-and-forever/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3776743\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 113\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);float:none;font-family:Roboto;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-decoration:none;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-26T06:15:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2022 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tetragramm","CreatedById":203793,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-05T05:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll caught up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent work.

The reality of course was rather different. A rusty launch tower constructed from old scaffolding. A bunker full of worn out monitors and other abandoned electronic gear. And a last ditch attempt at a rocket that they had built from whatever junk they could scavenge up and weld together. Wernher\u0027s original LV-1 engine had proven far far more difficult to scale up than any of them had imagined.

Four RT-5 solid fuel boosters attached to the sides by explosive bolts and a simple capsule secured to the top with more explosive bolts completed this most unlikely looking spacecraft.

When you have a conversation - i.e. a block of text which is mostly quotations and represents two character speaking back and forth - generally each new paragraph represents a switch to the other character as the active character, i.e. the one talking or doing the actions, but here both successive paragraphs are about Jeb.

You\u2019ve been a mother to her for so long now.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd maybe when she\u2019s ready, I can be again.\u201D Meleny gave him a half-smile. \u201CShe\u2019s getting to the age where she\u2019ll have things to talk about and she probably won\u2019t want to talk about them with her dad. But right now, I\u2019m not her mother, and she knows it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll want to stay with me.\u201D She raised a hand as Jonton opened his mouth to speak. \u201CAnd that is quite proper and I\u2019m not remotely offended.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton scrubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands, before looking up at her and Thombal in mute gratitude. \u201CI don\u2019t know how we would have got through all of this without you both. Through all of this.\u201D He leaned back in his sack chair, closing his eyes for a moment. \u201CI\u2019ll talk it over with Joenie tomorrow. If she wants to go, I\u2019ll let Elton know what we\u2019re doing and ask him to tell Jonelle.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou might ask Joenie first in case she wants to tell Jonelle,\u201D said Thombal. \u201CFrom what you were saying about your last Communion with her, I think\u00A0 would probably understand why Joenie needs to leave her Grove for a little while.\u201D He stood up. \u201CAnd now that all the hard talking\u2019s done, I think we\u2019ve earned a prickleberry cider between us. Can I get you anything, love?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeleny shook her head. \u201CI\u2019ll be heading to bed soon. Forestry teaching group tomorrow.\u201D She rolled her eyes. \u201CWe\u2019re at the \u2018pollination of economically valuable trees\u2019 stage, so I\u2019ll be spending all day rigging safety harnesses and getting covered in climbing gum.\u201D She saw the momentary shadow behind Jonton\u2019s eyes and decided not to comment. \u201CBoth of which need a good night\u2019s sleep behind me if I\u2019m not going to end up strangling one of my little teenage darlings before the day is done.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThombal popped the top off a bottle of cider and poured it into two glasses. \u201CNo sapwood tomorrow night then?\u201D Meleny gave him a look, as he handed Jonton his drink before settling onto his sack chair. \u201CCheers.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCheers.\u201D Jonton took a sip of cider and sighed. \u201CThanks, Tom.

He wore a dusty, road-worn poncho, the shirt sleeves beneath printed in a pattern that even the clerk, long past the age of caring about such things, recognised as old-fashioned. The stranger turned to one side and fumbled with a money belt under his poncho, before walking up to the desk and setting down his pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne to Barkton, please.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was something in his accent that the clerk couldn\u2019t quite place. \u00A0\u201CCertainly, sir. Single or return?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stranger appeared to give this some thought. \u201CA single,\u201D he said at last. \u201CI do not know if I\u2019ll be coming back.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAhh\u003C/em\u003E. The clerk smiled at him. \u201CGoing to volunteer for the One-Twenty? You\u2019re not the first kermol we\u2019ve had passing through.\u201D He bent over the ticket machine, missing the momentary look of confusion on the other\u2019s face. \u201CThat\u2019ll be one kero eighty and twenty-five funds please.\u201D He watched the stranger scrabbling around in his coin pouch before finally putting down the right amount. \u201CThank you, sir. You\u2019ve got three changes, four if you stop over at Cabaralb.\u201D He slid a printout across the counter with the ticket. \u201CI\u2019ve printed out a reminder of them for you here. You\u2019ve missed the morning train I\u2019m afraid but at least you\u2019ll have plenty of time for lunch - the next one doesn\u2019t leave for just over two hours. Platform three.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stranger studied the printout before carefully folding it up and tucking it into his poncho along with his ticket. \u201CThank you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMy pleasure, sir.

Somewhat to Jonton\u2019s surprise and pride, she also chose to tell Jonelle about the trip herself. When he asked Elton about it later, the elder Kerm merely reported that neither his, nor his Keeper\u2019s daughter had spoken to him, but that he had sensed acceptance instead of distress from Jonelle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo sooner had he and Joenie packed, than they were being bundled into Ferry\u2019s car and driven over to Barkton. At the station, Meleny pressed a sheet of handwritten notes into his hands and hugged him and Joenie goodbye. Ferry leaned out of the car window to add his own goodbyes, before they were shooed on their way by Meleny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs they walked in through the grand archway to Barkton Central Station, Jonton was struck by the quiet. The hubbub of soldiers that he remembered from his and Joenie\u2019s first trip to the Capital had gone, replaced by the occasional group of civilian passengers, most of them soberly dressed or carrying attache cases. Some things though, he reflected, watching the station manager hurry over to them, did not change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKeeper Jonton! It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201D He handed Jonton an envelope. \u201CAnd also yourself, young lady.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie blinked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTickets to the Capital, I believe; one adult, one concession. One shared and one private compartment booked on both trains. The lady on the phone didn\u2019t say but we assumed you\u2019d prefer to take adjacent ones. Now, if you\u2019d just like to follow me through security, we can get you to the platform in time for the evening train.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey followed the manager across the concourse and into a sectioned off area where their bags were checked. The searches were still reassuringly thorough and Jonton had to stifle a grin at the expression on one inspector\u2019s face after Joenie\u2019s approving little nod. Another inspector fastened a tag marked with a white cross onto each of their bags and waved them through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station manager escorted them on to the platform. \u201CYour cabins are in the second carriage from the front. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to show you onto the train but I think you\u2019ll find everything just the way it was for your last journey.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine,\u201D Jonton replied. \u201CThank you for arranging everything at such short notice.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, it\u2019s my pleasure, Keeper, my pleasure. Have a peaceful journey and enjoy your stay in the Capital when you get there.\u201D He tipped his hat to Joenie and hurried off across the concourse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie watched him go. \u201CI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s in such a hurry. There aren\u2019t that many people here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton gave her a wry look. \u201CNot really, no. Maybe he\u2019s expecting more to arrive later.\u201D He inspected his luggage tag and nodded to himself. Joenie looked at her tag curiously. \u201CWhy the white crosses, Dad?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAfter the White Cross Company, I would imagine.\u201D He saw his daughter\u2019s blank look. \u201CThey were a group of volunteers during the war. According to Patbro, they used to help with the Kerm seed inspections to speed up food and medical supply shipments, although he did hear rumours that they helped the space program too.\u201D Jonton fingered his tag. \u201CI guess they\u2019re either still going, or people just got used to putting a white cross on anything that\u2019s been checked for Kerm seeds.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u2019s reply was drowned out by a train arriving at the platform behind them, accompanied by a raucous announcement from the overhead speakers. She scowled, clamping her hands over her ears, and even Jonton winced at one particularly loud squeal of feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaybe that\u2019s why he was in a hurry \u2013 he had to go fix the speakers.\u201D Joenie removed her hands from her ears, staring balefully at the offending equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CProbably,\u201D her father said. He glanced at the station clock. \u201CTwenty minutes till our train arrives. Do you want a book while we\u2019re waiting?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs promised, their compartment was very much as Jonton remembered, right down to the cupboard under the table and the water heater set into the wall. He busied himself stowing their luggage whilst Joenie went off to explore her private cabin. By the time she returned, two cups of steaming djeng sat on the little table and her father was sitting by the window, watching something with great interest, as their train pulled out of the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat\u2019s happening, Dad?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA rocket I think \u2013 or a part of one. Over there, hanging from that crane by all the floodlights. I guess they must be sending it to the other launch site on the east coast.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie peered out of the window. \u201CIt\u2019s got no engines,\u201D she said doubtfully. \u201CI don\u2019t think it can be a rocket. Gildas would know.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019m sure he would,\u201D Jonton agreed. \u201CMaybe it was part of that space station that Wernher and Jebediah showed us. It was pretty big whatever it was.\u201D He blew on his djeng before taking a sip. \u201CHmm, that\u2019s good. I made you one too.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks.\u201D Joenie perched herself on the bed opposite him. \u201CCould I have this compartment, Dad? The one next door doesn\u2019t have a moss room.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COf course you can. Now - how about a game of Triangles before bed?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTriangles?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton produced a worn cardboard box. \u201CI haven\u2019t played since I was a student and to be honest, I\u2019m not even sure if anyone makes it anymore.\u201D He slid the box open and removed a scuffed game board and a bag. \u201CIt\u2019s a travel set \u2013 works pretty well. He drew a triangular wooden piece from the bag and placed it on the board. \u201CYou put your first piece here, where it\u2019s marked and every new piece you put down has to touch an existing one along one edge. The idea is to match the colours along the edge if you can and you get bonus points for making different patterns. Here.\u201D Jonton took a yellowing piece of paper out of the box and unfolded it. \u201CChains are pretty easy but rings and linked rings are harder. I don\u2019t think I ever managed to get linked rings in the same colour!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie saw the hopeful look on her father\u2019s face and didn\u2019t have the heart to turn him down. \u201CSure, sounds good.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CExcellent!\u201D Jonton rubbed his hands together. \u201CNew players go first.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie drew a piece from the bag and placed it on her starter zone. She drew a second tile, studied it for a second then placed it next to the first. \u201CBlue matches blue.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood start,\u201D Jonton drew his own piece. \u201CAnd blue matches blue again.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the first few moves, Joenie began to take more of an interest in the patterns unfolding across the board and by the time her chains began to cross over onto her father\u2019s half of the board, she was engrossed, her mug of djeng long since gone cold. After narrowly winning a second game and losing a third, her offer to make it a best three out of five was interrupted by a prodigious yawn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton glanced at his watch. \u201CI think\u2026\u201D his eyes widened as he too yawned hugely. \u201CI think it\u2019s later than I thought.\u201D He drew the curtains of their little compartment before standing up to retrieve his overnight bag from the luggage rack. \u201CYou\u2019re definitely on for tomorrow though!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat was fun \u2013 thanks, Dad.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGlad you enjoyed it. Good night, sleep tight.\u201D The compartment door slid shut behind Jonton. Smiling slightly, Joenie unpacked her washbag and started to get ready for bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next morning, the fifth game of the set was interrupted by the train driver\u2019s announcement that they would shortly be arriving at Cabaralb station. Jonton declared the set to be a draw, raising an eyebrow at his daughter\u2019s unspoken demurral. Joenie gave him a half-smile and began packing away the board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheir stopover in Cabaralb was much more cheerful than their previous visit. Jonton was relieved to find the station empty of any military presence and was pleased to see more fishing vessels than warships in the harbour. For her part, Joenie bounced along the far busier streets and had to be pulled away from two or three of the shops, much to her father\u2019s secret amusement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth of them agreed though, that the best part of the day was visiting the transformed town park. The flowerbeds and gardens were in full bloom amidst the freshly gravelled paths and the central meadow was newly mown and dotted with groups of kerbals enjoying the sunshine. The patch of raw earth that Jonton remembered had been weeded, fenced off and planted with a new Kerm sapling. The other thirty-six saplings were dotted around the park and a faint whiff of cinnamon filled the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey stayed at the Grove Hotel again that night where, much to Joenie\u2019s surprised delight, their waitress recognised them from their previous visit and brought her a minted redfruit juice with ice without having to be asked. The food was just as good as she remembered, especially the greenleaf fondue which turned out to be a plate of crispy greenleaf stems served with a herb jelly and a pot of cheese dipping sauce which arrived at the table on its own little nightlight heated stove.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe train journey to the Capital passed by in a pleasant blur of reading, Triangles, and watching the world go by from the carriage window. What roads they saw were busy with traffic: trucks hauling all manner of supplies and construction materials, White Cross cars, and the occasional private car. As the train followed the coastline south towards the capital, Joenie spotted a single contrail streaking the sky over the Great Tranquil Sea, a glinting speck just visible at its tip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy tacit agreement, what conversation there was steered carefully clear of anything that would remind them of Gerselle and if either became distracted mid-game, or lost in their own thoughts, the other would find something else to do for a while. \u00A0Even so, towards the end of the journey, Joenie disappeared into the moss room, returning sometime later with a freshly scrubbed face and red-rimmed eyes. She shook her head as Jonton started towards her, giving him a grateful look as he pulled a spare handkerchief out of his pocket and passed it over to her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie\u2019s subdued mood lasted through their arrival at the Capital and walk to the Grand Gardens. Jonton eyed the tik-tik lot as they left the station and briefly considered hiring one of the pedal-powered buggies but decided that Joenie probably wouldn\u2019t be interested. They crossed the Boulevard and turned onto City Avenue, stopping every so often for Jonton to consult his map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the far end of the Avenue, the arches and domes of the Capital Building stood out against the skyline, it\u2019s flagpole still visible over the rooftops as they turned right onto Progress Walk and towards the Gardens. A quiet descended as they passed through the wrought-iron gates, the trees around them screening out the bustling streets outside. Joenie looked up at a songbird perched on a nearby branch and her mood seemed to lift a little.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sapwood coffee and a cake from a nearby concession stand lifted it a little further and by the time they reached the glasshouses near the centre of the enormous park, Joenie\u2019s head was turning from side to side as she took everything in. Jonton caught a glimpse of immense shapes through the panels of one glasshouse and tapped his daughter on the shoulder. \u201CShall we start in there?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPuzzled, Joenie followed his finger, then her face cleared. \u201CYou remembered?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton grinned at her. \u201CI wasn\u2019t going to forget after our last visit. Come on.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe centre of the desert hothouse had been fenced off and planted with a group of kerbahusk cactuses. Joenie stared up at them in delight, remembering the papier-m\u00E2ch\u00E9 version she\u2019d made with Enely, although she had to admit that the real-life spines looked rather more impressive than pieces of drinking straw glued to a model. She read the nearby sign warning visitors not to climb over the fence and touch them and nodded to herself, Enely\u2019s voice clear in the back of her head. \u003Cem\u003EStroke the spines one way and they\u2019re not dangerous but stroke them the other way, away from the bulb, and they\u2019ll cut your fingers to ribbons. They make good knives but you have to be careful. \u00A0\u003C/em\u003ESmiling at the memory, she moved on to a sandy area dotted with large boulders which were draped with fleshy green ribbons. Patches of twisted, knotty tubes, improbably decorated with tiny crimson flowers, sprawled across the sand between the boulders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton caught up with her by another sandy patch, this one planted with rows of what looked like brown clay balls. He saw Joenie\u2019s puzzled expression and walked over to her. \u201CWhat\u2019s up?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI thought these ones were malkaballs but the name on the sign is totally different.\u201D Joenie heard a choking noise behind her and turned to find one of the hothouse gardeners behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey\u2019re malkaballs all right but it\u2019s been a long time since I heard anyone else call them that.\u201D He studied Joenie through deep brown eyes. \u201CYou don\u2019t look Hazachim if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoenie blinked in surprise. \u201CI\u2019m not, but one of my friends is and he taught me about them.\u201D She scrunched up her face in thought. \u201CHe always said they tasted very\u2026 sathy, even if they don\u2019t look very nice.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gardener\u2019s face broke out in a broad grin. \u201CSathy they are. What was your friend\u2019s name?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEnely.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, now, now. I knew a young Enely once.

The Glass Caf\u00E9 was quiet, with most of the waiting staff spending more time cleaning tables or serving drinks than bringing out food. He glanced at the clock on the wall, braced himself inwardly, and turned back to Joenie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve been thinking.

All change.

As he stepped onto the platform, he stared around at the cavernous railway station, hiding his private dismay behind an impassive stare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI would suffer far more in Her service.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShouldering his pack, he set off towards the main concourse, striding past his fellow passengers, only to join another line of travellers at the turnstiles. He turned his pack to show its white-crossed tag to the nearest guard, who merely nodded and waved him through. Walking by a line of tables where a handful of kerbals were having their bags searched and past a row of shops, he emerged into a huge vaulted atrium, a line of constantly shifting departure boards at its far end. He wrinkled his nose in distaste at the overly-grandiose archways leading outside. Then he caught sight of two figures walking into the station and his jaw dropped open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEven from afar, her Will prevails.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe hurried across the atrium before the two figures could disappear into the crowd, following the wake of gawkers and excited onlookers pointing them out to each other. Skirting round another group of shops, he slowed to a walk, holding his pack up again as he passed another turnstile and onto platform fourteen where, according to the signboard, the train to Olbinat would shortly be departing. Waiting for the two figures to board the train, he got on the same carriage by the opposite door and found a nearby seat from which he could eavesdrop on them. Then he settled down to wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Corruptor and his daughter spent most of the journey reading or exchanging trivialities over what appeared to be a pointless and tedious game. Eventually though, the kerblet started complaining of hunger and asking when they would get to the Berelgan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhich can only be the Berelgan Institute. Good\u003C/em\u003E. He leaned back in his seat, closed his eyes and tried to block out the irritating chit-chat from across the aisle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a start, he awoke to find the train juddering to a stop amidst a raucous announcement that it was now arriving at Olbinat. The Corruptor and his daughter were both overburdened with luggage, giving him time to retrieve his own pack and follow them off the train at a discreet distance. Trailing them across the station and outside into the pleasantly shady car park, he watched them greet\u00A0 another kerbal before being ushered into an off-roader and driven away, leaving him standing, momentarily witless, outside the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA Kerm-olia is not so easily defeated - not after She has delivered them into my hands.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCinching up his pack as he went, he set off in pursuit. The road out of town was easy to find and a little way past the final cluster of houses, a signpost declared the Berelgan Institute to be thirty-two kilometres away. He glanced up at the afternoon sun and slowed his all-out march to the easy, kilometre eating pace which, he knew, he could sustain for most of a day if necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time he reached the turreted brick archway marking the entrance to the Berelgan grounds, twilight had long since turned to night. Light spilling from a window illuminated a heavy looking and conspicuously locked gate. He stood motionless by the verge, well back from the pools of radiance thrown by the roadside lamps and waited for any signs of activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis patience was rewarded when a patrol of guards marched past and stopped by the gate. After a brief conversation, they disappeared inside the gatehouse, leaving its previous occupants to begin their own patrol. Noiselessly, he drifted into the surrounding trees, freezing as torchlight played over the ground nearby. He waited for a long moment, using the time to check his pack for loose buckles or straps, before pulling his poncho cowl further over his face and slipping deeper into the woods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrossing the open pastureland between the woods and the brightly lit buildings in the distance became a test of nerves. Shadowed mounds lurked in the fields near the road, the smells of dung and warm fur giving them away as some kind of animal. He crept past them as quickly as he dared, praying to Her will that the creatures would not spook at his scent and give him away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReaching the top of the driveway, he skirted round an expansive gravelled space; a row of boxy off-roaders parked along the side nearest to the grand buildings behind. Nodding in satisfaction, he stared at their ornate fa\u00E7ade, fixing the position of the front doors and the steps leading up to them in his mind, before slipping away between the smaller outbuildings which surrounded the car park. Slinking from shadow to shadow, he searched for a concealed spot from which to watch the main entrance and the vehicles parked outside; eventually settling for a nook between a drainpipe and the moss-covered entrance to what had once been a wood cellar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSatisfied with his hiding place, he prowled the Berelgan grounds, scouting out what escape routes he could, until the first fingers of dawn began to show on the horizon. Then, murmuring a prayer to Her will under his breath, he returned to his nook and settled in to wait for sunrise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton stood at the top of the manor house steps, gazing out over the Berelgan grounds and savouring the early morning smells of greenery and dew. He yawned, watching Joenie and Mallas walking across the car park, the fresh air doing more to wake him than his morning coffee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a crunching of scattered gravel, a figure burst into view, racing towards Joenie, something glinting in its hand.\u00A0 Jonton heard a muffled scream and sudden oath from Mallas, then Joenie was being dragged away, heels scraping along the ground, the stranger\u2019s arm around her neck.\u00A0 Heart hammering in his chest, Jonton hurled himself down the steps, only to see Mallas scramble into one of the off-roaders and Joenie bundled into the back at knifepoint. The hooded figure swung himself up into the passenger seat, the door slammed shut and Jonton had to shield his face against a spray of stones. By the time he looked up, the off-roader was already careering down the driveway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sprinted for the nearest vehicle and wrenched at its door, an icy band of fear clenching around his guts. Finally realising that the door was locked, he swore and ran for the manor house.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe off-roader jolted over a speedbump, Mallas\u2019s jaw clenching as the stranger\u2019s knife pricked his skin. \u00A0\u201CDoes this place have a Kerm?\u201D The knife dug little deeper. \u201CQuickly. Does it?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe felt a trickle of blood running down his side. \u201CYes!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThen you will take me there. Quickly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas nodded tightly, gunning the off-roader over a rise before glancing in his passenger mirror and seeing Joenie\u2019s terrified face staring back at him. Eyes to the front again, he saw the track to Obrinn\u2019s planting site coming up and eased off the accelerator, not daring to brake. He swerved sharply left, missing the drainage ditch by centimetres and put his foot down, the off-roader\u2019s rear wheels throwing up a rooster-tail of mud. Racing up the track to the copse of Kerm trees, he pulled up outside Erlin\u2019s hut with a wrenching jerk that bounced his head off his headrest. The stranger leapt out, flung the rear door open and dragged Joenie off the back seat before marching her up to the hut and disappearing inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKicking the front door closed behind them, he pulled Joenie into the sleep room and flung her onto the nearest bed before shoving her head into a leaf cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObrinn sensed the kerbal under his leaves, brightening as he recognised her as Joenie. Then the leaf connection solidified and a torrent of fright and incomprehensible images battered at the young Kerm\u2019s mind instead of the friendly presence he was expecting. His response was swift and instinctive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMallas heard a scream as he pelted into the sleep room and into a tableau of frozen Kerm vines, their needle teeth splayed behind motionless inner tendrils. He saw Joenie lying on the bed, her abductor leaning over her, one hand holding a knife to her throat, the other\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOh Kerm.

Twisting round, she grabbed at the skein, sobbing in fear as it slithered out of her grasp. She felt herself falling, tumbling, the mindscape an insubstantial blur as it rushed up to meet her. Then all turned to whiteness. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA distant part of\u2026 someone\u2026 erupted down the failing link and stormed past her, hunting for anyone \u2013 or anything \u2013 to save it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd from out of the whiteness, a single overwhelming command screamed out to the Kerm telegraph. Overloaded, Obrinn\u2019s interface unit had time to transmit one incoherent blast of noise before its sensors shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n-------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElton\u2019s branches smashed through the roof in a cascade of shingles and broken battens.

Even before the last of them were awakened, the Telegraph operators were run off their feet keeping the interface units replenished, so we know they were doing a lot of talking about something, even before the blackout.\u201D He cocked an eyebrow at Bob. \u201CKerm don\u2019t go in for small-talk as a rule, so they were probably talking business and if I know Guardian Elton, his idea of business is Starseed.

They pulled up outside the Payload Integration Facility and Bob was unsurprised to see a knot of kerbals already gathered outside the doors, waiting to greet them. As they crossed the reception area, he watched Jeb working the room; offering a quick word here, a smile or a handshake there, and was reminded of a long-ago trip to KSA\u2019s Alpha Site. \u003Cem\u003EWhich worked out pretty well,\u003C/em\u003E he added to himself. Seeing that the crowd showed no sign of dispersing, he caught Jeb\u2019s eye, tapping his watch meaningfully.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EJeb nodded and raised his arms for silence. \u201CThank you all for the welcome, folks \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u201CThat\u2019s a first!\u201D somebody called out, to general laughter.

A fully assembled bridge module rested on its dollies, nestled within the test bay scaffolding and already attached to its forward hub module. Skeins of cables emerged from the airlocks at either end of the spacecraft and from various access points on its hull, snaking across the floor and into the back of a line of test consoles. Groups of engineers clambered over the scaffolding, running tests on the module exterior systems and occasionally one engineer would leave his or her place behind the consoles and climb inside the larger of the two airlocks, clipboard in hand.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBill watched a grin of pure delight slowly spreading over Jeb\u2019s face as he studied the colony ship bridge, circling around the scaffold to get a better look at the hub module.

Afternoon all.\u201D A glint of reflected light caught his eye and he glanced up. Then, to the bewilderment of the younger engineers, he stepped back from the consoles and took a longer look up, eyes resting briefly on the open petals of the docking port cover, before watching the test crew at work through the bridge windows.

Aft of the shelters, a lattice of open girders secured the far ends of the habitation and cargo modules to the spine.
