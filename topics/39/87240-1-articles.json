Why? It could provide fuel, a safe haven for Kerbals, or even serve as a pit-stop. In the video below, I will show you one of the few techniques that you can use to dock with a space-station that is currently in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more directed towards people that struggle to rendezvous with orbiting crafts (while landed) and for those who struggle to dock too. It\u0027s not a full in-depth guide, just to give you the gist of what to do.
