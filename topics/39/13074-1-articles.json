That place your parents told you to avoid. That nation that barely anybody liked. Theoretically economically unstable, yet always rich. So disliked, yet always pleased. So shunned, yet always noticed. You may think this is just a bunch of propaganda at the moment, in which case you can leave. But, if you want to know some of the darker secrets of Nexvulch, and find out what is really hidden underneath their plain skin, please read on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan was just going to work, as usual, in the nation of Angleland. It was nearly the start of his shift in the GS inc. factory, producing the wings for the scout planes. He ran as fast as his little green legs could carry him. His hair blown back in the wind as he ran. There he could see it. Right in front of him. The factory. If he didn\\\u0027t get there on time, Mr. Gelleo would fire him for sure. It was just at that moment, that perfectly timed moment, that his toupee fell off. It was a particularly windy day in Angleland and the ball of hair got blown straight into a dark alleyway. Well, Stan couldn\\\u0027t turn up at work without his hair. he would be the laughing stock of one of the biggest companies in Angleland! He had to get his hair. He dropped his briefcase and darted for the alleyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smell of rotting flesh crawled up his nose and filled his head. Tiny insects crawled around him. One got on to his lab coat, which he quickly disposed of with a shriek. Strange green slime clung to the walls, glowing, producing enough light to dimly illuminate the pitch black alleyway. It was then that it hit him: a lob of sticky, viscous, musky liquid. It hit the bald dome that was his head, coating his flesh in a layer of slime. Stan moaned as he wiped the liquid from himself with his hands. Then he heard the growling. Low and deep. Then he remembered the saying \\\u0027low and deep, away you keep. Anything other, don\\\u0027t bother\\\u0027. Then he tensed up. The most feared creature ever, that\\\u0027s what the saying referred to. He slowly turned around, and found himself face to face with an armored dog, it\\\u0027s shell a dark grey, six legs on the floor, the other two held up, claws out. It\\\u0027s hot red eyes glared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027CLEAVLE!!!\u0027 he screamed, darting away as the monster pounced at where he was standing. He ran faster than he ever had in his life, the monster pouncing after him. He knew that cleavles could go faster than him, but this one wanted to play a game. Let him run, then strike him down and tear him to shreds. The cleavle swiped and scratched his back. Stan let out a high pitched yelp as the cleavle licked the blood off of it\\\u0027s claw, smiled, and appeared to laugh menacingly. Then it set out, in pursuit of it\\\u0027s toy once again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan turned a corner and found something very peculiar indeed. A kerbal was standing there. He was wearing an entirely black suit with a white shirt underneath. Despite the darkness of the alleyway, he was wearing sunglasses. The cleavle came around the corner and saw Stan. It smiled before it saw the kerbal in black. It\\\u0027s face dropped, then it lay down whimpering in fear. The man walked towards it and it covered it\\\u0027s eyes with its paws. The creature was shaking faster than a Taherian massage machine, it even appeared to be crying in fear of this kerbal. The kerbal patted it\\\u0027s head and it went silent. He continued stroking it for five minutes, until it had calmed down, before he turned to Stan, who had been watching in amazement this whole time. Stan froze in fear just like the cleavle. This kerbal could cause the most ferocious beast on the planet to cower in fear, what could he do to a small, unprotected, bald kerbal? The kerbal smirked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, he merely said \u0027Derrku Stan.

You can\\\u0027t take me anywhere. I\\\u0027m going to be late for work! Who are you anyway?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kerbal smirked, \u0027My name is Kachzen. I work for sector 22 of the government. You have been requested for a meeting due to your knowledge on the Gelleo Bomb project.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How do you know about the Gelleo Bomb?\u0027 Stan asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I don\\\u0027t think I should tell you just yet.\u0027 Kachzen replied, \u0027It would only make you more terrified. Your boss has been notified of your absence. You have a meeting at the opposite pole of the planet with some of the worlds most powerful people.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You mean Ascensiam?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Him and others even more powerful. Now, get on the cleavle.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What? No! I\\\u0027m not getting on that foreign death trap of a science experiment! Those Nexvulchian freaks are \u003Cem\u003Esick\u003C/em\u003E in the head if they created this monster!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The Nexvulchians didn\\\u0027t make them. That\\\u0027s just a tale spread by the SPQK as a scapegoat. Cleavles are wild animals, and affectionate ones too, if you treat them with respect. Nexvulch has no control over them and cannot be held responsible for the ignorance of others!\u0027 Kachzen screamed. He was obviously angry at something \u0027The SPQK came to Nexvulch, trying to seize control of the land. The cleavles caught the scent of their weapons and, in an attempt to protect themselves, decided to retaliate! The cleavles actually have a rather primitive economic system of payment in meat for territory. They are also very good at plotting. They planned to board SPQK helicopters and hitch a ride to the SPQK HQ, where they could avenge their land by retaliating against the leader. Instead, the SPQK army stopped in Charlestonia. The cleavles believed that they were in the SPQK HQ and attacked everything in sight. Cleavles even have a basic language of thirty words. Along with hand gestures, this is enough for them to converse with each other and even kerbals who can listen to what they say. Now, get on the cleavle!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan did as he was told, terrified of this Kachzen guy. The GCK only had 21 government sectors. What could sector 22 be? Did it even exist? He eventually decided to get on the cleavle. Kachzen got on in front of him. They both put their feet in the stirrups on the cleavle\\\u0027s sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Gien,\u0027 Kachzen told the cleavle, pointing at it, then towards the nation of Nexvulch. \u0027Schtuzen,\u0027 He said again, covering his eyes and pointing to the streets. It took a while for Stan to figure out what this meant: \\\u0027Go to Nexvulch and don\\\u0027t let anyone see you\\\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh, by the way Stan. I think this belongs to you,\u0027 Kachzen said, holding up a slimy ball of hair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan snatched his wig back, an embarrassed grin on his face. The cleavle jumped onto the roof of the nearest building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hold on tight, It\\\u0027s gonna be a fast ride!\u0027 Kachzen said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, the cleavle was already running. Stan watched in awe as it pounced from one roof to another, never missing it\\\u0027s target, never losing it\\\u0027s footing. People always said that cleavles traveled impossibly fast. Stan never thought they could go at speeds of up to 400 miles per hour. In just 15 minutes, Stan and Kachzen were already coming to a stop. Above them hung a large metal sign with illegible words in a strange, runic alphabet written upon it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKachzen translated: \u0027Welcome to the nation of Nexvulch...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027comic sans ms\u0027;\u0022\u003ETO BE CONTINUED\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kachzen tied the cleavle\\\u0027s harness to a nearby post. He spoke to it in cleavanian and it lay down, closed its eyes and camouflaged with the tarmac of the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Nobody ever visits Nexvulch anymore,\u0027 Kachzen said \u0027So this road is useless. People just leave cleavles here while they\\\u0027re elsewhere. Anyway, the cleavle won\\\u0027t be able to survive where we\\\u0027re going.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKachzen took Stan to a telephone box. It must have been a local telephone system because the numbers were also in Nexvulchian. Kachzen dialled while speaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027ellix, sambi, lo, lo, yelo, sambi,ellix, sambi, lo.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, the phone box became dark. A bright light then turned on. Stan could feel his stomach turning. They were descending. That\\\u0027s the only place cleavles can\\\u0027t go. Underground. After around 10 minutes, Stan got worried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How deep does this elevator go?\u0027 he asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It goes about halfway through the mantle of Kerbin. That\\\u0027s where all of Kerbin\\\u0027s decisions are made.\u0027 Kachzen replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh! I didn\\\u0027t even know that was possible. I thought that would be godmodding.\u0027 Stan exclaimed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Godmodding? That\\\u0027s just a myth Stan. Anything is possible. Anyway, it\\\u0027s the rule of godmodding that is the cause of our situation.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, I guess you\\\u0027re right,\u0027 Stan said guiltily \u0027Anyway, Kachzen, I want to say sorry for what I said about Nexvulch. I didn\\\u0027t know that they were just trying to help. I\\\u0027m sorry I offended you and I\\\u0027m sorry I offended the cleavles.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKachzen ignored him for a while, then replied: \u0027Sorry to the cleavles? There are no cleavles any more, no more than 20 anyway. You people destroyed their life, their hope, all of the things that meant something to them. Innocent cleavle children died that day. You kerbals would never understand, too ignorant and industrial. You couldn\\\u0027t accept the world as it is without blowing each other\\\u0027s faces off even if you tried. They\\\u0027re all monsters...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan could see a tear emerging from behind Kachzen\\\u0027s sunglasses, which was quickly wiped away by it\\\u0027s creator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Now, because of your ignorance, and the actions of world leaders, Nexvulch may bring Kerbin to an end.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How could Nexvulch do anything? They\\\u0027re powerless to the almighty Kortugan pirates!\u0027 Stan asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the elevator doors opened, Kachzen merely said \u0027Oh Stan, why on kerbin do you think I\\\u0027m talking about the \u003Cem\u003Enation\u003C/em\u003E of Nexvulch?...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027comic sans ms\u0027;\u0022\u003ETO BE CONTINUED\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan saw before him a large room. Everything was silver and symbols were painted above multiple screens. There must have been at least one thousand. The screen bearing an eye within an inverted triangle had been smashed long ago. Other symbols included a blue square with a strange planet on it, labeled \u0027Earth\u0027, another one with a tree on it was labeled \u0027Sirius\u0027, the next with a beam of Rainbow light was marked with the word \u0027Andromeda Galaxy general\u0027. There were different names on each one: Olympus, Yaru, Quetzalcoatl. Finally, Stan came to a screen that was marked with a familiar sign. It was the biggest there and was labeled \u0027Nexvulch\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Stan,\u0027 Kachzen called \u0027sit down already!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan hadn\\\u0027t noticed that there was a large table in the middle of the room, around which were seated some people. It was only when he sat down that Stan realized who they were. One was sat with a straight face, staring directly forward, instead of being locked in conversation like the others. His name tag was labeled \u0027Radion\u0027. The kerbal sitting next to him seemed rather shaky and nervous. his hair was messed up and his name tag was written in ancient runes. Stan could guess that they spelled \u0027Ascensiam\u0027. The kerbal to the far right of the table was in a rather disgusting state. His clothes were torn and his right leg was replaced by a large piece of wood. He was holding a large mug and appeared to be drunk. He looked like a pirate: \u0027Capt\\\u0027n Skunky\u0027. Between these two was a relatively tall kerbal who was trying to make conversation merrily, yet had nervous sweat running down his forehead. He wore the International Kerbin Flag. It was none other than the head moderator himself, \u0027Damion Rayne\u0027. Stan squirmed in his seat uncomfortably, between Kachzen and Radion, for five more minuites, before a secret door opened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone in the room fell silent. A kerbal, wearing a strange, metallic jumpsuit stepped in. His face was strict and he had an aura of importance about him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You complete... utter... one hundred percent... MORONS!!!\u0027 The kerbal screamed as he marched in and took the biggest seat. \u0027What were you thinking? How dare you?! Innocent people will DIE in the masses because of you IDIOTS!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes Mr. HarvesteR, we\\\u0027re sorry Mr. HarvesteR\u0027 everyone apart from Stan and Kachzen replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\\\u0027s who this man was. HarvesteR: creator of the Kerbal Space Program. Most powerful person on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I bet some of you selfish, insignificant, ignorant blobs don\\\u0027t even know why I\\\u0027m mad. Do you?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We all know why you are mad sir. Allowing disruption in Nexvulchian liberation sir!\u0027 Radion exclaimed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes. It\\\u0027s nice to see that some of you pathetic slobs are listening. Now, why did you let it happen. Nexvulch are probably going to disapprove!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Excuse me sir,\u0027 Stan queried \u0027How are Nexvulch threatening in any way?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Nexvulch? You don\\\u0027t know what we\\\u0027re talking about, do you?\u0027 HarvesteR sneered \u0027We are talking about the planet of Nexvulch. It\\\u0027s a distant place, but they are powerful. Do you know who their president is, insignificant? Their president, the great Thorn Kuh Thornp, is God!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan\\\u0027s face went pale, \u0027You mean-\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027These \u003Cem\u003Egeniuses\u003C/em\u003E enraged GOD!!!\u0027 HarvesteR screeched, slamming the table. \u0027Nothing but a load of...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarvesteR cursed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027H-h-harvesteR,\u0027 Damion stuttered, now not so merry, \u0027Y-y-you c-can\\\u0027t swear on t-t-t-this forum.

It was Damion\\\u0027s BAN hammer. Damion swung at HarvesteR. It looked like it was all over until HarvesteR actually caught the hammer with one hand. He clenched his fist and the Hammer shattered. Damion\\\u0027s face dropped. He fell back in his chair, the broken remains of what gave him power now lying in his hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027You dare to swing the Ban Hammer at your superior. Do you know who made Space Travel possible for Kerbin? Who made all of your little politics possible? I own this place! Not you! ME! So stop crying about your little hammer and get on with your life.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStan was in complete shock. Never before had he seen such power, such anger. This was too much for him. He was in the prescence of the most powerful Kerbal ever, the head moderator had just had his status revoked in an instant, and the whole world was going to end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Now be quiet everyone.
