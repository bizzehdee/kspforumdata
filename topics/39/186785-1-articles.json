No second pod, just a command seat, and a heat shield that\u0027s only protecting him by the skin of his teeth, or rather his helmet.

I\u0027ve tried similar setups (with the seat directly attached to the shield as opposed to a cubic strut close to it) in the past and they usually end in a cooked Kerbal, but somehow it managed to survive! I\u0027m willing to bet it\u0027s because of the stage I kept bolted on to aid in decelleration. Honestly, it was a really fun and interesting mission, especially since I couldn\u0027t just \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E my closest approach or time to rendezvous. Figured i\u0027d share this fun, albeit brief little occurrence in my career mode with you all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaveJohnson376","CreatedById":180382,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-29T18:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, that\u0027s awesome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
