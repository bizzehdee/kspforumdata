In our hearts we carry a bit of longing to touch back down at base and greet the crowds of cheering and crying Kerbins, but the mission is not over, no, the journey has just started. Before us the winking stars and the thrill of the unknown calling to the adventurous soul. With pride and courage we sail forth to greet the Heavens as the tiny blue speck fades to join the countless stars as yet another dot in the deep black ocean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the song that tells of that glory and pride as Kerbin fades and adventure begins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://soundcloud.com/billy-winn-2/to-the-heavens-we-sail\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://soundcloud.com/billy-winn-2/to-the-heavens-we-sail\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy and as always, let me know what you think!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T01:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s rather cool, but you can\u0027t say it\u0027s peaceful, as the description on soundcloud.com says.
