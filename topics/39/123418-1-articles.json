The project was set aside due to other craft building interest, this one along with a few others. A Single Launched Space Station recently I launched for a second go round and fueled the Station in Kerbin Orbit and headed for the Mun. The Orbit at the Mun was accomplished without refueling. I can\u0027t even begin to explain how difficult it is to dock crafts the size of these with such little magnetics on the Docking Ports, patients and endurance was at maximum for sure. During the refueling at the Mun one of the ports lost Magnetism completely and this was only one of many problems that had to be worked out to get to this point. At this time the Station has been refueled and waiting for a Tug which will bring Alpha Delta to its next Destination. I am not good with the math and not sure if it will make it to Duna Orbit without having to refuel enroute or possibly make it to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpha Delta 21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/xzzlP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
