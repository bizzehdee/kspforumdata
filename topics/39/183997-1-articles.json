I am a professional writer and have a publisher for my actual books who will help me with the editing and formatting. I plan on distributing the books here, on my website, and on social media as they are finished, hopefully in Epub format (which if any of you know is a universal digital format for easy reading). But they will need to be free and available to anyone and everyone. So unless there is quite a bit of interest, I can\u0027t justify starting the project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will be a labor of love for KSP, and as such require my own time and money. I\u0027m considering starting a Patreon page to help support the effort and allow me to have some breathing room when it comes to writing my actual Disparia novels. I\u0027m also looking into producing actual printed copies of the book (again, for free) for those interested (though I\u0027m still looking into whether or not I can do so).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo before I jump in head first, I thought I would figuratively \u0022Check my staging\u0022 for interest and suggestions.

Sometimes it was cloudy and the abstract shapes would drift by, coalescing into imagined shapes, then pass quietly out of sight.

There had to be. Birds soared through the sky with ease, something no Kerbal had done before. Clouds drifted by seemingly weightless yet bound to a steady track through sky, guided along their invisible highway by an unseen hand. And what was beyond the mundane terrestrial world?

Other floaty things. Astronomers and scientists had discovered, studied, catalogued, and reported on these objects for hundreds of years. Legends from dead civilizations mythologized the objects in the sky and incorporated them into their views and beliefs of the realms beyond daily reality. These objects were seen, studied, and incorporated into each culture. But they were not well understood. No Kerbal had left Kerbin\u2019s surface for more than a few seconds, and when they had, it was usually because they fell off something and were quickly reminded that when you lose contact with the ground there is only one direction you can travel\u2014down. But knowing that they were there and understanding what exactly they were besides transient lights and objects in an untouchable ether were two different things. And try as Jeb might, pushing his brain muscles with all his effort until sweat pooled in his green, furrowed brow, he could not learn more about them through sheer willpower.

She puffed out her bulging and prodigious chest, adjusted her floral dress, and took two steps towards the front of the class. Jeb, lingering for just another moment, turned and walked down the center aisle between the separated rows of desks and stopped in front of his teacher. Jeb was only eight years old but already he (and most the other students) were eye level with their teacher. Ms. Able was, using only slightly exaggerated descriptions, as wide as she was tall. Her pale green complexion always glistened from a layer of sweat cause by the massive exertion everything seemed to be for her. She wore only dresses out of necessity. The dresses were so large and required so much fabric it was a wonder there were any sheets or pillow cases to be found inside the city of Granite Heights, the city of 5,000 people in which Jeb lived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs Jeb neared the hulking mass of Ms. Able the sour smell of old dairy, her distinct aroma, met Jeb\u2019s sensitive nose.

The harder he worked the more the kids in his class began to giggle. By the time a bit of sweat began forming under his brow the giggles had evolved into outright laughter. \u201CEnough!\u201D Ms. Able shouted and at once Jeb stopped flapping and the children went quiet. \u201CDid your feet leave the ground?\u201D Jeb looked down at his feet, lifting one off the ground and inspecting the sole of his brown school-issued boots.

Coming out of the recorder it sounded like animals being tortured. \u201CA Kerbal is made up of bones, muscles, ligaments, skin, and about 20% chocolate pudding. In today\u2019s presentation we will begin with the head, perhaps the most amazing part of any Kerbal. A Kerbal\u2019s skull is the thickest of any animal on Kerbin. Inside the thick skull is a secondary layer of a spongey material known as Squidgy Puddo-formus. This combination of rigidity and sponginess protects them from high velocity reading impacts and full contact knitting disasters, things most Kerbals are prone to experience.\u201D Jeb, as the recording continued, slowly lost interest and found his eyes wandering back towards the window. The sky was blue and bright, beautiful. His head might have been in the clouds, but his feet and amazing Kerbal brain were planted firmly on the ground.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-25T19:09:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2019 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Disparia Books\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos FTW!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-25T06:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the only idea that springs to mind is that you could maybe add a post to the \u2018writers talking about writing\u2019 thread further down this page. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/119356-a-thread-for-writers-to-talk-about-writing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E for ease of finding and future reference.

Eddington itself was separated from the nearest major city, Rexburg, by 20 kilometers of rolling highlands and pastures. It was considered \u003Ci\u003Eusually\u003C/i\u003E quiet because during the times other than \u201CUsually\u201D the air was rent with the sounds of Vlad and his various experiments. Hypergolic was another word for Tuesday in Vlad\u2019s world, and orange mushroom clouds were almost as common a sight as non-toxic clouds. Normal cities saw children\u2019s parents giving them barometers in order to help understand and predict the weather. Residents of Eddington gave their kids Vladometers. Vladometers were essentially clocks and Geiger counters packaged neatly in animal-shaped mounts where the clock face was on one side of a beast\u2019s stomach and the eyes would glow according to radiation levels (pigs and cows were the most common, though some horses and sheep could be found too). The clocks were used to time the gaps between tests (and necessarily explosions). If you saw your Vladometer tick over a full rotation you could expect the ground to shake and the sky to light up at any time. The Geiger counters detected radiation, which was another way of saying they detected Vlad. Because if Vlad wasn\u2019t already green thanks to being a Kerbal, he\u2019d certainly be green from radiation. Some also said he glowed in the dark, so the Vladometer wasn\u2019t as necessary at night. But that was mostly a rumor and not a fact. Regardless, when you saw a Vladometer\u2019s eyes begin to glow you knew it was time to take a brief holiday out of town. The animals in the local fields and farms knew this, and at least once a day you could find a stampede of cows, horses, and even chickens sprinting across the countryside to avoid the inevitable charring, searing, or decapitation.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiriusRocketry","CreatedById":178125,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-29T17:19:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI very much enjoyed this!

I understand why, but in keeping with the rules it would make writing the books incredibly difficult, as I could not even use a Patreon account with Kerbal-based rewards in any way. So in order to do this I would need to separate the KSP stories from my Disparia Books label completely, fund it out of pocket(and time), and only use Patreon for my primary novel series. That\u0027s fine, but it would make this much more time consuming and difficult.

Start an entirely new book series in the same tone/theme as the KSP project would go, but without using the KSP IP.
