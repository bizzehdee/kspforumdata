This is my take on KSP lore and how the space program was founded! We will be covering how Jeb, Val, Bob, and Bill all came together, along with all the other Kerbals tasked with taking on the task of conquering space! I will be releasing these chapter by chapter, so stay tuned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCHAPTER ONE: THE CRATER\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crisp, cold air of the Starfall Mountains was filled with the joyous laughter and cheerful shouts of Kerbals celebrating the arrival of a new year. Colorful fireworks burst into the night sky, illuminating the quaint town of Stellark in a dazzling display of reds, blues, and greens. Jebediah Kerman, a young and adventurous Kerbal with a perpetually cheerful disposition, stood at the heart of the festivities, his eyes fixed on the explosions of color overhead. He wore his signature brown bomber jacket, a testament to his aspirations of one day becoming a pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah\u0027s friends and neighbors, their faces illuminated by the flickering lights, danced to the lively music that echoed through the mountains. Kerbals of all ages had gathered to celebrate this momentous occasion, their concerns forgotten in the face of such merriment. It was a rare night of unity and pure joy, a respite from the worries that had plagued the people of Kerbin and the world at large for the past 5 years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the clock ticked closer to midnight, Jebediah couldn\u0027t help but reflect on the events that had brought them to this point. The Crater War, as it had come to be known, was sparked by the crisis involving an asteroid hurtling towards Kerbin. It had shaken the very foundations of their world, plunging Kerbals into a fierce conflict as they fought to secure the resources needed to defend their planet. But tonight, none of that seemed to matter. For a brief moment, the war was forgotten, and the people of Stellark came together in celebration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah\u0027s best friend, Bill Kerman, clapped him on the back, shouting to be heard above the noise. \u0022Can you believe it, Jeb? Another year gone by!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah grinned, his eyes shining with excitement. \u0022It\u0027s been one wild ride, Bill. And I have a feeling the next one\u0027s going to be even wilder.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as the crowd\u0027s cheers reached a fever pitch, the music abruptly cut out, and the celebratory shouts turned to confused murmurs. A hushed silence descended over the crowd, and Jebediah felt a chill crawl up his spine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA deep, authoritative voice echoed from the loudspeakers, cutting through the night air. \u0022Ladies and gentlemen, I interrupt your celebration with grave news.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah\u0027s heart sank. He exchanged a worried glance with Bill, and the two of them moved closer to the source of the announcement, their friends and neighbors following suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Crater War has ended,\u0022 the voice declared. \u0022A truce has been reached, and peace has been secured. Kerbin is safe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd erupted in a mix of cheers, tears, and embraces. Jebediah\u0027s own eyes welled with emotion as he hugged Bill, his heart pounding with relief. For so long, they had feared for their world, and now, on this joyous night, it seemed the weight of the world had been lifted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the voice on the loudspeakers continued, its tone solemn. \u0022We have made sacrifices, Kerbals. But we have achieved what we set out to do, and for that, we should be proud. Let this night of celebration be a testament to our strength and unity.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah and the others listened intently, their elation tempered by the gravity of the message. The sacrifices made during the Crater War were not to be forgotten, and they knew there would be much rebuilding and healing to do in the days and months ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the voice faded, the music resumed, and the fireworks burst forth once more. Jebediah watched the colors dance in the night sky, his thoughts filled with hope for a brighter future. The war was over, and a new year had begun, ushering in a fresh chapter in Kerbal history. In the midst of the celebration, he couldn\u0027t help but believe that their dreams of space exploration, once threatened by the crisis, were now more achievable than ever. Jebediah\u0027s eyes twinkled with determination as he looked up at the stars, for in that moment, he knew that his journey had only just begun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
