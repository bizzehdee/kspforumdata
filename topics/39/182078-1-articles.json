God.. I don\u0027t even know.. Anyway, I thought I might start a video series, but I had a serious question for you creators out there.. logistically, how do you do it? Like.. I just recorded about.. eh.. 8ish hours of footage and plan on editing it down to 30 min episodes and narrate over the cuts.. is that the best way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triop","CreatedById":145841,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-12T06:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-12T14:27:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually that\u0027s the last very\u00A0pair of\u00A0steps, the recording and editing. How much time have you got budgeted for planning and writing\u00A0each video?
