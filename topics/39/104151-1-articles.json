Basically taking my bag of tricks out of trade secret land and put the blueprints out there in the public domain for anyone to co-opt. I think I\u0027ve finally worked around my machine not wanting to listen to the mic, so you can hear me again.\n\nIf I were to do this, what would you want to see me do?\n\nBut more importantly, would anyone care?\n\n#EDIT: Ok, people do care haha.

I bought - and just recently upgraded - VideoPad for $99 and then $39 and think it\u0027s worth every penny.

However I may be wrong considering the program \\*DOES\\* have a \u0022save to YouTube\u0022 option.\n\n[http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/](http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/)\n\nThere are various other video editors out there that are free but - not to go full regex on you - they\u0027re all garbage. But if you just want a no-frills, drop all the stuff together, trim it, and go option then I\u0027d look into Windows Movie Maker. You may even already have it but if not, [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download)\n\nAnd I totally know what you mean about intros.
