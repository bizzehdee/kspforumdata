So I did. Wasn\u0027t that hard, just a bit tedious on the copy/paste to assembled everything into one image from about 30 or so. I used KerbCam and Paint.NET. Pressing the F1 key every second or so while steering the rocket with the interface hidden. I could have also used Chronolapse to have it take screencaps at set intervals but didn\u0027t think about it until afterwards. Slight post-edit in Paint.NET to yellow the entire rocket trail. I\u0027m sure someone who\u0027s actually good at image editing could do better.
