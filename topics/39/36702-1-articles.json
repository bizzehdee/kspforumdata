As long as their idea is not too far out of the way of the story. This story will tell the story from 4 points of view of the Space Center\u0027s formation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: :)Wernher Von Kermnan: In his mid-30s, Von Kerman is something of a dreamer. He has had this idea in his head that you would use huge rockets to land on other planets and Muns. He is also a great rocket scientist, creator of the Kerggregat-4 Missile, used against Lololondon during Kerbin War II.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: :cool:Jebidiah Kerman: Jeb, mid-20s, Is a thrillmaster, an adrenaline junkie, and... Well, you get the idea. His Junkyard exists only so that he can assemble crazy contraptions to get the Adrenaline pumping. After Jeb heard of the \u0022Rocket\u0022 he was hooked, creating a very successful rocket, that is little more than \u0022a trash bin full of boom\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: :mad:Bill: Bill is Jeb\u0027s brother, late 20s, and does not really like Jeb\u0027s shenanigans. He\u0027s afraid he\u0027ll get himself hurt, or worse: dead. He tries his best to keep his brother in check, but he is usually too late. The two live in apartments next to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: :)Bob: Bob is a teenager, and he loves science fiction. Ever since he saw Stayputnik go up, he knew he was going to be an astronaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note who you are posting about with one of the above smileys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T14:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had been a great day for me that day! I went to the bar earlier today, and I found a penny. It was even SHINY! but more importantly, I saw, while the bartender was mixing my drink, that alcohol is flammable. After I had my drink, I asked him. \u0022Hey, Bart, What\u0027s the strongest stuff you have here?\u0022 \u0022I have pure alcohol, that\u0027s pretty strong.\u0022 He looked puzzled as to why I would need something so strong. \u0022I\u0027ll take 400 liters of the stuff!\u0022 I excaimed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put the many many bottles of liquor in my truck, and headed to the junkyard. \u0022Alright, I have got a GREAT idea!, Bill!\u0022 Bill was working on a new design for a solid rocket motor. \u0022Bill, put away that SRB scribblin\u0027, I need you to make something MUCH better.\u0022 I showed him the alcohol. \u0022But first I need you to go to the store and get 400 liters of Nitrous Oxide, the stuff in whipped cream cans. They\u0027ll make an excellent oxidizer.\u0022 Bill stared at me. \u0022What the moho are you thinking, Jeb? SRBs have oxidizer built in to the grain!\u0022 I showed him the alcohol. \u0022Alcojhol is flamable, and with an Oxidizer, it\u0027ll get a much bigger boom in space.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the next few hours we got to work designing the LV-T30 Liquid Fueled rocket motor, and the FL-T800 fuel tank. Using these, the plan is to get into space, and fall back down. I asked my mom to make a quilt we could use for a parachute. I found some scrap metal in the junkyard, and I, with the help of my assistant Danny, worked it into a (mostly) airtight command capsule. The launch of the Moho 7 Rocket is imminent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Designer225","CreatedById":48514,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T02:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOdiinYggd already stated that RP in KSP forum is disappointing and that moving the thread to a new place designed for RP is a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
