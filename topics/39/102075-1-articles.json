I added others as I went along, but those are the core mods.\n\nCurrently, I\u0027m waiting for a transfer window to Duna, the entire tech tree is unlocked and all I\u0027ve yet to upgrade fully is the SPH and Runway (they\u0027re at Tier 2 right now). I\u0027ve had a lot of fun making this series and eagerly await 1.0 so I can do it all over again. Focus went from capturing everything to capturing only significant missions (since I eventually ended up with a LOT going on).\n\nQuality improves when I picked up a desktop condenser mic and learned how to do some basic editing, so a thousand pardons for that.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLv-TFFDKnxnjCAK_KpDR4IzL_3NPZuHWh\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T05:46:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 05:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pvtnum11**"}]}
