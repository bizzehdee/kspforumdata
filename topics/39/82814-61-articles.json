The most special effects I\u0027ve ever done (thanks to ABAthedude for helping me out with that) and a really exciting story. Best part about it is that it went from script to film in roughly five days, which is a record time for me by a country mile, I can assure you though that the quality did not suffer: in fact it\u0027s probably the best I\u0027ve ever done. The narrated section of the video hopefully wont take me too long either, though the last episode taught me that I shouldn\u0027t underestimate how long it takes to record a battle.
