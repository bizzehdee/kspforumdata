He was old and suspicious-looking. This guys gave me a CD in a blank case splattered with HYPER REALISTIC blood. I looked up to ask him what this was, but he had already left.  \n\n Now, walking home, I decided to plop the CD into my computer disk-drive. However, when I removed the CD from its case, I noticed there was more blood (HYPER REALISM OMG!) on the CD and the inside cover, writing out the words, Kerbal Death Program. Not noticing anything out of the ordinary (nope, not at all) I popped the disk into my computer\u0027s disk-drive, noticing it was smoking a little. Ignoring it, I closed the disk-drive, and my computer suddenly sucked me in.\n\n As I looked around in the cyber-space, I noticed I was at a space center, similar to Florida\u0027s KSC. Walking around, I noticed I was getting smaller. Looking down, I noticed my hands had turned green, along with the rest of my skin. All of a sudden, a jumpscare came out of my ass and shoved itself firmly into my mouth, knocking me unconscious.\n\n When I woke up, I found myself inside what appeared to be a space capsule. Being a space nerd myself, I recongnised it to be similar to the Orion capsule in design. I also noticed that I was wearing a spacesuit, and was strapped to my seat. Trying to leave the spacecraft, I noticed I was firmly strapped to my seat; when I tried to undo it, I felt a rumbling under my seat. The rocket I was in was launching!Panicking, I ran around like an idiot. Not that it mattred; the rocket blew up with me in it, unleashing gushes of HYPER-REALISTIC BLOOD!!!\n\nBTW, this is a parody to bad creepypasta, made bad on purpose."},{"CreatedByName":"EdusacconBR","CreatedById":135047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:46:12Z","Content":"wat? xD"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T06:04:21Z","Content":"I know, right?
