Few stepped up for the challenge though, There were low budgets, Few workers, And small Mission Control crews. The Kerbals decided on a Probe 9/10 The only rejection was Jebadiah Kerman, He quoted this after asked questions \u0027I believe we should be first near Minmus for one reason... UNTESTED SPACECRAFT AND POSSIBLE EXPLOSIONS\u0027 Mission Control were all thinking \u0027Oh dear Kerbus tell me he isn\\\u0027t piloting our FIRST landing\u0027. The head designer was Lernher von Gr\u00C3\u00BCn the most experienced engineer of his time and father of Kerbal Space Science. Lernher von Gr\u00C3\u00BCn Turned to his friend NovaSilisko as he was called by most everyone. Silisko fitted out the probe, The Hyperion Space Telescope As Lernher von Gr\u00C3\u00BCn and his small team of workers worked on the Murs II rocket for taking the Probe to Minmus. It took only three weeks to get ready for launch, Then two weeks of waiting for smooth weather once the day came everyone was nervous due to the Murs II never being tested at such orbits. Everyone was excited, the mission control was nervous more than anxious \u0027Lets hope the Murs II Makes it\u0027 Bill Kerman Said as the clock counted down: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1........\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T09:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I just say that Minmus would have been discovered way before the first mission to the Mun due to (mainly) the fact it can be seen from the surface of Kerbin and primitive telescopes would easily see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T16:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I just say that Minmus would have been discovered way before the first mission to the Mun due to (mainly) the fact it can be seen from the surface of Kerbin and primitive telescopes would easily see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Thats not what game history says \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T16:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI Will add onto this when I get the time too there will be either 4 or 5 chapters\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T18:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sbowyer28\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sbowyer28\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thats not what game history says \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so if HarvesteR was to add a planet 1 million lightyears from Kerbin, then a large Mun 70 000m from Kerbin, the Planet would be noticed first?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T19:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nooblet68\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so if HarvesteR was to add a planet 1 million lightyears from Kerbin, then a large Mun 70 000m from Kerbin, the Planet would be noticed first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E Probably\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-16T19:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[mod]Stay on topic fellas, what did you think of Sbowyer28\u0027s fanfiction?[/mod]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Minmus didn\\\u0027t even exist a month ago, it\\\u0027s a game remember \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanic","CreatedById":149920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T15:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinmus would look like a very bright star.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T16:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sanic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sanic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMinmus would look like a very bright star.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t Necro old threads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T16:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease don\u0027t Necro old threads.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t reply to necros or backseat moderate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESanic, please check the last post date before bumping old threads like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
