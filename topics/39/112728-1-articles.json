What would the intro theme be like?\n\nThe music used in this video is the theme from \u0022The Cape\u0022. \u0022The Cape\u0022 was an American drama series that ran for one season in 1996. It centered around a group of NASA astronauts as they trained and flew Space Shuttle missions. As of this video, a DVD release of \u0022The Cape\u0022 episodes has never been made, and few clips are available online. However, the theme matches up well with the atmosphere and immersion of Kerbal Space Program.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The KSP logo is present in the video, as is the reference to Squad as the producer, but they\u0027re simply there for theatrics and this video is NOT an official product of Squad.\n\n*Raptor*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T03:39:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor9**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:41:49Z","Content":"Pretty good. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shawn28","CreatedById":143994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T23:45:11Z","Content":"nice ! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T23:46:00Z","Content":"Thanks guys.
