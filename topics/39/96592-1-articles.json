His body was deprived of energy, as was his soul. Exhausted despite the low gravity, he continued to ascend. It took all the strength he could muster just to crest the hill. \u003Cem\u003EWhere\u0027s Halcyon One?\u003C/em\u003E he thought. Peering out into the distance he saw her, perched on a small island. The colonists were lined up in rows, surrounded by the Hanland\u0027s marines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No...\u0022 He said. Suddenly, a light illuminated the sky. \u003Cem\u003EDebris.\u003C/em\u003E he thought. Multiple points of light streaked across the Laythian sphere, leaving long crystalline tails behind them. The last remnants of the battle in the sky. Summoning every ounce of energy he could muster, the figure planted his boots in the sand and rose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I will make you proud, father.\u0022 he murmured, \u0022I will make you proud.\u0022\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2014/312/f/7/shelbus_by_i_phillip-d85s3xp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shelbus_by_i_phillip-d85s3xp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe stood, his legs shaking with the effort, and slowly began making making his way down the sandy slope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI must save them\u003C/em\u003E, he thought to himself. \u003Cem\u003EHow could this have happened\u003C/em\u003E? \u003Cem\u003EI have to get them out of there\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EI have to save them\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EBut, I already did...

He staggered to a halt, a light wind blowing flecks of sand in his face, \u003Cem\u003EWhat obligation do I have to them\u003C/em\u003E? \u003Cem\u003EThey were going to arrest me\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EThey think I murdered Gregford to cover up my own crimes\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe chuckled half-madly to himself as he began his slow trek once again. \u003Cem\u003EOh, how did I get into this mess\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EI should never have left Kerbin\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cem\u003E Kerbin\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EGravity\u003C/em\u003E. He suddenly became aware of his heavy, stumbling gait. He chuckled again. \u003Cem\u003EGregford would kill me if he saw how weak I\u0027ve let myself become\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EGregford had always insisted on spending at least a half-hour hour a day in the centrifuge, even if it meant spending the next five hours huddled up in a blanket with the heater on low\u003C/em\u003E. But, no, that made no sense. They hadn\u0027t been in zero gee for months. Years, maybe. How long had it been since the colony landed? He couldn\u0027t remember. Long enough that he should be able to walk straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he peered into the deep indigo sky, one of the shards of light streaking overhead erupted into a puffy sphere of flames. A moment later, he felt a jarring vibration pulse through his body as the shock wave caught up with him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelentlessly, he continued plodding down the hill, the flame of his soul once again dying. A sphere of darkness began to encompass the edges of his vision. He staggered and tumbled down the hill. He had no idea how long he rolled before finally coming to a halt on his back in the sand. He heard the crashing of waves on a beach. As he watched as the remaining shooting stars incinerate, consciousness abandoned him again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2015/045/7/1/the_catastrophe_by_i_phillip-d8i0ivj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022the_catastrophe_by_i_phillip-d8i0ivj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus curled his toes into the fuzzy carpet, feeling warmth and security as he groggily rolled out of bed and stumbled over to the kitchen. His mother had already put a slice of toast and a glass of Koamba Juice on the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shelbus?\u0022 He glanced up to where his mother was climbing down the stairs. \u0022Oh, there you are, Shelby.

He really thinks you\u0027ll make it this time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, I wish I was as confident as him. I think that I\u0027m going to go for a walk, just to shake off the stress.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus donned his shoes and some comfortable light clothing. \u0022I\u0027ll see you soon, Mom!\u0022. He strolled out the door and down the driveway with a certain contentedness to his step. Mhm. I love this place. \u003Cem\u003EMuch better than living in the desert. The sight of the mountains rising in the distance. The smell of the ocean. The flowers. The clear sky. It truly doesn\u0027t get better, does it?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe turned the corner down a shaded path where the sunlight was glistening off the emerald pine needles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPassing a older looking figure, he chimed, \u0022Good morning!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re going to fail Shelbus, you\u0027re going to fail and everything you love and hold dearly will be taken from you.\u0022 Shelbus came to an abrubt halt and spun towards the direction of the speaker, who was staring at Shelbus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Excuse me?\u0022 Shelbus stuttered, suddenly angry and confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe figure simply turned and continued walking down the path. Suddenly, there was a gripping pain in his left side. He collapsed to the sand. Sand... sand? The illusion before his eyes began to fade. \u0022NO! I WANT TO STAY!\u0022 He sprinted across the projection, grabbing hold of whatever he could, trying to cement the facade in his mind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Please, just let it end here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an instant his eyes opened. \u003Cem\u003ESand........\u003C/em\u003E \u0022Ow\u0022, he felt a gentle prodding in his side. Struggling to hoist his head aloft he turned towards the source of the disturbance. Perched in the sand was the AL228 Rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AL, how did you find me?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You did not return to the colony, so I originally assumed you dead. However, about a half an hour ago, I detected a capsule transmitting vital signs that matched yours, Mr. Shelbus. I located your wreckage and tracked your boot imprints to this location.\u0022 Shelbus nodded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AL, how are your resource reserves?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Consumable Rations at 78% . Electric charge at 58%. I also collected your helmet from the wreckage, Mr. Shelbus\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why thank you AL. You can hold onto it for now, I don\u0027t think that I could carry much else.\u0022 Shelbus reached for the consumable resource compartment on the underside of AL228-Unit. Shelbus\u0027s hand quickly retreated as he peered under AL. \u0022The bomb. The bomb Gregford planted on you, AL. Why did you let him do that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am an Artificial Intelligence, a program, Mr. Shelbus. I follow directions and programs and function to the very best of my abilities however I am required.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, is the bomb armed?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative, the explosive is armed and awaiting remote detonation via the controlling apparatus. I took the liberty of retrieving the controlling apparatus from deceased colonist 06, Gregford Kerman, and placing it in my sample retrieval chamber\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027d better be careful with that. AL, Is there any way to detach the bomb?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Not within either of our current capabilities. I\u0027ve calculated that severing of any of the 3 transmission wires will result in an automatic detonation.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Great. Just perfect,\u0022 Shelbus muttered as he heaved himself to his feet by grasping onto AL\u0027s frame. He gently touched his side and was rewarded with a sharp pain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think I broke a rib.\u0022 He muttered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That is no problem. I permanently borrowed a medical kit from Mr. Gregford\u0027s buggy after detecting your vital signs. It is stored in Containment Unit 3 in my lower chassis.\u0022 Shelbus chuckled a little bit to himself at Al\u0027s refusal to say the he stole something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs gingerly applied a calcium salve to his chest, he gazed out to the horizon where he could still see the colony. He sighed a heavy breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s pretty incredible isn\u0027t it? Isn\u0027t it AL?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Indeed it is Mr.Shelbus\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus couldn\u0027t pry his eyes from the magnificent jade orb looming in the sky. \u0022We\u0027re just so small, so worthless\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I concur Mr.Shelbus\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Eh, you do? Do you know what it\u0027s like to feel the insignificance of your own existence, do you feel your own existence at all?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hm, well who am I to argue with you?\u0022 Shelbus slowly stood, he was shaky on the knees after recovering from his fall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why should I save them AL? They\u0027re not my friends, they don\u0027t trusts me, they don\u0027t care about me. They think I was traitor, the rat who destroyed everything\u0022. His head turned back towards Jool. \u0022But it\u0027s all so meaningless. Dust in the wind they say\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They die, I die, what difference does it make?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr.Shelbus, I am but an artificial intelligence, a program, Mr. Shelbus.

So Al why does\u0022 --\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Save them, Shelbus\u0022. Shelbus was startled by the interjection. \u0022It is imperative that you save them, Shelbus\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus found himself unable to reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I must ensure and preserve the safety of you and your fellow colonists, Mr.Shelbus. It is my design. I ask you this Mr.Shelbus, is it compassion I feel?

I implore you, save them... I have the chronological datafile of every colonists. Think of your father, Shelbus\u0022. AL\u0027s soothing tone echoed through Shelbus\u0027s mind. \u0022Consider all that there is yet to discover, to feel, to experience, Mr.Shelbus. Do you not wish to return home?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAL spun his single black lens towards Jool.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2015/045/2/2/al228_by_i_phillip-d8i2oft.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022al228_by_i_phillip-d8i2oft.jpg\u0022\u003E \u0022You\u0027re prior statement was correct Shelbus, it is very much so incredible\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But the preservation of many more beings capable of appreciating such incredulity is much more so\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I-I...

My optical systems were not designed for surveillance at such distances.\u0022 There was a distinct mechanical whirring as AL continually adjusted and refocused his lens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I can perceive three armed Hanland guards. They arrived on Laythe\u0027s surface in an HDF-MT-18 Marine Transport orbital dropship. I see that the craft\u0027s primary weapons are aimed directly at Halcyon One.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How about the colonist. Can you see them, AL?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Negative, Mr.Shelbus.\u0022 The two sat there for another minute or so in silence, Al\u0027s camera occasionally whirring when he readjusted his focus. Al suddenly spoke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Shelbus, I believe that the Hanland\u0027s crew intends to forcibly reduce the population of the colony to the point where only the most scientifically active colonists still exist.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus nodded grimly. \u0022Why do you think that they\u0027ll keep the scientists around?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because, assuming I am correct in that the Hanland wishes to utilize the colony\u0027s resources for their own purposes, rather than merely destroy it, they will view the scientists as a resource to be utilized. The majority of the other crew, the engineers, the media team, can be replaced with forces from the Hanland, or will likely be viewed as irrelevant. I suspect that the first colonists to be decommissioned will be media executive Merbald Kerman and Genenie Kerman, as they hold the least value to the Hanland\u0027s invasive forces.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Genenie?\u0022 Shelbus\u0027s tone rose. \u0022How do we know she wasn\u0027t helping Gregford? How do we know that she\u0027s not also responsible for this disaster?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Shelbus, in spite of what you seem to believe, Genenie Kerman\u0027s personal relationship with Gregford is not a reliable piece of data as to determining where her allegiance lies. It is possible, perhaps even probable, that colonist Genenie was aware of just as little of Gregfords plans as you and your fellow colonists.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well what would you like me to do, AL? What can I do? Ask her?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes. Asking her could very well be an effective determinate of her alliegances. Her responses to the question would vary widely, depending on allegiance and current emotional state. She may respond with an honest truth, confusion, indignation, wild indignation, wild confusion, an attempt to kill you, fake confusion, fake wild indignation...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shut up and watch the colony.\u0022 Shelbus growled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two sat for another few minutes, watching the little black ants scurry about in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAL\u0027s monocular lens rotated to face Shelbus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr Shelbus, in spite of your suspicions about Genenie\u0027s allegiances, we must rescue Genenie and Merbald before they are terminated. They may not hold much data relevant to our current directive, but I cannot allow any of my colonists perish, Mr.Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your colonists, AL? What do you mean by that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022My purpose is to serve and protect every colonist that was designated to the Halcyon One colony. Your protection is the duty that wasassigned to me before I was ever activated. I was given authority that, in some cases, surpasses even that of my creators, and the leaders of this colony. In that sense, this colony is mine. Your existence is my purpose. Without the colony, the only task I have is to sit and wait for a viable command to come through the comm link.\u0022 AL was repetitively toying with the sand, pivoting his front wheels and quickly spinning them to kick up small amounts of sand. \u0022I cannot allow any of you to come to harm, Mr.Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus sighed. \u0022How can you be so logical and still pluck at my emotions at the same time?\u0022 He slid down the dune on his back, wincing at the pain from his broken rib. \u0022I know that I have to save them all. Even if I did have a good reason to suspect that one of them might be in league with the Hanland\u0027s crew, I couldn\u0027t just leave them there.\u0022 He sighed again. \u0022How do we that we stop this execution?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am uncertain. I have prepared multiple possible scenarios for review. Allow me a moment to process.\u0022 Again, there was silence, aside from the breeze and the whirring of Al\u0027s camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Shelbus, how do you feel about piloting another military aircraft?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kraken, that\u0027s cold!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The temperatures are well within the tolerance limits of the combined heat output of your body and the suit\u0027s environmental maintenance systems, Mr. Shelbus. Focus on your purpose.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey! Do you want to hop in here?\u0022 Shelbus waded in the frigid Laythian waters. \u0022AL, Laythe\u0027s oceans are much less dense than Kerbin\u0027s. I don\u0027t think I can swim that far and keep my head above the water at the same time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Simply put your helmet on. It will increase your buoyancy and minimize the energy you expend during trip.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, alright.\u0022 There was a hiss and a click as the helmet sealed itself around his neck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, once I swim over there, what exactly do plan for me to do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That is uncertain, Mr. Shelbus. I require more data as to the state of the colony to develop a detailed plan of action.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, basically, you\u0027re improvising.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Precisely, Mr. Shelbus. The current mission outline that I have prepared requires that you infiltrate the colony undetected, rescue the media executives undetected, and leave undetected. However, as this is unlikely to happen, I have prepared a secondary outline involving you permanently borrowing a dropship to make your escape. It is unlikely that either will work without severe deviation. You are leaving my auditory range. Please close your helmet and test your communication apparatus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Testing, testing, one two three. Can you read me, AL?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative, Mr. Shelbus. Remember, the execution may occur at any time, so time is of the essence. You must not waste it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Got it, AL.\u0022 Shelbus turned around and awkwardly waddled into the deeper waters. It was gradually becoming more and more difficult for his feet to touch the sandy ocean floor. \u0022Well, the helmet\u0027s working well enough, AL.\u0022 Shelbus started kicking. \u0022This is not going to be fun...\u0022 Shelbus after a minute or so, he turned around and, much to his dismay, was still only about 20 meters from the shore. \u0022I\u0027ll see you at the rendezvous point, AL.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2015/046/d/d/shelbus_in_the_water_by_i_phillip-d8i6lnv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022shelbus_in_the_water_by_i_phillip-d8i6lnv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobbing up and down Shelbus unrelentingly made his way across the channel. \u0022What would Dad think about this? Guerrilla warfare certainly isn\u0027t what I was trained for.\u0022 The silent static of his communicator was suddenly interrupted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re talking to yourself, Mr.Shelbus. Would you like me to perform a psychiatric evaluation?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What? No! AL, I\u0027m fine!\u0022 Shelbus said adamantly. \u0022It\u0027s a coping mechanism; I\u0027ve always done this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You have always done this?

Soon, Shelbus could barely feel his arms. He could clearly see the colony on the shore. \u003Cem\u003EWhere did the guards go? The execution! It must be happening, and soon. Ground! I can feel the ground!\u003C/em\u003E Shelbus suddenly found his footing and slowly made his way to shore. \u0022Oh boy. Here we go, AL. Wish me good luck.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good luck, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022 AL pivoted in the sand and steadily made his way up the dune before disappearing over the crest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe must succeed. \u003C/em\u003EHe thought absently.\u003Cem\u003E Mr. Shelbus and I cannot fail.

Conditions are nearly optimal to accommodate stealth, though the lack of active Kerbals could indicate that the termination of colonists Genenie and Merbald is nearly upon us. Proceed with caution, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022 Shelbus nodded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Any idea why the lights are off?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Monitoring of the Hanland crew\u0027s most recent radio communications indicates that that the dropship had some kind of generator malfunction, which is common with the Hanland\u0027s engines. Presumably, the Hanland crew drained the colony\u0027s batteries to recharge their ship. Or they could have ordered an early sleep period, and shut down the lights to accommodate. Either way, it is best to be cautious, as the lights could come on at any time.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus glanced out from behind the rock again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wait, I see two guards over there, standing under module 2. Just the two, I think. Most of the Hanlan\u0027s crew is probably sleeping, after the long day they just had. Now, how do I know tell which module Genenie and Merbald are in?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The optimal method of determining their location is via a direct observation through a transparent port.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So... look through the windows?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Precisely, Mr.Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022All right. I\u0027m going in.\u0022 Shelbus silently crept towards the colony. Careful to keep out of sight of the guards, he made his way to the colony and hid behind one of its four landing engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bad news, Al. There\u0027s no way I can reach that window, it\u0027s got to be two meters off the ground.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Climb the landing leg. You will find a series of rungs ringing the bottom of the habitation module that you can balance on and use climb around to the window, if you are careful.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he moved to start climbing the landing leg, the guards stopped talking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus climbed down from the leg and glanced around the module. They were walking in his direction. His heart started pumping as adrenaline worked its way through his system. \u003Cem\u003EWhat do I do?\u003C/em\u003E His eyes darted around frantically. \u003Cem\u003EWhat do I do?\u003C/em\u003E He dove to the ground, hoping that the guards would not notice the noise, and began furiously pulling sand over himself. He didn\u0027t stop until there was no part of him exposed. \u0022This helmet really comes in handy, Al.\u0022 Shelbus whispered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guards stopped just a few meters from where he was, so close that Shelbus could hear their muffled voices. \u0022Is it really necessary to execute those two? I mean, obviously they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re of no benefit to us, but I wasn\u0027t expecting this sort of stuff when I signed on with Hanland.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA distinctly softer voice spoke. \u0022You know what our orders are, Ludfurt. This is war. In was, we cannot afford any unneeded expenses. We are all that is left of the Hanland fleet, and the Spiritwolf fleet has been obliterated. If we are not ruthless now, it will only be a matter of time before the colonists turn on us and destroy us as well, stealing our victory for Spiritwolf.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But these guys are just civilians and scientists; they\u0027re just here to explore Laythe.

Orders are orders, the execution is in 30 minutes and you cannot change that!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus heard what sounded like one of the guards walking away. \u003Cem\u003EThis is it, this is my chance!\u003C/em\u003E Shelbus burst from the sand and swung his head at the guard as hard as possible. There was dull thump as the thick glass of Shelbus\u0027s helmet connected with the guard\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s forehead. Shelbus stunned fell backwards into the sand, slightly stunned, as did the guard. \u0022Al, I got him!\u0022 Shelbus exclaimed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Double check his status, Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus righted himself and peered down at the guard. \u0022Unconscious.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CExcellent, Mr. Shelbus.

He backed up against the jet engine affixed under the module, suddenly aware of how much his stark white space suit contrasted with the dark black metal. In spite of the darkness, anyone who walked around to this side of the engine may still see him. A thumping suddenly reverberated through the module and into his body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAl,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 he whispered. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI heard someone walking around above me.

We have very little time. The Hanland guards have ordered you and Mr. Merbald executed. It is happening in approximately twenty minutes.

The other lump moved in the darkness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGenenie?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 The reedy voice of the ancient Merbald cut quietly through her sobs. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI know that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been through a lot in the last day. I have too. I would never have thought that anyone could know how to do that kind of\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 things to a Kerbal either.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 His voiced got quiet for the last part of that sentence. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBut you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t let them break you. If they break you, they win. They win more than if they just execute you, if they break you. I went through exactly what you did, so I know how you feel, right now.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 His voice suddenly went stern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNow, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m an old Kerbal, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here ready to stand up and walk out of here while you sit there, less than thirty years old, crying on the floor. It\u0027s time to go, Genenie.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Shelbus thought he saw her nod, and she stood up, using Merbald for support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CNow,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Al said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe must move quickly. The position of all of the guards is uncertain.

She cringed. \u0022AL, did you do this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAL was silent for a few moments, \u0022Technically, yes.\u0022 Shelbus chuckled a little under his breath. Commanding Shelbus to attac was quite an ethical conundrum for Al to work through. \u0022Careful on this ladder Merbald,\u0022 said AL. \u0022Stay low and remain confined within the shadows.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AL, who\u0027s in that suit? Who did you get away from the guards?\u0022 Merbald whispered anxiously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There is no time to explain, Mr. Merbald, we must remain silent.\u0022 Shelbus led the kerbals in the direction of the dropship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AL,\u0022 Shelbus whispered as quietly as he could. \u0022The first guard I took out... he\u0027s gone.\u0022 Shelbus\u0027s heart began to race again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do not panic, Mr. Shelbus; we will worry about the guard if he becomes a danger. Right now, you must escort the prisoners to safety. In any case, you attacked him quickly enough that he may not even realize what had happened. Maintain your pace.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus continued forward, delicately stepping through the shadows, Merbald and Genenie never more than a meter behind him. Nearing the edge of the Colony, Shelbus became hopeful. \u003Cem\u003EWe might actually make it. Just a little further.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Merbald, Miss Genenie, this is the most dangerous part of the rescue operation. Your clothing was not designed to insulate against cold water, so we cannot leave via the ocean. We must make an dash of approximately fifty meters to the Hanland dropship. The kerbal in this suit will follow my instructions to take control of the vessel and pilot us to safety.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... how do you know how to fly a Hanland dropship, AL?\u0022 Said Genenie as she squinted at the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I do not.\u0022 Al said calmly, \u0022I expect the kerbal in this suit to improvise when I cannot provide him with necessary instructions.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus turned around to look for guards. \u0022AL, the colony tower. A guard could be up there. He\u0027d have a clear view of us. And what about guards in the dropship? They won\u0027t leave it unguarded.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool\u0027s green glow provided just enough light for figures and movement to be seen in the darkness. AL observed the whole scenario from a hill a few kilometers across the channel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I detect no heat signatures in the tower, at the moment. I believe that is currently uninhabited. As for the dropship, I believe that there will be no more than one guard, as most of the dropship\u0027s forces will be sleeping in the more comfortable colony or focused on keeping the colonists confined to the colony. It is now or never, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus crouched down preparing to sprint. \u0022Alright, make yourselves ready please,\u0022 AL spoke calmly. Then, there was a loud \u003Cem\u003Ethud\u003C/em\u003E. The door of the module directly above them had just opened. Genenie gasped and dove behind the the the engine on the bottom of the module. Shelbus and Merbald had no choice but to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo guards climbed out of the module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m telling you!\u0022 Shelbus recognized the voice of the guard that had been arguing earlier that Hanland\u0027s forces must be ruthless. \u0022Those sand worms are real! I don\u0027t care how many expeditions didn\u0027t find any traces of them; one of them jumped out of the ground and knocked me out cold!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And I\u0027m telling you that you tripped and fell.\u0022 Another voice growled. \u0022You know as well as I do that those old low-quality rover pictures that people say are sandworms are just blurry geysers. There is no such thing as a Laythe sandworm.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... I saw it! I was attacked by one! Are you telling me that my word counts for nothing!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other guard sighed. \u0022Matlorf, you\u0027ve had a long day. You\u0027ve been up for nearly ten hours. Why don\u0027t you let me take the rest of your shift while you go get some sleep. In the morning, you\u0027ll see things more clearly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guards came around the side of the module, and Shelbus and the other two moved to stay out of sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No buts! As the resident medical officer, I am declaring you unfit for duty until you get some rest. Now, go to module two and...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, Shelbus tripped. He had been moving around the engine trying to keep out of sight, when his foot encountered a rock. He would have been able to correct for it, should have been able, but then Genenie bumped into him, causing him to fall, his helmet connecting squarely with the engine. A loud metallic clang pierced the silence of the night. \u003Cem\u003EOh, you\u0027ve done it now, Shelbus\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three of them sat there, motionless, completely frozen in fear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What was that?\u0022 The voice that had identified itself as the medical officer said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sandworms!\u0022 Matlorf said fearfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s not sandworms, Matlorf.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guards footsteps could be heard coming towards the module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It sounded like it came from under here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, a bright light flared in the darkness. One of the guards had a flashlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shelbus, move!\u0022 said AL. \u0022ALL OF YOU! GO!\u0022 Somehow, Al\u0027s quiet voice managed to convey the capital letters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruggling to gain traction in the sand, the three Kerbals stood and sprinted from under the colony, suddenly colliding with one of the surprised guards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus and Merbald toppled over into a heap with him, \u0022Genenie, go!\u0022 Merbald slowly stood and began to hobble after Genenie. Righting himself, Shelbus stood and began to run. But then, something collided with him from behind, knocking him to the ground and holding him there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Matlorf!\u0022 The voice of the medical officer roared in Shelbus\u0027s ear. \u0022Get the other two!\u0022 Shelbus struggled against the heavier kerbal\u0027s grip as he felt a knee being pressed into his back. \u0022The captain\u0027s going to want to talk to you.\u0022 He muttered. \u0022I knew that something was fishy when couldn\u0027t find...\u0022 Suddenly, there was a loud \u003Cem\u003Ethump\u003C/em\u003E, and the medical officer\u0027s voice cut off. The pressure was suddenly removed from his back as the guard fell into the sand. Shelbus extricated himself from under the medical officer\u0027s body. He stood and turned, prepared to defend himself against the other guard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, the guard just stood there his body silhouetted against the bright crescent of Jool. \u003Cem\u003ECome on!\u003C/em\u003E Shelbus thought, \u003Cem\u003EGet it over with! \u003C/em\u003EThen he noticed the rock in the guard\u0027s hand. And the second guard unconscious on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know who you are, and I don\u0027t why you\u0027re saving those two, either, but I don\u0027t like what\u0027s going on here.\u0022 Shelbus blinked. It was the kerbal that had been arguing earlier to let the prisoners live. Ludfurt, he thought his name was. The guard shook his head. \u0022These executions... I didn\u0027t sign up for this. I\u0027ll tell Matlorf and Ruben that your friends knocked them out. Don\u0027t expect anything like this from me again. Now, go! Before somebody shows up!\u0022 So Shelbus ran for the dropship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Quickly, Mr. Merbald,\u0022 Al sounded almost hurried as Shelbus helped the elderly kerbal hoist himself into the crew compartment of the Hanland dropship. \u0022Miss Genenie, please help Mr. Merbald secure himself in a harness. No, the top hook connects to... yes, like that. The dropship\u0027s crew compartments are not shielded, so it is necessary that you and Mr. Merbald are properly secured.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, Al, I know. Just go fly this thing.\u0022 Genenie affirmed while fumbling with her own harness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus ran to the cockpit boarding ladder. \u0022Al, are you sure that you want me to pilot this thing? We could get Merbald or Genenie over here and have them do it. I did fail my military flight test three times, after all.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Shelbus, I have a comprehensive file on every colonist, and I\u0027m well aware of your utter incompetence when it comes to piloting. However, you are familiar with the interior of aircraft, and did demonstrate that you could pilot in an at least rudimentary sense when you flew the Isprit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I also crashed the Isprit.\u0022 He muttered as he climbed into the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And that makes you much more qualified to fly than both Miss Genenie and Mr. Merbald.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, a shout came from the colony, and its lights flared up bright enough to challenge the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In any case, I do not think that you have time to ask either of them to take your place.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus hurriedly closed the canopy as he climbed into the cockpit. He looked down at the extensive control panel laid out in front of him. \u0022AL, I\u0027m not familiar with the layout, here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It does not exist in my data records, either. I suppose you must wing it, as the saying goes.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uhm, all right then. Fuel gauges, here. check. Altimeter, over here. Set. Flight controls, full range of motion... Auxiliary power, check. Electrical systems... on.\u0022 The aircraft\u0027s floodlights suddenly erupted from the nose. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img08.deviantart.net/3624/i/2015/066/f/d/floodlight__story_illustration_by_i_phillip-d8kuwl1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022floodlight__story_illustration_by_i_phillip-d8kuwl1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Kraken, AL. The last idiot in here left the floodlights on!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I can see that from here, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022 The entire colony was illuminated in piercing white light. \u0022It will certainly attract their attention. We must hurry, now. I do not see how to activate the engines.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a muffled \u003Cem\u003Ecrack\u003C/em\u003E from outside, and a white crack suddenly appeared in the canopy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think it\u0027s... like this.\u0022 Shelbus recognized the familiar whining of a spooling engine as he slowly pushed forward the thrust lever. \u0022VTOL engines are on, AL.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Excellent. Bring up the thrust slowly. I am uncertain what the maximum capabilities of these engines are, so do not put yourself into a tailspin because you tried to go up too fast.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Aye aye, Captain.\u0022 Shelbus pushed the throttle a bit farther and felt the craft gently lift off the ground. He carefully pivoted the aircraft so that Merbald and Genenie were facing away from the colony and slowly started to gain altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus winced as another crack appeared in the canopy. \u0022Yep, definitely time to get out of here.\u0022 Shelbus muttered as he diverted fuel to the main engines. \u0022Home free.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon, the colony was a pale dot behind him in the north, and Shelbus brought the engines down to cruising throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I think we did it, Al! WE DID IT!\u0022 Shelbus could barely contain his joy as he thrusted his fists into the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hands on the controls please, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mhm, AL... I hope Genenie and Merbald are ok back there. We did it, AL. We saved them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes we did, Mr. Shelbus. But do not lose focus. Our mission is not completed. The colony is still controlled by the Hanland\u0027s forces. However, I do not believe that the Hanland\u0027s forces intend to execute another coonist in the the near future. The only non-scientist remaining in the colony is Geofbas, whose knowledge of Halcyon\u0027s systems will likely protect him until Hanland\u0027s forces have learned enough to consider him unecessary. However, the Hanland forces have a significant scientific armada of their own, which could very well be on their way from Kerbin at this very moment.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You had to remind me of Kerbin. Hey, AL, do you think we can see Kerbin from here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus brought the dropship down to an attitude of 100 meters, which was the lowest he dared go as he turned back north.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative. It is currently located along the Kerbolar plain between the two brightest stars of the Kerduna constellation. The pale blue dot. Do you see it, Mr. Shelbus?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I see it. Home.

I heard him complaining quite a bit about his back after the landing.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Affirmative. Mr. Merbald is quite fine. I conducted a basic medical evaluation of both Miss Genenie and Mr. Merbald while you slept. The back pain was temporary and to be expected in a Kerbal of his age. Miss Genenie suffered from mild hunger, but was unsatisfied by the emergency consumable rations.

I told them that I was worried about explosions, and that it was safer to sleep away from the wreck. In reality, I simply wanted to speak with you.\u0022 He rotated his entire body in the sand so that he faced Shelbus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shelbus, I have concerns. I must assume that Hanland has intent to construct military colonies on Laythe, which would be detrimental to the strategic position of Spiritwolf\u0027s allies. The Hanland\u0027s forces will not willingly lose their hold on this system. The dropship is an essential tool if they wish to prepare Laythe for the arrival of new ships to expand their operations. They will not give it up easily. Now, the dropship has a nine person crew capacity. Assuming one is the pilot, and one the commander, they have at least seven trained, armed Kerbals. I believe that they have already begun searching for the dropship by now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You have a plan right? You\u0027re the smart one, AL.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Constant relocation is a possibility. However, it hinders my future plan.

And, Shelbus...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You cannot hide your identity from Miss Genenie and Mr. Merbald forever. It will be detrimental to the mission. You must confront them before the day ends and put the matter to rest. You must make them comfortable around you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course.\u0022 Shelbus said absently, \u0022And while I\u0027m at it, why don\u0027t I take on the Hanland\u0027s forces myself. And reconstruct Spiritwolf. And...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am being serious at this moment, Shelbus. Please.\u0022 There was a pause as AL refocused his lens. \u0022There can be no interior obstacles to my success, our success. Killing Gregford was your only option at the time. Shelbus, you had to kill Gregford, for the good of the colony. For the good of Kerbalkind, Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus sighed. Is that true, is that really true? There must have been something else I could have done. Anything else. AL, I\u0027m a murderer.

You can hold onto it for now, I don\u0027t think that I could carry much else.\u0022 Shelbus reached for the consumable resource compartment on the underside of AL228-Unit.

I permanently borrowed a medical kit from Mr. Gregford\u0027s buggy after detecting your vital signs.

Commanding Shelbus to attac was quite an ethical conundrum for Al to work through. \u0022Careful on this ladder Merbald,\u0022 said AL. \u0022Stay low and remain confined within the shadows.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AL, who\u0027s in that suit?

Right now, you must escort the prisoners to safety. In any case, you attacked him quickly enough that he may not even realize what had happened. Maintain your pace.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus continued forward, delicately stepping through the shadows, Merbald and Genenie never more than a meter behind him. Nearing the edge of the Colony, Shelbus became hopeful. \u003Cem\u003EWe might actually make it. Just a little further.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mr. Merbald, Miss Genenie, this is the most dangerous part of the rescue operation. Your clothing was not designed to insulate against cold water, so we cannot leave via the ocean. We must make an dash of approximately fifty meters to the Hanland dropship. The kerbal in this suit will follow my instructions to take control of the vessel and pilot us to safety.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... how do you know how to fly a Hanland dropship, AL?\u0022 Said Genenie as she squinted at the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I do not.\u0022 Al said calmly, \u0022I expect the kerbal in this suit to improvise when I cannot provide him with necessary instructions.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus turned around to look for guards. \u0022AL, the colony tower. A guard could be up there. He\u0027d have a clear view of us. And what about guards in the dropship? They won\u0027t leave it unguarded.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool\u0027s green glow provided just enough light for figures and movement to be seen in the darkness. AL observed the whole scenario from a hill a few kilometers across the channel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I detect no heat signatures in the tower, at the moment. I believe that is currently uninhabited. As for the dropship, I believe that there will be no more than one guard, as most of the dropship\u0027s forces will be sleeping in the more comfortable colony or focused on keeping the colonists confined to the colony. It is now or never, Mr. Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus crouched down preparing to sprint. \u0022Alright, make yourselves ready please,\u0022 AL spoke calmly. Then, there was a loud \u003Cem\u003Ethud\u003C/em\u003E. The door of the module directly above them had just opened. Genenie gasped and dove behind the the the engine on the bottom of the module. Shelbus and Merbald had no choice but to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo guards climbed out of the module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m telling you!\u0022 Shelbus recognized the voice of the guard that had been arguing earlier that Hanland\u0027s forces must be ruthless. \u0022Those sand worms are real! I don\u0027t care how many expeditions didn\u0027t find any traces of them; one of them jumped out of the ground and knocked me out cold!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And I\u0027m telling you that you tripped and fell.\u0022 Another voice growled. \u0022You know as well as I do that those old low-quality rover pictures that people say are sandworms are just blurry geysers. There is no such thing as a Laythe sandworm.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But... I saw it! I was attacked by one! Are you telling me that my word counts for nothing!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other guard sighed. \u0022Matlorf, you\u0027ve had a long day. You\u0027ve been up for nearly ten hours. Why don\u0027t you let me take the rest of your shift while you go get some sleep. In the morning, you\u0027ll see things more clearly.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guards came around the side of the module, and Shelbus and the other two moved to stay out of sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No buts! As the resident medical officer, I am declaring you unfit for duty until you get some rest. Now, go to module two and...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, Shelbus tripped. He had been moving around the engine trying to keep out of sight, when his foot encountered a rock. He would have been able to correct for it, should have been able, but then Genenie bumped into him, causing him to fall, his helmet connecting squarely with the engine. A loud metallic clang pierced the silence of the night. \u003Cem\u003EOh, you\u0027ve done it now, Shelbus\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three of them sat there, motionless, completely frozen in fear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What was that?\u0022 The voice that had identified itself as the medical officer said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sandworms!\u0022 Matlorf said fearfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s not sandworms, Matlorf.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guards footsteps could be heard coming towards the module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It sounded like it came from under here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, a bright light flared in the darkness. One of the guards had a flashlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shelbus, move!\u0022 said AL. \u0022ALL OF YOU! GO!\u0022 Somehow, Al\u0027s quiet voice managed to convey the capital letters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruggling to gain traction in the sand, the three Kerbals stood and sprinted from under the colony, suddenly colliding with one of the surprised guards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus and Merbald toppled over into a heap with him, \u0022Genenie, go!\u0022 Merbald slowly stood and began to hobble after Genenie. Righting himself, Shelbus stood and began to run. But then, something collided with him from behind, knocking him to the ground and holding him there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Matlorf!\u0022 The voice of the medical officer roared in Shelbus\u0027s ear. \u0022Get the other two!\u0022 Shelbus struggled against the heavier kerbal\u0027s grip as he felt a knee being pressed into his back. \u0022The captain\u0027s going to want to talk to you.\u0022 He muttered. \u0022I knew that something was fishy when couldn\u0027t find...\u0022 Suddenly, there was a loud \u003Cem\u003Ethump\u003C/em\u003E, and the medical officer\u0027s voice cut off. The pressure was suddenly removed from his back as the guard fell into the sand. Shelbus extricated himself from under the medical officer\u0027s body. He stood and turned, prepared to defend himself against the other guard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, the guard just stood there his body silhouetted against the bright crescent of Jool. \u003Cem\u003ECome on!\u003C/em\u003E Shelbus thought, \u003Cem\u003EGet it over with! \u003C/em\u003EThen he noticed the rock in the guard\u0027s hand. And the second guard unconscious on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I don\u0027t know who you are, and I don\u0027t why you\u0027re saving those two, either, but I don\u0027t like what\u0027s going on here.\u0022 Shelbus blinked. It was the kerbal that had been arguing earlier to let the prisoners live. Ludfurt, he thought his name was. The guard shook his head. \u0022These executions... I didn\u0027t sign up for this. I\u0027ll tell Matlorf and Ruben that your friends knocked them out. Don\u0027t expect anything like this from me again. Now, go! Before somebody shows up!\u0022 So Shelbus ran for the dropship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voyager55","CreatedById":70945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T00:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECHAPTER TEN\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Quickly, Mr. Merbald,\u0022 Al sounded almost hurried as Shelbus helped the elderly kerbal hoist himself into the crew compartment of the Hanland dropship. \u0022Miss Genenie, please help Mr. Merbald secure himself in a harness.

The only non-scientist remaining in the colony is Geofbas, whose knowledge of Halcyon\u0027s systems will likely protect him until Hanland\u0027s forces have learned enough to consider him unecessary.

It is just on the opposite side of the hill where the Isprit wreck resides.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus glanced over at the hill, where the charred black wreckage that had been the Isprit was half-buried in the sand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s why our rendezvous point was so close the Isprit wreck. For the parts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your Isprit wreck.\u0022 AL interjected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, yeah... I ran out of fuel. Stop rubbing it in.\u0022 Shelbus glanced over at the wreck again. \u0022Why didn\u0027t they just sleep in the Isprit?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I told them that I was very uncertain about the amount damage to the dropship. I told them that I was worried about explosions, and that it was safer to sleep away from the wreck. In reality, I simply wanted to speak with you.\u0022 He rotated his entire body in the sand so that he faced Shelbus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shelbus, I have concerns. I must assume that Hanland has intent to construct military colonies on Laythe, which would be detrimental to the strategic position of Spiritwolf\u0027s allies. The Hanland\u0027s forces will not willingly lose their hold on this system. The dropship is an essential tool if they wish to prepare Laythe for the arrival of new ships to expand their operations. They will not give it up easily. Now, the dropship has a nine person crew capacity. Assuming one is the pilot, and one the commander, they have at least seven trained, armed Kerbals. I believe that they have already begun searching for the dropship by now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You have a plan right? You\u0027re the smart one, AL.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Constant relocation is a possibility. However, it hinders my future plan. And we may very well be spotted or heard if we continue to activate the engines frequently. Our best option at the moment is to remain where we are. And, Shelbus...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You cannot hide your identity from Miss Genenie and Mr. Merbald forever. It will be detrimental to the mission. You must confront them before the day ends and put the matter to rest. You must make them comfortable around you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course.\u0022 Shelbus said absently, \u0022And while I\u0027m at it, why don\u0027t I take on the Hanland\u0027s forces myself. And reconstruct Spiritwolf. And...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I am being serious at this moment, Shelbus. Please.\u0022 There was a pause as AL refocused his lens. \u0022There can be no interior obstacles to my success, our success. Killing Gregford was your only option at the time. Shelbus, you had to kill Gregford, for the good of the colony. For the good of Kerbalkind, Shelbus.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus sighed. Is that true, is that really true? There must have been something else I could have done. Anything else. AL, I\u0027m a murderer. I murdered Genenie\u0027s love... don\u0027t you understand, AL?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Perhaps there was a different option, but you did what was required. You saved Genenie, Merbald, and everyone else. And we are going to save them all again, Shelbus. But first, you must alleviate any issues between you and Genenie and Mr. Merbald.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright... alright... This won\u0027t end well though, AL.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbus set his helmet down next to the ladder and started trekking off towards the shelter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ENOTE, illustrations are only available on page one inside the spoiler condensed chapters. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T14:57:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Voyager55\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
