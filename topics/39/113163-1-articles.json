For longer-duration spaceflight or planetary exploration stays, however, packaged space food should be complemented by fresh provisions, both for psychological support and nutritional balance reasons. Various methods can be used to accomplish this:\n\n- Small orbital stations, planetary outposts and interplanetary transfer vessels should have at least one culinary herb garden; recommended species include pepper cactus, marrowort, citrella, saltleaf, yellow clover and firewhisker\n- Larger stations and ground bases should have at least one hydroponics garden, to grow fresh fruit and vegetables that would otherwise be unsuitable for pre-processing into space food, such as Greenleaf and tomatoes for salads\n- Fresh food, including wheat-based breads, should be provided periodically via unmanned resupply vessels. Such items must be consumed within three days after the arrival of the resupply vessel, to minimize storage/preservation requirements.\n- Kerbalnauts may elect to receive care packages from family/relatives back on Kerbin, which may contain provisions otherwise not in the approved items list. Care package items must still be demonstrated to survive the rigors of launch, be easy to consume using limited eating utensils, and produce little waste or crumbs.\n\n* * *\n\n**5.0 Acknowledgements**\n\n- bea\\_bear (reddit): Krill cocktail, Kumkauts, Blomphs (Kerbal mushrooms)\n- DuoDex: Fouch\u00E9 pastry **[FULL BACKSTORY](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026tab=comments#comment-2021126)**\n- egreSS \u0026 SilverFox (#kspmodders): Blapmip (Kerbal pork)\n- KamikazeF0X: Chestnut spread, yogurt\n- KSK: Prickleberries, Sapwood, Djan chips, Kaya Jerky (Kerbal yak), Luffa-eye peppers, Herbs, White Beans, Greenleaf, Creva (Kerbal ibex), Tubers, improved version of \u0022Junk\u0022 originally proposed by Geschosskopf **FULL BACKSTORIES (****[1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026tab=comments#comment-2007429)****,** **[2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026tab=comments#comment-2013779)****,** **[3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026page=2\u0026tab=comments#comment-2040298)****)**\n- Legendary Emu: Wolys sauce, Sukaree (spice mix) **FULL BACKSTORIES (****[1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026page=3\u0026tab=comments#comment-2235826), [2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026page=3\u0026tab=comments#comment-2259092))**\n- Mad Rocket Scientist: Applesauce, dissolving powdered condiments such as salt and paper in oil-based liquids/gels, Latok (Meat from the Kerbal snake-like reptile Lotos **[FULL BACKSTORY](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026page=2\u0026tab=comments#comment-2040204)**\n- MedwedianPresident: Bleek (Kerbal lamb) **** [FULL BACKSTORY](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113163-space-professionals-institute-of-culinary-excellence-spice/\u0026page=3\u0026tab=comments#comment-2258392)\n- NephilimCRT (reddit): PB\u0026J\n- waterlubber: Cheese Noms (restylized as Cheez Nomz) and Kubrikos\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-25T23:01:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2018 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**\n  \nMoved lists of items into spoilers to reduce screen real estate"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T02:52:13Z","Content":"I just read this, pepper needs to be suspended in oil so it doesn\u0027t fly around and cause a sneezing fit.

Prickleberries are a versatile crop which can be eaten as a fresh fruit, made into preserves (prickleberry jam is an excellent accompaniment to many cold meats and cheeses) or processed into a number of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. First pressing prickleberry juice is normally consumed as a fresh juice, whilst the second pressing is laid down in specially prepared wooden barrels for up to a year. The juice absorbs tannins and other phytochemicals from the barrels, which act both as flavourings and natural preservatives. Third pressing juice and pomace is typically used to make prickleberry cider, a light, sparkling drink of no more than 3% abv.\n\nSapwood\n\nWild sapwood trees originated in the Kerbin rainforest and Kerbal scientists believe that they became insectivorous as an evolutionary adaptation to wet, nutrient leached soils. Long parallel grooves in their trunks exude a sweet viscous sap which traps insects and gradually carries them down to the base of the tree where they decompose and are absorbed by a network of near-surface roots. Sapwoods have long been cultivated by kerbals and in the equatorial and mid-latitudes of Kerbin they are very nearly as ubiquitous as the Kerm. Domesticated sapwoods are larger than their wild cousins and less dependent on insect consumption. This is partly due to centuries of selective breeding but mostly because they are grown in Kerm enhanced soils.\n\nAlthough sapwood sap can be fermented and then distilled into a strong liquor, similar to a Terran rum, this is not a particularly popular drink on Kerbin. The vast bulk of harvested sap is cleaned of insects and then dried to make a sticky, toffee like substance, beloved of kerbals and kerblets alike. The dried sap is also used to make a number of extremely popular non-alcoholic cordials, which are consumed with water, sparkling water or milk. Two notable specialist cordials are smoky sapwood (produced in old-fashioned wood fired evaporating pans) and wild sapwood (colloquially referred to as \u0027crunchy sapwood\u0027) which is harvested, insects and all, from wild sapwood trees. \n\n*Djan* chips. \n\nPopular snack food across most of Kerbin and equivalent to the Terran tortilla chip. Traditionally served as a street food in a twist of paper but could be more robustly packaged for spaceflight. Normally served with various spice dustings, SPICE chefs have experimented with applying the spices in a oil-based liquid and then second baking the chips.\n\nKaya jerky\n\nStrips of dried or smoked kaya meat. Kaya are indigenous to the northern reaches of Kerbin and somewhat resemble the Terran yak. Early kerbal settlers relied on them for everything from food to needles and thread but in modern times they are still prized for their luxurious wool and tasty meat.\n\nLuffa-eye peppers\n\nLuffa are a very distant cousin to modern kerbals. In evolutionary terms they diverged from kerbals far longer ago than, for example, the great apes diverged from hominids on Earth. Six limbed, large eyed and long necked, they inhabit some of the coastal areas on Kerbin. Luffa-eye peppers resemble a small Terran bell pepper or a large Terran chili pepper but when properly ripe they are sweet rather than fiery.\n\nHerbs\n\nCrew members on *Endurance*, the first long duration kerballed space station experimented with growing herbs in zero-gravity, which has since become a tradition of the Kerbal Space Program. Having living plants aboard their spacecraft is thought to be psychologically beneficial in general and herbs provide the very tangible benefit of making space food far more palatable than it might otherwise be. Typical kerbal herbs include: pepper cactus, marrowort, citrella, saltleaf, yellow clover and firewhisker.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T12:22:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:20:37Z","Content":"Excellent suggestions and backstories, KSK - I\u0027ve added just about every single one of them to the list.\n\nI\u0027ll also create a new subsection regarding fresh food (such as the growing of herbs and vegetables) in hydroponics, and how that relates to crew provisions."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T00:30:50Z","Content":"You might to have: \u0022Corned beef sandwiches Hey!

A classic white bean stew consists of white beans, onion and mixed mushrooms, stewed with marrowort for flavouring and served garnished with yellow clover. However each Regionality and in fact, almost every village, tends to have their own version of the classic stew. The one thing almost all of them have in common is a lack of meat as an ingredient.\n\nWhite beans are a hardy crop that grow well in a range of conditions, including very wet soils. Experiments with growing them under zero-g conditions suggested that they should be emininently suitable for the space programme although they were originally rejected as being a relatively high residue food. In the words of Geneney \u0027Gene\u0027 Kerman: \u0022I do not believe that white beans are compatible with our current air recycling and sanitation equipment.\u0022 The rise of hydroponic modules on larger orbital and off-world bases has prompted a cautious re-evaluation of this stance.\n\nGreenleaf\n\nAnother crop that has only really found widespread acceptance in the space programme with the rise of hydroponic farming, the greenleaf plant is a small, compact bush, resembling an oversized Terran lettuce, with large, dark green leaves each supported by a central fleshy stem. For cooking purposes, the stems are normally removed and used separately - relatively few dishes use the whole leaf. \n\nThe flat parts of the leaf have a mild peppery taste and are popular as a fresh salad, wilted in butter as a side vegetable or baked in layers with stewed vegetables and meats. Greenleaf rolls are a common alternative to sandwiches, consisting of a single greanleaf half, wrapped around a savoury filling. Egg (scrambled or boiled and chopped) and greenleaf rolls are a common breakfast dish. The stems are a versatile foodstuff that may, for example, be eaten fresh as a salad vegatable, boiled and served in a cheese sauce or dipped in breadcrumbs and deep fried. The latter are a popular bar snack and appetiser across Kerbin. \n\nGreenleaf has a mildly laxative effect when consumed in excess, although this only tends to be a problem in very young kerbals with their proportionally lower body mass.\n\nCreva\n\nThe nearest Terran equivalent to the creva is probably the ibex, although creva tend to be larger and heavier set. Their tough but flavourful meat is normally used in stews or sliced thinly and baked in layers with various fruits. Both meals are eminently suitable for freeze drying and creva stew wet-packs were a favourite meal for the early Kerbonauts.\n\nTubers\n\nTubers of various shapes, sizes and colours are grown and consumed in most parts of Kerbin and freeze dried tubers seemed like an obvious base for space rations. Unfortunately, in the words of space programme chef, Derny Kerman, early experiments: \u0022were a horrible slop with awful consistency and all the taste of wet plaster.\u0022 Kerbonaut Sherfel Kerman (navigator on *Pioneer 1*, the first circum-munar voyage) suggested adding dried pepper cactus to add fibre and absorb water, which turned out to be a huge improvement. The resultant mixture did eventually prove to be a staple ration pack on the early mid-range spaceflights.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T07:53:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 07:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T23:35:36Z","Content":"Ah KSK, you\u0027ve done it again ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Added your suggestions to the list."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T08:22:32Z","Content":"R: Pruke meat:\n\nPruke is a furry, flightless bird-like animal found in the northern areas of kerbin.
