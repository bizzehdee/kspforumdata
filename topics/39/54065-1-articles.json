This thread will be about my attempt of the Duna Outpost Mission Architecture Challenge by sturmstiger (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/31510-Duna-Permanent-Outpost-Mission-Architecture-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/31510-Duna-Permanent-Outpost-Mission-Architecture-Challenge\u003C/a\u003E). My original attempt at the challenge failed, as my kerbal carrying vessel could not safely land on Duna, leaving them orbiting the sun without enough supplies to be rescued. I took this as an opportunity to re-start and improve on my last attempt. So, to bridge the gap, I wrote this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Impact;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EPrologue - All a dream\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElming Kerman awoke with a start, in a cold sweat. \u0022This bed is far too nice for a hab module...\u0022 He thought. That\u0027s when it hit him. Project Irata wasn\u0027t due to start for a long time. He wasn\u0027t in space, in a vessel out of fuel circling the Sun with diminishing supplies, he was in his bed in the astronaut complex back on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Get yourself together, Elming. You were just announced mission commander yesterday and you\u0027re already thinking of everything that could possibly go wrong.\u0022 He muttered to himself. Suddenly, Elming\u0027s door burst open and Donner Kerman nearly lept through the door. Donner then said \u0022Rise and shine, Elming! The early kerbal gets the rocket! ...Or something!\u0022 almost more enthusiastically than kerbally possible. \u0022Oh right, and of course my flight engineer is Donner... Of course. I\u0027ll have to get used to him I guess.\u0022 Elming thought to himself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Mitzer and Hadfurt are already down at the training center waiting for you! Cmon!\u0022 Donner was fresh out of flight school, and had just enrolled into the space program. No one really had any idea why he was chosen, his only notable attribute was his complete and utter enthusiasm. Or at least if there was anything else, it was drowned out. Elming, however, was a fairly seasoned kerbonaut who had spent time on space stations and was part of a Kethane operation for a time. It\u0027s not that he\u0027s a grouch, he just focuses on the task at hand and is fairly easily annoyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh Kod why...\u0022 Elming thought as he crawled out of bed. \u0022Our first day of training for Project Irata! Aren\u0027t you excited?\u0022 Donner exclaimed. \u0022You have no idea...\u0022 Elming muttered. \u0022Well, I\u0027ll see you down there!\u0022 Donner said before excitedly running out of the room. \u0022Why... Why him? I would\u0027ve taken ANYONE but him... I\u0027d even put up with Jebediah and his crazy antics... Too bad \u0022The Trio\u0022 retired...\u0022 He thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject Irata is a very ambitious endeavor, nothing this groundbreaking has been devised since the first Mun landings. That was a long time ago, but lack of funding and other political nonsense had slowed the progress of the space program. All that had happened since was some stations and kethane operations in the Kerbin system, and some probes around Duna, Eve and Jool. Project Irata\u0027s aim was to prove that there was still much to be learned in outer space. The heads of the space program hope to accomplish this by studying many different places of Duna and Ike. To help facilitate this, two kerbal scientists, Mitzer and Hadfurt, were also being trained for space operations. It was going to be only 10 days before the first unmanned payload would be launched into orbit to take advantage of the transfer window. They could only get two launches in, so it would mostly be infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the same, Elming, Donner, Mitzer and Hadfurt would all be heading to Duna at the next transfer window, and they knew it. The KSC was bustling with activity to get ready. There were schedules to plan, components to design, and rockets to be built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all I got for now.

I know I\u0027ve been hyper and annoying. It\u0027s just been my dream to go to space, and as soon as they announced Project Irata, Duna. I know you\u0027ve been there. Sure, maybe I wasn\u0027t acting mature then. But I will try now. There\u0027s a reason they made me your flight engineer, you know. I\u0027m not stupid. Now let me de-orbit the booster, and you can set up the rendezvous.\u0022 The 3 other kerbals were taken aback. \u0022Okay Donner, you\u0027re right. I guess I haven\u0027t been fair to you. None of us have. We\u0027ve all felt that way, we just didn\u0027t think of it that way. I never thought I\u0027d say this, but I\u0027ve glad you\u0027re on this crew Donner. Now let\u0027s get moving!\u0022 Elming replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir!\u0022 Donner said. He was glad he finally had the respect of Elming.
