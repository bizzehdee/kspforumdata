Im Lolmeister here on ze forum but normally im known as Veran. And to be quite frank I dont really play KSP. I know shame on me ^^ However my good friend does. So what am I doing here? So before the cries call out for me to be banished on the mun or somewhere else much more horrible let me tell you a quick story. \n\nMe and two of my buddies created a youtube channel some years ago. We posted regular bad quality content for awhile. We stopped as we were burned out and then couple years later we renamed our channel and tried to do a reboot with better quality however this time extremly much more casual and really just post what we wanted to. We also deleted all our old content. The quality part didnt take of too good because of some rusty/rookie mistakes. And then some problems for me to upload stuff in HD happened. That led our channel to where it is now. A casual channel posting what they like and because we are 3 people we have/and will have a large array of different games on our channel.\n\nSo to the POINT my friend known simply as 707 on the channel started a series recently where he shows of some of his creations in KSP in HD so its good quality. To be frank I dont know what more will come myself because he has spent hundreds of hours in the workshop of KSP what he has done there is a mystery even to myself. Right now he has showed of some of his warplanes he created of IRL warplanes. I recommend you check out the series. The rest of the content on the channel will not be everyones cup of tea but you dont have to watch it. I dont mind if you just follow our channel for the KSP series because we are grateful for anyone who takes interest in anything we do. Thank you for your time ^^\n\nLink to the playlist:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLCb6fpgAdGxx6r2_YaHlNytDepM7XUB-H\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLCb6fpgAdGxx6r2_YaHlNytDepM7XUB-H\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\nAs an example watch the first video of the series:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1iiAMzSX7k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n epM7XUB-H\u0026index=1"}]}
