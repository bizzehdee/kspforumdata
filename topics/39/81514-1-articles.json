Everything is calculated during the mission (except a few things like the position of the deorbit burn, the required delta-v to get back from the Mun to Kerbin, but I kinda failed on both of this, I didn\u0027t remembered them properly =)) ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry for not explainig what I\u0027m doing during the video, but I had no viewers (I guess most of the people enjoy 20 hours north pole expeditions, not this) and I didn\u0027t wanted to ... contaminate the highlight with my voice. =))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial plan was to land it on the helipad, but I had a few problems during the mission (got into a retrograde orbit around Kerbin after I escaped the Mun and wasted like 400m/s on this, while orbiting Kerbin I entered the atmosphere by mistake, wasted like 300m/s on this too and it\u0027s hard in general to be efficient while flying from the cockpit), but the deorbit burn was also a little off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try it again some other time and maybe I\u0027ll also explain what I\u0027m doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
