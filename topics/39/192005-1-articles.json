Jeb swore under his breath, reaching for the translation controls. He glared at the altimeter as it counted down alarmingly quickly, the rate needle wavering as it crept towards zero.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Smooth landing, Jeb,\u0022 Gene\u0027s voice came through the speaker, an echo lightlagged to absurdity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJeb cackled, one hand still on the translation stick as he keyed the transmit button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Smooth as silk. See you soon.\u0022 Jeb\u0027s voice was overlaid with alarms and the mad enthusiasm unique to kerbal pilots.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene sighed and pushed himself back from the desk in his chair. \u0022You\u0027re sure there\u0027s no chance he survived?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nWernher shook his head. \u0022Our models show a full breakup at that impact velocity, and the crater ejecta analysis from DRESat agrees. No debris larger than thirty centimeters. No disturbance since the impact, either.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nGene turned to Wernher. \u0022At least it was quick.

Close to a hundred kerbs in their dress whites stood, shoulder to shoulder. At the end of the room, on a table draped with a blue cloth, lay a helmet. Its faceplate was painted with a likeness of Jeb\u0027s face, the near-opaque visor raised.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022\u2026May the kraken spare his soul.\u0022 Walt reached forward and flicked the visor down, the crinkle of his hazmat suit the only sound after the snap of the visor.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSilence reigned in the cafeteria for almost fifteen seconds before the door at the back flew open, bashed by a cart heavily-laden with snacks. A kerbal hung from the handle at its back as it coasted to a halt in the center of the room. Plastered across the kerb\u0027s face was an unmistakable grin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022I brought the snacks, what\u0027d I miss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerballingSmasher","CreatedById":195689,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-29T21:44:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHA!
