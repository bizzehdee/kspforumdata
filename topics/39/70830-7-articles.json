Ever since she and Bob had returned from Jebediah\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s old base, Bob had been arguing non-stop with Bill, and making no progress, from the sounds of it. Bill seemed to have relapsed into the same counter-argument he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d been using ten minutes ago and the two were making no progress. Shaking her head, she turned her attention back to the mail she was sorting, shifting in her uncomfortable small folding chair. Evidently the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Personal Assistant to Bob Kerman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 did not warrant a desk of her own.

Still, despite it all, she didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really mind this job. Sometimes she would catch herself thinking about getting back into the field, but that encounter with those CKFN agents was enough action for her for a good while.

One is the engineering complexity. Serial staging is remarkably simple you know, as it simply places one stage on top of the other, and decoupling the two is trivial. This new method takes a great deal of knowledge in how stages attached to the side of other stages behave when detached, something we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve only been able to analyze recently due to the [i]Uranus[/i]\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 SRBs. Also, we integrated fuel lines into our simulation, a relatively new technology which allows us to actually pump fuel from tank to tank. We didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have those when the engineers were starting out building the [i]Aether[/i] rockets!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis all seemed to make sense to Bill.

Fuel tanks drain the outer tanks first, then they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re detached, and the process continues, keeping the central core full of fuel.

One, the CKFN sees our technology has outclassed theirs and spends time rushing to catch up. This diverts time from their inevitable Mun mission. Two, this makes the USKK look strong, and the CKFN weak, something which Parliament absolutely adores. Thus, even the most die-hard factions in government will be inclined to allow us to continue, so long as we continue to show off how much better USKK rocketry is than the competition. And three, this puts us farther along the way for developing for a Munar mission, as we have the launcher design completed, and by demonstrating the size of payloads it can carry to orbit, we simply have to design a crew carrier and lander which will fit this design.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell said, Joli!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D Bob said as she finished her speech, clapping her on the shoulder. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis design will be the saviour of the Space Program yet!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt [i]might[/i] be the saviour,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D corrected Bill. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe neither have a working design nor a payload to show it off.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u009D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBob glanced at Jeb. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWell, we may have an answer to that.
