Beyond that of the commander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing happens during launch? During the ascension? During orbital maneuvers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has to be a clear point of something or another happening. Otherwise, the whole thing falls flat, truthfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Mission Control, this is the Command Tower, we are preparing the rocket for launch, stand by.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The radio buzzes off. Bill the Second and Bob the Second sat in their chairs, a little apprehensive. Bill and Bob were named after their fathers, who also were Kerbonauts in the famed Kerbal Space Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022I hope we don\u0027t crash again,\u0022 Bob said, a hint of fear in his voice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Well, they did put \u003Cem\u003Ehim\u003C/em\u003E into the commander\u0027s chair. Again,\u0022 replied Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Pipe it you two, I\u0027m feeling rather... sane today,\u0022 chimed in the Kerbal sitting below their seats. Wearing a special pin on his shirt, inside the suit, Jebediah the Second sat at the controls, apprehensive about their newest mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To him, it seemed like every mission they were ever on ended in explosions or crashes; in reality, it was usually his fault. Oversteering, overthrottling, or just plain being a little loopy - whatever the reason, it was just his way of doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Unfortunately, this also ended up costing the KSP lots and lots of Krebits. So, in today\u0027s mission - a simple interstellar burn from Kerbin to Duna, inside the \u003Cem\u003EArmes\u003C/em\u003E - they added a little \u0022assistance\u0022 to avoid any disasters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Mission Control, this is the Tower. Prepare for lift-off in...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u002210... 9... 8... 7...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A high-pitched whine filled the cockpit of the \u003Cem\u003EArmes\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00226... 5... 4...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00223 - igniting rockets.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The systems within the cockpit went ablaze, indicating all systems nominal and clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00222... 1... LIFTOFF.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With a shudder, the \u003Cem\u003EArmes\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s solid rocket boosters ignited; the throttle underneath Jebediah II\u0027s hand pitched straight out, and the shuttle lifted, the docking clamps on either side of the core of the external booster tank detaching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As the Kerbals inside the Control Tower watched on, the \u003Cem\u003EArmes\u003C/em\u003E lifted beautifully and cleanly through the atmosphere, clearing 10,000 meters easily before the SRBs detached from the main core. Four external rockets also ignited as part of the staging process, and the shuttle began to shoot up, faster and faster and faster still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A technician watching the readings proclaimed, \u0022We\u0027ve cleared 20,000 meters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Better than last time,\u0022 remarked the head of the Control Tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u002255 kilometers!\u0022 exclaimed Bill II. \u0022We\u0027re finally going to make it!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As the shuttle passed 85,000 meters, the external fuel tank finally burned out, the external booster tanks having detached and plummeted to Kerbin a couple of minutes ago. With a *shh-\u003Cstrong\u003Eponk\u003C/strong\u003E!* the tank detached from the \u003Cem\u003EArmes\u003C/em\u003E shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The technician said, \u0022We have separation of the booster core. Apoapsis at 200,000 meters\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The head nodded his head, and picked up his radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With a click, he said, \u0022Mission Control, this is the Control Tower. All systems nominal. Begin orbital burn 35 seconds before apo.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Roger that,\u0022 replied a slightly grumpy, but secretly excited Jeb II, miffed that he\u0027d been replaced this time by an autopilot system. The radio clicked off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At the height of the orbiting path, the main rockets on the rear of the shuttle roared to life, a fiery inferno of heat, noise, and destructive beauty. As the seconds passed, the fuel burned lower and lower in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just one minute after igniting, the rockets shut off; the cockpit filled with silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bob II picked up a tape recorder, clicked it on, and spoke:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022This is Bill II of the Kerbal Space Shuttle \u003Cem\u003EArmes\u003C/em\u003E. As of May 3rd, 1234, at 7:25 A.M., we have entered a stable orbit of 200 kilometers by 201 kilometers around the planet Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The Control Tower was filled with excitement as, over their intercoms, and the speakers throughout the Tower, filled with the voice of the young Kerbonaut inside their shuttle. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022We will begin our transfer burn within 20 minutes, when our window of transfer opens. Our destination, the planet Duna.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022What now?\u0022 inquired the ecstatic Bob to his childhood friend and fellow Kerbonaut Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jeb replied, \u0022What now? More like, what next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022What next is, we begin colonization of the stars themselves, my friends!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bill happily replied, \u0022Let\u0027s not get ahead of ourselves, Jeb!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....wow. That was more fun than I thought it would be. XD That\u0027s what I get from ADD, though, a lot of fun time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m really not trying to rain down on you, Music. I\u0027m trying to help out! And, with a little more time put into it, and a little patience, you can write wonderfully! Your premise was great - as I showed by being able to, rather easily, expand upon it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey! If you ever need to show me something that you wanna post, PM me. Maybe I can help you write.... I don\u0027t want to say \u0022BETTER\u0022, because that implies that you need to get better. xP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I can help you write a little more fluently, or however you wanna say it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, excellent premise. That\u0027s the joy of writing, though. A good premise can become a great little tale, or even a novel if you write long and hard enough, haha! ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, and have a good day!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Machre\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
