He finally came up with and idea, fly to Proxima Centauri! He packed a super kraken drive spaceplane with repair kits, and wore a jetpack with a proto canon. The launch crew pulled his plane to the runway, and he turned on the kraken drive. He hurtled forward and made it to orbit in 20 seconds, a world record! He extended his orbit so that he transferred to KerBal\u2019s sphere of influence, before extending it even more to enter Proxima Centauri\u2019s sphere of influence. He burned retrograde to try and slow down. \u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont size=\u00224\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003EHowever, he crashed straight into Proxima Centauri A.

After a few hours, he found some copper and iron. He started to use some salvaged bits of the ship, and the copper to make a switch and radio transmitter for morse code. He used the ship\u2019s antenna and powered it up.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont size=\u00224\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003ENothing happened at first, but then it exploded, he had connected the solar array backwards. Jeb was devastated. Now he had no antenna, no transmitter, and he was running low on space snax, the food he had brought. Suddenly he heard a rocket engine, \u201CCould it be another kerbal?\u201D he thought. The rocket flew by and he realized that it was a space pirate.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont size=\u00224\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003EHe armed his proto cannon and got ready to dodge, but no bullet came. Instead the space pirate just circled the planet, had they not detected him? Jeb was not sure what to do, if he stayed still, he would be safe, but he needed the radio transmitter from that ship.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont size=\u00224\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003EEventually he decided to blast the pirate ship\u2019s engine the next time it came around. But before it came into view, he heard landing engines from behind him. He was seen! Jeb turned around expecting to see robots or turrets, but instead he saw a kerbal. This kerbal was like no other kerbal Jeb had ever seen. He was tall, and had a very large, funny looking head. Jeb stepped back, expecting to see a blaster, but instead the kerbal slowly walked toward him.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cfont size=\u00224\u0022 style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003EJeb took another step back and asked,\u201DWho are you?\u201D The kerbal replied in a robotic voice,\u201DAre you Jebadiah Kerman?\u201D Jeb said,\u201DYes\u2026\u201D Suddenly the space pirate pulled out a blaster and jumped to the side. Jeb leaped into the air and started shooting at the pirate, but in a flash, it was gone. He heard more engines, but this time it was Bob Kerman, Jeb\u2019s best friend! Bob jumped out of his rocket and said in his funny voice, \u201DHey Jeb!\u201D Jebadiah was speechless, \u201CHow did you\u2026 what\u2026 no way!!!
