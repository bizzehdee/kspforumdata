The probe was about the size of two Kerbals stacked head on head, covered in radiation hardend golden insulation, and dozens of tiny scientific instruments, many nolonger functioning. Three weathered solar panels, fading with age, provided the power for the small probe faced the sun wearily. The faded-yet flamboyant and proud colors of blue, white, and red were barely visible on the craft as it hurled past the orange-red planet at kilometers per second. The solar wind from the sudden storm during the probe\u0027s trek around Eve did most of the damage-and comisic radiation, the nemisis of Kerbal spaceflight, did the rest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9EAzYi5.png\u0022 alt=\u00229EAzYi5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small odd dark object tightly held onto the bottom of the Deep Sky Five. The surface probe of the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeep Sky Five\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E was mostly intact. Mostly. Radiation and solar storms had fried mst of the onboard equipment, and a corrupt contractor had caused a partial failure in one of the solar panels. But the mission was holding up, just as the controllers back at KSC wanted it to. The little lander, the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeep Red Planet\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, or \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDRP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, as it had fondly been known by researchers, was to perform surface studies while it\u0027s mothership performed orbital surveys while orbiting dozens of kilometers above. It was the only part of the spacecraft that would land. The probe was now a mere one million kilometers from the surface of it\u0027s target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom here, Duna looked like a large round grapefruit. The probe faced the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrusters began to fire on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDeep Sky Five\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, following out the pre-programmed commands they had been trained for all their lives. Then they fell silent, as the probe began it\u0027s quick descent toward Duna. The time came. The alignments where correct. Several explosive bolts planted in the connection between the lander and the orbiter fired, releasing small puffs of Kerbin-air that had been trapped for years inside the craft. They quickly dispersed and dissappeared into the void as the lander slipped away from the probe, pushed off by a slight (but pre-programmed) nudge from the aerobraking shield. Now on it\u0027s own, the orbiter re-adjusted it\u0027s orbit, and the thrusters fell silent for the last time. The lander probe, which had clung so tightly an faithfully during the transit, was now a mere dot in the far distance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/OqqneDe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OqqneDe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OqqneDe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander was not finished yet. Swinging toward the night side of Duna, it braked with the last of it\u0027s monopropellant, and began to aerobrake in the atmosphere before landing. The altitude went low. The temperatures soared. Hurling across the Dunaian landscape at orbital velocities, a bright streak raced across the skies of Duna, heading toward the dusty surface. It\u0027s cameras snapped widly at every detail, and prepared to upload the data to the orbiter over ahead. The craft passed into the radio shadow of Duna. Twelve hundred thousand meters from the surface, the lander tasted it\u0027s first impression of Duna, a stray dust cloud in the high atmosphere. It kept going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8ZTIqPO.png\u0022 alt=\u00228ZTIqPO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the craft hurled into the atmosphere of Duna, the parachute began to deploy, slowling down it\u0027s descent as the air around it thickened. With the lower gravity and the large parachute, landing would be softer than expected, a true break for the battered spacecraft. Onvoard the descent module, the surface instruments went online for the first time, recording every number, every little piece of data, and every last image of the scarred surface. The lander kept with it\u0027s constant battery of telemetry data to the orbiter, which relayed it back to KSC. Two hours after landing, the batteries were completely exhausted, and the solar panels went back online. Recieving no more data from the lander, the orbiter turned toward Kerbin and relayed the data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourty minutes later, the results came in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome were quite unexpected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pkWDRnc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pkWDRnc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-23T20:19:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2013 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xzxvrx","CreatedById":57321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T04:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks nice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHail probe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Danish_Savage","CreatedById":49194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T10:52:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother mental exercise:\u003Cem\u003E Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one, Don\u0027t let him abandon this one.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, you write really well, and it\u0027s really a letdown getting fond of a story that then just stops.

The craft, the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunshot IV\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E was a typical craft of its class, a small service module and a capsule. A couple weeks of constant micrometeorite bombardment and comisic radiation had caused several dents in the hardened insulation and armor that the ship sported. Onboard, operations went as planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBilly-Bobfred went through his EVA checklist. He secured his helmet and comms headset, tightened the bolts, and stuffed a large oxygen tank into his EVA pack, and connect it to his suit. The airlock was cramped, a small chamber in the side of the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunshot IV\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E command capsule, and he stuggled to keep upright. Beside him, Jebediah himself was also struggling with glove, and managed to get it on and secured after a few tries. He grinned, and tapped his helmet and gave Bobfred an enthusastic thumbs up. He was ready for action. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slow ritual was checks was oddly comforting to both the astronauts. It really did help relax them and take their minds off the task ahead. Bobfred clasped on tightly to the foot restraints inside the small chamber as Jebediah accessed the keypad for the airlock controls, and moved the several controls, setting the Depressirzation Adjustment button to 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022EV58, we are go. Bobfred, be careful out there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Going?

Jebediah grabbed a handrail then hopped out of the airlock, steadying himself with his EVA pack and pushing the hatch the rest of the way open. Bobfred followed, messing around with the controls on his pack. His heart rate hit 120%, and a message to calm down appeared on his HUI. Jeb paused, and looked at him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022First time out here, huh? You\u0027re a spaceship now, and a rather quiet one by standards. Don\u0027t act silly. You ready for the repairs and retrival? This is going to be a sort one.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i54dp4S.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i54dp4S.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobfred nodded silently. Jeb was the Mission Commander here, and one of the Munwalker\u0027s during the Munshot programme, had served as a Major General in the Airforce, a Senator in the Parliament, and the Deputy Administrator of the NAA until he was re-transferred to become a astronaut under his own command, while he was just a rookie-a Mission Specialist tagging along on the lunar orbital expedition. If he was a Prince, then Jebediah was a god-king, the pinnacle of achievements that every astronaut could ever hope to become. It would be best to follow his advice. Jebediah was whistling cheerfully now as he moved around with his jetpack, and opened his toolbox-a large chamber on the side of his pack. A screwdriver floated out, and he grabbed it in time, and set about fixing the comm dish as Bobfred watched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What? You going to join in?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alrighty, sir.\u0022 Moving toward him with his pack, Bobfred took out his own EVA toolbox, and set to work. He breathed in. \u003Cem\u003EI can do this. I can do this\u003C/em\u003E, he whispered. He went to work, something that he had done several dozen times back at the swimming pool at KSC during training. A screw floated out of his toolbox and into the distance, and Jeb frowned with disapproval, and grabbed it just in time. The Service Module was slightly worn here and there, and the emblems emblazoned on the side where slightly faded. The radiator panels onboard the service module were gleaming, and both astronauts made careful notice and tried to stay away. Jeb loosened his control pack controls, and moved cautoiusly toward the Mystery Goo containers on the shadowy side. Bobfred still remained silent, and remained by his side, staring out toward the fruit-sized dot of Kerbin in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Turn on your EVA lights. We\u0027re in the shadow of the spacecraft.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You\u0027re not a talker, aren\u0027t you?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Meh, you don\u0027t use the comm link that much\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vLpCp2L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vLpCp2L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaching into the worn-out container, Jebediah grabbed the experiment canister, a small glass tube with a odd green substance inside. He looked at it, checking for micrometeorite damage in the glass chamber. There was none. He handed the cansister to Bobfred, and stuffed it into his storage chamber. The gold visor of his helmet reflected the sunlight as he manuveuered himself back to the daylight side of the spacecraft. The two headed in silence back toward the airlock. Bobfred stayed quiet. Years ago, when he was just a kidling, he had seen Jebediah prance around the Munar surface at the Eypmodus Mare with his lander pilot. He had a hero-worship thing going around Jebediah, and now he as working with him, over the very Mun he had landed on all these years ago. Bobfred felt the sides of the cansiter, and looked toward the veteran.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the canister secured to his pack, Jebediah moved outwards from the spacecraft. He floated in silence, staring at the craft, with its layers of hardend armor and insulation, gleaming in the sunlight. Several signs flashed up on his HUI, alerting him back to reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh great. Oxygen low. Tom!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LIyiXfv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LIyiXfv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Tom, EVA has retireved experiment canister. Open the airlock!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a sound of several buttons being punched back onboard the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunshot IV\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E by Tom, the Capsule Pilot. A pause followed, and Jeb noticed something out of the corner of his eye. A small grey dot, heading toward Kerbin. Most probably an asteroid. Below, the hatch for the airlock swung open and an alert on his HUI quickly notfied him. He closed it. \u003Cem\u003EIt can wait\u003C/em\u003E, he thought, and looked at the craft, summing it up. The \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMunshot IV\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E was pretty beat up, despite being a brand new vessel on its maiden launch-the Munshot series weren\u0027t designed to be reusable. The XML-30 shuttles where. The are average lifetime of a Munshot IV-class rocket was less than a month-and that was first and only flight. The dot dissappeared for a second, then once again appeared in his range of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Bobfred, come see this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Coming, sir!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb pointed into the horizon, at tiny grey dot streaking past Kerbin. The dot slowly approched Kerbin, and slowly flung itself outwards into space until it completely dissappeared into the darkness of space. Bobfred sighed in relief that whatever it was, it didn\u0027t hit Kerbin. After all, he did have families and friends down there. \u003Cem\u003EEspecially my kerbette. How is she doing, since I\u0027m so far away?\u003C/em\u003E, he wondered. He snapped back to attention when he heard Jebs voice over the comm link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Wow.
