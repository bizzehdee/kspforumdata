From the Kerbal Space Program community on Google\u002B--and thanks to Monkeysee in particular--I learned that fuel lines are strong like struts, but flexible like bungee cords.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAnd another member of that community wondered if one could use the fuel lines, along with noodle rockets, to make a working claw.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis was an experiment with that idea. I didn\u0027t bother to add any \u0022actuators\u0022--landing legs, which can push against other parts. I just wanted to test the structural integrity of this design, given that it\u0027s intentionally not rigid.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI found it haunting, and a little disturbing. I think I lost it about five minutes in.\n"}]}
