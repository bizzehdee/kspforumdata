No, I won\u0027t doooooo thaaaaat...\u0022\n\nAs last few bars of piano rang to silence, the room *exploded*. Every Kerbal in the building was on their feet cheering at the top of their lungs, whistling and shouting, and Valentina was pulled right along with it. Though the lingering soreness in her hand kept her applause somewhat less enthusiastic than she would have liked. \n\nThe stout technician had been, as they said here, \u0027killing it\u0027 by halfway through the song. Then Lolli Kerman had joined him on stage for a final duet, and for a brief moment the cheers had completely drowned out the powerful sound system. Once she had begun singing the crowd had quieted down, again hushed into awe by that deep, penetrating voice that was far too large for such a small frame. The fellow Valentina didn\u0027t know had brought it home at the end, and now the cheers went on and on. \n\nInstead of glassware, the crowd  threw roses at the bowing, blushing pair. Which, Valentina noted, looked awfully similar to the ones in the shrubbery outside. Eventually, the tide subsided and the singers were able to make their way off the stage. Yet... something bothered her...\n\n\u0022What is \u0027that\u0027?\u0022 She asked Edmund. \n\n\u0022What?\u0022 He blinked. \n\n\u0022That.\u0022\n\n*\u0022What?\u0022*\n\n\u0022That thing he won\u0027t do.\u0022\n\n\u0022Who?\u0022\n\n\u0022*Him*.\u0022\n\n\u0022Him who?\u0022\n\n\u0022Him in song.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh.

Something like \u0027close... the attic door, my yak sings... a hairpiece.\u0027\u0022\n\nValentina gaped at him for a moment, then put a hand to her face, \u0022I need a cheeseburger.\u0022\n\n\u0022Hey, you did it!\u0022 Edmund gushed.\n\n\u0022Did what?\u0022 She asked with resignation. \n\n\u0022Used an indefinite article!\u0022\n\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\n\u0022\u0027A.\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, \u0027a\u0027.\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh what?\u0022\n\n\u0022An \u0027a.\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022Anna who?\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh uh, *an* \u0027a.\u0027\u0022\n\n\u0022I do not know this *Ann*a.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ean\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E \u0027a!\u0027\u0022\n\nValentina\u0027s mouth worked silently as her brain quietly overloaded. Then, at the very moment she was sure *she* would go mad, and welcome it too, another cheer from the crowd distracted the three from their linguistic merry-go-round. It surged toward the newly opened door, whistling and clapping, to greet a very bedraggled looking Burdous Kerman, partially supported by Gene. \n\nBurdous put on a weary, bewildered smile at the sudden frenzy of attention, and gave a weak \u0027thumbs-up,\u0027 sending the throng into more cheers. He looked like he hadn\u0027t slept or eaten in days. And based on what Valentina knew about spaceflight, that probably wasn\u0027t far from the truth. The debriefings alone would do that to a person. \n\nLed by Ol\u0027 Sam and assisted by Gene, Burdous made his way to the picture case behind the bar. Ol\u0027 Sam unlocked it, and Burdous added his own picture to those of Chadvey, Jorrigh, and that young face no one would speak of. Another round of whoops and hollers, then Ol\u0027 Sam poured a strange-looking concoction into something that resembled a small rocket nozzle and handed it to Burdous. He downed it with some difficulty, held up the upturned cup for the audience to see, and shrank bank a little as cheers roared again. \n\nThey charged the bar, seized Burdous and raised him on their shoulders in a triumphant procession down to the main floor. Here, the tables and chairs had been quickly cleared away with military-like efficiency, leaving a wide open space before the stage that was shortly filled with waving, cheering Kerbals. Burdous somehow found himself atop a chair held high by the crowd, bouncing and waving this way and that. The way it swung and tilted, Valentina wasn\u0027t sure if the people were trying to give Burdous a ride or throw him to the ground, and by the look on his face, neither was he.\n\nThe chair rose and fell as the crowd chanted:\n\n*For he\u0027s a jolly good fellow, for he\u0027s a jolly good fellow, for he\u0027s a jolly good fel-**LOW**...!*\n\n*We\u0027re all glad he didn\u0027t die!*\n\nBurdous maintained a nervous, slightly terrified smile as the serenade continued:\n\n*We\u0027re all glad he didn\u0027t die, in a fireball in the sky!Scattered before the eye, no remains to identify!*\n\nHis smile faded when the macabre routine didn\u0027t cease.\n\n*Or get crushed by gee-force high, and his body liquified!*\n\nHis bloodshot eyes grew ever wider:\n\n*Or land in the desert nigh, where his corpse would mummify!*\n\nA nervous laugh escaped his lips. They *were* joking, right?\n\n*Or a jungle swarm of big bot flies, what a tragedy to decry!*\n\nBut it just went on and on:\n\n*Or a windswept mountain high, his bones all bleached and dry!Or a Badlands farm to buy, with hungry critters nearby!Or crash \u0027fore the public eye, and get smashed into Kerbal pie!*\n\nAnd finally, when Burdous looked near to tears, they swung back around:\n\n*For he\u0027s a jolly good fe-eh-**looooooooooow!**We\u0027re all glad he didn\u0027t die, **HEY**!*\n\nSome disappointed-looking Kerbals finished in a perfect four-part harmony:\n\n*We had a poooooooooooooool.*\n\nValentina shook her head. And she thought they had a morbid sense of humor back *home*. Yet... something *still* bothered her.\n\n\u0022Where is Mister Jerdous?\u0022 She asked Edmund, \u0022should he not be here for such celebration? Is his brother after all...\u0022\n\nEdmund looked like he was either desperately trying to contain a laugh, or had just swallowed something unpleasant. He pointed to the stage as suddenly a crystal clear piano rang out. The noise of cheers rose to ear-splitting levels, the air now filled with lurid cat-calls and whistles. Valentina strained for a view, to see what could have *possibly* driven the crowd into such a frenzy. Incredibly they parted, and when she saw the figure poised in the spotlight, her jaw fell like lead. \n\nThere was Jerdous, wearing a sparkly gold-sequined dress, a huge frizzy wig, ill-fitting heels, and sporting a pair of enormous, bouncy, fake... eyelashes. \n\nHe waggled them at the crowd, and the clamor became deafening. \n\n\u0022Ladies and germs!\u0022 He said, waving them down to a dull roar for a moment, \u0022let\u0027s hear it for the Kerb of the hour, back from a stunningly successful spaceflight, my own brother Burdous!\u0022\n\nThe cheering raged to a fever pitch, Valentina clapped her hands to her ears in a vain attempt to drown it out. \n\n\u0022This one\u0027s for you, bro!\u0022 He winked.\n\nBehind him, a significant live band had gathered, led by...\n\n\u0022Play it again, Sham,\u0022 Jerdous pointed, and Ol\u0027 Sam played another flourish on the piano. \n\nJerdous raised a hand...\n\n\u0022At first I was afraid, I was petrified, kept thinking I could never live without you by my side...\u0022 Jerdous sang in a nasally falsetto oddly reminiscent of his brother, \u0022but then I spent so many nights thinking how you done me wrong, and I grew *strong*, and I learned how to get along...\u0022\n\nHe grinned slyly as the pause drew out, the silence filled by the cries of the crowd. He let them call on in mounting antici........pation.\n\nThen the drummer tapped out a syncopated beat on the hi-hat, and Jerdous jumped into the music with both feet.\n\n\u0022And so you\u0027re *back*, from outer space (*WOOOOOOOOO!*), I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face! I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key, if I had known for just one second you\u0027d be back to bother me!\n\n\u0022Go on now go (*STOMP*)! Walk out the door (*POINT*)! Just turn around now (*SPIN*), \u0027cause you\u0027re not welcome anymore (HAND)!\u0022\n\nAs they said here, Jerdous could not carry a tune in a bucket, yet what he lacked in pitch he more than made up for in zeal, cavorting and pantomiming to the lyrics, and, as they also said, shaking his grooved thing. \n\n\u0022Weren\u0027t you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye? Did you think I\u0027d crumble? Did you think I\u0027d lay down and *die?\u0022*\n\n*\u0022Oh no not I! I will **survive!**\u0022*\n\n*WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*\n\n\u0022Oh as long as I know how to love I know I\u0027ll stay alive! I\u0027ve got all my life to live, I\u0027ve got all my love to give, and I\u0027ll survive!\n\n*\u0022I will survive!\u0022*\n\n*HEY! HEY!*\n\nThe crowd threw their hands up to the beat, and soon the open space before the stage became a dance floor. Over a hundred green, sweaty bodies bopped and bounced and... pointed to something on the ceiling... and the floor... and the ceiling, though Valentina couldn\u0027t see what. And as she sat there, feeling her shoulders inexorably pulled along to the beat, a green hand appeared before her. \n\n\u0022May I have this dance?\u0022 Jorrigh said brightly. \n\nValentina threw her own hands up in panic, \u0022oh nonononononono I cannot-EEEEEK!\u0022\n\nAs it turned out, Jorrigh couldn\u0027t dance either, and didn\u0027t seem to care much, which made dancing with him very easy. All she had to do was move her own feet trying to avoid his, and occasionally flail her arms for balance, which oddly enough seemed to fit right in. She still couldn\u0027t figure out what was so interesting on the ceiling, though. \n\nThe bassist slapped and popped, the horns rang and the violins sang, while the guitarist strummed a staccato *wacka-wacka* rhythm. Valentina bumped and grooved and tried to avoid getting kicked in the shin, but the part of her mind that was always alert, always wary, honed by years in the dense and unforgiving taiga, picked bits out of the lyrics and filed them away for later:  \n  \n*It took all the strength I hadNot to fall apartKept trying hard to mendThe pieces of my broken heart*\n\n*wacka-wacka*\n\n*And I spent oh so many nightsJust feeling sorry for myselfI used to cryBut now I hold my head up high*\n\n*dirnt-dirnt-dirnt*\n\n*And you see meSomebody newI\u0027m not that chained up little person...*\n\n*wacka-wacka-wacka*\n\n*And now I\u0027m saving all my lovingFor someone who\u0027s loving me...*\n\nA soulful sax blew into a solo, and the music played long into the evening. Songs about staying alive and hustling and burning someone\u0027s poor mother, it all seemed quite morbid despite the catchy, uplifting beats. It goaded her, but Valentina had to admit to herself she was having, well, *fun*. Even Burdous seemed to be finally enjoying himself. But a distressing thought lingered in the back of her mind as she danced the night away avoiding Jorrigh\u0027s tibial onslaught. \n\nJerdous Kerman, dressed in drag, singing \u0022I Will Survive,\u0022 chilled her to her very core. \n\nFar more than it should have. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-28T04:45:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2016 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"vsully","CreatedById":129549,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T10:58:11Z","Content":"Hehehe...\n\nI burst out laughing and woke up my brother..."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T14:28:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/27/2016 at 5:04 AM, monophonic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The first on that list no doubt discovered by Dr. [Murrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Murrell) Kerman.\n\u003E \n\nTraditional Kerbal medicine has always involved injecting the ~~victim~~ patient with explosives and seeing what works. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) Sooner or later *some*thing had to."},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T05:33:55Z","Content":"Ah, back to normal.

Gene seemed to take a moment to gather his thoughts, one hand rubbing his temples and shading his bloodshot eyes from the harsh fluorescent light above. Valentina used to opportunity to quickly run her own eyes around his office. \n\nOn the wall behind him, between two large windows looking out on the launchpad, was a massive group photo of the current Kerbonaut Corps, all smiles posed before a mockup of their Orbiter and upper stage in their shiny metallic pressure suits. Nearby was a much smaller picture featuring a dozen or so rather overwhelmed looking faces clad in blue. Valentina guessed this must be the first fledgling class of new cadets. Below it was room for many more frames. \n\nThe utilitarian, white-painted cinderblock walls were festooned with all manner of stylized space art. Sleek painted rockets roared past enormous ringed space stations, or towards more exotic destinations like Duna or the moons of Jool. Mixed in were more realistic renderings of space capsules and satellites. She even noted several Ussari works, including the all too familiar portrait of... Sergei.\n\nOne wall was mostly empty, just a few old-looking photos of Gene with some Kerbals she didn\u0027t recognize, all looking very happy, but oddly cropped. In the center of them all was a single framed picture, a different image of the same young, smiling Kerbal from the case in the bar, the one no one would speak of. Engraved on a small brass plaque beneath it, she could just make out the words *AD ASTRA PER ASPERA.*\n\nGene\u0027s desk was covered in neat, ordered stacks of papers and thick binders. Just in front of Valentina was a gold-colored model of a conical craft she hadn\u0027t seen before, but for the moment, she returned her attention to Gene, who seemed to be recovering. \n\n\u0022So,\u0022 he said, suspiciously neutral, \u0022how\u0027s the hand?\u0022\n\n\u0022Is sore.\u0022\n\n\u0022I see. It says here,\u0022 he pressed a finger to a paper on the desk, \u0022you had another altercation with Dean.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*.\u0022\n\n\u0022And punched a wall.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*.\u0022\n\n\u0022And cracked it.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D--what?*\u0022\n\n\u0022There\u0027s a crack. In the wall. Just a small one.\u0022\n\nShe gaped at him for a moment, then snapped to attention in her seat, \u0022I humbly accept whatever discipline you deem fit, sir!\u0022\n\n\u0022Stop doing,\u0022 he waved his hands at her, \u0022*that*.\u0022\n\nGene leaned back and sighed, putting his hand to his temples again, \u0022this \u0027Dean\u0027 thing has got the be remedied,\u0022 he said to no one in particular. \n\n\u0022He is d-... d-...\u0022 she fumbled, \u0022what is word? Difficult.\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, he is,\u0022 Gene breathed, leaning forward again, \u0022but he\u0027s really not a bad guy, once you get past his ego. Which, unfortunately, is huge...\u0022\n\nValentina opened her mouth to say something, but didn\u0027t get far.\n\n\u0022...so I\u0027ve scheduled you two some flight time together.\u0022\n\nHer mouth now *fell* open, before she snapped to attention again, \u0022sir, yes, sir!\u0022\n\n\u0022*Stop that*,\u0022 Gene said emphatically, then more softly, \u0022look, I\u0027m just trying to help everyone get along here. No one here can challenge Dean in the air, but from what I\u0027ve heard, maybe *you* can. Show him a thing or two. Find a chink in that armor.\u0022\n\n\u0022...armor?\u0022 Valentina said, confused. \n\n\u0022Figure of speech. Anyway, I have the two of you down for a block of time tomorrow afternoon. If you can earn his respect, I think you might just see a different side of him,\u0022 Gene gave her a hopeful, not-quite-believing-it smile.\n\nValentina returned one equally as awkward. \n\n\u0022Um...\u0022 she foundered, seeking a distraction, \u0022is new spacecraft?\u0022 She pointed to the golden model on the desk. \n\n\u0022Yep, that\u0027s DUOS,\u0022 Gene looked relieved himself, and handed her the fragile-feeling bit of plastic, \u0022the latest in cutting-edge KSA technology. It will be our own foray into performing rendezvous and docking in space.\u0022\n\nValentina kept a polite smile as she turned the model over in her hands. It bore a very passing resemblance to *Zarya*, but could certainly not be called a copy. It looked like little more than an upscaled version of their conical orbiter capsule mated to an overly large fuel tank and engine, which she suspected was actually the last stage of the lifter. She also noted, it did not appear to actually *have* any sort of docking port. Or even any place to put one. \n\n\u0022Just a prototype, of course,\u0022 Gene said, as if reading her mind, \u0022once these early bugs are sorted out there\u0027s plenty of room for improvement.\u0022\n\n\u0022Er... bugs?\u0022\n\n\u0022Figure of speech,\u0022 he said, rubbing at the wide, flat spot between his eyes, \u0022I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard about Rockomax\u0027s um, difficulties. Just normal development snags, that\u0027s all. They have another test flight scheduled from their west coast facility tomorrow, actually. I\u0027m sure everything will...\u0022\n\nGene stared at her, as if not sure where his own thought had been going. \n\nHe returned to rubbing his temples, \u0022wow, I\u0027m talking a lot...\u0022\n\nValentina looked at him, concerned, \u0022are *you* all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, I\u0027m fine,\u0022 he said with a half-hearted, dismissive chuckle, \u0022just the challenges of being the Flight Director. We\u0027re in a good place. Burdous\u0027s flight was a great success, just have to get over this one little hump, now.\u0022\n\nEvery recent Rockomax launch had failed, every one that wasn\u0027t crewed, that\u0027s what someone had said. Could he not see the obvious? Or was she just being paranoid? Rockets were tricky things, after all, prone to failure from the tiniest flaw, and the entire program here seemed far behind the Union\u0027s. Ironic, since so much of the Union\u0027s hardware came from... \n\nThe thought evaporated, as another flash of distant emotion wandered through Valentina\u0027s mind. \n\nShe pushed it away, and wrenched her attention back to Gene, \u0022still, uh, you should get rest. You do not look well.\u0022\n\n\u0022I\u0027ll be all right,\u0022 he grinned weakly, his eyes seemed to have grown redder in just these few minutes, \u0022no rest for the weary, after all.\u0022\n\n\u0022But,\u0022 she blinked, \u0022it is weary who *need* rest, no?\u0022\n\n\u0022Figure of speech,\u0022 he groaned.\n\n\u0022Your speech has many figures,\u0022 frowned Valentina, \u0022like *matryoshka* doll.\u0022\n\n\u0022Like m-what?\u0022\n\n\u0022*Matryoshka* doll,\u0022 she gestured vaguely. \n\n\u0022I have no idea what that is,\u0022 Gene blinked, as if he should have, then shook his head, \u0022maybe I *could* use some coffee...\u0022\n\nHe sighed, and looked back to Valentina, \u0022you\u0027ll do fine tomorrow, and don\u0027t go easy on Dean either. Really show him what you\u0027ve got. It\u0027ll be fine.\u0022\n\nThey stared awkwardly at one another for a few moments. \n\n\u0022Er, yes, you can go,\u0022 Gene rolled his eyes, then clapped a hand to them, \u0022and on your way out, do me a favor and kill the lights, please.\u0022\n\nShe stood, saluted again, felt a bit silly, then went to the door. At the light switch, she paused a moment, wondering if perhaps she should punch *it*, but Gene probably just meant \u0027turn them off.\u0027 So many incomprehensible figures of speech here, like turning your hat in winter. Shrugging, Valentina flicked the light switch. The room didn\u0027t change much, with the late afternoon sun streaming in the windows as it was. Gene didn\u0027t seem to register it either way, he now sat with his face in hands, fingers rubbing his forehead. \n\nValentina gave him another concerned frown, and quietly closed the door behind her. She made her way down the hall, out past the ever-smiling secretary, and through the legions of apparatchiks clacking away at their typewriters, to the elevator. Some things, she supposed once more, truly *were* universal. Only they didn\u0027t call them apparatchiks here, right? What was the word? Pencil-pusher, yes? That made no sense either, none of them had pencils as far as she could tell. The doors *bing*ed open, and she walked through the lobby and out into the stifling tropical sun with a headfull of thoughts. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-07T17:13:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2016 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T22:12:22Z","Content":"**Chapter 57: Wanderings**\n\nValentina wandered aimlessly across the space center grounds, no real destination in mind. Here and there, workers busied themselves with their tasks. A large, cylindrical object was being inched into the VAB on its special low-boy trailer, still veiled in white shrink wrap. The upper stage for Jerdous\u0027s rocket, due to launch a few weeks from now, she surmised. \n\nAnd then what? She\u0027d seen copies of launch manifests, filled with both the mundane and the ambitious. Nearly every flight followed by the letters \u0027TBA.\u0027 Even Gene seemed to be nearing his limit. Something here was *wrong*, she *knew* it, but--\n\nMovement drew her eye, and Valentina looked up to see Burdous walking her way, followed at an odd distance by his brother. She mentally braced herself for another of his profanity-laced tirades, but much to her surprise he simply walked right by, glassy eyes fixed the concrete. He smelled like he hadn\u0027t bathed in... well, longer than usual. \n\nShe watched Burdous go, then turned to his brother as he approached, \u0022what is, how you say? Chewing upon him?\u0022\n\nJerdous raised an eye... bulge, then shrugged, \u0022you remember that concert he was going to a couple days ago?\u0022\n\n\u0022Indeed, Solpugids, yes?\u0022\n\nHe nodded, \u0022he was on top of the world, playing the heroic spacekerb. Had a date with that pretty weather gal from Channel 3, rented a limo, even *combed his hair*. Arrived at the VIP entrance to the stadium, with her on his arm, to a gauntlet of cameras.\u0022\n\nA sigh, and a defeated, one-sided smile, \u0022the tickets were fake. Someone swindled him. Got turned away at the door.\u0022\n\n\u0022That is horrible!\u0022 She blurted, \u0022do you know who has done it?\u0022\n\n\u0022He won\u0027t say,\u0022 Jerdous looked off towards the drooping figure, his own arms folded, \u0022hasn\u0027t said a single word since. I think he even walked home.\u0022\n\n\u0022He... no, he does not deserve such.\u0022\n\n\u0022I warned him about shady resellers. He\u0027s real smart when it comes to engineering, but people? *\u0419\u0424T S\u0424 M\u0426CH*.\\*\u0022\n\nValentina raised an eye... bulge at the Ussari interjection.\n\n\u0022I\u0027d better go keep an eye on him. Takes him a while to bounce back from these things,\u0022 Jerdous nodded, then trotted off. \n\nValentina frowned after them. No, not even that one deserves such, rude as he is. A smack on the head, perhaps, but he already seemed to be well supplied with those. She continued on her way across the grounds. Jerdous, at least, looked more himself today. Something... something was not right there either. Nightmares. She could understand that. But something else about him just felt... wrong. Wrong... yet, familiar. Like in the spring, when the days became sunny and beautiful but all that which had died during the long winter began to fester, and the sticky sweet smell of decay mingled with the subtle perfume of flowers. \n\nIt felt like... when the voice had called out to her. \n\n*...do not think too hard on such things...*\n\n*Could* it be? Could the voice have other... charges?\n\n*...or did you just imagine it all? A side effect of stress, a mind\u0027s way of coping...*\n\nShe should do something. She should do *some*thing. If it *is* true. She couldn\u0027t just leave him like that. She had to help. There must be a *reason*, a reason she was here at all. \n\n*...never ever make noise...*\n\n*...you have such power...*\n\n*...you may not like what you find...*\n\nValentina shook her head against the competing thoughts, and a wave of emotion sloshed about her mind.  \n\nWhat... *could* she do? It all seemed so ridiculous. A rational mind didn\u0027t didn\u0027t think like this. Didn\u0027t hear voices and feel emotions that were not its own. Either she really *was* going mad... or the reality was far, far worse than she imagined. \n\n*...you took an oath...*\n\nBut what could she do? This was beyond her understanding. It was all subtlety and scheming and... politics. She did not *know* these things. \n\nSomewhere, not that far, someone was having a great laugh about something. It echoed back and forth inside her brain.\n\n*...I don\u0027t understand...*\n\n*...believe...*\n\n*...do not think too hard on such things...*\n\n*...you have such power...*\n\n*...I found things that were... troubling...*\n\n*...this, we do not speak of...*\n\n*...progeny of traitors...*\n\nValentina clapped her hands to her head, \u0022shut up shut up shut up, all of you!\u0022\n\nSomeone who had been coming the other way looked up at her, then suddenly remembered urgent business in the opposite direction, and set off for it at a brisk trot. She ground her teeth and rubbed her own temples. She most *certainly* needed a cheeseburger. Or three. Or eight. \n\nOff to the west, the sun was sinking down towards the horizon, silhouetting several enormous propellium tankers sitting at anchor. Odd, that was an awful lot of fuel for one small rocket, with a launch still weeks away. She recalled that PropelOx stored well, but--\n\nThe thought blew away like breath in the breeze. \n\nComing down the path were several pipeline workers, roughnecks, they called them. Their faces were streaked with sweat and grease, but their enormous hats were utterly spotless. They tipped them, and offered big friendly, Exast smiles as they passed.\n\n\u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\nValentina smiled back weakly. After all day lifting very heavy things in the hot sun, the four had perhaps two a half shirts left between them, and, well, they were *built* like fellows who spent all day lifting very heavy things in the hot sun. \n\nValentina swallowed hard, raising a hesitant hand as she watched them depart. Presently, a shadow loomed over her. \n\n\u0022Good, strong boys, all of \u0027em. Work like dogs and twice as loyal.\u0022\n\nShe jumped, and spun around. How does he *do* that?!\n\n\u0022Evenin\u0027, ma\u0027am,\u0022 J.R. said, tipping his own huge black hat, \u0022fixin\u0027 to be a real looker of a sunset, Ah reckon.\u0022\n\n\u0022Good evening, mister J.R.,\u0022 she said carefully, hoping her cheeks didn\u0027t look as colored as they felt. \n\n\u0022Well, Ah\u0027ll not keep yah. Three more tankers comin\u0027 in the night and Ah\u0027m busier than a one-eyed cat watchin\u0027 nine rat holes. Besides,\u0022 he winked, \u0022you look like a lady with a lot on her mind.\u0022\n\nValentina opened her mouth, and closed it just as quickly. \n\n\u0022Y\u0027all have yerself a fine evenin\u0027, now,\u0022 he tipped his hat once more, with a rather unsavory smile, \u0022and remember, bein\u0027 a team player *does* have its advantages.\u0022\n\nAs he walked away, Valentina could just see his shoulders shake as he chuckled. She bared her teeth as his back. Why of all the...! That... slimy... GAH! \n\nShe spun around, stalking off beyond the concrete of the Space Center proper. The sun was nearly touching the ocean, now. She always expected it to make a comedic *shhhhhhhh* sound and sink into a cloud of steam. Yes, she\u0027d been watching *far* too many of these absurd Foreign cartoons. Nevertheless, it did amaze her how fast the sun set here on the equator. \n\nBack home, the sunset seemed to last for hours, the fading light filtered by towering trees. Not far from where she grew up, the sun never really set, in a land of eternal twilight. It was always cold there, too. She wouldn\u0027t mind that, it would be a welcome change, the cold never--\n\nA slight tickle on her arm drew Valentina\u0027s attention. She looked down in horror to find a tiny mosquito helping its self to dinner at her expense. For a moment, she could only gape in disgust. How did these people *live* like this?! One of these... these... these... *vermin* could just make a meal of you and you *might not even know!* At least the mosquitos back home had to put up a proper fight, first! \n\nSnarling, she balled her hand into a fist and *squeezed* until the mosquito burst like macabre balloon. She picked the head off and wiped her arm on a convenient plant. \n\nPlant?\n\nValentina looked around, and found herself surrounded by lush green vegetation and stunted trees. Ah, this must be the lake everyone talked about. She walked toward the shore, until her shoes squelched in the soggy ground. It certainly was a very pretty lake. She knew a lake that looked like this back home, for the few weeks it wasn\u0027t covered in thick white ice. To the west, the sun had fully disappeared, the splash of orange in the sky fading to red and deep crimson. The dwindling light was maintained by a brilliant, pallid M\u00FCn just peeking over the mountains far to the east.

Here and there, workers busied themselves with their tasks. A large, cylindrical object was being inched into the VAB on its special low-boy trailer, still veiled in white shrink wrap. The upper stage for Jerdous\u0027s rocket, due to launch a few weeks from now, she surmised. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And then what? She\u0027d seen copies of launch manifests, filled with both the mundane and the ambitious. Nearly every flight followed by the letters \u0027TBA.\u0027 Even Gene seemed to be nearing his limit. Something here was *wrong*, she *knew* it, but--\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Movement drew her eye, and Valentina looked up to see Burdous walking her way, followed at an odd distance by his brother. She mentally braced herself for another of his profanity-laced tirades, but much to her surprise he simply walked right by, glassy eyes fixed the concrete. He smelled like he hadn\u0027t bathed in... well, longer than usual. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E She watched Burdous go, then turned to his brother as he approached, \u0022what is, how you say? Chewing upon him?\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Jerdous raised an eye... bulge, then shrugged, \u0022you remember that concert he was going to a couple days ago?\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Indeed, Solpugids, yes?\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E He nodded, \u0022he was on top of the world, playing the heroic spacekerb. Had a date with that pretty weather gal from Channel 3, rented a limo, even *combed his hair*. Arrived at the VIP entrance to the stadium, with her on his arm, to a gauntlet of cameras.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A sigh, and a defeated, one-sided smile, \u0022the tickets were fake. Someone swindled him. Got turned away at the door.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022That is horrible!\u0022 She blurted, \u0022do you know who has done it?\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022He won\u0027t say,\u0022 Jerdous looked off towards the drooping figure, his own arms folded, \u0022hasn\u0027t said a single word since. I think he even walked home.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022He... no, he does not deserve such.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022I warned him about shady resellers. He\u0027s real smart when it comes to engineering, but people? *\u0419\u0424T S\u0424 M\u0426CH*.\\*\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina raised an eye... bulge at the Ussari interjection.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022I\u0027d better go keep an eye on him. Takes him a while to bounce back from these things,\u0022 Jerdous nodded, then trotted off. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina frowned after them. No, not even that one deserves such, rude as he is. A smack on the head, perhaps, but he already seemed to be well supplied with those. She continued on her way across the grounds. Jerdous, at least, looked more himself today. Something... something was not right there either. Nightmares. She could understand that. But something else about him just felt... wrong. Wrong... yet, familiar. Like in the spring, when the days became sunny and beautiful but all that which had died during the long winter began to fester, and the sticky sweet smell of decay mingled with the subtle perfume of flowers. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It felt like... when the voice had called out to her. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...do not think too hard on such things...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *Could* it be? Could the voice have other... charges?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...or did you just imagine it all? A side effect of stress, a mind\u0027s way of coping...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E She should do something. She should do *some*thing. If it *is* true. She couldn\u0027t just leave him like that. She had to help. There must be a *reason*, a reason she was here at all. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...never ever make noise...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...you have such power...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...you may not like what you find...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina shook her head against the competing thoughts, and a wave of emotion sloshed about her mind.  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What... *could* she do? It all seemed so ridiculous. A rational mind didn\u0027t didn\u0027t think like this. Didn\u0027t hear voices and feel emotions that were not its own. Either she really *was* going mad... or the reality was far, far worse than she imagined. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...you took an oath...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But what could she do? This was beyond her understanding. It was all subtlety and scheming and... politics. She did not *know* these things. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Somewhere, not that far, someone was having a great laugh about something. It echoed back and forth inside her brain.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...I don\u0027t understand...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...believe...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...do not think too hard on such things...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...you have such power...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...I found things that were... troubling...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...this, we do not speak of...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *...progeny of traitors...*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina clapped her hands to her head, \u0022shut up shut up shut up, all of you!\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Someone who had been coming the other way looked up at her, then suddenly remembered urgent business in the opposite direction, and set off for it at a brisk trot. She ground her teeth and rubbed her own temples. She most *certainly* needed a cheeseburger. Or three. Or eight. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Off to the west, the sun was sinking down towards the horizon, silhouetting several enormous propellium tankers sitting at anchor. Odd, that was an awful lot of fuel for one small rocket, with a launch still weeks away. She recalled that PropelOx stored well, but--\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The thought blew away like breath in the breeze. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Coming down the path were several pipeline workers, roughnecks, they called them. Their faces were streaked with sweat and grease, but their enormous hats were utterly spotless. They tipped them, and offered big friendly, Exast smiles as they passed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Ma\u0027am.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina smiled back weakly. After all day lifting very heavy things in the hot sun, the four had perhaps two a half shirts left between them, and, well, they were *built* like fellows who spent all day lifting very heavy things in the hot sun. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina swallowed hard, raising a hesitant hand as she watched them depart. Presently, a shadow loomed over her. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Good, strong boys, all of \u0027em. Work like dogs and twice as loyal.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E She jumped, and spun around. How does he *do* that?!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Evenin\u0027, ma\u0027am,\u0022 J.R. said, tipping his own huge black hat, \u0022fixin\u0027 to be a real looker of a sunset, Ah reckon.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Good evening, mister J.R.,\u0022 she said carefully, hoping her cheeks didn\u0027t look as colored as they felt. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Well, Ah\u0027ll not keep yah. Three more tankers comin\u0027 in the night and Ah\u0027m busier than a one-eyed cat watchin\u0027 nine rat holes. Besides,\u0022 he winked, \u0022you look like a lady with a lot on her mind.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina opened her mouth, and closed it just as quickly. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Y\u0027all have yerself a fine evenin\u0027, now,\u0022 he tipped his hat once more, with a rather unsavory smile, \u0022and remember, bein\u0027 a team player *does* have its advantages.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As he walked away, Valentina could just see his shoulders shake as he chuckled. She bared her teeth as his back. Why of all the...! That... slimy... GAH! \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E She spun around, stalking off beyond the concrete of the Space Center proper. The sun was nearly touching the ocean, now. She always expected it to make a comedic *shhhhhhhh* sound and sink into a cloud of steam. Yes, she\u0027d been watching *far* too many of these absurd Foreign cartoons. Nevertheless, it did amaze her how fast the sun set here on the equator. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Back home, the sunset seemed to last for hours, the fading light filtered by towering trees. Not far from where she grew up, the sun never really set, in a land of eternal twilight. It was always cold there, too. She wouldn\u0027t mind that, it would be a welcome change, the cold never--\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A slight tickle on her arm drew Valentina\u0027s attention. She looked down in horror to find a tiny mosquito helping its self to dinner at her expense. For a moment, she could only gape in disgust. How did these people *live* like this?! One of these... these... these... *vermin* could just make a meal of you and you *might not even know!* At least the mosquitos back home had to put up a proper fight, first! \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Snarling, she balled her hand into a fist and *squeezed* until the mosquito burst like macabre balloon. She picked the head off and wiped her arm on a convenient plant. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Plant?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina looked around, and found herself surrounded by lush green vegetation and stunted trees. Ah, this must be the lake everyone talked about. She walked toward the shore, until her shoes squelched in the soggy ground. It certainly was a very pretty lake. She knew a lake that looked like this back home, for the few weeks it wasn\u0027t covered in thick white ice. To the west, the sun had fully disappeared, the splash of orange in the sky fading to red and deep crimson. The dwindling light was maintained by a brilliant, pallid M\u00FCn just peeking over the mountains far to the east. She sat on a convenient log, and watched it rise, occasionally batting at the mosquitoes. Somehow, this, too reminded her of home. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Home. She finally realized how homesick she was. The brighter stars began to pop into the sky, one by one, bringing with them an odd contradiction of emotions that were, thankfully, entirely her own. Her time in this bizarre place was beginning to sink towards its own end, and oddly, she felt wistful about that too. She wondered absently if she would still feel the same *tomorrow* night.

It was... no, it was more... well, it looked sort of like a fish. And also like a squirrel. But also like a rat.

Just *looking* at it made her eyes water. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As it hopped and squished forward, its big fishy lips curled into a hopeful grin, its long whiskers... whisked, and its bushy, sodden tail flicked with anticipation. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Valentina held its beady-eyed gaze and scowled, \u0022*don\u0027t even think about it*.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The critter\u0027s countenance fell, and it turned, crestfallen and sniffling, and sulked off back into the lake. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Standing, Valentina sighed.
