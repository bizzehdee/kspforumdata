A well-designed rocket, if there ever was one. Shoot For The Mun had been through several iterations: we\\\u0027d had previous contractors contact us with news \\\u0027bout how marvellous our design would look, should we just add their new, top of the range RCS thruster to it; or try out their innovative winglet on each of the nine gleaming liquid fuel stacks that made up its launch stage. Would we be interested in maybe some re-texturing, to further improve the ship\\\u0027s brutish charm? Or, hell, our entire crew could easily be replaced by this cheap, low drag AI unit that could pilot the whole goddam ship for us!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E No, Shoot For The Mun was a marvel- a vanilla ship of pure power and ingenuity that we had designed and put together from scratch. Desecrating its body with such invaders would destroy the entire philosophy behind it, what it stood for. And, believe me, it didn\\\u0027t half stand proud.

The silence that followed resonated throughout the cramped command module, \\\u0027till I realised my elbow had nudged the communications mute button I\\\u0027d installed by hand that was perched on the edge of my chair\\\u0027s armrest. Damn stupid place for it to be, I thought, before nudging it once more and tuning back into Bill\\\u0027s droning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027- and SAS isn\\\u0027t even on.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027So, we\\\u0027re not actually ready then?

Even Bob stopped wailing in anguish for a few seconds to peer out of the smudged command module windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hey Bill! What\\\u0027s our altitude?\u0027 I whooped, elated at the truly incredible moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We\\\u0027re climbing past four thousand metres now.\u0027 Came the reply. Bob went back to wailing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now, what was it we were supposed to do next? We\\\u0027d discussed our plan for the mission in detail; plotting trajectories and calculating thrust-to-weight ratios... well, I say we when I suppose I really mean Bill and Bob had- my usual part at times like such was to insist it \\\u0027looked cooler\\\u0027 or to sit back admiring how sleek I\\\u0027d made it. I\\\u0027ve been told that acting like that is in no way beneficial to the success of the mission, to which I say \u0027design plays a major factor in ship control, little missy. Go away and make a ship filled to the brim with health and safety precautions, then come back and tell me it\\\u0027ll fly straight damn it!\u0027. To this, Bill would generally sigh and walk off whilst Bob would wonder why I had called him a little girl... again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Speaking of looks, it sure was a nice view from up there. A bit lopsided, not really how it should\\\u0027ve looked for some reason, but nonetheless a great place to relax and think, without the disturbance of other crew members. Other crew members? Wait a second... oh, goddammit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027- for God\\\u0027s sake Jebediah!

Well, \\\u0027course we aren\\\u0027t Bill! To get into orbit we have to tilt over towards ninety degrees.\u0027 I smiled and sank back into my chair, feeling happy with myself for remembering this crucial part of the flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Well then\u0027 Bill shrieked, his voice shaking somewhat, \u0027we definitely aren\\\u0027t going to make it into orbit any time soon.\u0027 Having paid a little more attention to what he was actually saying this time round, I focused on the navball and realised that for some strange reason we actually weren\\\u0027t heading towards ninety. Instead, Shoot For The Mun was having a hell of a time spinning crazily, firing rapidly expanding hydrogen gas in all directions (rather like I do in the office on Tuesday mornings) as it sailed up past our thirty five thousand metre apoapsis and began to fall back down towards Kerbin. I remembered my training.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Don\\\u0027t worry guys\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Don\\\u0027t worry!?\u0027 Bill screamed down the comms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay, Bill: you worry. Bob?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes Jeb?\u0027 For a kerbal with Bob\\\u0027s panic issues, he was dealing with the situation surprisingly well. Made me a little proud of him, if I\\\u0027m honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Don\\\u0027t worry, or look at the navball.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027The navball...?\u0027 Bob murmured, and promptly passed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027JEBEDIAH WE\\\u0027RE GONNA DIE YOU PIECE OF-\u0027 My elbow nudged the chair\\\u0027s armrest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oops\u0027 I muttered. Looking around the command module, I eyeballed my current options and then the altimeter. Thirty thousand metres. By this point the colourful pens I\\\u0027d brought along with me in my spacesuit chest pocket for zero-gee entertainment in transit to the Mun had wormed their way out of the shoddy velcro seal and now were floating around the command module. Bill began to thrash in his chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Thank God he gave himself a seatbelt as well...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Okay, decision time. I punched the large rectangular button directly ahead of me in order to separate us from the launch stage. Ker-chunk. Twenty seven and-a-half thousand metres and now gaining speed. Okay... how about this one? Bob got another kick, which woke him up whilst de-activating the SAS: allowing me some actual damn control. A second punch to the rectangle (Why not? It worked the first time) initiated the orbital stage, consisting of three liquid engines with nine tanks between them. The orbital stage was much smaller than the launch stage, which yielded unto me the control I needed to wrestle us upright. Despite being intended for high-atmosphere/ space, it also had sufficient thrust to pull us out of the dive and back on course with the mission. Pens rained from the roof of the command module under the return of positive Gee forces and I turned the comms back on, feeling pretty pleased with myself. Silence. I nudged the button again... silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Damn thing...\u0027 A round-house punch that rocked the chair right to left, and still no one was screaming. I checked the video feed- Bill had fainted and Bob was nervously nibbling on one of the pens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter Three- Orbital Burns\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LakJ5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LakJ5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was far more peaceful from then on, for a while. Not how I usually prefer things to be, but not on awful lot was going on, seeing as Bill was sulking and Bob was content enough to bounce pens around the command module with me. Zero Gravity is a wonderful thing, if you didn\\\u0027t already know. I adore the feeling of weightlessness, \\\u0027specially on such a great mission. Little did I know then that we\\\u0027d be weightless a whole lot longer than was planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Moonrise.\u0027 Bill muttered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Speak up lad.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It\\\u0027s moonrise Jeb! Time to burn.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh, right.\u0027 Since we\\\u0027d ejected the launch stage far earlier than was planned for, our orbital stage was running lower on fuel than I personally would\\\u0027ve liked. Guess I do kinda have to thank Bill that we had enough fuel to carry on with the mission in the first place, he was the one who\\\u0027d stuck laterally mounted fuel tanks onto the orbiter so we had just enough to get to the Mun before we\\\u0027d resort to the lander engine. Then again, all credit to my sweet brain for wanting to continue in the first place- Bob and Bill were both screaming at me to abort in light of what\\\u0027d happened with the launch stage, but we can\\\u0027t stop no matter what! We\\\u0027re flying for much more than the Space Centre\\\u0027s research projects, my reputation is on the line!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okayyy, RCS engaged- let\\\u0027s swing her round boys.\u0027 The RCS thrusters spluttered into life, readjusting the ship to point towards the Mun so we could begin our transit burn. I thought that it was pretty strange we weren\\\u0027t still pointing in the same direction we had been when we ended our orbital manoeuvres, seemed to me that the damned SAS unit wasn\\\u0027t working properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It\\\u0027s working great Jeb\u0027 Bill had said, when I\\\u0027d tossed it off of the VAB for the third time, and for the third time it pointed in the same direction the entire way down. \u0027Stop mucking around.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It works great on the ground, but in orbit it sure don\\\u0027t.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027It does! It\\\u0027s just... not pointing relative to Kerbin.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, and what\\\u0027s it pointing relative to then?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Um.\u0027 He blinked, actually floundering for an answer for once. \u0027Space, the ether, background radiation.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Huh. Sure.\u0027 I\\\u0027d replied, heading towards the fire escape in order to retrieve it once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Throttling up\u0027 I murmured, as the engines roared back into life after their three hour hiatus. All the pens in the air once more flung themselves at us- several bounced off my helmet and embedded themselves in the battered headrest that supported it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Urgh, Jeb! Why on Kerbin did you bring the pens?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Lay off him Bill, he needs to concentrate.\u0027 Bob motioned towards the lever that he\\\u0027d set up as our throttle control. \u0027That thing gets stuck sometimes.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah, thanks Bob.\u0027 He was probably just saying that, from now on Bob was indebted to me for the pens- they\\\u0027d served as his outlet of fear for the entire flight. Nibbled nibs floated around the Command Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But they don\\\u0027t even have lids!\u0027 Bill wailed \u0027There\\\u0027ll be scribbles all over my equipment!\u0027 I shifted in my seat at this, trying to cover up the doodle of him I\\\u0027d done on the chair\\\u0027s armrest. It could help me imagine what he might be saying every time I muted the comms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Grow up damn it!\u0027 I growled. \u0027We\\\u0027re going to the Mun, and your worried about your precious equipment being written on!\u0027 He sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yeah well- wait a second. Those thrusters have been on too long Jeb, cut it!\u0027 Bill reached forward and just managed to press the \\\u0027X\\\u0027 button that was supposed to cut our thrust immediately. It didn\\\u0027t. Minutes before the others took up their seats in the cockpit, I\\\u0027d ripped out all the wires behind the \\\u0027dashboard\\\u0027 that looked vaguely attached to it. Who wanted less thrust? Seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027What?\u0027 He pressed it again. \u0027Jeb, what did you-\u0027 he lunged for the lever, but only succeeded in brushing his fingertips on its surface. Rolling my eyes a little, I reached out and gave it a brisk tug. No response, it didn\\\u0027t move an inch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Huh Bob, you sure weren\\\u0027t kidding.\u0027 By this point Bob\\\u0027s eyes had widened so far it seemed they\\\u0027d pop out any minute and join all the pens. We were gaining quite a lot of speed now, I noticed. Three thousand metres per second, three thousand five hundred, four thousand... the numbers rolled past at shorter and shorter intervals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Jeb!\u0027 Bob cried \u0027You need to wiggle it a bit to-\u0027 He stopped suddenly, because we had all just heard the unmistakeable sound of the engines cutting out.

It seemed so... old, to my eager eyes. I sat there, wonderfully unrestrained by my chair, peering out of the command module windows with shining eyes just to see, to try and examine its historic surface. The Mun was fascinating to me, I\\\u0027d sit up on the VAB at night gazing towards the stars when the Mun was at its brightest and imagine what it would be like to actually stand at the base of one of those craters, those deep black spots that covered its ancient hide. It really did look beautiful, as we floated teasingly close above it- never to touch down upon it. Never to fulfil my wish, never to be the first to say \u0027well, it ain\\\u0027t made of cheese\u0027. Never... well, not this mission at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Oh no, the mission wasn\\\u0027t over baby.

Three rookies get trapped in orbit- successfully testing the command module\\\u0027s ability to sustain a crew of kerbals... indefinitely. A mission to the Mun overshoots its target- successfully tested the adaptability of a mission profile.

We\\\u0027re going too fast!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Options. I need options. Bob, what are our options?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Um. Panic?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Technically an option, but not a particularly useful one. Bill, hit me.\u0027 A scream of rage and a ferocious pen launch later, my helmet acquired another scratch for its collection.

We can\\\u0027t do much though, we\\\u0027re-\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027-going to fast, I know- heard you the first time.

What\\\u0027s our current course?\u0027 Bob leaned out of his window to look back at Kerbin, trying to judge what direction we were pointing in. Not the most accurate way to do things, but it worked. Most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I\\\u0027d say we\\\u0027re heading towards the Mun...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes Bob, obviously.\u0027 Bill snapped, impatient as ever. \u0027Our burn achieved that much.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hey, don\\\u0027t get at him. So, can we get into orbit around the Mun?\u0027 I asked, an idea beginning to form in my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Barely, but if we try to we\\\u0027ll almost definitely run out of fuel.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay, so we can\\\u0027t do anything that close.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027That close...?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027We\\\u0027re travelling too fast, you\\\u0027ve said it enough times. The only way to slow down without using precious fuel is to reach our apoapsis, surely.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027But by then we\\\u0027d be orbiting the sun Jeb! We\\\u0027ll never get back once that happens!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Come on, can\\\u0027t we change our direction enough to stay in Kerbin orbit at least?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Well... yes.\u0027 Bill muttered, scepticism resounding in his words. \u0027But we\\\u0027d still be in the middle of nowhere.\u0027 A grin formed on my face, the same grin that always took that particular position during launch- front row seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Oh no Jeb.

It really is a lump of rock, isn\\\u0027t it?\u0027 That\\\u0027s not to say Minmus didn\\\u0027t look interesting. In fact, Minmus\\\u0027 textured surface brought back that grin to my face as soon as the first pixel of its existence hit my retina. I can tell \\\u0027ya, the anticipation I had begun to really feel when looking up at Shoot For The Mun on the launch pad, two long days ago, was reaching its peak and beginning to tear me apart. The way I expressed this in-containable excitement to my fellow pilots was overly nonchalant as a result of trying to seem calm, for Bob\\\u0027s sake. To be honest, I\\\u0027d always had a soft spot for Bob over Bill. This was mainly due to Bill\\\u0027s inner fear of my incredible potential, which had begun to form during our childhood. Yeah, I know, it\\\u0027s hard to believe we grew up under the same roof- largely because we only had a roof for five short years, when that very same potentially had grasped a vague understanding of air-pressure... anyway, that\\\u0027s a different story. Safe to say Bill wasn\\\u0027t best pleased when I pleasantly demanded we landed on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027What is wrong with you, Jeb!?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027People have offered differing opinions...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027First we dropped all our launch fuel barely twenty thousand metres off the ground, then-\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027...which was the decision that saved your life, lest you forget.\u0027 I muttered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027-then you put us all in danger by refusing to abort. After-\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Hey! I have a reputation for never backing out of a flight! Would you put that on the line if you were wearing my helmet?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027-after that you burnt out all of the orbiter fuel by over-shooting our target, and now you say we should land on this clump of rock, way out from Kerbin using the very fuel you just released into space by adjusting our course to orbit the damn thing-\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027the second time I saved your arse...\u0027 I was beginning to get angry at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027-instead of simply swinging round it to get us home!\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay, so I put you in danger again. That levels out to no harm done, right? No, listen to me.

He had been near-silent for the long wait to get to this point. Or, then again, maybe he hadn\\\u0027t. I\\\u0027d only just turned the comms back on to discuss a Min landing with the pair of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Yes Bob, don\\\u0027t you see?\u0027 My eyes, I\\\u0027m told, shone brightly in the dark command module (which had gone into standby mode somehow- I knew my idea to run the ship\\\u0027s critical systems off of a windows vista OS was a bit... iffy. We had no idea how to turn the damned thing back on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Do you not feel the same? The mission is our purpose right now, our life! How can we think of self-preservation when that would only end the mission and cut away our reason to exist?\u0027 Bill began to say something, probably another stupid remark. No, this was my time to speak. \u0027We press on, dammit! Onwards, for the mission!\u0027 I reached up and viscously kicked out at the throttle lever. As the single landing engine kicked back in retaliation, the gee forces compressing us back into our worn and battered chairs to the screeching of their hinges, my arm smacked down on the RCS activation and Bill, realising he had no choice, fluttered his hands over the lander\\\u0027s controls in order to point us retrograde. The reassuring feeling of weight relaxed in my gut and, despite not being able to see its icy surface, Minmus\\\u0027 image glowed in my eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter Six- Contact Light\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENo picture yet...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027It\\\u0027s been a long time, Minmus.\u0027 I muttered, staring down at the methane lake that hung tantalisingly close beneath us. \u0027A long time\u0027 We were close... so close! The grin seemed stuck on my face now. Despite the fact that those ecstatic moments of joy, of sheer thrill, when I\\\u0027d began our descent were long gone, my face didn\\\u0027t seem to comprehend the sadness I felt now; our time was nearly here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Bob seemed to watch me anxiously.

The rest of my thoughts kept themselves occupied on the matter at hand: we\\\u0027d never get out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We\\\u0027d never get out THERE. THERE, on the lake, on the surface of Minmus, on the face of a celestial body never before touched by Kerbalkind. Our efforts had brought us this far, we\\\u0027d overcome so many limitations of the mission, yet we would never stand on the icy surface for ourselves. The trace left by our landing feet digging into the ice, nine hundred metres, would be the only thing capable of proving that all my training hadn\\\u0027t been in vain, eight hundred metres, despite my very presence there, seven hundred, not three metres from the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027How low Bob?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Maybe six hundred metres?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Okay, we\\\u0027ve got this.\u0027 Bill sounded remarkably confident, but not excited.
