Still trying to wrap my head around the camera tool controls, so some of the camera angles are a little repetitive. Comments and constructive criticism are welcome.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Nj-0_odsrI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nMy first trip to Duna and Ike, aboard the Spaceplane Carrier Nyx One (totally not the previous Kerbin Orbital Refueling Station because Mortimer can\u0027t spare the funds) and the Spaceplanes: Diabolus X (SSTO for Duna) and Valkyria III (Ike Mission and Direct Kerbin return). This Duna mission was crewed by Valentina Kerman, star pilot, and Jagie Kerman, scientist and first-time kerbonaut.\n\nMission Plan: Valentina flies Nyx One into Duna Orbit, takes both spaceplanes to Duna and Nyx, and uses Valkyria III as the direct return vehicle bring all scientific data with her, while Jagie remains aboard Nyx One to study the data on-board laboratory and wait for low-consumption route home."}]}
