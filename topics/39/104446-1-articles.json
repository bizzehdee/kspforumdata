The population of Kerbals is declining.\n\nStarvation.\n\nThirst.\n\nFear.\n\nDeath.\n\nWe tried getting cures for the plants. We tried to get rid of the Citric Acid in the water. We tried everything.\n\nExcept one.\n\nMoving.\n\nWe need a new home. Sadly, there is no place to go.\n\nOr so everyone thought. Now we have a hope.\n\nThe Jool system. For the first time since the beggining of DMSP, Kerbin and Jool are lined up so we won\u0027t have to use more than 9,000m/s.\n\nOur craft is in orbit. The CSV Paulina. Two Landers, One Ranger. The crew is ready. Jool looks good.\n\nAnd we have a hope.\n\nI\u0027m leaving my family behind. But I have a chance to save them.\n\nTo save Kerbals from extinction.\n\nIt\u0027s a long shot, but at least it\u0027s a shot.\n\nThe crew of the CSV (Colony Set-up Vehicle) Paulina had been trained in secret years before the mission. Even they didn\u0027t know they were being trained. That was a time when no one in the public knew Kerbin was dying. It became obvious it was when Kerbals started dying because their water source became polluted with Citric Acid and food disappeared off of their plates. Panic followed. Governments were able to calm people down by saying they had a solution. Most people still alive on Kerbin believed. Space agencies sent out different bases and missions to the Mun, Minmus and even one to Duna. This was all in secret to make sure no one panicked again. All of the base projects failed, and most of the crews never saw home again. Some lucky ones got back, but the rest are still out there, either dead at their cold outposts or living off their greenhouse modules.\n\nJool has 5 moons. It causes tidal heating. Life might be on some of those moons. Jool is a chance. So everyone at DMSP took it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T17:47:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:24:11Z","Content":"More chapters will come tomorrow, or maybe even one tonight if I can get some photos uploaded."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T21:14:27Z","Content":"Looking forward to it!

He took in the rolling fields, towering mountains, and glinting oceans. *So long, Kerbin...*\n\nHis daughter, Staca Elo Kerman, ran into his arms.\n\nThen he told her everything about the mission.\n\nShe stopped smiling.\n\nShe turned around.\n\nAnd Staca stormed in the house and started crying.

He used force, tipping over the chair and making things fall off the desk.

He turned, and left Staca\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s room. He closed the door, and hugged his father in law, Dotmal. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWatch after Stac for me, Dotmal.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\n\nHe hopped into his off road rover and started the drive towards KSC. Only then did Staca come running out, screaming at her dad.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CStay! Dad! Daddy please Stay!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 She yelled into the dying light.\n\nSidrie, distracted by the sound of the four wheels beneath him and the tears dripping down his face, never heard Stac\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cries.\n\nAs Kerbol began to set, Sidrie turned his headlights on and parked on the side of the dirt. He stood on top of the rover\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s roof, and turned to look at his home, miles in the distance, its silhouette outlined against setting Kerbol. Only once Kerbol was below the horizon did he climb back in the rover and continue driving towards the mountains lying ahead.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:04:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T19:50:50Z","Content":"I\u0027ll put photos in really soon, I promise!"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T19:30:37Z","Content":"Looking forward to seeing the pics man!

The modified Jool-6 was now ready to go. Sidrie looked at his 3 other crew members. Newson, his *Science!* officer, Genson, the backup pilot and Rodbles, His main engineer. They were sitting inside Ranger-1, one of the two on the rocket adapter. He could see the excitement in their eyes, and the horror as well. They might never come back. They might not make it to Jool. They might never dock with the Paulina. Heck, they might never make it off the pad. But he knew they would.\n\n\u0022Two minutes to liftoff,\u0022 Announced Gane Kerman at Mission Control, \u0022All fuel pipes released, systems nominal!\u0022\n\nOne minute and 40 seconds later...\n\n\u002220 seconds!\u0022 Gane was tense. So were the crew inside Ranger-1. Sidrie, remembering, took a photo of Staca out and put it in the tight space behind one of the control panels.\n\n*I\u0027ll see you again...* Sidre thought.\n\n\u002210 seconds!\u0022\n\n\u00225\u0022\n\n\u00224\u0022\n\n\u00223\u0022\n\n\u00222\u0022\n\n\u00221, all 1st stage motors go, clamps released, and... we have a liftoff!\u0022 The force of the 1st stage\u0027s 20 rocket motors lifted the Rangers off the ground. The far left window was smudged, and it seemed to distort the blue sky and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. The M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, a source of pride for Kerbal-Kind. Also the grave of 37 Kerbals and 12 bases. The rocket pushed skywards.\n\n*5 minutes later...*\n\nSidrie took a quick glance at the first stage fuel. Almost empty. \n\n\u0022First stage burnout in 6 seconds!\u0022 He yelled over the 20 dying rocket motors. \u00223\u0022. \u00222\u0022. \u00221\u0022! The interstage seperated, and everyone and everything was thrown forward. The second stage ignited, clawing towards the dark vacuum of space.\n\n*3 hours later...*\n\nNewson was floating around the cases of personal belongings and last minute equipment when he spotted a glint out of the window. A grin spread across his face.\n\n\u0022Hello Paulina, nice to meet you!\u0022 He announced jokingly. Sidrie clambered over his chair and looked out of the window. The ring of modules reminded Sidrie of a clock. Rodbles let out a gasp in awe.\n\nThey now had seen their new home.\n\nGenson was stunned. \u0022Wow... What a wonder...\u0022 He looked wide eyed at the craft. He had constructed multiple parts of the craft, but seeing it fully assembled put him in awe.\n\nThe crew got to work setting up the Rangers for docking.\n\n*32 minutes later...*\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NvsfO5m2BU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSidrie was sitting at the controls, watching the Paulina through his window.\n\n\u0022Alright, separating Ranger-2!\u0022 Ranger-2 flew away from the adapter towards the ship, its autopilot docking sequence kicking in. The craft docked perfectly. \u0022Ok guys, strap in! It\u0027s our turn to dock! Ranger-1... Detached!\u0022 The Ranger and its crew flew away from the adapter and rotated to get in line with the port. Sidrie alined the Ranger and then started using the RCS to ease them towards it. When less than 30 centimeters away, the magnets on both docking ports brought the spacecraft together. \u0022And... docked\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes!\u0022 Genson was excited.\n\n\u0022Nice work Sidrie!\u0022 Newson was relived. The crew began by opening the front airlock.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T16:04:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:52:13Z","Content":"I wonder if anyone reads this..."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:54:04Z","Content":"[I just did, don\u0027t worry if people don\u0027t comment, it doesen\u0027t mean that they don\u0027t read it.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77509-Kerbal-Space-Porgram-The-Beginnings)"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T13:58:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [I just did, don\u0027t worry if people don\u0027t comment, it doesen\u0027t mean that they don\u0027t read it.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77509-Kerbal-Space-Porgram-The-Beginnings)\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nYeah, that\u0027s true, it takes some time to get followers.\n\nNice story BTW"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:04:45Z","Content":"This is so **\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9#Quiet**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:28:17Z","Content":"I write stories too, and trust me, you don\u0027t get views as fast as you think.
