The launch bunker and smelled of the sharp ozone tang of overheated electronics. The launch bunker smelled of the earthier scent of overheated kerbal. Geneney\u0027s head throbbed. He stifled a yawn amidst humming equipment and clacking keys while the flight control team worked their consoles. His glazed gaze hung on an overhead monitor whereupon endless expanses of numbers shifted like desert sands. Then it switched to show the grandstands: they were bursting! Geneney grinned at a great throng of kerbals that sat on the grass between the stands and the safety fence. \u003Cem\u003EEven after half a dozen launches, these guys just keep sitting here.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Show instead of telling to increase immersion. Instead of saying that Geneney \u0022was gratified to see\u0022 the bursting grandstands, show how his gratification affects him e.g., by writing that he \u0022grinned\u0022. Or replace narration with thoughts or dialogue, as I did above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Tell instead of showing to decrease immersion. Any form of literary \u0027technique,\u0027 be it motif, similie, alliteration, or pun informs the reader that they are reading an account, not attempting to experience. One can mimic the confusion of listening through a door by telling the reader what the characters beyond say instead of quoting it, omitting or making indirect information about their movements, or using the aforementioned \u0027techniques\u0027. In this case, use repeated boring, uncomfortable writing--simple sentences--to show the boredom and discomfort of the launch bunker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Simplify where possible. The word \u0022amidst,\u0022 for example, can be used to surround things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Check the accuracy of your onomatopoeia (sound words) by saying them aloud and looking for real examples thereof: keys thud and \u0022clack\u0022 whereas mice \u0022click\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022\u003C/strong\u003EWheels squeaked on concrete: the rest turned to see Wernher roll his chair around the corner of his console, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CJeb haz ey point.

Wernher Von Kerman is the KSP analogue to Wernher Von Braun and therefore must show the Kerbal equivalent of a German accent, and as a rocket scientist, he also likely spent little time learning the finer points of English: phonetically spell mispronounced words, randomly remove articles or otherwise necessary words, and insert incorrect ones. Wernher will thereby gain a distinct voice that can add richness and flavor to your story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) A brief phrase then a colon can create a causal effect wherein the cause is before the colon and the effect is after, e.g., \u0022He fired: the building exploded into a cloud of dust and splinters!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Like fireflies through a cavern had the Kerbal Interplanetary Society flown through its early days: with swat of failure or bite of frustration each fell, rent bodies upward gleaming.

Beware unnecessary commas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Combine many words into one word, \u0022kept going despite X\u0022 can be replaced with \u0022overcame X\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) When attemping \u0027epic\u0027 language, use metaphor with emotional torque. Nothing is more evocative, striking, or haunting.

It\u0027s good work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T11:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatupi - this one\u0027s for you...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBeyond Kerbin\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single shaft of sunlight peeped through a gap in the shutters, illuminating the chin of a kerbal sprawled out fast asleep on his bed. As Kerbol rose into the clear morning sky, the shaft crept upwards until it brushed silently over one large green eyelid, suffusing it with a soft green glow and revealing a faint tracery of blood vessels beneath the skin. The eyelid twitched and then suddenly it snapped open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb blinked and sat bolt upright, automatically checking the time on his alarm clock. His eyes widened and he jumped out of bed, frantically scrabbling around for his clothes. Half past ten! Everyone would have been waiting in the yard for hours! Then, as he reached for his shirt, it occurred to him that it was oddly quiet outside. No mutter of voices, no banging on the warehouse door. Nothing at all in fact, to suggest that a crowd of impatient kerbals was milling around outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it all came back. The failed M\u00FCn flight, the beach party... and Genie\u0027s parting words reminding everyone not to come into work until the afternoon. Jeb winced as he also remembered his last mug of beer and conversation with Ornie. \u003Cem\u003EGoing to have to apologise for that, Jeb\u003C/em\u003E, \u00A0he thought to himself, as he swung the shutters open, letting the crisp autumn sunlight flood into the room. Across the road could see the first dusting of frost on the ground. A brittle skim of ice sparkled on the puddles in the road, dazzling him with reflections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned as he took in a deep lungful of chilly air. Plenty of time for a long shower, a good hot breakfast and then maybe a quick stroll to clear the last of the beer fog from his wits before everyone else turned up for work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb scraped the mud off his boots and sauntered across the warehouse towards the canteen, whistling the tune from the \u003Cem\u003EBallad of the Kerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E and chuckling as be remembered Bob\u0027s lyrics from the night before. There was a clattering of mugs and then the rattling of a stuck drawer, followed by a crash and a muttered oath as the drawer popped open, spilling its contents over the floor. Presently though, there was a cheerful burbling noise and the scent of fresh coffee filled the air. Jeb emerged from the canteen clutching a large steaming mug and made his way over to his office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwiftly he sorted through the pile of rolled up strip charts covering his desk, setting the recordings from the LV-T20 to one side and unrolling the charts for the four LV905s. A quick look was enough to convince him that the 905s were not responsible for the loss of the \u003Cem\u003EMuna 1 \u003C/em\u003Ebut they \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E been running slightly hot before the explosion, which was a problem all by itself. Jeb sipped his coffee as he pored over the charts, rapidly becoming engrossed in the thin squiggles of ink from the telemetry recorders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last of his coffee had long since gone cold when Jeb straightened up from the strip charts and pushed his notebook to one side. He dug his fists into the small of his back and stretched, grimacing as his spine popped in protest. He rolled his shoulders, mentally reviewing his analysis of the telemetry data and then nodded in satisfaction. He would need to talk things over with the propulsion team but he was reasonably confident that the overheating could be traced back to a problem with the pressurisation valve calibration. The overheating was obviously down to excess propellant flow into the engines and the excess was sufficiently similar for all four engines that a mechanical error seemed unlikely. Jeb made a note to get one of the spare 905s up onto the test stand after lunch and then glanced up at the clock.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPerfect,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0he thought happily.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ETime to open up for the day and then grab a quick bite to eat before everyone else arrives.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jeb walked over to the warehouse doors, he thought he \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E hear voices outside. He smiled to himself. \u003Cem\u003ENot even friendly threats from Genie could deter everyone from turning up to work early\u003C/em\u003E, he thought. The bolts on the side door were sticking slightly and squealed in protest as he worked them back and forth. Finally, he forced them back with a sudden metallic clack and swung the door open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s jaw dropped, as the entire Kerbin Interplanetary Society poured around him into the warehouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThought this place was never going to open,\u0022\u00A0somebody called out cheerfully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah,\u0022\u00A0came the good-natured reply, \u201CSome of us have got a rocket to build today!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAt least the boss has been up long enough to get the coffee on!\u0022\u00A0called out a third voice, as everyone hurried over to their benches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb closed the door behind him and then fell into step beside Geneney and Ornie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sniffed the air appreciatively and then looked at Jeb apologetically. \u201CLooks like you were right about taking some time out,\u0022\u00A0he said. \u0022It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve seen the gang this eager to get to work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded. \u0022Something we should do more often,\u0022\u00A0he agreed, \u201Cand it wouldn\u0027t hurt to do a little more to celebrate our \u003Cem\u003Esuccessful\u003C/em\u003E launches too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned at him.\u00A0\u201CThe \u003Cem\u003Elaunch\u003C/em\u003E was perfectly successful,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CIt was just the flying into space part that didn\u0027t go quite to plan. Speaking of which, I think I\u0027ve figured out the overheating we saw with the 905s. I\u0027d appreciate a second opinion on the numbers though, if you\u0027ve got a minute?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure,\u0022\u00A0said Ornie, \u201CGene - could I have a word later? I need to see what our inventory is like for the 905 gimbals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhenever you\u0027re ready, Ornie, although I think we\u0027ve got everything you need in stock for the rest of the 905s. I\u0027ll be over with the payload team when you need me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Jeb walked back to his office with Ornie, he flicked a quick sideways glance at his friend. \u201CI think I owe you an apology too, Ornie,\u0022\u00A0he said quietly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie\u0027s forehead crinkled. \u201CWhat on Kerbin for, Jeb?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb didn\u0027t reply for a moment. \u201CFor last night,\u0022\u00A0he said eventually, \u201CI have to confess that the details are a touch hazy but I definitely remember the conversation turning more than a little bitter towards the end.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie\u0027s face cleared. \u201COh that,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201CDon\u0027t worry about it, Jeb. Sounded like you\u0027d needed to get that off your chest for quite a while.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded gratefully. \u201CI think I did, Ornie - thanks.\u0022\u00A0He pushed open his office door. \u201CAnyway - about those 905s. I\u0027m thinking that we\u0027ve got a little problem with our test stand is all...\u0022\u00A0The two kerbals bent their heads over the strip charts littered over Jeb\u0027s desk, Ornie tapping his fingers thoughtfully as Jeb flipped open his notebook and started pointing out various underlined numbers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater that afternoon, Jeb finally made his way back to the canteen for a long overdue lunch. As he rummaged around in the fridge, he could hear the the propulsion team arguing over the LV-T20 telemetry. The canteen televsion was deliberately placed to be visible from behind the kitchen counter and Jeb was able to keep half an eye on the KBS news bulletin as he chopped up left over potatoes and meatcakes and tossed them into a pan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Meatcake hash and ketchup!\u0022 he announced, taking a seat beside Bob. \u0022The recommended lunch of rocket scientists everywhere.\u0022 The rest of the table were too caught up in conversation to notice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere\u0027s no way it was the bearings!\u0022\u00A0said Malmy. \u201CNo matter which way you look at the turbopump strips, there\u0027s just no sign of any wobble at all. I\u0027m telling you - something fell into the fuel manifold and chewed up the blades.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher scowled. \u201CWhich doesn\u0027t explain why everything was working perfectly right up until the loss of vehicle. Besides - there\u0027s nothing \u003Cem\u003E to \u003C/em\u003E \u0027fall into the fuel manifold\u0027. I suppose one of the slosh baffles might have fallen off but they\u0027re far too big to do any harm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMalmy shrugged, \u201CMaybe it got caught on one of the baffles and didn\u0027t come loose until the booster pitched over past a certain point. I don\u0027t know. All I know is what I\u0027m seeing from the flight recorders and they\u0027re just not consistent with impeller flutter.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie raised his hands in a placating gesture. \u201CEasy, guys. Wernher - assume for the sake of argument that it was debris in the fuel line that broke the turbopump. What can we do about that? Can we fit a filter over the manifold inlet or something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher took a bite of his sandwich. \u201CWe already do put a filter there. I could redesign it but it\u0027s not as easy as you might think. A coarse filter is next to useless but I don\u0027t really want to fit anything too fine in case it causes too much of a pressure drop across the inlet. At best that gives us poorer performance...\u0022,\u00A0he swallowed a mouthful of cheese, \u201Cand at worst it gives us turbulence and possibly cavitation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll four kerbals winced. \u201CGood safety tip, Wernher,\u0022\u00A0remarked Hando, \u201Clets try not to do that if possible.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded. \u201CI\u0027m not sure we have time to redesign the filters for the next launch anyway,\u0022\u00A0he said reluctantly. \u0022We\u0027ll need to take a long hard look at the tank design for the Moho 4 but for the Muna 2, I think we\u0027ll have to go with what we\u0027ve got and just make sure to triple check everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that moment, the picture on the television screen changed from that of a group of kerbals sitting around a table to a view over a launch site. A news ticker down the left hand side of the screen announced that this was the maiden launch of the Rockomax BA-CA solid rocket booster. Malmy scrambled to his feet and turned up the volume.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C... latest generation of solid rocket booster, augmented by additional laterally mounted B1 boosters. For those just joining us now, the second stage is a single B1 solid rocket and the final stage uses clustered 48-7D liquid fueled engines for a precision insertion into kerbostationary orbit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHando turned back to his lunch. \u201CKerbostationary orbit huh? Impressive but there\u0027s a long way between Kerbin orbit and the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie wasn\u0027t so sure. He casually looked around the canteen and, as he expected, Jeb, Lucan and Edsen were all staring intently at the Rockomax spacecraft. Jeb caught his eye and surreptitiously beckoned him over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAre you thinking what I\u0027m thinking, Ornie?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI think I probably am, Jeb. And if I\u0027m not, our flight dynamics team almost certainly are.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen and Hanbal stood behind the flight director\u0027s chair, eyes flicking between the status indicators on her control board and the orbital tracking screen on the far wall. Nelton briefly considered exercising flight director\u0027s privilege and ejecting them both from Mission Control, or at least putting them somewhere where they couldn\u0027t breath down her ear. Then she shrugged. She could hardly blame them for wanting to be here, she thought and besides - they might just be useful. Provided that they kept their mouths shut until asked and kept out from under the feet of the rest of the team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Approaching max Q. B1 thrust profile nominal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton put the two engineers out of her mind. \u0022Thank you, Booster,\u0022 she said, \u0022Flight Dynamics - status please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Airframe stresses acceptable, Flight. Ascent trajectory is good. Launch vehicle has passed max Q.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehind her she could sense Danfen relaxing slightly. Hanbal\u0027s head was still restlessly swivelling from side to side as he tried to follow all the readouts for the B1s. Nelton rolled her chair to one side to give him a better view over her shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thirty seconds to burnout. Decouplers one through four armed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that, Booster. All systems Go for staging.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pattern of indicator lights on Nelton\u0027s control board abruptly shifted and one panel flickered and went out. She leaned forward in her seat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lateral booster detach confirmed. Backer status please, Booster?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022BA-CA thrust on profile, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Booster. Guidance?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re go, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight Dynamics?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Altitude 24 kilometres and climbing, Flight. Vehicle attitude is nominal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal let his breath out explosively. \u0022It worked,\u0022 he murmured under his breath, \u0022it actually worked.\u0022 Danfen nudged his arm. \u0022Keep the analysis out of earshot would you,\u0022 he whispered. Hanbal ducked his head and then turned his attention back to the tracking screen. The stylised rocket depicting Satellite 4 had barely moved, although the altitude and velocity readouts were clicking upwards on schedule. He watched as the projected altitude climbed past 75 kilometres and continued to rise. \u0022Any moment now,\u0022 he thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Approaching MECO, Flight. Decoupler five armed and ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Backer shutdown in three...two...one. Decoupler firing.\u0022 There was a long pause. \u0022Second stage ignition confirmed!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Flight Dynamics. Payload?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey hands shook as he worked his console. \u0022Fairing jettisoned on schedule, Flight. Instrumentation looks good. Bringing propulsion and guidance systems online.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton nodded. \u0022Thank you, Payload.\u0022 A green light lit up on her console. \u0022Flight Dynamics, I have a projected periapsis - please confirm.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy that,\u00A0Flight. Twenty seconds to shutdown. Projected orbit two-forty by one-sixty\u00A0by plus twelve. Altitude raising burn in thirty-one\u00A0minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen squeezed Hanbal\u0027s shoulder. \u0022Time for us to take a break and pass on the good news,\u0022 he murmured. The two engineers nodded politely to Nelton and made their way quietly out of the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as the door to Mission Control closed behind them, Hanbal punched the air in triumph. \u0022It worked - it really worked! Tapered propellant loading on the B1s, lateral decouplers - it all went off without a hitch!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen beamed at him. \u0022It really did! Gotta hand it to you - I never actually thought you could throttle down the B1s that far in \u003Cem\u003Eflight\u003C/em\u003E and bring them back up to stable thrust. That was fine work!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHanbal grinned \u0022Truthfully?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know, I know,\u0022 laughed Danfen, \u0022neither did you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well it all worked on the test stand so I \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E have been surprised.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanfen chuckled at the old joke. \u0022True, true. Anyway, we\u0027ve got a little over an hour before the big test. Just got time to go thank the troops before we point our baby at the M\u00FCn!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe glowing green trace on the tracking screen showed Satellite 4 in an almost perfectly circular orbit around Kerbin, although Nelton knew that was more due to the scale of the display than anything else. A small red circle blinked slowly against the orbital track with a timer display beside it slowly unwinding down to zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton rubbed her suddenly sweaty palms on the arms of her chair. She leaned forward and tapped her microphone for attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All controllers report in for trans-Munar injection. Payload?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey swallowed the lump in his throat. \u0022Go, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guidance?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re Go, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Electrics?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Looking good, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Flight Dynamics?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go for TMI, Flight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove their heads, the Satellite 4 marker inched its way round the screen. As it passed over the edge of the blinking circle, the red colour shifted to orange and a flashing \u002722\u0027 symbol appeared on Melvey\u0027s console. He scanned the propulsion and guidance readouts on his console one last time, crossed his fingers and punched the \u0027Proceed\u0027 button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ullage motors are go. 48-7D ignition confirmed.\u0022 Melvey watched as the readings on his console settled down. \u0022All engines burning,\u0022 he reported, \u0022vernier firing pattern looks good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you, Payload.

Verniers looking good, spacecraft attitude holding steady and tracking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone in the control room tilted their heads up to watch the flight tracking screen. A dotted elliptical tongue began to protrude out from the solid green line marking the known Satellite 4 orbit. Slowly at first and then faster and faster, the tongue stretched away from Kerbin towards the white circle depicting the M\u00FCn. Melvey watched his readouts, finger hovering over the manual shutdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u0027t needed. The dotted line flickered as the flight computer updated its trajectory prediction and then snapped into an extremely lopsided figure-eight configuration with the M\u00FCn sitting squarely in the smaller of the two loops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C48-7D shutdown confirmed, Flight,\u0022 said Melvey quietly. \u201CDeploying cameras and orienting vehicle for Kerbin observation programme.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Payload,\u0022\u00A0said Nelton.\u00A0\u201CFlight Dynamics - do we have a trajectory confirmation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COne moment, Flight.\u0022 Lemgan spoke quickly into his microphone, cocking his head as the answer came back through his headset.\u00A0\u201COur tracking team report that they have the vehicle. Jerdo\u0027s team are having some problems with their antenna which is slowing things down a little. We estimate 5-6 hours for initial fix, another two to three\u00A0hours after that for confirmation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton grimaced. \u201CSix hundred miles is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E enough of a baseline. If we\u0027re going to be doing this on a regular basis, Ademone needs to see about getting us another tracking station. Will nine hours give us enough time to work through the midorbit correction?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNot a problem, Flight. First correction burn was scheduled for ground elapsed time \u002Beighteen hours but we have a reasonable window with our remaining propellant levels. Suggest we delay the burn to GET \u002Btwenty-two\u00A0to give Tracking and Guidance a little more time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNoted and accepted, Flight Dynamics. Thank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COK, thanks, Sigbin. Can you send through the next lot of frequency shifts in thirty minutes or so? Yeah I know - chasing down Rockomax isn\u0027t the trial run I was expecting either. Huh - I guess. Might as well get the bugs ironed out before we give it another go ourselves. OK, speak to you in thirty. Thanks, Sigbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan put the phone down and ground the heels of his hands into his eyes. Beside him, Edsen threw his pen down on the table and turned to face Ornie, Jeb and Geneney\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CKerbostationary orbit, my cheeks!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb sighed. \u201CYou\u0027re sure then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPositive.\u0022\u00A0Edsen shook his head. \u201CTracking data isn\u0027t good enough to give us a trajectory yet but that spacecraft is going way beyond a stationary orbit. Look.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen reached for a sheet of paper and quickly sketched out a diagram. \u201CWe\u0027ve still got a large error space here but I figure their trajectory is somewhere in between this... and this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb scratched his cheek as he looked at the roughed out orbits. \u201CWhat\u0027s the centreline estimate?\u0022\u00A0he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen drew a third line on the diagram. \u201CMunar flyby, 1000 km periapsis. Give or take.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWould that work? For the Prize I mean.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney was picking at a piece of loose insulation poking out of the top of Lucan\u0027s console. \u201CI\u0027d want to check with Bill first but my best guess is no. Not reliably. The picture quality would be pretty bad from that altitude - hard to prove anything.\u0022He studied Edsen\u0027s diagram.\u201CAnd if this is anywhere near to scale, they\u0027d have problems transmitting the data back too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell then,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb, \u201CIt sounds like they\u0027re planning a midcourse correction of some kind. I think we just wait for the next lot of data from Sigbin and Doodlie, try and sharpen up that tracking and see if we can work out what they\u0027re up to from there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked at him, \u201CSo what do we tell everyone in the meantime, Jeb?\u0022\u00A0he said. Jeb frowned. \u201CWe tell them what we know,\u0022\u00A0he said at last, \u201CBetter that they get the bad news from us than KBS.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey was hunched over his console, paging back and forth through the first images from Satellite 4, when he heard the door open and the rest of the team file back into the control room. Nelton took her seat and checked the flight tracking screen. The dotted figure 8 had gone, replaced by a sinuous line that snaked out from Kerbin and curved gently around the M\u00FCn before disappearing off the edge of the screen. She tapped her microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CA good try for a first attempt,\u0022\u00A0she said, \u201Cbut not quite what we need. Lemgan - do we have a burn solution for the midcourse correction?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe do, Flight. Guidance and trajectory teams concur.\u0022\u00A0Lemgan pressed a button on his console. \u201CAn eight metre per second\u00A0burn here...\u0022\u00A0he pressed another button,\u201Calong this vector, should put us back on the nominal flight plan.\u0022\u00A0On the screen, another red circle appeared, with an arrow pointing away along the burn vector. A dotted line curved away from the circle and into the predicted figure-eight path around the M\u00FCn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CVery good. Payload - what is the spacecraft status please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey twisted his chair round to face her. \u201CAll instruments deployed, Flight,\u0022he said,\u00A0\u201Cand I have the first images from the Kerbin observation sequence. I think you\u0027ll find them interesting.\u0022\u00A0He flicked a switch and one of the large monitors next to the flight tracking screen lit up. There was a clatter as one of the other flight controllers dropped his pen. Not a single one of the other controllers so much as twitched at the noise. Even Nelton sank back into her chair and gazed at the glowing blue and green sphere neatly filling the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eround!\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she whispered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe colour filters are working well,\u0022\u00A0said Melvey. \u201Cbut that\u0027s not the most interesting part.\u0022\u00A0He brought up another image.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis one was taken just a couple of hours ago. We\u0027re a lot further from Kerbin now of course but as you\u0027ll note, the image is also a lot noisier.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemgan peered at the screen.\u201CIs there a problem with the camera?\u0022\u00A0he asked, \u201Ca loose feed causing static or something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey shook his head. \u201CThe camera systems are fine. It\u0027s the environment the camera is flying through that\u0027s the problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Radiation,\u0022said Nelton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey blinked. \u201CYes. We expected some background radiation of course, mainly charged particles ejected from Kerbol. We also did our best to shield the cameras but there\u0027s a limit to the amount of shielding we could use, given the payload mass requirements. As it turns out, this may have been a happy accident.\u0022He tapped a key on his console and the images on the monitor began to cycle past in a crude and rather jerky film clip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took Lemgan a while to work out what he was seeing. \u201CHang on,\u0022\u00A0he said slowly, \u201Cthe noise is fluctuating.\u0022 He jabbed a finger towards the screen. \u201CThere! Stop the film there.\u0022\u00A0He swivelled his chair to face Nelton. \u201CLook. Just as noisy as that last still shot but a lot closer to Kerbin too. Melvey - could you move the film on a few frames?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey smiled faintly and tapped at his console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere!\u0022\u00A0said Lemgan. \u201CFurther out from Kerbin but the noise has dropped away again!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLike rings,\u0022\u00A0said Nelton wonderingly, \u201Crings of invisible particles wrapped around Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMelvey coughed. \u201CI imagined them more like belts, myself,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cbut obviously we don\u0027t have enough data to tell.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton smiled. \u201CThen that\u0027s what we\u0027ll call them in our research paper,\u0022\u00A0she said, \u201CThe Melvey Radiation Belts!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=707603\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E Chapter 20\u003C/a\u003E :: \u00A0 \u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30718-first-flight-chapter-101-a-is-for-acorn/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=754964\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChapter 22\u003C/a\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-13T07:02:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2019 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Danish_Savage","CreatedById":49194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T20:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good chapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.troll.me/images/stifler-thumbs-up/well-done.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022well-done.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Would you please put all the chapters up in your blog.

As he let himself in, he was relieved to see the light still on in Jeb\u0027s office, even if it didn\u0027t do much more than highlight the looming shadows in the darker corners of the assembly area. His footsteps echoed as he strode across the warehouse floor and Edsen had to remind himself rather forcefully that the half-seen shapes hanging from the ceiling were just the old familiar sections of fuel tank and not anything more sinister.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe knocked on the office door and poked his head round the doorframe. Geneney and Jeb looked startled as he came in but then Jeb leapt to his feet to greet him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEdsen! What news from the bunker?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen blinked in the sudden warmth and sneezed violently. As he shrugged out of his soaking raincoat, Geneney pressed a large mug of hot \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E into his hands, which Edsen sipped at gratefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks, Gene. It\u0027s not pleasant out there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCome and take a seat. Is Lucan still out at the bunker?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen nodded. \u201CStill working away. I\u0027ll take him some food when I head back over. I don\u0027t suppose you have any smoky sapwood do you, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb raised his eyebrows. \u201CNow why on Kerbin would I keep that muck around my office. Tastes like wet firework ashes - and trust me, I should know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m sure there\u0027s a fascinating story right there,\u0022\u00A0said Geneney dryly. \u201CThere\u0027s a couple of cans left in the canteen, Edsen. I think Lucan is about the only one that drinks it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen took a gulp of his \u003Cem\u003Edjeng\u003C/em\u003E, greedily inhaling its fragrant steam. He patted his lips dry and carefully put the mug down on the edge of Jeb\u0027s desk. Geneney and Jeb looked at him expectantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027ve got a trajectory plotted for the Rockomax probe. We think they\u0027re trying for a free return trajectory but if they are, they\u0027ll need to make a midcourse correction burn sometime tomorrow morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s eyelids drooped as he worked through the implications. \u201CThat makes sense,\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201Cone less burn to worry about, although they\u0027d better be sure where they\u0027re pointing their cameras if they\u0027re only getting one chance to get what they need.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COr they could do what we did and put the probe into a slow spin,\u0022 said Geneney, \u201CIt wouldn\u0027t give them as much useful data but it would be something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTrue. It won\u0027t help them much if their attitude is really cockeyed but if they pull off that course correction that\u0027ll be a solved problem anyway. Thanks Edsen - that\u0027s good to know.\u0022\u00A0Jeb reached for his own mug. \u201CLooks like the Probodyne Prize has gone then but at least the Muna 2 will be the first probe to \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E the M\u00FCn rather than just trundling round it and back to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIt\u0027s not going to be much of a consolation prize for the team though,\u0022said Geneney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb stared down at the floor. \u201CYeah, I know, Genie - I know. The money would have come in handy too, no doubt about it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen couldn\u0027t help himself. \u201CIt would have paid for a phone line between here and the bunker if nothing else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s head jerked upright. \u201CThere \u003Cem\u003E is \u003C/em\u003E a phone line, or at least there used to be. That explains why you came all the way out here in person then - I did wonder.\u0022\u00A0He frowned. \u201CI\u0027ll take a look at that tomorrow. What sort of launch control bunker can talk to an orbiting spacecraft but can\u0027t make a simple phone call.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen yawned. \u201CThanks, Jeb. I\u0027d better be heading back there now - Lucan will be getting hungry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stood up. \u201CI\u0027ll go, Edsen - you look dead on your feet. It\u0027ll be pointless trying to persuade Lucan to go home but I should at least remind him that there\u0027s a folding bed and a heater in the corner of the bunker. That probe isn\u0027t going anywhere else tonight.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe couch in here makes a pretty good bed too,\u0022\u00A0said Jeb cheerfully, \u201Cand somebody even replaced the spare toothbrush.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen\u0027s head was drooping on his shoulders. \u201C...know...\u0022\u00A0he said, \u201C...put it back myself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemgan peered through the glass door into the Mission Control room. Most of the flight controllers were already at their stations, a semicircle of green heads poking out above the high backed chairs, headsets clamped firmly over their ears. The viewing area around the edges of the room was packed with kerbals, all leaning against the balcony rail and staring up at the orbital tracking screen. Just inside the doorway, a prominently placed signboard read \u0027Quiet Please - Mission in Progress\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside in the corridor, a shuffling crowd of Rockomax workers were pressed up against the long curved windows, all trying to get the best view they could of the screens. Lemgan squared his shoulders and pushed the door open. Everyone in the viewing area turned to watch as he walked down the steps towards the consoles, took his seat and plugged in his own headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter satisfying himself that the Satellite 4 position and trajectory were still within expected values, Lemgan set to work, occasionally calling up one of his colleagues on a private loop to consult them on a particular detail of the guidance or propulsion systems. Just as he flipped over the next page of his checklist there was a crackle from the comms system as Nelton\u0027s voice cut in on all loops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CGood morning everyone. All controllers report in please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemgan listened to the systems reports as they came in one by one. Above his head, the timer on the orbital tracking screen rolled over from 1:00:00 to 0:59:59.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFlight Dynamics?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u0027re Go at fifty-eight minutes Flight. Spacecraft is in stellar inertial. Orienting for burn at MC minus forty.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdemone gripped the balcony rail tightly as the clock ticked down. The monitor still showed Kerbin floating in space, although the cloud cover made it difficult to pick out surface details. Sheer distance from Satellite 4 had reduced the atmosphere to nothing more than a thin glowing line, wrapped around the edges of a diminishing disc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNelton glanced down at her console and gave a guilty start at the comm system settings. As she clicked one of the dials round a notch, there was a soft hissing noise out in the corridor as the public address loop came to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemgan took a deep breath and switched his console to conference mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMC minus six. How do you read, Melvey?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAll s..systems go Lemgan. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tank pressure is high but acceptable, steady current to all propellant line heaters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CLooks good, Melvey.

Guess we\u0027re as ready as we\u0027ll ever be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLemgan put his console back to public mode. \u201CFlight, this is Flight Dynamics. We\u0027re Go for reorientation.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUnderstood, Flight Dynamics. Thank you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E firing in 3...2...1...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin began a stately drift across the monitor and slowly disappeared off screen. For a long moment, there was nothing to see as Satellite 4 revolved silently agains the backdrop of space. Then, along one edge of the screen, a thin grey crescent appeared and slowly spun into view. Without an atmosphere to wrap it in a diffuse halo of light, the M\u00FCn stood out starkly against the blackness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u0027s about what we\u0027re seeing too Sigbin. Looks like they had a pretty clean burn. Has Doodlie had any luck decoding their transmissions? No? Pity - it would be nice to get a look at whatever pictures they\u0027re sending back. KBS - oh Kerm yes. They\u0027ll be all over this. Yeah, don\u0027t blame you. We\u0027re going to sign off here as well. Thanks Sigbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdsen slumped into his chair. \u201CWell that\u0027s that then.\u0022\u00A0He looked at Lucan\u0027s crumpled clothing and stubbled chin. \u201CAt least we were right about the free-return.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan stared at him and then flopped down on his bed. \u201CYep.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u0027m going to shut everything down.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CFine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne by one, the displays on Edsen\u0027s console flickered and went out. He walked over and switched off Lucan\u0027s console at the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CC\u0027mon Lucan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clean salty sea air smelt remarkably good after the enclosed fug of the launch bunker as Edsen switched off the lights and locked the door behind him. The two kerbals climbed into Edsen\u0027s car and drove away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConversation on the assembly floor was muted and for the most part, limited to strictly technical matters. Even the noise of the engine tests out in the yard didn\u0027t seem as loud as usual although, Adelan thought, that was more to do with the thicker blast shields around the test stand than anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lathe beeped, as the turret returned to its index position and the motor switched itself off. Adelan picked up a micrometer and began to check over the newly machined pusher rod. Satisfied that the part was within tolerance, she put it down on the bench with the others and loaded a new billet onto the lathe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin and Ordun walked past pushing a half assembled LV-T20 on it\u0027s trolley. \u201CYou got those valve heads ready, Adelan?\u0022 Ordun called out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCouple more rods to turn yet,\u0022\u00A0said Adelan, \u201Cbut valve heads are next on the list.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCheers, Adelan. Good to see someone looking halfway happy with their work too. I\u0027ve never seen such a miserable bunch as the tankage team this morning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin swung the trolley round. \u201CHaving your M\u00FCn rocket go boom will do that,\u0022\u00A0he said equably, \u201Cspecially when somebody else\u0027s M\u00FCn rocket is about to make it there in one piece.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPfff. I\u0027m with Gene. We gave it our best shot - and we got a damn fine party out of it if nothing else. If we\u0027d just come back here, started plugging away at the next rocket - and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E got the news about Rockomax today... well I might have been a bit grumpy then. And Kerm\u0027s sake, Richlin - it was only a box of electronics that went boom. It could have been Adelan sitting on top of that booster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdelan rolled her eyes. \u201CThanks, Ordun.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrdun grinned. \u201CDon\u0027t mention it. Besides that\u0027s why we have abort systems right?\u0022 He pulled out a radio from his pocket. \u201CI don\u0027t know about you two but I \u003Cem\u003E want \u003C/em\u003E to find out what\u0027s happening out at the M\u00FCn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201C....rollers are preparing to put Satellite 4 into a controlled spin before it passes around the far side of the M\u00FCn. According to Flight Dynamics officer Lemgan, this will ensure that Satellite 4 can photograph as much of the M\u00FCn as possible on its single pass.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThis is Leland Kerman at Rockomax Mission Control. The atmosphere here is tense but controlled as Satellite 4 plunges towards the M\u00FCn. Payload officer Melvey reports that everything is Go for the spin up maneuver.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAnd 3..2..1... ignition. Well not ignition precisely as this maneuver will only be using the spacecraft reaction control system. The propellant for the main engines was of course used up nearly three days ago for trans-Munar injection. One of the main screens at Mission Control is showing the view from the onboard cameras and I\u0027m watching the M\u00FCn start to spin.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThat\u0027s odd. Two of the flight controllers are crossing the room to speak to Flight Director Nelton...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201COh and this doesn\u0027t look good. The M\u00FCn is spinning faster now and it\u0027s starting to slide off the screen. I think we may have a problem here...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJEB!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb came skidding up to Adelan\u0027s workbench. \u201CWhat...!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrdun raised a finger to his lips and then pointed at the radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThis is Leland Kerman at Rockomax Mission Control. The spacecraft is off course in an uncontrolled tumble. We\u0027re waiting for an update from the flight control team but at this time it appears that one of the reaction control thrusters is stuck on...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Above my head, I can see the main orbital tracking screen. The picture has just changed from showing the M\u00FCn and Kerbin to showing the M\u00FCn only. I think those two dotted lines are possible new trajectories. One of them gets very close to the surface indeed. It looks like the spacecraft will stay in orbit but it may not stay in a high enough orbit to make it safely round...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CAnd we\u0027ve just lost contact with the probe. Loss of signal happened a few seconds later than expected and the guidance team are now using that information to measure the spacecraft trajectory more accurately...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u201CThe dotted lines have gone.... and they\u0027ve been replaced by a single unbroken line. Wait, wait one moment. Flight Dynamics reports that the periapsis, that is the lowest point of approach to the M\u00FCn, will be no more than 4 kilometres. If all goes well, Mission Control will re-acquire contact with Satellite 4 in approximately 19 minutes...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe assembly floor was silent as every kerbal in the building gathered round Ordun\u0027s radio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Reaquisition in 2 minutes...
