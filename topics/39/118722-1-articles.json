Particularly since the design of the Yamato and the techniques for animating it had changed subtly. Fans would\u0027ve noticed even without the new additions to the Yamato - so the theory goes that the producers mandated the change to discourage the animators from even THINKING about it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I hesitate to call it a true logo or something suitable for a planted Flag. The anchor by itself with no other reference is pretty generic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for the 2199 reboot - they added a LOT of insignia bits everywhere! Uniforms are more detailed, often with mission patches or squadron patches. There are well-defined flags and proper insignia in use and they are used consistently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(They even went back to an old episode of the original series and extrapolated the official symbol and flag for the Gamilas in the new series based on a design for a medal pinned on General Domel\u0027s (Lysis) chest by Desslok that only appears for like 1-2 seconds of time!! I don\u0027t remember seeing that design anywhere else in the original series, but the producers of the new show decided that if they were going to have a symbol for the Gamilas then by god it was going to be based on SOMETHING from the original series no matter how hard they had to hunt to find it! Now that\u0027s dedication to the original concept!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhem... anyway. That\u0027s why when looking for insignia or flags from Yamato you\u0027re much more likely to find stuff to use from the new series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for the Yamato herself? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact there are a couple of them, both worn as mission patches on uniforms. (Links to cleaned up versions of both designs \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.deviantart.com/art/Space-Battleship-Yamato-2199-Yamato-Shoulder-Patch-328878832\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.deviantart.com/art/Yamato-2199-Yamato-Flight-Jacket-Patch-328701714\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I didn\u0027t include them in the designs above because they were -ironically, considering my above notes- a little \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Etoo specific\u003C/span\u003E to Yamato herself. One even has the silhouette of the ship on the patch, so unless you\u0027re actually building the Yamato herself in KSP, why would you want that particular design?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want one, I could make one from those designs.

This was also when the white stripes were painted onto the main guns barrels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Yellow anchor in the above designs is very similar in design to that old anchor by the way - and is yet another callback to the original series design cues among many that endear the new series to us old grognards. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat painted anchor design (and the gun stripes) was added in the movie \u0022Be Forever Yamato\u0022 and carried through Yamato Series 3 and Final Yamato. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was some fan speculation that the addition of the anchor and stripes was to prevent the animators from re-using animation from earlier series - such as the classic \u0022Yamato cruises past the camera\u0022 shots. Particularly since the design of the Yamato and the techniques for animating it had changed subtly. Fans would\u0027ve noticed even without the new additions to the Yamato - so the theory goes that the producers mandated the change to discourage the animators from even THINKING about it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I hesitate to call it a true logo or something suitable for a planted Flag. The anchor by itself with no other reference is pretty generic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for the 2199 reboot - they added a LOT of insignia bits everywhere! Uniforms are more detailed, often with mission patches or squadron patches. There are well-defined flags and proper insignia in use and they are used consistently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(They even went back to an old episode of the original series and extrapolated the official symbol and flag for the Gamilas in the new series based on a design for a medal pinned on General Domel\u0027s (Lysis) chest by Desslok that only appears for like 1-2 seconds of time!! I don\u0027t remember seeing that design anywhere else in the original series, but the producers of the new show decided that if they were going to have a symbol for the Gamilas then by god it was going to be based on SOMETHING from the original series no matter how hard they had to hunt to find it! Now that\u0027s dedication to the original concept!) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhem... anyway. That\u0027s why when looking for insignia or flags from Yamato you\u0027re much more likely to find stuff to use from the new series. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for the Yamato herself? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact there are a couple of them, both worn as mission patches on uniforms.

One even has the silhouette of the ship on the patch, so unless you\u0027re actually building the Yamato herself in KSP, why would you want that particular design?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want one, I could make one from those designs. Not difficult. But that\u0027s the reason I didn\u0027t include them in my posts above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - that\u0027s probably WAY too much answer to a simple question. So I apologize, but I kind of reflexively grab any excuse to fan geek on Yamato. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey!
