It\u0027s UpsilonAerospace.\n\nAs some of you older forum junkies know, I can art! I actually have a little experience making graphic novels (mostly very short ones for friends). \n\nI\u0027m going to try to put all that art to work over the next several months as I make a KSP graphic novel in my free time! It won\u0027t be top-quality, perhaps, but it will be a heartfelt and fun effort. Stay tuned.\n\nMy (WIP) KSP Graphic Novel!\n\n~~~\n\nSo, I haven\u0027t done much yet. I\u0027ve sketched out a general storyline and am working on the prologue right now. Here\u0027s the two first pages, still rough and unedited (and uncompressed, sorry for the large images). In other words, they\u0027ll look a lot better soon... In the meantime, though, I have to say that this is shaping up reasonably well.\n\n![HCQMOVN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HCQMOVN.jpg)\n\n![fyfjqyW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fyfjqyW.jpg)\n\nSo, whaddaya think so far? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks for taking a peek here, and be sure to check back soon!\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T04:07:03Z","Content":"Looks interesting!

I like how it\u0027s based on a real mission; as you\u0027ll soon see, my comic is more \u0027what goes on behind the scenes\u0027 (it\u0027ll be several more chapters before the next Kerbal is even launched).\n\nStay tuned for more..
