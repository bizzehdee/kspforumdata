He could see the rocket in his minds eye. A gleaming tower of sculptured metal rising into the sky with a cluster of the latest generation engines at the base and the newest, most spacious capsule sitting proudly at the top. Ready to take him to the Mun, to Minmus or anywhere else he cared to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sighed. The reality of course was rather different. A rusty launch tower constructed from old scaffolding. A bunker full of worn out monitors and other abandoned electronic gear. And a last ditch attempt at a rocket that they had built from whatever junk they could scavenge up and weld together. Wernher\u0027s original LV-1 engine had proven far far more difficult to scale up than any of them had imagined. Getting the stability augmentation system to work had eventually been an exercise in stubbornness rather than elegant engineering. And as for the decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney shook his head. Best not to think about the wretched decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe reached the first of the launch clamps and inspected it carefully. The rocket loomed above him, a battered metal cylinder with a tangle of plumbing at the base, connected to the familiar ribbed shape of the LV-15 engine bell. Four RT-5 solid fuel boosters attached to the sides by explosive bolts and a simple capsule secured to the top with more explosive bolts completed this most unlikely looking spacecraft. In Geneney\u0027s opinion \u0027booster\u0027 was an optimistic name for a squat drum of firework propellant with a cone attached to the bottom. As for sticking them on with explosive bolts...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo - best not to think about the decouplers. Besides they had worked well enough in testing and none of them had been able to get the hydraulic pusher system to work reliably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney could hear voices far above him as Lucan helped the three cosmonauts into the capsule. An occasional mumbled comment from Bill, Bob\u0027s nervous chatter and Jeb, talking up a storm in his enthusiasm. Geneney smiled to himself. Bill was still a believer, Bob... well Bob was loyal. If his best friends were risking themselves in a home-brewed rocket, then Bob would be there alongside them. And as for Jeb, he had never given up, despite all the difficulties, frustrations and exploded prototypes. He\u0027d kept them going, with his permanent grin and irrepressible enthusiasm, even as the other members of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society had gradually drifted away. It helped that the grin hid a surprisingly competent engineer, otherwise Geneney was fairly sure that Wernher would have stuffed Jeb headfirst into the engine bell of the LV-10 test model and probably fired it too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis smile faded. The LV-10 test had been a definite low point and they still hadn\u0027t figured out exactly what went wrong. The LV-15 worked, although it wasn\u0027t close to being powerful enough and all their attempts to cluster multiple LV-15s together had failed. Eventually even Jeb had conceded that the multiple LV-15 design was just too prone to overheating and suggested using a set of RT-5 \u0027Trashcan\u0027 engines instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the launch clamps seemed to be in order and a loud clang from above announced that Lucan had finally closed the hatch of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. Geneney waited as Lucan clambered down the launch tower and the two kerbals hurried back to the control bunker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney tapped his microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbal 1, this is Control.

How\u0027s that telemetry looking?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Geneney knew Bill and Bob, then calm was most probably a lie, let alone collected. No point in breaking the facade though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wernher\u0027s just running the last tests on the decouplers now Jeb. Five minutes to launch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher pressed a button on his console and grunted in satisfaction as a set of indicator lights winked out. He flicked a switch and all five lights flickered briefly then lit up with a reassuring green glow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All rocket systems check out.

LV-15 engine start on my mark, 3 second hold down at full power as a last check, then we release the clamps and light up the Trashcans. That last bit is probably going to be a bit bouncy guys, so as soon as the LV-15 lights you\u0027ll probably want to hold on to something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gotcha, Genie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney took a deep breath. \u0022LV-15 ignition in five...four...three...two...one.. Mark!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan and Geneney turned towards the main monitor screen.

A steadily increasing rumble could be heard outside as the LV-15 throttled up to full power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Holding for three...two...one...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bunker shook to a thunderous roar as all four RT-5s ignited, sending sheets of flame washing across the launch pad. The image on the monitor flared brightly. Spots danced in front of Geneney\u0027s eyes as he stared at the screen trying desperately to spot the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E amongst all the static. As the image came back into focus, all Geneney could see was a badly scorched launch pad. The noise in his headphones suggested that this was due to a successful launch rather than a catastrophic explosion but the faint screams didn\u0027t sound at all good. The static on monitor 2 didn\u0027t look promising either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wernher - talk to me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022LV-15 performing well, all four RT-5s are running.

Wernher, try SCE to Aux.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s knuckles turned white as Wernher searched for the switch on his console. Then, with a click, monitor 2 lit up, as telemetry suddenly flooded in from the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. A slow smile spread across Geneney\u0027s face as he got to his feet and slapped Lucan on the back. Above his head, the numbers for altitude and velocity of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E were both steadily increasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002210 seconds till burnout.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney kept his fingers firmly crossed as he waited for the Trashcans to shut down. Five seconds to go, two, one...\u00A0and nothing. The roar of the engines still filled his headphones. Five more seconds, ten more seconds. He was just turning towards Wernher, when everything went quiet. There was a series of muffled explosions and four lights on Wernher\u0027s console winked out. He grabbed the microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kerbal 1, this is Control. Come in Kerbal 1! Jeb, Bill, Bob - can you hear me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb chuckled. \u0022Hearing you loud and clear, Genie if you\u0027d let us get a word in edgewise!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb - thank the Kerm! Are you guys OK up there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Bobcat here is looking a bit blue but we\u0027re all good. Nothing but Class A Badasses on \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E rocket ship!\u0022 Jeb paused to savour the moment. \u0022Yeah, this rocket ship...\u0022, his voice trailed away. \u0022Dammit guys we did it! Faster than any kerbal has ever travelled, higher than any kerbal has ever travelled and way \u003Cem\u003Eway \u003C/em\u003Enoisier than any kerbal has ever travelled! I told you those Trashcans would do the trick!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well we\u0027ve still got a couple of things left to do, Jeb but yeah - those Trashcans definitely made it happen. Thirty seconds of fuel left for the LV-15.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan was keeping a close eye on the telemetry. The \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E was actually accelerating slightly now as the last litres of fuel drained away,\u00A0until at last the engines shut down. The last light flickered out on Wernher\u0027s console accompanied by a final muffled bang from the speakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shutdown and booster separation confirmed, Jeb. We figure you should top out at around thirty to thirty five thousand metres.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, Luco. Not bad for a first flight, not bad at all! Looks like I won that bet with the Bobcat too - he reckoned we\u0027d get to twenty five thousand at best!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob laughed nervously. \u0022Are you sure they were just the standard Trashcans, Jeb? If we get down from here in one piece, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll be able to get out of this seat, I got mashed into it so hard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Didn\u0027t touch them, Bobcat. They sure did make for one heck of a ride though. What did you think, Bill? Hey - are you OK there, Bill? That window isn\u0027t coming loose is it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh... Oh wow... Guys you need to see this.\u0022 Bill silently reached out a hand and Jeb wordlessly passed him the camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney blinked. He\u0027d never heard Jeb sound like that before. Almost awestruck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What is it, Jeb?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s Kerbin... just Kerbin. Only not quite and all of it at once. And the sky - it\u0027s full of more stars than you can believe. Greens and blues and brilliant white clouds and then black and stars.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re not making any sense, Jeb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, no I don\u0027t think I am. You\u0027re gonna have to see this for yourself, Genie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney sighed. \u0022You know we\u0027re never going to get another shot at this. The Kerbal 1 was all we had left,\u0022 he said sadly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, Genie, if even half of Bill\u0027s photos come out, I think you\u0027re going to get to see this quicker than you can imagine and in a bigger and better rocket than you can imagine too. Hey, Bill, if you\u0027re done with that camera, pass it over here. Genie, I\u0027m taking off my helmet, sticking the camera into it and wedging it under the control panel for safekeeping.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s jaw dropped. \u0022What, why, what are you doing? What happens if you get an air leak?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s voice was uncharacteristically serious. \u0022I\u0027ll just have to hold my breath, Genie. Whatever happens to Bill, Bob and me, you \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E this camera. It\u0027s all the proof that the Kerbin Interplanetary Society needs and it\u0027s going to change everything.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo small green figures stood on the roof of a makeshift concrete bunker, anxiously peering out to sea. Geneney glanced at his watch and then scanned the horizon again, too nervous to look away for more than a moment. He knew that he probably wouldn\u0027t see the capsule from this distance but the parachute should be visible. And it should be visible any moment now. Beside him, Wernher suddenly stiffened and pointed at the sky. An orange streamer popped into view, plunged towards the ground and then fluttered skywards. Geneney\u0027s heart was in his mouth. If that was the drogue chute then...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES! Two orange discs burst into the sky and then unfurled into the welcome, welcome sight of two fully opened parachutes. Geneney and Wernher looked at each other, grinned in triumph and then threw themselves down the stairs as fast as they could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lucan, Wernher - boat. Now! We\u0027ve got three kerbonauts to pick up!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEpilogue - two days later\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour members of the Kerbin Interplanetary Society were lounging about at the Jebediah Kerman Junkyard and Spare Parts Company. Bill was in Jeb\u0027s office working on his camera, whilst Jeb was out with a pair of customers, helping them rummage through a pile of old engine parts. As the three of them strolled back towards the office, Geneney overhead snatches of conversation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Were you boys anything to do with a mighty lot of noise out by that old rusty tower the other day?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded, \u0022Yup, that was us, sir. Testing some bits and pieces from the junkyard.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe older of the two customers chuckled. \u0022People back in town reckon they saw one of those rockets flying into the sky.\u0022 He snorted. \u0022Load of nonsense if you ask me, never mind what those crazy interplanetary characters keep talking about. Although I have to admit, they do make some mighty fine explosions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenneny stifled a grin as Jeb tried his best to keep a straight face. Just then Bill popped his head around the office door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey\u00A0guys - photo\u0027s came out nicely. You want to take a look?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb smiled. \u0022Love to, Bill.\u0022 He turned towards his customers politely, \u0022and would you good kerbals care to join us?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney stared at Jeb\u0027s office wall. Most of Bill\u0027s photographs were blurry views of not very much, taken out of what was obviously a very small window. Several more showed what looked like maps. But none of the eight kerbals crammed into the room had eyes for anything other than the largest picture in the middle. This too was clearly a view through a window but beautifully sharp. A very obviously curved line down the middle separated inky blackness from brilliant blue, dusky brown and lush green. Far away in the distance, the familiar battered grey ball of the M\u00FCn rose over Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney blinked back tears. Jeb was right. They had really done it. They could do it again.

The soft electric purr of the truck\u0027s motors and the rattling of the trailer provided quite a tuneful accompaniment, apart from the occasional loud clanking as the truck bounced over a bump in the road. To his left, well tended green fields stretched out to the coast, interspersed with the usual copses of Kerm trees. On the horizon, sunlight sparkled off the waves of the Great Tranquil Sea. To the right the fields gradually petered out into rougher grassland and woods whilst straight ahead, the road wound down towards the Dasqu bridge, which arched over the river in a graceful series of steel cobwebs. Over the bridge, the road continued south as far as Ornie could see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA motley collection of brightly coloured boats drifted past underneath him, as Ornie cautiously steered his unwieldy vehicle over the bridge. The trailer was rocking noticeably as it bumped over the expansion joints in the roadway and he had no desire to dump hundreds of kilograms of metal onto a passing barge, or worse still a yacht. He doubted that the swimmers using the bridge piers as impromptu diving boards would be very impressed either. At last he rolled over the final section of roadway and off the bridge. After a brief stop at the side of the road to cinch up the chains holding everything in place on his trailer, he drove onwards looking for a signpost to the small town of Barkton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs he reached the outskirts of town, Ornie was rather surprised to find complete strangers waving at him or pointing to the back of his truck and talking excitedly to their friends standing next to them. It was strangely pleasant to be treated as some kind of minor celebrity though and he soon found himself smiling and cheerfully waving back. Surprise turned to outright astonishment as he drove up outside Jeb\u0027s junkyard. A sea of people were milling around the gates, pointing at a figure on the roof and chattering amongst themselves. Ornie decided that there was no way that he was going to be able to push through the crowd, so he rolled to a stop. wound down the truck window and leaned out to see what was going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbal on the roof turned around and spotted Ornie leaning out of the window. \u0022Ornie, my friend\u0022, Jeb shouted, \u0022you\u0027re just in time!\u0022 He waved at the crowd below and raised his arms for silence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good Kerbals. Today marks a new start for my humble business empire!\u0022 He paused, \u0022An empire so humble in fact that most of you were probably blissfully unaware of it.\u0022 Polite laughter rippled through the crowd as Jeb continued. \u0022But today, I think that is going to change. From today this building will no longer be called \u0027The Jebediah Kerman Junkyard Company\u0027. He picked up a large pair of shears and with a flourish, cut a rope holding a large canvas sheet in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022From today, this building will be known as \u0027Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard \u003Cem\u003Eand Spaceship Part\u003C/em\u003E Company!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb whisked away the sheet and the crowd cheered as he revealed a freshly painted signboard. A stylised rocket pointed jauntily into the sky, trailing a horizontal line of flames out behind it. Above the flames, the words \u0027Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard were written in a bold script, leaning towards the rocket as if dragged along behind it. Below the line, the words \u0027and Spaceship Part Company\u0027 were also leaning towards the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb slid down a nearby drainpipe and bounded through the crowd towards Ornie. He hopped up onto the running boards of the truck and thumped on the hood for attention. \u0022Make way,\u0022 he cried, \u0022make way! Important spacecraft parts coming through!\u0022 He leaned through the cab window. \u0022There\u0027s parking space to the left as you go through the gates, Ornie. We\u0027ll unload her later.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie started up the motors and slowly edged his truck forward towards the gates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie climbed out of the cab, stretched and looked around in bemusement. The old junkyard was buzzing with activity - everywhere he turned somebody was building something, carrying material to the builders or watching things being built. A brand new outbuilding had been put up in one corner of the yard. Just three walls, a roof and a workbench inside but already, a kerbal was sitting at the bench hard at work with a soldering iron and a pile of electronic parts. Another two kerbals were watching in fascination. Beside them, more kerbals were busily laying bricks on the half completed walls of a second outbuilding with a gang of volunteers ferrying a constant supply of new bricks and buckets of cement to them. Another gang of volunteers were digging the foundations of a third workshop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb jumped down off the running board and came to join him. \u0022Things have changed quite a bit since you were here last haven\u0027t they?\u0022 he said with a grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie shook his head. \u0022Has the whole town gone rocket crazy?\u0022 he asked. \u0022I\u0027ve only been away for a couple of days and I come back to find crowds outside the gate, a building site in here...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb laughed. \u0022You can blame Richlin for that,\u0022 he said, \u0022I\u0027m not sure what he\u0027s been saying to the good people of Barkton but its certainly had an effect! And you haven\u0027t even seen the best bits yet. Let me show you around!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey strolled over to the out buildings. Ornie wasn\u0027t particularly surprised to see that the kerbal at the workbench, soldering iron in hand was Bill, working away on a circuit board and apparently oblivious to the noise of all the construction work going on around him. Jeb waited patiently until Bill put the soldering iron down and then tapped him on the shoulder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Bill - look who made it back here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill looked up startled. \u0022Oh - hi, Ornie\u0022, he said, \u0022did you manage to find some tanks then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded. \u0022Right over there on the truck, Bill. Along with a couple of crates of spare parts and odds and ends that I think you\u0027re going to find useful.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill gazed past him distractedly. \u0022Good... that\u0027s great Ornie... thanks.\u0022 he said before picking up his soldering iron again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb gestured to Ornie and they quietly left Bill to his tinkering. As they walked past the half finished outbuilding, Jeb greeted the builders enthusiastically. \u0022Great work, guys! That wall is gonna be solid enough to hang a booster off. Have any of you guys seen Wernher or Richlin anywhere?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the volunteers pointed across the yard. \u0022Over there Jeb. They dug out some dirty great piece of machinery from the back room. Not sure what it was but Richlin seemed pretty excited about it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked over to where the volunteer was pointing. The dirty great piece of machinery looked very much like an old model automatic lathe to him and sure enough, Wernher and Richlin were both hard at work stripping it down and cleaning it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the far corner of the yard past Wernher and Richlin, another smaller group of kerbals stood around a framework of metal girders. A fountain of sparks shot into the air as one masked kerbal carefully welded a cross beam into place. Jeb spotted where Ornie was looking. \u0022Ahh yes,\u0022\u00A0he said happily as they walked over, \u0022the new test stand. Looks like it\u0027s all going well. Hey, Malmy - did you find that spare fuel valve?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Couldn\u0027t find one anywhere, Jeb,\u0022 replied Malmy. \u0022Got the old one working again though. Nothing that a replacement seal, a new handle and a bit of cleaning and greasing couldn\u0027t fix.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excellent. I tell you, guys, Wernher\u0027s gonna love having a new stand to get some decent data for his smaller engines! The big stand out the back is OK for an LV-15 or a Trashcan but we could never get it calibrated for anything much smaller than that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the kerbals looked up from the girder he was holding. \u0022Sounds interesting.

Ornie looked around. For a self proclaimed spaceship parts manufacturer, Jeb had a rather ordinary office; desk, filing cabinet, a pile of paperwork on a chair. Not even one of Bill\u0027s photo\u0027s left on the wall. Then Ornie reminded himself that until a couple of hours ago, this had just been the office of a small scale junkyard owner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb fished two cans of sapwood juice out of the fridge and tossed one to Ornie. \u0022It\u0027s only sapwood,\u0022\u00A0he said apologetically, \u0022but it\u0027s a bit early for anything stronger. Besides, I\u0027m thinking that beer and spaceship engineering probably shouldn\u0027t be mixed. It\u0027s good and cold though.\u0022 He noticed Ornie looking around the office. \u0022I know,\u0022 he said, \u0022I\u0027d love to get one of Bill\u0027s photos put back on the wall to make this place look more the part. We don\u0027t really have any spares at the moment though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie frowned, \u0022I thought...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded, \u0022Yes - Bill took lots of shots but... well see for yourself.\u0022 He led the way through into the main warehouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie stared. The yard outside was one thing but the atmosphere and sheer noise in here was unbelievable. A large open space had been cleared near the front of the warehouse. All of Bill\u0027s pictures were on display on boards around the outside and in the centre, in pride of place, the K\u003Cem\u003Eerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E capsule rested in a wooden cradle, with steps leading up to the hatch. Near the warehouse doors, Geneney stood behind a makeshift table, handing out tickets and collecting coins from the visitors who were patiently waiting in a queue that stretched out of the doors and far back down the street. If Ornie was any judge, there were over three hundred kerbals waiting in line just to get in and at least another hundred wandering around, gaping at the photographs of Kerbin from space and chattering to themselves as they inspected the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. A few daring souls were actually reaching out and touching it, wherever they could get close enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAway to one side, outside the impromptu museum, Lucan was sorting through boxes of junk and patiently answering questions from the small group of enthusiastic onlookers that had apparently volunteered to help. As far as Ornie could see, Lucan was taking an inventory, picking out anything that might still be useful as a rocket part and marking it off on a clipboard. Meanwhile, the volunteers were packing the rest of the junk away into various boxes and bins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie shook his head in disbelief. People volunteering to sort through dusty, oily old \u003Cem\u003Ejunk\u003C/em\u003E, just because it might become part of a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother queue was forming as a large number of kerbals waited to actually climb inside the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E. Bob was standing at top of the steps by the hatch, checking tickets and letting pairs of kerbals through the hatch. There was a continuous popping of camera flashes as other kerbals poked their heads through the empty spaces in the capsule (windows now removed) to photograph their friends inside. Occasionally Bob would climb in too, much to the excitement of the crowd, whereupon the brilliance of the camera flashes would become almost painful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb chuckled. \u0022I think Bob is quite enjoying being the heroic kerbonaut,\u0022 he commented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie raised an eyebrow, \u0022Are you trying to tell me that you haven\u0027t taken a shift or two by the capsule yourself, Jeb,\u0022 he asked dryly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb had the grace to look a little bit sheepish. \u0022Well maybe one or two,\u0022 he confessed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie sipped at his drink and let his thoughts drift back to that first meeting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe younger customer\u0027s jaw dropped open at the magnificent sight of Kerbin seen from space. Even the older customer looked startled for a moment. \u0022Well now,\u0022 he said quietly, \u0022looks like the folks in town weren\u0027t just spinning a tale. I\u0027d say you interplanetary boys did send a rocket up - and sent it up a good long way too.\u0022 He stuck out his hand. \u0022I\u0027m Ornie and this here is Richlin. Pleased to meet you all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb shook him by the hand. \u0022Likewise,\u0022 he said, \u0022 I take it you like our holiday pictures then?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They\u0027re not bad,\u0022 said Ornie, \u0022not bad at all.\u0022 He tried his best to hide his excitement behind a nonchalant look but had to give up as his face cracked into a broad grin. \u0022In fact a long way past \u0027Not Bad\u0027 I\u0027d say!\u0022 He looked over at Richlin who nodded eagerly. \u0022 Say - how do you join this here Interplanetary Society anyway?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grabbed a sheet of paper from his desk and scribbled six names on it; Jeb, Bill, Bob, Wernher, Geneney, Lucan..., he paused for effect, ...Ornie and Richlin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You already know me but this is Bill, Bob, Wernher, Geneney and Lucan. Bill is our avionics and remote sensing guy, Wernher does engines, Geneney and Lucan do launch prep, fuelling and mission control and Bob and I do whatever else needs to be done. More or less anyway - mostly we just all pitch in and build stuff. Anyway - welcome aboard!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill smiled shyly at the newcomers, Wernher nodded politely and Bob, Geneney and Lucan waved happily. Ornie grinned. \u0022Well you know me and Richlin now. We do airplanes mostly but I figure we could probably help build a rocket or two. Richlin knows his way around a workshop and I\u0027m a fair hand with a pipe bender.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sounds like you\u0027re going to fit in just fine,\u0022 said Jeb cheerfully, \u0022you couldn\u0027t be much worse at pipes than Bob here anyway.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob coughed. \u0022Says the kerbal who accidentally drilled a hole through the main fuel tank when he tried to fit the bracing struts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb waved airily. \u0022That tank needed patching up anyway. One more hole wasn\u0027t going to make much of a difference. Anyway, this office isn\u0027t really built for eight. How about you lot go and find a seat outside in the yard and I\u0027ll see what I can dig out of the fridge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sun was setting over the distant hills as the now expanded Kerbin Interplanetary Society arranged itself on a set of spare tyres. After a respectful pause for each kerbal to pop open his beer and take a swig, Ornie asked the question that was on everybody\u0027s mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what happens next?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked glum. \u0022Nothing much for a while, until we find enough parts for the Kerbal 2. We\u0027ve got enough spares to build another engine and we might just manage half a capsule.\u0022 He shrugged. \u0022As for everything else, we\u0027re open to suggestions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin looked thoughtful. \u0022We could probably find a spare fuel tank. I think we\u0027ve got some old avionics and tail fins lying around somewhere too. Ornie could head back with the truck and bring them over in a couple of days.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney brightened up but then his face fell as he remembered.\u0022That\u0027ll help but we\u0027ve still only got enough spare fuel for one, maybe two Trashcans\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked puzzled, \u0022Trashcans?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher took another pull of beer and wiped his mouth. \u0022Solid rocket motors. The LV-15 isn\u0027t quite powerful enough on it\u0027s own, so we... augment it slightly with solid boosters. Gene is right - we could probably build a couple of new ones with what we have left over from the Kerbal 1 but that won\u0027t be enough.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen Bob spoke up hesitantly. \u0022You know guys, I think we may be looking at this the wrong way. Instead of flying another capsule, how about we try for something smaller. Say about 100-200 kilos. We could easily launch that - heck we could probably get it into orbit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney looked confused. \u0022200 kilos isn\u0027t much. You\u0027d barely be able to lift a seat, a passenger and a parachute for that. Even if you made a capsule out of tinfoil it wouldn\u0027t work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grinned. \u0022So we don\u0027t bother with a capsule. Nothing between you, your rocket and the wide open skies.\u0022 He looked thoughtful. \u0022Actually that sounds pretty sweet... Mind you, we\u0027d need a big comfy chair, so the poor old passenger doesn\u0027t get mashed into it - right, Bob?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob rolled his eyes. \u0022We\u0027re putting a paying customer on top of a pile of rockets held together with explosives.\u0022 he said dryly, \u0022Us type A badasses can handle a little acceleration but I think everyone else might feel entitled to a properly padded seat. But anyway, I was thinking more of a camera or maybe a big radio rather than a passenger.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney frowned. \u0022What\u0027s the point in that. We\u0027re supposed to be the Interplanetary Society not the hobbyist high altitude camera club.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill looked rather put out at this and opened his mouth to speak, only to be interrupted by Jeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Actually, Genie, I think Bob might be on to something. Bill\u0027s pictures in the office - everyone is going to want to see them!\u0022\u00A0Bill looked mollified by this show of support as Jeb continued. \u0022Now imagine what they\u0027ll do if we manage to get some pictures from actual orbit. Sunrise from space. The M\u00FCn from close up - we may even get a snap of Minmus! Or if we launch a radio transmitter.

It looked like today was going to be busier than yesterday but he was worried. Ever since the meeting the night before, Geneney had been rather quiet and withdrawn. At first Jeb had put that down to a hangover, certainly the Genie had managed to pack away a good bottle or two that evening. As the day went on though, even the excitement of setting up Bill\u0027s pictures and posing for photos outside the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E with the first few visitors had failed to lift his mood.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought that he knew what the problem was but he wasn\u0027t at all sure what to do about it. He sighed, turned away from the window and walked back into the warehouse. On a sudden whim, he wandered out into the back yard and found Ornie packing his truck for the journey home\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie slammed the truck door shut and noticed Jeb staring pensively around the yard. \u0022Morning, Jeb,\u0022 he called, \u0022that\u0027s me about to head home. I\u0027ll be back in a couple of days with the parts.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb didn\u0027t answer at first and when he did he was strangely hesitant. \u0022Before you go, Ornie, could I ask you something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure, Jeb - what\u0027s troubling you?

Looked like he could see that bad road as well at times.\u0022\u00A0He looked shrewdly at Jeb. \u0022Reckon you know as well as I do why that would be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb grimaced. \u0022I think so. Putting the Kerbal 2 on hold hit him pretty hard. But dammit, Ornie - he knows that we don\u0027t have the parts yet and we can\u0027t afford to wait around until we do. We got a few folks in here yesterday but not that many. We need something quick, something to show everyone that the Kerbal 1 was just the beginning.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh he knows,\u0022 Ornie said quietly, \u0022 but knowing and accepting are two different things.\u0022 He held up a hand. \u0022And before you ask, \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E need to do two things too. Give him something important to do now and let him know that you have a plan. Doesn\u0027t much matter how big the plan is but Geneney needs to know that you\u0027ve thought about how to get from where we are now to where he wants to be: sitting in the Kerbal 2 waiting for launch. Telling him that him, Wernher and Lucan are still next in line wouldn\u0027t hurt either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb opened his mouth and then shut it as an idea started to take shape in his mind. \u0022Thanks, Ornie... Yeah, thanks!\u0022 Jeb straightened up and jogged back towards the warehouse with a new spring in his step.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside, the rest of the Interplanetary Society had arrived. Bob had brewed up a large pot of coffee and everyone was standing around, sipping the brew, chatting idly and waiting for Jeb to open up the warehouse for the day. Geneney was already standing behind the reception desk they had hastily put together the day before. Jeb wandered over to him casually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Genie, I\u0027ve been thinking about the Kerbal 2\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s face was expressionless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not the stand in machine we were talking about the other night, I\u0027m talking about a proper rocket with a capsule on top and you, Lucan and Wernher sitting in that capsule\u0022. Geneney straightened up imperceptibly and Jeb could sense that he was beginning to get some attention. \u0022Mainly I\u0027m thinking that we\u0027re going to have to be a lot more organised about the whole thing. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I think we\u0027ve done wonders given what we had to work with but it\u0027s time to stop working with what we\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Egot\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand start thinking about what we\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eneed. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003EAnd that means designing our own parts. If we can find some useful stuff lying around still, then all the better but we can\u0027t keep on relying on just finding stuff.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003EJ\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eeb paused. \u0022We still can\u0027t afford anything custom but that\u0027s not a problem. We can afford the bare metal and we\u0027ve got the talent - and we\u0027re getting the tools - to turn bare metal into spaceships! That\u0027s where I need your help, Genie. We need to sort through all the junk out there, pick out the useful bits and make an inventory. Then we need to draw up some proper plans for all the various rocket systems, match what we\u0027ve got to those plans and figure out what we need to buy to make the rest ourselves.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s voice trailed away as he glanced over at Geneney\u0027s stony face. \u0022I know it doesn\u0027t sound very exciting\u0022, he said \u0022but right now I think it\u0027s about the most important thing we can be doing. When I said that the next rocket is a stand in machine, I wasn\u0027t joking. Once we launch it, we\u0027re nearly out of parts - if we\u0027re going to launch anything else at all, we need a change of direction.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney\u0027s voice was mildly curious. \u0022Why me?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because you\u0027re our best systems guy,\u0022 Jeb said frankly. \u0022Bill is great with electronics;\u00A0you can\u0027t beat Wernher when it comes to engines but there\u0027s only one kerbal in this team that I trust to keep everything in one piece once that rocket leaves the ground.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney was silent for a moment. \u0022Sorting through all that junk,\u0022 he waved a hand towards the back of the warehouse, \u0022is going to be a big job.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb nodded in agreement, \u0022It will be but everyone can help out with the first sorting. The detailed inventory, planning and matching though... that\u0027s another job altogether. Anyway, have a think, Genie. I\u0027ll need to talk everyone else through the plan as well but I wanted to run it past you first. For now, I should probably open this place up for the day.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA loud explosion rocked the back yard of Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Company, followed by a tirade of equally explosive swearing. Ornie switched off the lathe and went out to investigate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn oily cloud of smoke hung over the test stand and the acrid tang of scorched metal and burnt rocket fuel tickled the back of his throat. Some enterprising, not to mention prescient, kerbal had erected sturdy corrugated iron sheets around the stand to serve as a crude blast shield. Judging by the scattering of twisted metal fragments that had blown over the top of them, this had turned out to be a good decision. Wernher stood next to one of the sheets scowling sullenly into the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie bent down to inspect one of the fragments. \u0022That\u0027s why we test them, Wernher,\u0022 he said. \u0022Better that they blow up now than on the launch pad. Lets have a look at the test data and...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s voice was ominously quiet. \u0022Stop trying to give me solutions, Ornie because at the moment I really couldn\u0027t care less about solutions. Ranting - yes, swearing - yes. Rational analysis - screw it. Or explode it. Which seems particularly appropriate at the moment.\u0022 Wernher aimed a surly kick at the blast shield but missed and stubbed his toe on the corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie kept a carefully expressionless face as Wernher vented his feelings in no uncertain tones. Eventually the flow of imprecations came to a halt and Wernher rubbed his eyes wearily. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, Ornie,\u0022 he said, \u0022but this was supposed to be the easy part of the whole machine. The LV-9 was \u003Cem\u003Eworking\u003C/em\u003E - that\u0027s why we chose this design in the first place remember? We even had a prototype all ready to go. I put it on the test stand just to check it out and...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Blam?\u0022 suggested Ornie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A little more than \u0027blam\u0027 but yes - no more LV-9 prototype. So I built a new one. I even made some improvements along the way. Nothing too far from the original design but they should have fixed some problems that we noticed before and made the whole engine a bit more robust. Instead...\u0022 Wernher jerked a thumb behind him wordlessly. \u0022And we don\u0027t exactly have an endless supply of spare parts to keep doing this.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded. \u0022Gotcha. Tell you what we\u0027ll do, Wernher. We\u0027re going to take a walk, we\u0027re going to grab a bite to eat and then we\u0027re going to come back, check over those strip charts and figure out what went wrong.\u0022 Wernher\u0027s face darkened but he forced out a terse laugh as his stomach rumbled audibly. \u0022Alright, alright. Maybe this smoke will have cleared away too by the time we get back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher and Ornie strolled back towards the junkyard chewing on the last of their sandwiches. Finally Ornie decided to break the silence. \u0022So what happens if we don\u0027t get the LV-9 working, Wernher? Could we go for an RT-5 upper stage instead?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher swallowed his mouthful of sandwich. \u0022We could,\u0022 he said \u0022 but I\u0027d prefer not to. The RT-5\u0027s don\u0027t have a lot of control at ignition, so I\u0027m not really happy with the idea of trying to light them in mid-air. And once they\u0027re lit, they stay lit until they burn out, which doesn\u0027t give us many options if the rocket does go off course. I think solids have their place but they\u0027re going to need some work before I\u0027m convinced by them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie frowned thoughtfully. \u0022I bet that the Kerbal 1 launch was a fun moment for you then,\u0022 he commented. \u0022Which makes me think - why not just go for a Kerbal 1 design but with two RT-5\u0027s instead of four?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That might work,\u0022 said Wernher \u0022and if we can\u0027t get the LV-9 to work, it\u0027s probably what we\u0027ll have to do. I\u0027m not sure it would get us to orbit but it would be better than nothing. We would launch with the Trashcans only, or with the LV-15 running at minimum thrust and then just see how far we get with a single stage once we drop the solids.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It does sound like an LV-15 lower stage lifting an LV-9 second stage is the best plan then,\u0022 said Ornie. \u0022One decoupler for simplicity, better control for the second stage.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And a symmetric mass distribution as well,\u0022 said Wernher. \u0022Which will make guidance and control a lot easier. Also a single point of thrust, rather than having to worry balancing thrust from the Trashcans.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey walked back through the side gate into the back yard and made their way over to the test stand. Wernher tore off a strip of paper from one of the chart recorders behind the main stand and unrolled it on a nearby workbench. \u0022This is the recording for the fuel supply pressure,\u0022 he said. Ornie bent over to examine it as Wernher continued. \u0022Engine start is here, pressure builds up to maximum, keeps steady for a minute, begins to oscillate here,\u0022 he jabbed a finger at the chart, \u0022goes out of control here and then settles at a lower pressure until we turn it off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie tapped the chart absently, thinking it through. \u0022Sounds like a turbopump problem,\u0022 he said at last. \u0022The engine runs fine to begin with, then we get a problem with the fuel flow here, failure here and then fuel just sprays out of the busted engine at whatever pressure you\u0027re feeding it in from the tank. Do you have any pump data?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher went over to the recorders and tore off a second strip. \u0022Impeller rpm,\u0022 he said, unrolling the paper onto the bench below the first strip. \u0022A pump failure was my first thought too and the data seems to fit. Normal spin-up, runs for a minute and then we start getting variations in speed - which matches the pressure changes in the fuel line. Failure here and then the rpm goes off the scale as the shaft is running freely without any blades attached.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie looked closely at the chart. \u0022Looks like we\u0027re getting some secondary oscillations on the edge of the larger ones,\u0022 he said thoughtfully, \u0022They\u0027re not very regular though, almost random.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher shrugged. \u0022Noisy data. I really need to move the recorders back from the stand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie shook his head. \u0022There\u0027s background noise in the whole trace but these secondary wiggles are still quite distinct.\u0022 His eyes suddenly widened. \u0022Of course! How could I forget!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher raised his eyebrows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The bearings! Richlin and I had the same problem with our early jet engines. The bearings weren\u0027t holding the impeller shaft steady enough and the blades were knocking against another part of the compressor. Just tiny knocks at first - the bearings weren\u0027t that bad - but they were enough to set the impeller shaft wobbling. The wobbles build up quickly until the impeller blades start rubbing against the pump casing.\u0022 Ornie looked up wryly. \u0022At which point it doesn\u0027t take long at all until you get a blade failure cascade. These secondary wiggles are the blades \u0027ringing\u0027 after each of those initial small knocks.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher\u0027s eyes lit up hopefully. \u0022So we just need better bearings? We can easily do that with the parts and tools we have on site!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie nodded enthusiastically. \u0022Better yet, I can still remember how we redesigned our bearings. Can\u0027t guarantee that they\u0027ll work for a rocket engine but it has to be worth a try!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe yard went silent as everyone stopped to watch Wernher and Ornie carry the LV-902 out to the test stand. Ornie plugged in the fuel and oxidiser lines as Wernher checked over the test program. They pulled the blast shields into place and retreated back to the control console. More than one pair of fingers were crossed as Wernher scanned the console settings one last time, before flipping back the cage over the master start button and depressing it with an audible clunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA billow of smoke marked the ignition, followed by a familiar high pitched roar as the LV-902 throttled up. Blazing light poured out of the gaps between the blast shields and the whole test stand shook under the thrust. Wernher watched the timer tensely as it climbed past the one minute mark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne minute thirty seconds...two minutes....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher held his breath, alert to any slight change in the engine noise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo minutes thirty....three minutes.... three minutes thirty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe light dimmed and the roar of the engine died away and went out. A great cheer went up as Ornie pulled back the blast shields to find the LV-902 still intact on the stand. Wernher let out his breath in a great sigh of relief. His voice shook slightly as he called out to Ornie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Test 1 complete. Let\u0027s review the data, check over the engine and then set up for a full mission duration burn.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-18T06:46:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2020 06:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T13:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESatellite.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cloud of dust trailed behind the car as it wound slowly up the steep hillside. From the passenger seat Lucan could see out over the plains, down to the twinkling river and beyond. In the far distance, he could just make out a sparse scattering of buildings marking the outskirts of Barkton. Jeb sat at the wheel, jaw clenched in concentration as he drove up the narrow series of switchback curves that masqueraded as a road. Behind him, Bill sat silently next to a large conical object. Four equally spaced bulges around the rim were the only features to break it\u0027s smooth surface which tapered upwards to a gently curved tip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoose gravel crunched under his wheels as Jeb swung into the car park and came to a halt. Lucan pulled a collapsed metal trolley out of the back of the car and began unfolding it. Jeb and Bill grunted with effort as they heaved the cone out through the trunk of Jeb\u0027s car and set it carefully down onto the trolley. Sweating in the warm afternoon sun, the three kerbals set about wheeling the cumbersome vehicle up the nearest hill. Fortunately the ground was dry and the trolley wheels hissed as they trundled through the short scrubby grass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey reached the top of the hill and Lucan locked the brakes on the trolley. Bill fussed around it, double checking the brakes and carefully rolling the cone until it rested point downwards on its cradle. Satisfied at last he stepped back and pulled a portable radio from his pocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Control, this is Bill. We\u0027re ready to go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a long pause as the three friends waited expectantly. Then abruptly four green lights lit up around the base of the cone and a long antenna extended out from each bulge. Richlin\u0027s voice crackled from the radio. \u0022Control here. Confirming payload activation and incoming test signal. Let me see if I can...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRichlin\u0027s voice faded out into static and then a muffled but unmistakeable tone echoed out of the speaker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022beep... beep... beep...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last few weeks had seen a buzz of activity at Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Company, much to the fascination of the steady stream of kerbals queuing up outside the doors. Quite apart from the wondrous pictures of their planet from space and a chance to sit in the very spacecraft that the pictures were taken from, hundreds of visitors had watched in mounting excitement as the two sections of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 1\u003C/em\u003E rocket were slowly assembled in the yard. Others had watched in awe as the two test stands shook to the fire and fury of rocket engines at full power. Still others had lined the streets as Ornie\u0027s truck took the completed rocket stages out to the launch pad for assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHundreds had watched from behind the ropes as the lower stage of the rocket was carefully lowered into place on the launch pad and secured to the four restraining pylons. They had held their breath as two kerbals climbed out onto an arm of the launch tower and the second stage of the rocket, complete with conical tip, was hoisted into the air. Some of them swore that they had only started breathing again once the two sections had been gingerly brought together and made secure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the whole, Jeb thought, it was probably just as well that none of the onlookers realised the significance of the dozen slender looking bolts that held the two rockets together. He unrolled the tube of paper that he was carrying and pasted it firmly to the warehouse door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nCLOSED\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Company will be closed today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll visitors are cordially invited to join us for the opening of our new out of town facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch at 1.37pm.

Jeb stood in the doorway of the control bunker and looked out over the launch site. Far to his right, the freshly painted \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 1\u003C/em\u003E stood gleaming in the sunlight. Wernher had muttered something about \u0027white paint keeping the sun off\u0027 and \u0027keeping the fuel tanks cooler\u0027 but Jeb suspected that, like everyone else, he just wanted to launch a smartly painted rocket for a change. Next time, Jeb thought, they would make sure that the launch tower was cleaned and painted too. If nothing else, the rusty old scaffolding could hardly inspire confidence in anyone outside of the Kerbal Interplanetary Society.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver at the far end of the field, at what they hoped was a safe distance, a grandstand of tiered wooden benches had been built. Jeb could already see a line of small green figures queuing to get in. Bob had been down to the grandstand earlier that morning to check that the countdown clock was running and that the broadcast link to the launch bunker was working properly. Out at the launch tower he knew that Geneney, Lucan and Richlin were busy fueling the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 1\u003C/em\u003E and running final checks on the launch clamps and decoupler systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy noon, the grandstand and the grassy area around it were full to bursting with enthusiastic kerbals. Some, more entrepreneurial types were meandering between the benches selling a variety of cold drinks, snacks and clothing and several hats with the jaunty tilted rocket logo of the Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Company could be seen bobbing through the crowds. Elsewhere small knots of kerbals were standing around the radio speakers listening avidly to the launch preparations. Everyone was keeping at least half an eye on the countdown clock as it slowly marked off the minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus thirty minutes. Weather is holding and lower stage fueling is complete. Bringing telemetry and guidance systems online.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus twenty minutes. Upper stage fuelled and ready. Launch vehicle on internal power. All tower systems to launch positions.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneney and Lucan clambered over the gantries, disconnecting fuel lines and other umbilical connections. Satisfied, they scrambled to the ground and joined Richlin at the winch. With a great creaking and squealing of rusty joints, the tower rotated out of the way, leaving the Kerbin 1 standing alone, tethered to the ground only by its four launch clamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus five minutes. Launch site is clear, weather is good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus three minutes and counting. Tank pressures nominal. Decoupler systems are Go, guidance is green.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus two minutes and counting. We are Go for engine start.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGradually the grandstand grew quiet as everyone watched the last few seconds tick away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T minus 12, 11, 10...\u0022 All eyes turned to the slim pencil of metal on the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00227, 6, 5...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire blossomed from the base of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 1\u003C/em\u003E and thunder rolled across the field towards them. For a brief moment the watching crowds feared the worst as the rocket remained stubbornly anchored to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00222, 1 and LIFTOFF!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch clamps fell away and the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 1\u003C/em\u003E rose from the launch pad on a great billow of smoke and flame. A thousand small green faces watched in awe as it accelerated smoothly away, soaring gracefully into the sky and climbing out over the sea until only the bright flame of it\u0027s exhaust could be seen against the blue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDown in the launch bunker, Geneney sat in his chair watching the main screen. Altitude, velocity and projected apoapsis were all racing upwards. \u0022Lucan, Wernher - systems report.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Trajectory is good, stability augmentation systems within operational parameters.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022First stage propulsion performing well. One minute to staging.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside on the grandstand, even over the radio link, the crowd could sense the tension in Wernher\u0027s voice. Very few of them knew what \u0027staging\u0027 was but it was clearly something important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00223...2...1... First stage shut down. Decouplers firing...separation and second stage ignition confirmed!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kerbals standing closest to the speaker could just make out Wernher\u0027s voice over the cheering in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E - we are go for orbit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLucan watched the telemetry with trepidation as the fuel drained steadily out of the \u003Cem\u003EKerbin 1\u003C/em\u003E upper stage and the ship velocity climbed higher and higher. As far as he knew the projected apoapsis was now well above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere but they still weren\u0027t quite fast enough for a stable orbit. Behind him, Wernher was calling out the remaining fuel levels in an unworried voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002230 seconds... 25 seconds...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then the final display on the telemetry screen lit up. Lucan forced himself to be calm. \u0022Projected periapsis 10 km and rising. Eighteen seconds of fuel remaining. Estimated six seconds till loss of signal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the numbers on the telemetry display flickered into noise and random characters and went out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb broke the sudden silence that settled over the bunker. \u0022Good job with those trajectory calculations, Luco. What\u0027s your best guess on time to reacquisition?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002267 minutes, assuming a clean shutdown and separation,\u0022 Lucan replied, \u0022Separation should trigger payload activation, so we\u0027ll soon know if everything is working.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In that case I think I\u0027m going to take a walk down to the grandstand and let everyone know what\u0027s going on. Genie - could you reset the countdown clock to display time to signal acquisition and patch the satellite receiver into the broadcast system please?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Will do, Jeb. Lucan - could you talk me through the numbers for acquisition?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob stifled a yawn. \u0022I could do with a walk too,\u0022 he said, \u0022anyone else coming?\u0022 Richlin got to his feet. \u0022Think I\u0027ll join you,\u0022 he said, \u0022 this bunker is getting a little stuffy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not me,\u0022 replied Lucan quietly, \u0022you all launched using my calculations - I want to see whether they were any good.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWernher nodded, \u0022I\u0027ll wait here too,\u0022 he said, \u0022I want to see if the LV-902 did it\u0027s job. Lucan can run me through the calculations too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrnie stayed in his seat. \u0022Reckon I\u0027ll want to get the news straight from Mission Control,\u0022 he said, \u0022rather than watching the clock from the far end of the field.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo everyone\u0027s surprise, Bill got to his feet. \u0022Think I\u0027ll take a walk too.\u0022 he said, \u0022Either the satellite works or it doesn\u0027t - there\u0027s not much more I can do down here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd jostled around them, voices clamouring to know what had happened to the rocket. Jeb did his best to answer their questions as he made his erratic way towards the grandstand, Bill and Richlin following closely behind. Bob took everything in with rather more aplomb, even stopping to buy a fistful of crispy \u003Cem\u003Edjan\u003C/em\u003E chips from a passing vendor. Jeb cupped his hands around his mouth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Make way! Make way,\u00A0folks - the quicker I get to a microphone, the quicker you\u0027ll all get to hear what\u0027s happening.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the crowd parted before them, Jeb led the others over to one of the radio speakers. Seizing the microphone hooked to the side of the speaker stand he vaulted up onto a nearby table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good Kerbals - I have some good news and some bad news!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb slowly scanned the crowd waiting for them to quieten down, when his eye was caught by a cheerful array of brightly coloured hats, set out on a bench beneath him. They all seemed to be printed with a rather familiar stylised rocket. The hat seller looked more than a little nervous as Jeb jumped down to inspect his wares but Jeb just grinned at him and hopped back up onto the table cheerfully waving his new purchase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As I was saying - we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is - we made it to space! The bad news is - we don\u0027t know how far.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd laughed as Jeb continued.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We do know that we\u0027re going to make it at least half way around Kerbin but we\u0027re not sure if we\u0027re going to make it all the way back. What we have done is to put a radio transmitter on top of the rocket, so if everything goes to plan we should have a little surprise for you in about...\u0022 Jeb glanced at the countdown clock, \u0022in about forty minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now I\u0027m not sure what you good people planned to do but we\u0027re going to be right here waiting by this radio. You\u0027re all welcome to join us - and if one of you could show me where Bob got those \u003Cem\u003Edjans\u003C/em\u003E you\u0027d be a lot more than welcome!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the minutes went by, more and more eyes turned to the clock. As it ticked down past the five minute mark, the four members of the Interplanetary Society, looked at each other and silently crossed their fingers. A brief crackle from the speaker was followed by a burst of static. Bill looked up at the clock, which was still showing two minutes to go. Another burst of static, a pause and then, out of the electronic noise, a voice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022..nie, Richlin and too many other kerbals to mention from the great town of Barkton!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\u0027s heart leapt\u00A0as the speaker gave a loud beep and the recorded message started again.
