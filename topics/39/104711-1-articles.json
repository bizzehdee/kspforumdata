That means a clean install of KSP in preparation, make a fresh checklist of mods (and then patiently wait for their release) aaaaand... NEW FLAGS! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I took this as an opportunity to freshen up my Illustrator skills...\n\nI\u0027ve decided to make an official logo for my space program and this is the time to reveal:\n\n![wAdZqim.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/wAdZqim.png?1)\n\n I took some base inspiration from SpaceX\u0027s logo and extended from that... Broax is my name around here (and most games) and then the \u0022X\u0022 is supposed to symbolize a craft going into orbit.\n\nBut this is just the logo... The whole flag will look like this: \n\n![hQKUk8Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/hQKUk8Z.png)\n\nThis will be the general purpose flag for Kerbin orbiting missions. General satellites, tests, etc. The flag colors are green to represent Kerbalkind and blue representing space exploration. I\u0027ll have multiple flags for each mission but the main theme (colors and logo) will be the same for all.\n\nEach routine mission will have its own flag according to which celestial body the mission will take place in (Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, etc). There will be specific flags for special missions (1st Kerbal in space will have the Kersok-1 flag, 1st Mun landing will have a Kerpollo 11 flag, etc) and I\u0027m considering special flags for career contracts (rescue missions, experiments, etc).\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n[TABLE=width: 500, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]![nBXZKNo.png](http://i.imgur.com/nBXZKNo.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD]![fzlZvSw.png](http://i.imgur.com/fzlZvSw.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD]![kFZ1bWZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/kFZ1bWZ.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD]![0RoUJYz.png](http://i.imgur.com/0RoUJYz.png)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]**General Purpose Kerbin Flag**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**General Purpose Duna/Ike Flag**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Special Edition Kerpollo 11 Flag**[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**Special Rescue Flag**[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nEDIT: Now with a real-life example:\n\n![5MfNQAR.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/5MfNQAR.png?1)\n\nI would love to have some feedback from other KSP fans so please let me know what you think of these! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Do you think the design is space-worthy? Is the color scheme cool? Do you think these many flags is overkill? \n\nMost of all... Do you think Jeb would be proud of planting these flags?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T22:33:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Broax**\n  \nJust formating..."}]}
