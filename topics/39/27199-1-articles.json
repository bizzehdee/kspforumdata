Consider this: the majority of people do not attempt what you\u0027ve done, simply because they are too afraid to put lines down on a piece of paper. If your goal is to get other people to like your work however, well, that depends a lot on the crowd. We all agree that a painting of a bowl of fruit is good when everyone sees it. However, when someone sprays a paint enema onto a canvas from a swing; well, only a select crowd gathers to bid on that \u0027masterpiece\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said; of course a proper tablet, better software and training helps.
