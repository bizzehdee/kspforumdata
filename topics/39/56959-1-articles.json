The channel started about a year ago but life got in the way and I\u0027m just now getting back into things. I haven\u0027t played the game since the last video I posted (LP Video #5).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve downloaded the updates and my new videos (#6 and above) are all about me relearning the game and exploring the new features and parts. I play with a completely vanilla install (no mods) and am working my way through the research tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t gotten around to updating my intro or outro so I\u0027ve chosen to make these new videos a continuation of the existing LP season. Once I get some spare time to play around, I\u0027ll be updating with new bells and whistles for season two. Hope you join me and have some fun along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I forgot to mention, my play style means that I try never to use the reset mission button and if I strand a pilot, I try and rescue him. I do however do some off-camera tests on works in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralorwolf","CreatedById":96782,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T08:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going ahead and imbedding a video here. This is the only one I\u0027m going to post here. I find threads with multiple videos in them to be kind of annoying. This video is the first in my career mode play. It takes me a while to catch on to some of the new mechanics but I\u0027m a quick learner I swear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_kc4RzOQa9M?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
