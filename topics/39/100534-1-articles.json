I\u0027m seeking entertaining challenges that I can get a viable 30 minute or less video out of with a maximum of 2 hour recording period.

I\u0027ve got a few ideas for interesting mission for ya.\n\n1. Do precision landing on the Mun, getting two spacecraft launched separately next to each other.\n\n2. Do an orbital docking over Kerbin without RCS.\n\n3. Do at least a fly-by of Eve (a feat in of itself!).\n\n4. Land on top of one of the mountains west of the KSC."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T02:43:16Z","Content":"Fly through all the nooks and crannies in the Space Center!
