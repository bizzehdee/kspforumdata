I thought I\u0027d do a little tribute to Cassini (Kassini with a K, obviously!) as it approaches its Grand Finale. So I put together a little probe (yes I know it looks nothing like Cassini, artistic license!) and sent it to Jool. I honestly had no idea if this thing would even do anything around Jool, but to my utter amazement it did. In fact this little thing had enough delta-v to do a flyby of ALL of the moons in the Joolian system, as well as get into a circular polar orbit around Jool with enough fuel left over for a final de-orbit burn when the time is right! It worked out so well, I strongly recommend ion engines to any fellow Kerbonaut who, like me, never gave them a second thought. Yes they take FOREVER, and you have to use physical time warp A LOT, but their delta-v puts the nuclear engine to shame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/j5xvSa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKassini\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
