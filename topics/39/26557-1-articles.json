When template is open, you can use the \u0022wire/bounds\u0022 layer to see exactly where the face borders are, and make sure to paint in the \u0022PAINT HERE!\u0022 layer (not obvious at all). Keep the \u0022occlusion\u0022 layer on so you have a soft shade near the edges. To prepare the texture for KSP, you should duplicate the part folder, and change the name in .cfg to your liking. When you are finished making your art, save it as model000.png and put it inside the part folder. (hopefully this process will be simplified after we get flags in the next update)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: If you are unable to open the .psd file, save the image under this text, open it in any image program you want and you could paint over it. But note that you will paint over the \u0022shades\u0022. Therefore it is recomended to use a layer-capable image editor. If you are working in GIMP or other layer-capable image editor, put the image on top of your painting layer and put it into \u0022multiple\u0022 blending mode so the shades darken the paint under it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VPpsI6B.png?1?1908\u0022 alt=\u0022VPpsI6B.png?1?1908\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second image explains which side of the cube the squares face and where exactly the bounds are (everything colored in pink is not used on the model).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GBmjWLX.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022GBmjWLX.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EOk, so what\u0027s the use of this?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is absolutely no practical purpose.

The shade is only used to make the model look better and more smooth. You could do it without, but it would be better with IMO. Also the boundaries are difficult to see cause they are slightly smaller than the shaded squares so it\u0027s a big help to have an ability to turn on a layer just to see where they exactly are.
