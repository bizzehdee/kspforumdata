If someone with your plugin maintains names and co-ordinates and posts into this thread, can it be \u0027imported\u0027 quickly? Is it a file that sits in \u0027plugin data\u0027 folder in txt format?\n\nYou can add locations from within the game. You select these directly on the map. Or you can copy paste them into the text file which is located in PluginData/romfarer/kps.txt (it will be created when you first open up the system). It\u0027s described in detail in the the manual.\n\nThe system already comes with a few pre-made example locations you can delete and modify as you wish. For reference, this is what the kps.txt looks like:\n\n    Mun#4.16064834714487#-55.6260228246487#Crater 1Mun#63.5456339296924#-32.3903335090882#Crater 2Mun#13.1034661976821#20.7120616562151#Crater 3Mun#-9.00872987151143#81.8389789338056#Crater 4Mun#-20.0523976065337#135.036532057894#Crater 5Mun#6.97189113955997#-150.202351223027#Crater 6Mun#-37.6715834126541#4.7115849947796#Romfarer landingMinmus#-23.7466988564638#-342.025066661392#Romfarer was hereKerbin#62.6437630408871#-117.351140052713#Romfarer BayKerbin#20.6616392056821#-146.333447448622#KSC 2CelestialBody#Latitude#Longitude#LocationName \u003C-format\n\nKSP has blocked XML reading/writing so i had to make my own format, that may change in the future, and if it does, this file will be converted automatically.
