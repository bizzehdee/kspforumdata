Fucntionally there should be no difference other than your initial trajectory; you\u0027ll want to steer a few degrees west of north (somewhere in the 350-355 degree range) to account for the planet\u0027s rotation when you launch. You will need a little bit of extra delta-V to achieve the initial orbit, but no more than 100-200 m/s. It won\u0027t point at the same spot on the ground all the time as well.
