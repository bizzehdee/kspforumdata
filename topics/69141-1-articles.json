I don\u0027t know terms really I\u0027m like brand new to blender/all of this). anyway pieces that are \u0022joined\u0022 together will load from blender to unity but not into kerbal. Well I have this part here, and the only way to get it to animate is to join several pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://giant.gfycat.com/HandyIllAzurevasesponge.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022HandyIllAzurevasesponge.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoaded into kerbal, most pieces load.

Or if you have a suggestion to animate it that doesn\u0027t involve joining pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see here, I select the cylinder behind the head and set the origin to its center. Then I animate that cylinder rotating in its fixed position. Then I attach the whole upper jaw to that cylinder so that the whole thing opens in regards to the cylinders origin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uB1IMjR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uB1IMjR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking this out and literally any feedback would be appreciated.

What you would do in that case is ctrl-lasso everything and then set the keyframe for loc/rot/scale, or just tap the \u0022a\u0022 key a few times to highlight everything. Every keyframe, highlight everything in the scene and then set the keyframe for locrotscale. Even unrelated objects, don\u0027t worry about them for now. Just get everything in place (use parenting if you want to help with rotations, but its irrelevant), and select all and keyframe each step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave it as a master file, then follow the steps below if you have objects unrelated to the animation or multiple animated parts that need to be in Unity separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had issues where Blender uses every object in the scene for the animation and breaks the animation when you export it to Unity because you need to re-child/parent everything to get certain things to work. My workaround was to break up the export. Build the whole thing in Blender and animate, then save to a master .blend. Delete everything not involved in the animation, then export it (.fbx?). Reload the master, now delete everything with the animation, export again with a different .fbx file. Now you can just keep the pieces together in Unity involved in the animation, and the others you import separately and not worry about parenting...throw them anywhere in the tree, go nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
