The Rapier actually goes a little too fast for me down in the atmosphere, and puts your nose at some pretty severe thermal risk as you climb through the 22km-40km danger zone. Since the Whiplash is lower tech, I think it\u00A0is a very good option. I think it comes down to:\u00A0Rapier =\u00A0MK2 design, and Whiplash =\u00A0MK1 -- which ends up making them equal choices (except that MK2 is prettier and reenters better, and MK1 is more fuel efficient). But part of that choice depends heavily on exactly how you design the nose (blunt vs. pointy) or if you can figure some other really clever way around the nose heating problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the rocket phase: Part of the question is just how far up do you want your SSTO to fly? If all you want to do is get to LKO, do a little bit of docking, and then reenter -- then your rockets don\u0027t matter much\u00A0because they won\u0027t be running all that long. So you either just use the Rapiers to go the rest of the way to LKO, or you slap on a couple Terriers to keep the weight down, or you use a Poodle or Skipper if you want to SSTO something big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH, if you want to fly your SSTO to Minmus or Duna, then you need 120kN to make any decent-sized SSTO climb and accelerate\u00A0-- so NERV is your only fuel-efficient choice. You can\u0027t get a spaceplane orbital with a reasonable number of ion engines (which is your only available step up in Isp). Or, once again, you can use the Rapiers and hope that the weight savings balances out the bad Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-16T05:55:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2016 05:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk1980","CreatedById":163203,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T08:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin my experience, the whiplash \u0026amp;

design as its lighter then a jet\u002Brocket combo such as aerospike\u002Bturboramjet.\u00A0 That said, it comes with 2 major downsides.\u00A0 It has lousy rocket ISP, a big problem if you want the SSTO to go past LKO, for mun/minmus id rather have a lv-909 or something which has better ISP even if it means heavier total engine mass.\u00A0 Also, it requires very tricky thermal design to keep the nose/wings from melting on ascent.\u00A0 Since the rapier flies very very fast in the dangerous area between 20-40km, you will fry if you are not careful.\u00A0 Personally ive found a higher ejection angle solves this with most craft (trade altitude for speed, less fuel efficient, but there is only so fast you can go before your craft vaporizes itself with heating at 100%).\u00A0 Finally, it is fairly bad for landing and takeoff (especially if you are trying to fly 50t on a single rapier), given its anemic TWR when flying very slowly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurboramjet:\u00A0 Its better then the rapier if you want to spend alot of time in atmo because it uses less fuel and is way better at low altitudes/low speeds.\u00A0 The downside to it is that it is less efficient hands down compared to the rapier for pure ascent (even if you never use the rapier\u0027s rocket mode).\u00A0 I have personally used them both for fun and with nukes (both use LF only), so they are solid choices (especially if you play career and dont have rapier yet), but generally speaking rapiers are just easier to work with and give you better performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuke:\u00A0 If you want to go anywhere past minmus with your SSTO (discounting ISRU) you NEED to have one or more nukes on your craft.\u00A0 Personally my best nuke/rapier combo (in 1.0.5) managed to get over 7000 dV in LKO and i managed to go to laythe, pol, and bop (including landing on all of these) and then returning to kerbin without any form of refueling.\u00A0 While it doesnt really make alot of sense to make SSTAs (single stage to anywhere) given that its more viable to have a separate interplanetary ring or whatnot where a shorter range SSTO docks to, knock yourself out, afterall, ive spent alot of time in KSP making these

Eve SSTO will need to use aerospikes/new shuttle engine/ks25x4), but in general these 3 will do you well with most builds.\u00A0 Also, worth noting is that the jumo jet engine coupled with a 48-7s will make a very good micro-SSTO, although i do not build things that small and thus dont really have experience with those engines.\u00A0 If you want stuff thats below 5t, then those 2 engines work well (you can also use a lv-909 instead of the 48-7s but it depends on how much thrust you

If you\u0027re going that way, strapping a couple of Junos to your plane and a couple more to the rocket boosters will get you a HOTOL spaceplane very early in the tech tree ( if somewhat costly in dropped parts... ). Juno/Spark works, believe it or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs 20 mins in KSP *really* going to earn you more?

Personally I\u0027m a big fan of RAPIERs combined with LV-Ns, but that\u0027s mostly because I tend to use my SSTOs further than just a 100x100 O. The nuke, despite the massive weight increase, allows me to go a lot further with proper planning and piloting. If I\u0027m just shuttling things to orbit, then RAPIERs work fine on their own. Alternatively, when I\u0027m working lower in the tech tree, Whiplash \u002B Terrier is also a decent combination, but somewhat harder to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
