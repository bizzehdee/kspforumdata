I am testing the drills currently and I am running into a problem with the Industrial Strip Miner. No matter how many radiators I put on the craft they don\u0027t seem to reduce the heat output. They work for only 1 of the operations being active, but after that the temperatures just keep going up no matter how many more radiators I add on the craft. I tested this with both Thermal Control Systems and radiators attached next to the drill. The info in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E says the drill needs 200kW of cooling. I am guessing that is per operation active so in total we need 200 * 5 operations = 1000kW which 1 Thermal Controls System large should be able to provide. However even with 10 of them nothing hapens. So what am I missing here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-11T21:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tried to mess with drill/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E parts in a while but IIRC, heat producing parts have a line in their config file that limits the maximum cooling they can use.\u00A0 I can\u0027t speak specifically for MKS, but it could be the max cooling is limited to only being enough for a single active operation at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rukongai","CreatedById":200936,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-11T21:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes as far as I can see that was the problem. Kinda sucks but I changed the config to be a maximum of 1000kW of cooling and that seems to work perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
