But this wouldn\u0027t limitate to this only also will have something like little scientist outpost on any planet or moon surface. A rover contract should be like get from this point to this point with a rover. I don\u0027t like to be driving a lot of time so the distances aren\u0027t going to be so large. A scientist outpost would need to have a science lab and two scientist on board. That\u0027s the initial Idea of this."},{"CreatedByName":"GeoPhizzix","CreatedById":98946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:13:08Z","Content":"Initial Contract: Set up field station in a specific biome.

I do really like the order of the missions. And this would be great for KIS and maybe only for that because you could send some cargo on the rover and the science equipment. And the Resupply missions are a must on this. I don\u0027t know how if to make that requirement of the bases because this is supossed to be something before the bases but maybe.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Finding a role for rovers is tricky.

And with KIS, the rovers are able to move containers around the surface."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T17:36:04Z","Content":"Another thing you can do is to detect an existing rover (using the method in the tourism contract), and offer a contract to drive it to a new point X km away.
