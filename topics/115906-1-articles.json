But this wouldn\u0027t limitate to this only also will have something like little scientist outpost on any planet or moon surface. A rover contract should be like get from this point to this point with a rover. I don\u0027t like to be driving a lot of time so the distances aren\u0027t going to be so large. A scientist outpost would need to have a science lab and two scientist on board.

I do really like the order of the missions. And this would be great for KIS and maybe only for that because you could send some cargo on the rover and the science equipment. And the Resupply missions are a must on this.
