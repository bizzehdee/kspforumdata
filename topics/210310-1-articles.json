I myself used a slower trajectory, launching from earth when earth was passing through a planar node; then I waited a couple orbits in that parking orbit until I intersected Mars. This way I saved those 1000 m/s - I needed a few hundred m/s to syncronize my orbit for a Mars encounter, but still a large saving. But this two-times trajectory is never used in reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat sparked my interest was exactly that I was surprised by how expensive that plane change was. And that none of the Mars missions ever mentioned that some transfer windows are cheaper than others, even though I know that if the window happens on a planar node you don\u0027t need the plane change and you can save a lot of deltaV. Generally speaking, in all my interplanetary transfers I went through great hassles to avoid paying for plane changes, because the cost was measured in km/s. and none of the planets are nicely aligned.

Ok, I could perform the injection burn in the high atmosphere and save perhaps 100 m/s, but that\u0027s it. I could then slowly lower apoapsis with multiple passages, but I had to pay the cost of injection with rockets.

But on the other hand, the cheapest injection is also on a planar node, because you can use venus gravity to pay the plane change. But the planar nodes are shifted by almost 90\u00B0 from the aphelion-perihelion axis, so I had to pick one. In the end I decided to meet the innermost planet at perihelion, and I had to pay almost 3 km/s for a plane change in solar orbit. and there were still over 2 km/s of intercept speed, for a total cost of roughly 7 km/s from phobos to mercury orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeeping the mothership in solar orbit and using one of its subships as an impromptu additonal stage I managed to land on mercury and return to phobos, but I was left with the feeling that I could have been more efficient in the approach. that\u0027s why I was specifically interested in that part. real mercury orbiters used ion engines, so it\u0027s going to have a different profile, but they still save as much as they can by gravity assists, and there I wanted to see if they could do it better than I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-27T17:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224191676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221666884197\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022132560\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RCgothic\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, RCgothic said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E it generally takes to go places in the solar system.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AAGJvD1.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AAGJvD1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AAGJvD1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI look at these and have to remind myself that they\u0027re based (AFAIK) on an \u0027optimum\u0027 relationship between the orbits of the Earth and destination.\u00A0 i.e. you can\u0027t launch at just any old place in Earth\u0027s orbit and hope to get to Jupiter for 3360 m/s, the planets need to be in the correct alignment, like the hands on a clock where the big hand points at the target and the little hand at the Earth.\u00A0 When those are aligned correctly, you have a launch window.\u00A0 (Which reminds me; are there simple maps that show these?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question: is there a \u0027fan\u0027 of possible direction changes from just an intercept?\u00A0 I\u0027d guess that would be determined by the mass of the planetary body, where Jupiter would give you a pretty large fan, but Mars would be considerably constrained.\u00A0 Any easy to understand rule about this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally - if you wanted to do a \u0027whip around the planet and return\u0027 mission, should I read the above as needing some percentage of deltaV of the \u0027Low Orbit\u0027 requirements?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-27T17:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yes, those are typical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eduring transfer windows.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EShould have made clear.
