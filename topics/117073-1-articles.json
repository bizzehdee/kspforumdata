I mean, adding them all under the category imply you need to descend and rise the buttons, it is a hassle ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, something more like having filters all up in combo boxes and choosing those you want ... (I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m really clear XD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, yeah, a good example would be like in excel when you use filter ! You can then choose whatever you want, one / multiple criteria for each filter available ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there is other points but this one would be so much better !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne point would be to give an easier way to modder to add their category / subcategory, simply by adding the name in a .cfg for example ... or even simplier, if a category name in a .cfg does not exist, simply adding it ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust that would make me so happy !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoda","CreatedById":149369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T19:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI already do this.\u003Cp\u003EThere are categories for Kolonization and Freight already pre-bundled that move the parts from Utility into their own custom tabs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@RoverDude Can you say how you add Kolonization parts to kolonization, iam looking at cfg files and at category there is none which i understand to not go to any category of parts but there is sub category and it says -2, for freight it says -1 and for eva it says 0.
