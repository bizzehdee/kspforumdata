Maybe 2.5 needs little tweaks to be more inline with 1.25 and 3.75. Currently it 2.5m cryo differs from 1.25 and 3.75 versions in 2 things; cryo engine has more thrust (TWR) compared to stock but worse dV performance to stock ratio compared to 1.25 and 3.75m.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nconsidering atmo cryo engines comparison - it\u0027s much harder for many reasons. However playing with different configurations I consistently get 200-300 less dV to orbit even with boosters. Then this is compounded by the fact that they have often TWR less than 1 in atmo (with comparable atmo dV to stock) so they don\u0027t accelerate rocket comparably fast compared to stock lifters when there\u0027s a need for this. Comparison for 3.75m is even worse since stock 3.75m 4000 kN engines are IMHO unbalanced and too op in every respect (thrust, isp and mass wise compared to stock 2.5m and 1.25m equivalents).\n\nedit: a quick comparison between atmo 2.5 stock and cryo engines:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal orbital speed when fuel runs out, max thrust all the time, flying straight upwards, no payload except mk1-2 capsule:\n\n2770 cryo atmo 2.5 (2.5m pod, 3 jumbo tanks LH2/OX)\n\n2860 cryo atmo 2.5 (2,5m pod, 2 jumbo tanks LH2/OX)\n\n3370 stock single atmo 2.5 (2.5m pod, 2 jumbo tanks LF/OX)\n\n3490 stock dual atmo 2.5 (2.5m pod, 2 jumbo tanks equiv LF/OX)\n\n------------------------- same test but added 6 biggest boosters with separators ----------------------\n\n4046 cryo 2 jumbo tanks\n\n4230 stock single 2 jumbo tanks\n\n4100 stock dual 2 jumbo tanks equiv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo we can see that even without payload and with added boosters cryo atmo engines are worse than stock even though on paper they have 200more dV in atmo and vac.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo yah personally I have currently no incentive to use cryo atmo engines over stock (except beautiful flame and look ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif))) However cryo vac engines are very viable as 2nd stage and are really interesting alternative to stock atm ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T14:07:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T11:25:19Z","Content":"Honestly I think these cryo\u0027s are a bit overpowered.
