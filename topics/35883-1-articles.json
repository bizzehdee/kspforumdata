It is a matter of tweaking rocket designs to find that ideal medium of thrust, launch weight to orbit, and matching of staging to get the mission done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, your design should get your payload into orbit with the second stage having enough fuel left to get you into a Mum orbit or Kerbal escape velocity. From there, you can tweak the design to get a bigger payload into orbit for station construction or smaller to conduct orbital missions at reduced cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe smaller, lighter, more efficient designs are much easier to control during launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce there is a bigger selection of engine power ranges, that task of tweaking designs will become a lot easier. Example, a rocket between the power of a T-30 and an T-909 would be useful for a second stage after a T-30 powered first stage and have the power to push a T-909 power third stage efficiently into orbit.
