I have the parts but the control windows are not showing up. I have the most resent updates for the mods and the parts are there but no controls. As far a IR goes I also installed the most resent tweak scale which also isn\u0027t working. The only other mod I have now is KW Rocketry which is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
