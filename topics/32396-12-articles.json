They made a script that took all the mass from the magazines and put it into the (large) central engine. The only things I can immediately think of that could work similarly would be to 1) take the mass from the various storage units and put it in the launchpad/runway, 2) increase the physical size of the storage tanks, or 3) decrease the capacity of the storage tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note: It seems some designs arbitrarily can\u0027t be loaded. I tried to make a smaller and better-reinforced storage truck, but for some reason nothing happens.
