This is interesting\u00A0because some posit that after the great bombardment Earth woukd have been cold and the best place for life would have been isolated upwellings and volcanic pools. If this were the case why don\u0027t we several versions, each evolved from independent bioneogenesis. The current timing now\u00A0is between 3.5 and 4.2 billion years ago, which means the interval between the first archae and first complex is on the order 2.5 to 3.6 billion years. What this either tells us is that life did not evolve easily or that most life was low level junk, possibly as life on other planets, and\u00A0only one life form had the qualities to proceed onward as earths conditions became more favorable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yet as we observe the keplar data we find nothing\u00A0even close to being as optimal as earth, and primarily planets that orbit non-sun like stars. What is worse, we\u00A0are not even clearly aware how much atmosphere the inner planets had at formation, or how magnetically active our own sun was. And yet we continue to call planets earth-like when they orbit stars that are nowhere near sunlike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a metric, most of the stars so far picked as candiates are not visible tonthe naked eye, in fact no red dwarf is visible to the\u00A0naked eye. The overwhelming majority of stars we see are without telescopes\u00A0are two shortlived to support complex life. The overwhelming majority of stars we cannot see locally because of faintness are too red to support life. A large hanful\u00A0\u00A0stars within\u00A0100 light years of earth fit the longevity and emmisive characteristics of our sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt what point does searching for ETs become futile, 1000 ly? This is not to argue\u00A0that we could not travel to other stars, but in the end it might require a very tenacious and conservative population that waits 100s\u00A0of thousands of years for a star to come close enough we can jump to it, and then establish colonies or do terriforming,\u00A0\u00A0so that we are expanding say a light year outward every 500,000. How long would it take us to create a SOI of 2000\u00A0light years in radius? A billion years, but the galaxy is 100 light years across, and we could fit hundreds of these bubbles into it and still never encounter another alien species.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0And so sun like stars have a certain metal content thus a certain age bracket in our galaxy, there are not alot of time in the milky way for Earth like planets around sun-like stars to have enough time to spread. I don\u0027t think you are\u00A0going to find\u00A0gnat-like sentients that have \u0027brine shrimp egg\u0027-like cysts. Something that could be placed on a hawkings flyer and lasered to the\u00A0next world as a seed ship. Given IS travel appears to be a hinge point in the mobility of humans, its probably an equal hinge point for other species as well. When we factor in that all of the more curious and inventive animals on earth tend to have\u00A0EQs on the high side, its going to be some species with both mass and higher EQ needing a ship at least the size of a space capsule just to survive in IS space, not to mention accelerate or decelerate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits\u00A0not surprising at all that as more data cimes in why we we have not been visited, what is increadingly surprising to me is people are hyping up the earth-like world and Fermi paradox explanations \u0027proper\u0027 when the observation and need for explanations doesn\u0027t seem to exist.. Where is the life? Show me something even remotely capable\u00A0of supporting life, not some hype -piece that is pulled off of\u00A0MSNBC.\u00A0\u00A0Sunlike stars are not hard to see in any good telescope.\u00A0If\u00A0not, the bubble is moved so far away from earth the paradox inevitably voids itself. It is of no importance, and we would be left looking for traces of pre-archae like cells in the\u00A0atmospheres of very far off worlds, shaking our heads and pondering whether the world would be worth colonizing or just use the star as a way point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T12:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222612729\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464864516\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Baron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Green Baron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep :-).
