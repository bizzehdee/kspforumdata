It was quite an exciting trip, but when I had set up the fuel lines incorrectly and my middle engine ran out, I thought nothing of it, but it caused a heck of alot of problems ;P As I was lowering myself down, my plane started to wobble alot and became hard to control. I ended up flipping around on my way down, ended up going retrograde (Is that right?), completely stopping myself, then going the other way, then back again. This continued for some time before I managed to get it under control, with only 2000 meters to spare. It was nerve racking heh, just to end up crashing at your destination when you spent 40 minutes getting there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E Got some screenshots for you guys, unfortunantely none of when I was flipping around. And by the way, if anybody ever plans to go there, it is very flat so landing isn\\\u0027t much of a problem 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
