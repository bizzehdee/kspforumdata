To answer your question: I\u0027m assuming you know where the action groups tab is (correct me if I\u0027m wrong). The list includes Custom Group 1-10, simply click on one of these groups, then click on the part you want to assign to that group. The 3rd window will now show a list of actions that part (or parts if you attached multiples at the same time, eg. 4 x solar panels with 4x symmetry) can perform. Click on the action you want, that action is now set to that action group. These custom groups are mapped to your numeral keys 1-0 on the keyboard, so for example, if you\u0027ve mapped \u0022toggle solar panels\u0022 to custom group 1, pressing 1 in-flight will extend the panels, and pressing 1 again will retract them. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s just the numbers on the top of the keyboard, or if you can use the numberpad as well, I\u0027m going to try that actually...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BBcokeley","CreatedById":103306,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T11:31:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL, cheers, so ridiculously easily straightforward, I overlooked the number keys, how silly of me, thanks for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould make sense seeing as they are mapped to 1-0 custom keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill try tonight on a ship just plastered in stuff to get a feel for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CarlosMaximus","CreatedById":99289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T20:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo probs.
