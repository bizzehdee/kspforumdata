The question in quantum mechanics is how close you can get to Planck\u0027s scale and begin seeing non-conservations. I don\u0027t think Comptoms wavelength is a perfect lower limit to space time considerations in fact physicist cannot even get close enough to Comptoms length to measure whether this may be true or not. It is not a proof that there is variance, BUT for Cannae to be exploiting such variance........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-the type of energy they are using in the device is nowhere near this, and therefore the energy deviations from Planck scale must be significant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-these virtual particles come and go fleetingly, there are no many in space at any one moment, and as I have said I do not believe the device produces enough high energy to alter their existence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-they would need to be acting on many of these at once otherwise as NorthStar commented acting on \u0027empty\u0027 space would produce light thrust and trivially more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-and at the E=hv they are using these particles would have to forming a virtual cluster which requires both multiples and virtual particle stability (IOW the field is stabilizing particles that come into existence long enough for them to form some sort of array) but they still cannot be long-lived so must be sped up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-it could not be scaled up infinitely in power except through making much more volumetric (and massive) devices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The reason their electronics keep failing . . . . . . . . . . . . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all could be true since virtual particles have near infinite degrees of freedom (statistically also meaning that very few are going to interact with any specific hv). In addition if they are accelerating particles to near speed of light, then they would increase mass and live longer which might change their behavior, but you have to get them to the speed of light first and I don\u0027t see their MW interacting with virtual particles because, frankly, they are too short lived. Virtual particles that live much longer are no longer virtual and we would see their footprint. BUT if they are generating matter anti-matter pairs and if a particular frequency is good at keeping them apart for whatever reason . . . . . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would point out the quantum vacuum perturbations is one of the explanations in multiverse theory. This piece of equipment may have found a tweak zone in which, conservation holds most of the time because of the laws of mass action and random moment directions, but the directions and frequencies are able to make them less random. I don\u0027t think this is a violation of uncertainty principle. The analogy I would make here is NMR and its ability to capture information that is otherwise random. For the devise to work there has to be spin asymmetry, you have to have giant magnetic field and then apply radio frequency across it. Not all particles will generate a coherent signal and particles that do will only do so in the presence of a giant magnetic field otherwise the spins randomize in space. Other particles can be coerced to talk by doping them with neutrons or taking a isotopic variant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do happen to agree, theoretically the momentum should go somewhere but if the particles travel not much farther than Planck\u0027s length, in theory they and their momentums can go back into local space and perhaps send a wave through that space. The problem is that one of the unknown areas of the standard model is what exactly the Higgs field and how many types of sub-fields comprise the field, are there particles that handle different aspects of fields in empty space. Some of the momentum may be transferred back to the device and thus lost as inefficiency and some may be lost to other masses in vacuum chamber (i.e the chamber itself - thats why it needs to be tested in space it may become much less efficient when there is no surrounding mass). There are still questions remaining in the Standard model about the \u0027background configuration of empty space\u0027 so I would contest that \u003Cem\u003Equantum mechanics is in complete defiance\u003C/em\u003E. If it is then I think they are also arguing from assumption. The problem is that the Cannae explanation is a proof from negative information. Too fuzzy heads arguing each other means that some clear-head needs to do an experiment. Launch that sucker into space and lets see if its efficiency changes.
