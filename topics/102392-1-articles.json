I really want to continue my game (I know I can play) but a minus date is annoying. The first time I was thinking it\u0027s problem with my one of addon which I use but then I checked it on unmodded version of KSP and still the same problem :|\n\nI was thinking to change UT value in save file to smaller but it might mess up my ships (with and/or without Kerbals on aboard).\n\nSo is there any good solution for this?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T14:19:46Z","Content":"It\u0027s due to the fact that KSP can only save values to so many digits (32, I think?), and because of how binary numbers work, once you pass the maximum value you will come back to negative the maximum value. I\u0027m fairly sure it will eventually loop back around. You could time warp until it comes back to zero, but that would take a long time.\n\nChanging the UT value will rewind the ships along their orbits by however long you change it by.

It is a quick hack and would still be better than having the overflow go negative... Not many players would ever reach years above 100 anyways."}]}
