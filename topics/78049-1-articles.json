We suspect we were wrong, 0600 Hours Later The Satellite\u0027s Signal Dropped, Lost it Completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily we were able to recover some footage being recorded from our stations before it went down... But unfortunately, The footage recovered didn\u0027t give us any thing on why this happened, And how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 1200 Hours, We declared the Satellite M.I.A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe didn\u0027t have enough tech to actually steal a satellite, Which left us all to speculate Where did it go...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 0600 Hours The Next Day, We recovered peaces of the satellite, But not the whole satellite itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe believe the remaining peaces were either salvaged by bandits, or stolen by a secret enemy that hid themselves well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the clock hit 0600 Hours The Next Day, We started an operation, Sweeping and clearing every single KSC Station we found, And thought were abandoned. We could NOT Allow this to happen again... It was called \u0022Operation Redstone King\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had a co-operation with Northern Kerbin Allied Forces and The Kerbin Special Space Activities Division They are the best of the best when it comes to space, and ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we briefed all of our teams, The next day it was time to go Teams ready... Their names Hitman 1 and Bravo 12 The Allied Forces Are Grabbing intel on enemy positions by AC-130, With some weapons for support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey landed at the LZ, But something wasn\u0027t right... Our team\u0027s transports were being fired on right when we entered their airspace, Something wasn\u0027t right... And they all knew it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing only a few transports were badly damaged, None destroyed. We we\u0027re trying to ensure everyone made it back, So we built a new transport based off of an old one we used, But upgraded it\u0027s armor and weapons With as much stealth as we could give it... Stealth drives were just invented in the time we\u0027re in and they weren\u0027t perfect... But they got the job done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo our teams landed and the Allied Force\u0027s Intel told our teams that enemies had patrols and were sending infantry search parties and armored search parties, It wasn\u0027t a pretty sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan of this mission was to get all of the known KSC Places swept and cleared grabbed all intel and everything, Each known place would be cleared by this team, They would get in and clear it, Then get to the helicopter and fly to the others and rinse and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo our enemy, We took to calling them \u0022The Federation\u0022 Due to their nature of battle and urban weaponry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut our one advantage, Was tech, Organization, Teamwork. We had the most important of advantages, One being tech. They only had old salvaged weaponry from the 1950s and the kuban war... Not good at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce our teams got to the base without being spotted, It was time to go loud... We tried to set up some explosives to get a bit of a surprise, Only able to plant a few on some places that wouldn\u0027t shake them alot... But would surprise them. Our AC-130s Had New GAU-19s We\u0027ve been working on them for a while, They worked out well. Our first tech developed with laser weaponry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see this was only the end of the modern age, And so we had a bit of tech, And a bit of future tech, A Lot of it nothing special.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce our teams held through and cleared the first center, We decided to think about pulling them back. The enemy damaged a few of our transports and we didn\u0027t want to take a chance on our team\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe finally cleared the first station, Then it happened... Our teams comms went out... They went completely black, It then happened!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe enemy some how managed to invent a substitute for our normal EMP Systems with the satellite\u0027s parts, They launched an EMP And all of our transports wen\u0027t completely dark, and all of our teams died in a crash... We only had one, with possible survivors, For months we searched and we had to finally call it quits, They were Declared M.I.A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext mission report in the UKS Series coming soon \u0022United Kerbin States\u0022!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T02:03:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bearsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
