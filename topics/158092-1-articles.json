A lot of it has to do with the golden rule of rocketry: \u0022heavy bits at the front, draggy bits at the back\u0022. So yes, it\u0027s quite possible that you have too much stuff stuck to the capsule. Not only will they be creating drag on the wrong end of the vessel, but it also looks like you are not using symmetric attachment. This may result in one side of the rocket having more drag and/or mass than the other side, and that tends to pull you off course in a hurry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend employing a service bay, attached right below the capsule. Service bays are parts that have a high heat and impact tolerance, have doors, and are empty inside. So you can stick things like goo canisters, antennas, batteries and other such stuff in there, and they won\u0027t be generating any drag. Once in orbit, you can open the bay doors and access everything. The 1.25m service bay is unlocked in the same node that includes radial parachutes, so you already have access to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that can cause your rocket to flip over is bad piloting. Make sure that you are flying a nice and smooth turn, and don\u0027t let the nose deviate too much from the prograde marker. The way I see it, you have five hammers in your first stage; that\u0027s way more thrust a rocket of this size needs. If they\u0027re not thrust limited by hand in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, they\u0027re going to shoot you into the sky like a cannon. And because they are so heavy, generate so much drag, and don\u0027t have thrust vectoring, you probably cannot turn your rocket sideways as much as you need to. Then when you decouple, you try to correct your trajectory by turning sideways hard, and boom, you flip because you deviated too much to the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it bears noting that your rocket is overbuilt and inefficient. Normally, staging more helps you get more range, but because the Swivel engine is so heavy (it\u0027s not designed for use in upper stages - you\u0027ll unlock better engines for that soon), this actually works against you in this case. Too little fuel on too much dry mass means each stage barely gets you a little further. For example: you can actually push a capsule to orbit with just a single swivel engine, no other stages and no boosters necessary. Your rocket has five boosters and two swivel engines across three stages - you can see the difference, I\u0027m sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry the following rocket - it should do everything you need with plenty margin for error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1x Mk1 Pod\u003Cbr\u003E\n1x Mk16 Parachute\u003Cbr\u003E\n1x 1.25m Service Bay (put anything you like in there)\u003Cbr\u003E\n1x TR-18A Decoupler\u003Cbr\u003E\n8x FL-T200 fuel tank (or equivalent in other tank sizes)\u003Cbr\u003E\n1x LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 Engine\u003Cbr\u003E\n2x TT-38K Radial Decouplers (attached in symmetry to the bottom fuel tank)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2x RT-10 \u0022Hammer\u0022 Solid Boosters (attached to the radial decouplers)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust limit the Hammers to 70% by right-clicking them in the editor.

Your booster stage has a lot of drag -- more than your top stage. When you get rid of your booster stage, then what\u0027s left in the back end has less drag than your top stage, so the rocket flips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFairings or service bays can sometimes fix the problem. Sometimes adding some fins at the bottom of the main\u00A0stage can fix the problem. Sometimes launching straight up can fix the problem. Sometime adding control surfaces at the very top of the rocket can fix the problem. Sometimes adding control surfaces at the bottom of the main stage can fix the problem. Sometimes just moving all the draggy parts on the top stage down just a little can solve the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, you can understand that this is an aerodynamics problem. Once your rocket is above 35km altitude, there is no more aerodynamics to worry about. So one other thing you can do is to use kickbacks, or otherwise modify your booster stage so that it does not burn out until you are at 35km altitude. Then you can stage it away and the air will be too thin to flip your rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-23T12:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what\u0027s where on this rocket, but ONE radial chute means you MUST have it non-symmetrical.\u00A0 The tiny science parts probably aren\u0027t a problem, but the goo might be.\u00A0 Your third stage is too much rocket and not enough fuel, better to just add fuel to the second stage, and probably some fins right above the engine.\u00A0 Launch profile sounds likely to be the biggest problem if you haven\u0027t dialed down the outer 4 SRBs for the launch, since you won\u0027t be able to turn fast enough off the pad (and may not even know you needed to) ... turn a few degrees to the east immediately then try to hold prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, the service bay\u0027s nice to protect stuff, but can make the reentry stage flip-happy if you don\u0027t weight the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-23T12:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222994510\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158092\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490255832\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156864\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr.K Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Dr.K Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have senator a in the wrong spot?
