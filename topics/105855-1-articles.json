My mod is calling explode() for certain parts on the active vessel that meet certain conditions, and I need to record a flight event with the reason why the part exploded (by default, the game is not recording any event that the part has exploded). Any easy way to do this? Thanks to anyone that can help!"},{"CreatedByName":"stevehead","CreatedById":137745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:42:21Z","Content":"Nevermind, figured it out...\n\n    FlightLogger.eventLog.Add(string item)\n\nThe FlightLogger class was not listed in any of the online KSP API documentations I have been looking at."}]}
