It used to be something like Joystick1Button6, Joystick2Button6 etc, but they have both become JoystickButton6 and act as if they were the same button (I found this out at the end of a successful rescue mission when about to execute my deorbit burn I clicked what used to be decrease time warp on my stick, and it dutifully did so, as well as executing what was bound on my throttle button 6, which was -naturally- stage separation )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStrangely the control axes are still tracked separately for the throttle, stick and pedals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit I have tried reconnecting the throttle, restarting the computer and moving the throttle to another USB port on a different root hub, but none of this solved the issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/https://imgur.com/a/shzmC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlbum https://imgur.com/a/shzmC will appear when post is submitted\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-04T10:54:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2018 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Fast-and-Free\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
