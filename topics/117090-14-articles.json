So many ins, outs, shafts, gears...wow. And I thought the F1 turbopump was bad. Sadly, I\u0027m not quite yet up to the task of trying to model the pump in too much detail... but I think I got the important bits. And there are many, many, different variants of this engine; trying to find consistent information was...ugh. I probably still have some details from other variants in there... hard to keep them all straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso going to do 2 other RL-10 variants\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERL-10A-4-2N -- modern day \u0027short\u0027 RL-10, which has a short extendable nozzle (in reality it is offered with no extension, fixed extension, or mechanical extension); minor thrust, isp, and mass increase\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERL-10B-2-1 -- the long one, used on the ICPS and many others.

Looking into a few other engines as well... but honestly the RL10 has been used almost exclusively for US upper stages (and I\u0027m not all that familiar with the Russian stuff...yet). The other main candidate is the AJ-10 engine; a hypergolic thruster that has been (and still is) used everywhere, in many different variants. Between the two it should offer a fairly decent selection of smaller upper stage engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot quite sure what to do regarding smaller lifter / lower stage engines.

Hopefully I\u0027ll have enough engines by mid next week, and can start working on the mounting stuff for that weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, quick heads up that there might not be much/anything on this weekends update. I\u0027ll take a look into the effects stuff likely Sat. morning, so might have some of that ready.

However I have to redo it a bit to add all the plumbing/pumps and bring it in line with the other engine models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the ICPS/HUS balance -- yep, there is a pretty wide gap between them at the moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly happy where the HUS is; it has been balanced (volume wise at least) to be in line with stock fuel tanks for resources and mass, and is intended as its name would suggest, a -Heavy- upper stage, to enable lifting of the 200-400t payloads that the system should be capable of. Which is also why it has gobs of thrust. I might have forgotten about the ISP; it is supposed to be down in the ~340 range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ICPS though, has been balanced towards being a dedicated range-extender for the CSM stack to enable Mun/Minmus operation (and is likely useless for any other purpose). I\u0027m basically trying to emulate the performance stats you would get if the thing were actually LH2 powered, without breaking stock balancing in regards to ISP. I\u0027m not entirely happy with it though, and will likely be redoing it a bit, but unsure what direction to go with it. Would love to bring it in-line with stock balancing; the problem is you end up with \u0026gt;3.5kms of dV from it (with the CMS on top) due to its volume, and it ends up weighing 35t by itself due to stock fuel densities and poor ISP, making it far too heavy and powerful for its intended purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T17:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo are you going to make an Ares rocket from Constellation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
