I\u0027ve been trying to set my auxilliary boosters to divert fuel towards the center stage, but this doesn\u0027t work--I\u0027ve tried attaching at various different points, but the game simply does not want to attach the fuel ducts in the actual game, only the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny enough, I\u0027ve noticed this issue across multiple versions of the game--and it feels totally random. It\u0027s not because the fuel duct is clipping with an irregular part of one of the tanks, and making the fuel duct longer (with attachment points further away from each other) doesn\u0027t help either.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-31T06:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm. Well, other people are having the same problem with struts -- but I haven\u0027t heard about it with fuel ducts before -- but fuel ducts and struts are almost the same thing in the program. And with struts, if you try to fix the attachment again, it almost always works. And once it\u0027s attached properly, AFAIK, it always works after that on the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yes, the strut thing has been happening since 1.1.0, I think. Since 1.1.0, fuel ducts and struts have accidentally had very large aerodynamic drags -- so I\u0027ve tried to avoid both of them until now. So I\u0027m probably not the best person to be writing a response here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it were me, I\u0027d be trying to do manual fuel transfers instead of using fuel ducts.
