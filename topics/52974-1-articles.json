As a result, they rotate and wobble around this point, which usually results in unplanned disassembly. Placing multiple decouplers up the length of the main rocket doesn\u0027t help because they\u0027re not connected to the outside stack and when they decouple they tend to explode in hilarious fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from large amounts of strutting, there doesn\u0027t seem to be an elegant solution to this issue. Is it just me being stupid? Am I missing something obvious? Is there a solution, such as attaching docking ports to both sides prior to connecting the tanks so when physics loads all the decouplers are properly linked? (has someone tried this?)? Or do I just have to grin and bear it? For reference, I like to build pretty tall rockets, so I have Kerbal Reinforcement installed which makes this easier, but it doesn\u0027t seem to solve this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, are there any mod sets that have really long decouplers that are, say, nearly the length of an orange fuel tank so the connection is stronger?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T16:00:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmappedout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberFuber","CreatedById":90736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T15:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESad to say, I think the current solution is, as you said, strut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I think you only need about 1 strut to main structure per fuel-tank. Two for the big, orange ones.

While they will NOT be attached in the editor technically, they SHOULD dock almost instantly upon physics enable. Only thing you\u0027ll need to watch for is uniform distance from the center stack, so you may need to get rid of the radial decoupler and opt for docking port-only connections. Again, the pieces, if built correctly, will not connect in the editor, but will dock upon physics load. However, this really isn\u0027t the best option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bad news: It won\u0027t matter how long you make the decoupler, unfortunately, since you\u0027ll still only attach at one point. The tank would pivot around there and just clip through it as it bows/bends under the weight (just like any other time you\u0027d do this with a teeny tiny decoupler). So, a really long decoupler isn\u0027t going to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe neutral: It looks like strutting is your only real option, unless something fundamental to the way the game calculates collisions and craft trees is changed. However, strutting doesn\u0027t have to be ugly. Put two struts on top and two struts on bottom of each radial tank, connecting to the central stack. Put one strut on top and one on bottom connecting to the next tank over (if you\u0027re using more than two tanks). Add some separation motors to push them out of the way (since the struts will kill your decoupler force) and that should be all you need. This method (using the KW heavy struts for me, but I\u0027ve no reason to believe it wouldn\u0027t work for stock ones) holds two orange tanks stacked atop each other to a central 3.75m core. I\u0027m sure you can adapt it in your own way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, looks like strutting is going to be your only valid option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T15:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers; that\u0027s a shame.

Instead, mount each one individually to the core on its own decoupler with small gaps between the side tanks, and connect the side tanks with fuel lines from the top down. Functionally, this would be the same as having all the side tanks directly connected to each other but with the added stability of each tank being directly connected to the core.
