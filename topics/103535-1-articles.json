I\u0027ve figured out that I need to add fuels to fuel tanks to get them to work and have had several sucessful flights with liquid fuel rockets.\n\nHowever, whenever I try to use any kind of solid booster (whether the procedural one or any of those included in part packs), I can\u0027t figure out how to add fuel to them. This is what I see when I have the boosters in the VAB:\n\n![eWpgDlV.png](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/eWpgDlV.png)\n\nI can\u0027t see any way of adding the fuel. If I select \u0027Show tank GUI\u0027 it simply states that \u0027this fuel tank cannot hold resources\u0027\n\nIf I try and launch, the staging shows nothing in the tanks, as does the resource display:\n\n![L6V8bV7.png](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/L6V8bV7.png)\n\nFull mod list: \n\nAdvanced Jet engine 2.03\n\nRemote Tech Config RSS 8.1.1\n\nModule Manager 2.6.0\n\nRealism Overhaul 8.3.1\n\nFS Hangar Extender v3.0\n\nRSS Textures 2048 1.0\n\nRealChute 1.3.1\n\nTACLC 0.10.2b\n\nProcedural Dynamics 0.9.3\n\nToolbar 1.7.8\n\nDeadly Reentry 6.4.0\n\nCustom Biomes 1.7.2\n\nCrossFeedEnabler 3.2\n\nKerbalJointReinforcement v3.1.2\n\nReal Fuels 8.4\n\nNear Future Propulsion 0.4\n\nFAR 0.14.7\n\nSmoke Screen 2.5.3\n\nNear Future Solar 0.4\n\nRealPlume 8.2.0\n\nTweakScale 1.52.1\n\nRSS 8.6.1\n\nTextureReplacer 2.3.1\n\nFASA 5.215\n\nModule RCSFX 3.5\n\nCLS 1.1.2.0\n\nRemoteTech 1.6.3\n\nBetter Buoyancy 1.1\n\nDDS Loader 1.9.0.0\n\nProcedural Fairings 3.11\n\nProcedural Parts 1.0.2\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nHelp me out guys I\u0027m really excited to start using Realism Overhaul ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T17:21:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrise6102**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T03:07:57Z","Content":"SRMs should default to being full.\n\nTry upgrading RealFuels to 9.0."}]}
