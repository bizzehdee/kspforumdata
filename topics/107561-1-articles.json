You can change your inclination before you actually circularize your orbit of the mun using the side and up to down nodes. You can use them to do the same thing if you want to skip setting up the node.. Its more guess work but works great. They help out on Precision landing too.\n\nAlso on your Nav ball all those markers that I use in tutorials are represented on the Maneuver nodes."}]}
