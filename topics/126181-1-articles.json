You see, I love using that thing, it greatly helps me with gravity turns and maintaining stability. But is it generally seen as cheating? It is most certainly debug tool but hey, KER is not considered cheating despite it giving more information than stock game provides.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:29:44Z","Content":"\nAnd there we go again...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:34:10Z","Content":"\nNo. This is a sandbox game at heart.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:34:20Z","Content":"\nYes, whenever you do this we are silently judging you so cease your cheating lest you invoke our wrath.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:44:11Z","Content":"\nNo, it isn\u0026#39;t even in the debug menu anymore.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T18:50:06Z","Content":"\nI consider playing KSP cheating. :wink:\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T21:48:27Z","Content":"\nYes it is. Everybody who uses it is very bad human being. Cheating in video games should be immediately criminalized and every guilty should be tortured to death if front of audience. There should be a government agency which instruct an official right way to play and everything else would be cheating.
