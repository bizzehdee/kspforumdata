The weight does need to be far back, I get the CoM in the aftmost of the three cargo bay sections, and then the swept wings put the CoL in the right place and the elevators are far back to have good control authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the aid of the cross-struts at the I-beam \u0022legs\u0022 the wings take the weight no problem, on 0.5 strength in FAR at least. Heck, I\u0027m now working on a full Shuttle version with big Kerbodyne tanks and it still sits fine on its wingtips before takeoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTakeoff and ascent is mostly a doddle, loads of power. The Panther with its afterburner is your friend as a VTOL engine. Do watch for having enough air intake though. My biggest difficulty has been not overheating the nose, because the pointy nosecone has a lower heat tolerance. I put an antenna on the nose and a little fuel in the 1.25-2.5m tank and that helped draw the heat away but I still need to watch the thermals and be ready to throttle back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-entry isn\u0027t too hard. Maintain a good angle of attack, control your vertical speed, use S-turns if required, and don\u0027t forget the option of pumping fuel fore and aft for balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tricky bit is, of course, landing. My approach is to glide in low and slow but not too slow, then pitch up hard to vertical. I gradually increase the power to make sure the nose doesn\u0027t drop away, and Vernors and plenty of SAS help yank it up. Once it\u0027s pointing at the sky I hit hold radial out on the SAS. If I do it well I\u0027ll gain about a kilometre in this manoeuvre, if I do it badly I\u0027ll gain several.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in the hover I can\u0027t descend too quickly, the plane is after all unstable flying backwards. 30-40 m/s is about the maximum. For this reason I feel jet engines are basically mandatory for the landing, rockets will just guzzle too much fuel. Controlling the descent speed requires practice, a delicate touch on the throttle, and careful attention to the TWR reported in KER.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to ensure there\u0027s enough air for the jets. I put scoop intakes facing backwards for this, and ramp intakes face forwards. With such an arrangement be aware that least airflow tends to be in the -10 to 10 m/s speed range. You really don\u0027t want one of your lift engines flaming out on you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeware of having too little TWR as well. The design above has two RAPIERs and two Panthers, and that\u0027s enough with no payload, but trying to land with a 5 ton payload put the TWR barely above 1. And thrust is less the higher you are. That meant cases where I would accelerate in my descent and either flip over or hit the ground hard. The successor design has switched to one RAPIER and four Panthers, to give ample thrust for landing without much of an increase in weight actually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final touchdown needs to be gentle, a few m/s. The wings give some \u0022spring\u0022 and mean it likes to bounce, and it\u0027s very easy to tip over. The Vernors up front are meant to help keep it steady of course. If you\u0027re playing without quickloads and reverts, don\u0027t be afraid to just hit Z and abort the landing if it looks about to tip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-24T11:56:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2016 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbin vonKerbal","CreatedById":157973,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T13:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say your best bet is to keep the CoM leaning towards your desired tail-side, add some control/landing surfaces on your tail,\u00A0and just burn retro.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBiggest thing would probably be keeping your CoM at the bottom so your tail stays rear-oriented.

My initial thought would be that fuel pumping for mass adjustment could allow for two flight modes, especially if those tail fins aren\u0027t too huge and there are canards or vernier thrusters. The space-plane approach with last minute maneuver is awesome too. I wonder how you imagine the crew is oriented? Like the mk1-2 or mk3 pods or like the hitchhiker?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T12:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, a single stage design in KSP typically has its CoM shift back towards the heavy engine as the fuel is burned off... so that works well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should be possible to havethe CoM ahead of the CoL when its full (ie, for ascent when you want the point end facing forward), and the CoM behind the CoL when its nearly empty and you just want to do a propulsive landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my only tailsitting spaceplane...

Can still land on and lauch from Kerbin if you refuel on the ground. Worked in 1.0.5. When accompanied by a ISRU clipper, it can visit any body, even those where the ISRU vessel can\u0027t go.

By moving around the fuel you can make it so that she assumes a stable attitude, entering belly down and the nose 20-70 degrees above prograde, as you desire. You can also make her come down tail-first, but that\u0027s not good for reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn oder to land on Laythe with enough fuel for the return (= lots of extra mass), you need to do a juicy de-orbit burn of 800m/s or so, otherwise she will go up in flames no matter the attitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout gimbals and overall little control, I opted for a parachute landing.

Will drain the outriggers top-down, then the core. No fuel lines needed. Becomes aerodynamicall unstable when the outer top tanks are drained: stand by with the fuel pumps (or lock/unlock tanks) when launching from Kerbin.
