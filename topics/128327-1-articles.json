I have been having some fun except when I attempt orbit because my RCS thrusters will not work. I have deduced the problem to the fact that it seems like the procedural tank is missing functionality types. I only have the options for structural and fuselage. I see everywhere else (YouTube, forums, etc.) \u00A0(and even in the part description!!) that there are options for default, balloon, service module, etc.. I am convinced that I need to change the the tank type to service module but it is not there. I added modular fuel tanks to my game data but the procedural tank is missing after I reload the game.. the modular fuel tanks config file is located in the procedural parts module manager in game data.. I\u0027m completely stuck..

Fuselage, like ServiceModule, is highly pressurized and thus you can place RCS propellants in it. Set your thrusters to whatever propellant you want, then place\u00A0 a proc tank, make sure it\u0027s set to fuselage, and fill it with that propellant. Note that you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E need a valid fuel crossfeed from the tank to the thruster, so if you have parts in between with No Crossfeed, it won\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that RCS effects are weak to nonexistent for some reason, so instead of relying on visual FX, rely on propellant consumption. Turn on RCS (you will need sufficient avionics to do so), and try thrusting. If the propellant in the tank goes down, they\u0027re working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to look at the RP-0 tutorials, they explain this sort of thing. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note you get \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E little thrust out of them, practically zero, at sea level.

It wasn\u0027t what I had previously thought (thank you for explaining that to me). I narrowed it down to my thrusters not being assign to the rcs action group! I am completely new to ksp and I have no idea what action groups even do, but it is now something I will look into. Thank you for your suggestion on using them in space because I probably would have never known to do that as I was\u00A0looking for the visual FX!\u00A0I do have to ask you when you think a patch for the rcs FX will be coming out, though.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T19:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs soon as I get time (or someone else does), not sure when...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trnr428","CreatedById":155635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T22:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAghh I am again having issues. I have 138/223 N class attitude jets attached radially to a fuel tank. The engineer says that they are not receiving monopropellant and continues to show this for nitrogen and nitrous\u00A0oxide. I haven\u0027t tried helium yet (as I don\u0027t want to purchase it yet, and I need the NO2 for the higher specific impulse for the small tanks) but one thing that makes the message go away is if I use monopropellant and mess with\u00A0the mass slider. Simply loading monopropellant into a real fuels tank should not work, and I cannot understand why it will not register that there is fuel in there, even after switching fuel types back and forth, tank shapes, tank types, deleting and re-adding tanks and thrusters. This is what happened last time but it seemed to have solved itself and I have no idea how. I have also found that the engineer is saying that there is unused NO2 source as well as the battery that\u0027s attached. I checked all of my connections and everything seems fine.. crossfeeding is enabled for all of the couplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-22T23:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2015 11:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by trnr428\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T03:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnore the engineer report.
