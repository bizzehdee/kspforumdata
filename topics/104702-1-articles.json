You can complete the tech tree only killing enemies on Kerbin, Mon and Minmus in more than 30 different missions. \n\nThis mod change techtree a bit allowing you to have plane earlier. Also, it change techs required and cost of BDarmory weapons.\n\nThis pack gives you different kinds of enemies in different places and situations: vehicles, convoys, radar stations, bases outside Kerbin, armed satellites, space carriers to capture.....\n\n5dim mod adds more weapons for space combat.\n\nThis mod is compatiple with support live mods. Also you can use more military mods if you wish. \n\nAll enemies are in Team B, so you have to play in the default team (A) if you want to enjoy. If you try to control enemy, vessels the game probably crash in any way.\n\nRemenber that targets load when you go to tracking station or fly a vessel. \n\n![kkombat1.png](http://5dim.es/kerbal/kkombat1.png)\n\n![kkombat2.png](http://5dim.es/kerbal/kkombat2.png)\n\n![kkombat3.png](http://5dim.es/kerbal/kkombat3.png)\n\n-= Download =-\n\nDonwload it from [CurseForge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/229754)\n\n(Please, vote in [this poll](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119770)about next changes)\n\n-= Requirements =-\n\n [BDarmory](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209)\n\n [Contract Configurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604)\n\nModuleManagement (included)\n\n-=Recommended mods =-\n\nMechjeb\n\nAnyone which gives you more weapons.\n\nBurn Together (if you need help)\n\nAlso you can see my youtube serie about this mod on my channel (in spanish):\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiwV1SOsYfQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n-= Changelog =-\n\n[v0.5] [2015-05-12] - \n\n- Better airplanes at start\n\n- Minor fixes about science and money rewards\n\n[v0.4] [2015-05-3] - \n\n- Added a new missile (ASM-135) for space battles.\n\n- Added a new bomb (ASM-135 bomb) for space bombard.\n\n- Weapons are now distributed in differents technologies.\n\n- Compatibility checked with BDArmory 0.8.0.\n\n[v0.3] [2015-04-30] - \n\n- 1.0 compatibility.\n\n- Missions descriptions translated to Spanish (sin acentos, no los coge el kerbal de ninguna forma)\n\n- Problems with names in Linux solved\n\n[v0.2] [2015-04-24] - \n\n- Solved MechJeb in some vehicles.\n\n- Now all vessels have an antenna to be compatible with RemoteTech.\n\n- Added a new drone to do firsts missions easier.\n\n[v0.1] [2015-04-22] - \n\n- Release\n\n-= License =-\n\nThe 5dim Military Contract Pack is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)\n\n-=Notes =-\n\nThanks to nightingale for his help and his mod.\n\nThanks to BahamutoD for his awesome mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T23:32:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by odin\\_spain**\n  \nRemoved Adfly link."},{"CreatedByName":"pip12345","CreatedById":18407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T21:28:37Z","Content":"Doh!\n\nOh man, just what I\u0027ve been waiting for all this time. \n\nFinally a good reason to start using BDarmory again other than doing turn based stuff while using my imagination, this opens up so many cool new possibilities.\n\nThank you VERY much for this amazing addition and I really hope you will continue with this, this is amazing!"},{"CreatedByName":"odin_spain","CreatedById":39806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T23:37:32Z","Content":"Thanks!!, I love BD armory too and I always wanted to have some kind targets."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T00:11:10Z","Content":"Wow This is too awesome I always wanted to play with BDs, but don\u0027t do DMP, and spending the time building targets just to blow them up just never appealed to me.
