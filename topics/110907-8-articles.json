On the other hand, KSP is probably the first game I\u0027ve played modded since Quake I, so I understand something about the stock mentality.\n\nPlaying stock is simple. If I like the game, I play it. If I don\u0027t like the game, I don\u0027t play it. Playing modded is much more complicated. Every single aspect of the game becomes my personal responsibility. If I don\u0027t like something in the game, it\u0027s my job to find a mod that changes it, or create a new mod myself. I have to judge things and make choices all the time, which is mentally exhausting.\n\nChoices are hard. Every choice I make in a game is one less choice I\u0027ll be able to do well elsewhere in my life. Most of the time, it\u0027s simply not worth the effort. The choices I make outside the game are usually more important, interesting, and/or fun.\n\nEven though I play KSP modded, I rarely install new mods, as they would bring unnecessary choices to the game. My list of \u0022stock mods\u0022 used to include FAR, DRE, Procedural Fairings, MechJeb, and Docking Port Alignment Indicator. The first three are no longer necessary, so I\u0027m down to two mods at the moment.

I keep a spreadsheet around for calculating my deltaV budgets, something many seem to do with a mod - I find that doing so manually makes me think the mission through more carefully (and overall immerses me more)."},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:06:23Z","Content":"I play stock. Generally i dislike mods in most games. Sometimes because they\u0027re unfinished or i don\u0027t agree with them or they \u0022rebalance\u0022 things. That said, a good mod deserves heaps of praise and requires a lot of effort, so i\u0027m carefull not to dis mods too much.\n\nFor KSP i tried several mods of which Alarm is really something that needs to be part of the game. A major failing of KSP is that you can only handly a single mission at a time without a way to easily and sensibly keep track of multiple ongoing missions. Given you can explore the Mun several times over in the time it takes to reach the nearest planet, it\u0027s a shame that there\u0027s no proper \u0022mission control\u0022. It\u0027s probably a major reason a lot of planets/moons are rarely visited and it\u0027s very silly to force an entire space program to shut down while a mission to a faraway planet is timewarped.\n\nAnother mod i used was the multiplayer mod although i wouldn\u0027t call that a mod. I don\u0027t know what to call it though, but it\u0027s not like it adds parts or alters gameplay mechanics. It allwed me to play and crash the game horribly together with other people, so it\u0027s quite amazing.\n\nLastly i was very happy to use TAC, but eventually was happier to stop using it when the next version of KSP came out. While the idea seems fine, the execution is fairly dull and repetitive. Same way as you make sure to have the means of generating and storing power, you make sure you have the parts needed to keep crew alive and happy. It boiled down to basically attaching some parts, but it was fun initially. One major disadvantage is that part count rises steadily as you use docking/orbital/station craft though that is a fault of the game and not the mod. I played the game with an \u0022all flights must be manned\u0022 rule and the part count became annoying. Even a skycrane had TAC parts tacked on as it had to be manned and thus reusable.

But I don\u0027t think it is the reason why it has not been added.\n\nI think the main (bad) reason Delta-V has not been added is that it gives a number which has to be somehow processed by the player. The rest of KSP does not require that at all. You can just assemble rockets like lego and play with them, and retry if it does not work. With KER you need to make a target deltaV computation (even if it is basic) yourself, in the principle it makes a big difference, it feels more geeky.\n\nFurthermore a game has to be self-contained, you should not need to check an external deltaV map. So this map should be somehow integrated in the game.\n\nOne option would be to provide some info about your mission (target, or even manoeuvre) and it would give you a warning if you don\u0027t have enough delta-V.

But I don\u0027t think it is the reason why it has not been added.\n\u003E I think the main (bad) reason Delta-V has not been added is that it gives a number which has to be somehow processed by the player. The rest of KSP does not require that at all. You can just assemble rockets like lego and play with them, and retry if it does not work.
