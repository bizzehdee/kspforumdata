Starting out with the basic question \u0027why are the kerbals going to space?\u0027 and eventually drilling down to quite specific points about why their world works the way it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original answer for that first question was a bit vague: \u0027because it\u0027s there\u0027. I wanted to write a story that took the \u0027parts found lying by the side of the road\u0027 meme seriously and tried to give a vaguely plausible backstory for the Kerbal Space Program that really did begin in Jeb\u0027s junkyard, and for no better reason than the fact that the founder members were all obsessed with space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were a couple of problems with that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Firstly, after a certain point, the story ran the risk of just becoming a list of rocket launches - and there\u0027s only so many ways I figured I could write about a rocket launch! Secondly, taking Jeb and Co. beyond LKO was going to stretch my junkyard space program idea beyond any plausibility it might have had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I needed another answer. The one I came up with wasn\u0027t particularly original - basically a Malthusian (overpopulation) crisis. However, that answer threw up another question - why is that crisis so bad that the kerbals need space travel to help solve it? The answers to that question turned out to be a bit more interesting, and threw up their own set of questions which helped to fill out the basic plot. That was helped by another unconnected question \u0027why are all kerbals called Kerman?\u0027 - and the answer to \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E question turned out to be the real kicker!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, the story was driven by a combination of reluctance to pull plot twists out of thin air for no apparent reason and good old fashioned making things up as I went along. The first part was helpful in turning a basic plot into a series of chapters - \u0027OK, I want to write about X but for X to happen I need to show A, B and C first and at least hint (however vaguely) at D and E.\u0027 The second part kept things interesting - if the story veered away from my plan or went down a side alley that meant the plan had to be revised - well that was fine. A plan is good, sticking too rigidly to it is bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s just my take.

This is not a sufficient condition, of course--maybe what the writer has to say is stupid, or he doesn\u0027t have the skills to say it well. I did set out to say a few things in D:OB. I had been playing KSP for some time and developed the Kerbfleet mythos in my own mind--I had the flag and some of the basic \u0027feel\u0027 of KF as an organization. When I started writing I just wanted to use that framework to make my Duna mission report more interesting and yes OK maybe get some rep for it. At that point no one else was doing comics so just doing the report in that format was a pretty good \u0027hook\u0027. Besides that, I had the KF framework and culture which I think resonated with readers because it worked as a holistic explanation for what everyone sees in-game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I came to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122280-Duna-Ore-Bust%21-a-KSP-Graphic-Novel-%28COMPLETE%29?p=1977342\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1977342\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst interlude \u003C/a\u003Eand found I had something more to say.

Take Parkaboy\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E Plan Kappa\u003C/em\u003E, for example; he obviously has put some thought into the back story and the sudden appearance of the future characters. \u003Cem\u003EIn Eve Order Zero\u003C/em\u003E, Kuzzter planned all along for the wonderfully-named Atmosferkdipperkraft (excuse the spelling) to crash-land on Eve. The entire series is named after the \u0022General Order Zero\u0022 that Bill just invented. None of this is a bad thing. Indeed, it makes for a well-thought-out story and an entertaining read. The challenge comes in that most of us then write as we go along, with some decisions and mistakes along the way. But what\u0027s written is written, and there is no going back. In my case, Ascent and I (who are two different people, if you hadn\u0027t caught on yet) have a strict rule of no reverts, no respawns. This makes for a very entertaining game because there is a real element of risk, but also a genuine feeling of fear, because mistakes have real consequences. When Valentina died, I was genuinely upset, which of course has to be reflected in the story somehow. But then comes the real challenge: emergent storytelling inherently means you don\u0027t know what\u0027s coming next.

Even if nobody reads, your story still serves as a good practice. I did a few attempts at mission reports before, and nearly nobody read or cared about them. But I learned from those experiences, and I think I found now a format that fits me. Doing prose is a bigger effort to me, since english isn\u0027t my first language, and so it turns out that I have a lot more fun creating comics than doing old-fashioned mission reports. To each his own, so don\u0027t try to emulate what you think is more \u0022popular\u0022, just experiment and find out what gives you pleasure to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: if you want to be an author, then don\u0027t just read other stories as a reader. Read them as an author. Try to figure out what makes the storyes you like work, and try to apply that to your own stories. But don\u0027t copy a plot, try to understant what makes a story special, try to imagine the steps its author took to arrive at the concept, the characters, the plot, and try to replicate those steps. For instance, the stories that I most enjoyed about KSP were stuff like Scott Manley\u0027s Reusable Space Program, Brotoro\u0027s Long-term Laythe Exploration and Kuzzter\u0027s graphic novels. All of those were mission reports, but not just reports of a generic career playthrough - each had a concept that guided gameplay, something simple to understand and interesting to follow. I tried to apply the same logic to Plan Kappa - do a mission report that people would be interested not only if it was well narrated, but would be curious to see, as players, how I played out a career with those self-imposed rules and objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird: about emergent storytelling, Deddly said it well. It\u0027s important to have an endgoal and some checkpoints that you plan to go through, but if you\u0027re doing a mission report, try to leave some margin for what the game brings. Don\u0027t set goals that are too strict, but looser ones, that can be reached by multiple paths. Plan Kappa has a lot of stuff that arises from me trying to fit what happens in the game with the backstory I had in my mind from the beginning. I think that\u0027s very interesting, because even I don\u0027t know where exactly the story will take me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T09:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECase in point--I expected a few pages of \u0022What?

I have pages of notes that start with a single question, sometimes as simple as \u0022Does this make sense?\u0022. Then I write down the first two or three things that pop into my head, and proceed from there. \u0022Brainstorming\u0022 is a good word for it, though it\u0027s more like throwing stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks.

Kennedy Space Center is just up the road from my home town, and I grew up inundated with all things NASA. Apollo, the Space Race, the astronaut corps, etc. The only way for me to really describe it is to say that all of that starts to color the way you look at space flight. And when I was planning my story, when I started thinking about moving beyond the Mun, I came to the realization that the basic narrative of space flight I had in my head was wholly incompatible with the needs and realities of interplanetary travel. I suspect KSK has run into this himself, in one way or another. But it was jarring, and it took me a while to find a way to deal with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as having something to say goes, I think theme is something you find, not something you plan.
