Crates had been piled into an especially cobwebbed corner. Someone had written \u0022Ferfurt is a Bum\u0022 with his finger on a grimy window. The dust bunnies were now the size of small oxen, and they were ready to engulf any Kerbal who unwittingly reached for the #21-315 wrenches at the wrong time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a normal day at the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet, within the dusty and rusty building, a small team of Kerbals strove to make one final rocket. They wanted to recapture a tiny bit of the glory of this place; they wanted to restore its legacy. Or maybe they just wanted to fly Ferfurt into space and leave him there. Ferfurt really \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E a bum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis team was led by Wernher von Kerman. Greying and constantly wheezing, Wernher was nonetheless the most qualified Kerbal to help the team. His love for building rockets had been partially replaced with his love of waving his cane about, muttering, and using the restroom. But his passion for rocketry was still strong, and all of the Kerbals respected him for it. Or at least, they pretended to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Wernher wanted his team to get up far earlier than would generally be considered sane. He would have used a bugle to awaken the sleeping builders, but he needed to catch his breath after standing up. So instead, he lit a match and threw it, assuming that the floor would have enough pyrotechnic crud on it to get things going. He was right. A suspicious brown stain on the floor disappeared with a loud CRACK, throwing little bits of dust bunny through the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe builders woke up with a start and yelled some things that are not polite to discuss, so I won\u0027t discuss them. Wernher just smiled a gentle, wrinkled smile and said, \u0022Get up, ya lazy bums! When I was your age, we all got up at five thirty \u003Cem\u003Esharp\u003C/em\u003E. (Wheeze.) We didn\u0027t just lollygag about. That\u0027s the problem with kids these days. They\u0027re just so - mumble \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Emumble \u003C/span\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Emumble\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe day had begun. It was time to start building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright... um... Mr. Wernher.\u0022 (The Kerbals had realized quite early on that Wernher was to be called \u003Cem\u003EMr.\u003C/em\u003E Wernher, and perhaps Mr. Wernher, \u003Cem\u003Esir\u003C/em\u003E if you wanted to get along well.) \u0022What will we be doing today?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well, um, that\u0027s a good question.

We\u0027ve done the capsule, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, we did that a year and a half ago.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay, how about the boosters?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We\u0027re actually done with pretty much everything, sir. All we need to do now is get the thing out on the pad and launch it. The rocket\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eright there\u003C/em\u003E. I think... um... I think you need your glasses.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Okay. Say, have you figured out who\u0027s going up yet?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We... um... we were thinking of sending up Ferfurt. Sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher wheezed and squinted at Calrie. Then he looked across the room at Ferfurt, who was sitting bolt upright and smiling a chipper smile. \u0022Hello, sir! How are you doing this fine morning?\u0022 he said, standing up to reveal his pressed pants and immaculately clean shirt. \u0022It\u0027s great to see you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, Ferfurt was a \u003Cem\u003Ebum\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Are you sure you want to launch him?\u0022 Wernher shifted a little. \u0022Back in my day, we only sent up the slovenly and misguided youth. Ferfurt, on the other hand...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sir, we thought that - um - sending Ferfurt up would be a good way to show that nowadays, astronauts have sophistication and taste.\u0022 Calrie had practiced this excuse at least a few dozen times. Apparently, this practicing had paid off. Wernher bobbed his head up and down and growled, \u0022Alright, we can do that.\u0022 He paused. \u0022I need to use the bathroom. Give me a minute.\u0022 He wandered to the restroom at about the speed of the average glacier, wheezing as he went.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the door was closed, Calrie yelled to the others, \u0022Guys, guess what? Ferfurt\u0027s going up!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe room exploded into cheers. Even Ferfurt murmured a \u0022How nice!\u0022 and offered an encouraging smile. The VAB may have been grungy and filled with homicidal dust bunnies, but now it was also filled with a bunch of very happy Kerbals. For once, the old building seemed bright and festive, and the project seemed almost worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then Wernher poked his head out of the door and yelled, \u0022Quiet!\u0022 (Wheeze.) \u0022Why are you yelling like that?! Back in \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E day...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is the first chapter.
