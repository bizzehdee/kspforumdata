Or another term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I would argue with the first part. I play with mods which shows dV. Usually I build landers in such manner, that they have just right amount of fuel to land and get to orbit and then I can abandon it without docking. But stock KSP limit players ability to plan due to absence of dV information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we could dump fuel/oxidizer in the KSP, then players wouldn\u0027t have problems with carrying extra weight (now-useless oxidizer). On trip to somewhere player have full lander in any case and it\u0027s a dead weight even if main engine uses the same fuel, because taking fuel/oxidizer from lander we can take too much, that the one wouldn\u0027t be able get into orbit again or land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehaving to plan for two kinds of fuel consumption would certainly provide you with more opportunity to fail.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T22:11:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ddenis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T14:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m not suggesting resources, but in this image, look at where it mentions NTRs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m7CTGtN.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m7CTGtN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m7CTGtN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NERVAfan","CreatedById":72817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T18:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think they\u0027re talking about pure LF tanks which are heaver, presumably on the grounds that they\u0027re airplane parts and need the extra structural reinforcement.
