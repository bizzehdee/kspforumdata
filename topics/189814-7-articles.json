Regardless of it it was an official channel or not, it\u0027s not like this would suddenly be a new revelation. I think Youtube should have had the capacity to track these things... The music exists. The content ID database has no excuse to not have a popular song that\u0027s decades old not be in the database. The source needs to get copyright flagged. Channels that claim to be royalty free need to take serious consideration for submissions. Uploads to such channels need to be scanned by content ID, and denied upfront from being listed if they fail any part of Content ID\u0027s scan. Channels that claim to be royalty free need to be held to a higher level of scrutiny, because of the drastic and massive effect their uploads can have on numerous third parties who trust in them. ALL LIABILITY should lie in those who upload royalty free content, mark it as such, while knowingly using unlicensed samples, or who don\u0027t vet their uploads. If music is TRULY royalty free, then it should be uploaded to an official standard Youtube Royalty Free Music Library. Since Youtube likes throwing their info notices on select content already, they should automatically throw up a \u0022This content has not been verified royalty free, and is not the official royalty free library of Youtube\u0022 on any content that hasn\u0027t been fully vetted with a content ID pre-scan, or isn\u0027t part of the official library.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stand by my opinion that if Youtube allows anything to be uploaded with the words royalty free in the title or description, it needs to be vetted \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eimmediately\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, and it needs to be content ID claimed and blocked (if required) before false claims of being royalty free can hurt others, or before 1000 videos can be uploaded by a third party creator, only to be suddenly struck after the fact. I also stand by my opinion, that if something was uploaded as royalty free, \u003Cem\u003EAND\u003C/em\u003E Content ID \u003Cem\u003Efailed to claim it initially,\u003C/em\u003E but then \u003Cem\u003Elater\u003C/em\u003E claims it, then it is a failure on either Youtube\u0027s part, or the Rights Holder\u0027s part to take action in a timely manner. Youtube could make a simple rule change to the terms of service for Rights Holders using content ID, and would be able to resolve all of this. The following is merely an example of a basic ToS change that could still grant Rights Holders their \u003Cem\u003Efull legal rights\u003C/em\u003E to claim against any content that they feel violates their copyrights, but also takes the burden off third party content creators that upload content containing what was described as royalty free. It places a burden on the Rights Holder, without taking away ANY of their rights. My example ToS change is as follows:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*This is hypothetical, and not real.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022By you (the Rights Holder) agreeing to have Youtube act as\u00A0a copyright management\u00A0client,\u00A0providing it\u0027s Content ID services to match Rights Holder submitted\u00A0audio samples to allow the content ID service to automatically identify uploads that may potentially\u00A0be in violation of the Rights Holder\u0027s\u00A0copyrights, Rights Holder agrees to granting Youtube a\u00A0limited license restricted exclusively to past transformative uses of the Rights Holder\u0027s Content ID sample, in relation to the descriptor \u0022royalty free\u0022, and\u00A0not to pursue claims against audio content uploaded prior to the sample upload date, wherein the content in question is transformative (i.e. not the original audio composition, presented unaltered, in part or in full, but rather a sampled component of Rights Holder\u0027s audio used as a component within another audio composition), and\u00A0is also not the primary content of the upload (e.g. background music, intros, outros, interludes, timelapses, credit and information scrolls, or\u00A0montages), and has previously circulated, uncontested by Rights Holder, on Youtube with the descriptor\u00A0\u0022Royalty Free\u0022, or been previously hosted in a curated \u0022royalty free\u0022 audio library. Content identified as having been falsely uploaded as \u0022royalty free\u0022 will receive an automatic Content ID claim, and will be either delisted or claimed at the Rights Holder\u0027s preference. All content creators that used the content in the previously described ways, prior to the date of the Rights Holder\u0027s samples addition to the Content ID system, will not receive claims for the use of the content, but will instead receive a notice that the content has now been claimed by the Rights Holder, and that any future use of the content without negotiating a valid license or a monetization split with the Rights Holder will cause an immediate Content ID claim on it and all future submitted content containing Rights Holder\u0027s protected content. These requirements are to protect third party content creators who, in good faith, believed they were using royalty free music for their content creation. By using the Content ID service, the Rights Holder grants Youtube a limited\u00A0license for the claimed content, retroactively applicable to only the limited uses described under the descriptor for the mislabeled \u0022royalty free\u0022 content, from Youtube\u0027s inception date, and up to, but not past, the moment the new Content ID samples are integrated into the Content ID service. Youtube may also reserve\u00A0the right to request a valid license from the Rights Holder\u00A0for content that it seeks to keep in it\u0027s curated royalty free audio library, and encourages negotiation between Rights Holders and\u00A0content creators to establish a valid license or a fair monetization split, should the content creators wish to continue using audio containing Rights Holder\u0027s audio samples in the future. Such license exceptions should be integrated into the Content ID database, to eliminate\u00A0fall claims against content creators who have\u00A0succeeded in negotiating with\u00A0Rights Holder\u00A0for rights to reproduce the protected sample.\u00A0If Rights Holder wishes to pursue claims against third party content creators over their use of audio\u00A0previously listed as royalty free on the platform, wherein the Rights Holder made no prior efforts to claim or strike the offending content source (a creator or channel that uploaded the content containing currently claimed audio samples, but\u00A0listed with the description of \u0022royalty free\u0022),\u00A0prior to the date of content ID sample submission or prior to manual claims or strikes on third party content creators, then they will be outside the terms of use for engaging in the Content ID program. All claims will be permitted, as they are within the legal rights of the Rights Holder, however employing Youtube\u0027s content ID service to search for potential violators that a Rights Holder has simply failed to take notice of, with intent to retroactively claim all misled parties is not a valid use of the content ID system. Choosing to pursue claims against prior third party content creators over uploads containing content that had been labeled \u0022royalty free\u0022, wherein\u00A0you had previously failed to claim the source, is viewed as a refusal to grant Youtube the limited license, as described, and is thus a violation of the content ID system terms of service. Ignoring the source of the falsely\u00A0claimed \u0022royalty free\u0022 audio might also be\u00A0potentially viewed as a tactic to permit large numbers of violations by unknowing third party content\u00A0creators\u00A0to accumulate, over potentially long spans of time, to garner the largest number of claims at a time, maximizing monetization. Employing this tactic is harmful to content creators. It is also harmful to the trust users have in royalty free\u00A0libraries.\u00A0Rights Holder is under no obligation to grant Youtube the limited license to protect these third party content creators from\u00A0mislabeled or misidentified audio, but also indicates a refusal to abide by the terms of the Content ID service,\u00A0and will result in the Rights Holder being dropped from the content ID program. Rights Holder has the right to continue to manually claim any content that they have a legal claim over, including older content. They will be allowed to reapply to the content ID program after a duration of time equal to the duration of time that has passed between the date of the manual claim or strike against\u00A0the\u00A0oldest upload date of a\u00A0third party content creator\u0027s content using claimed content previously\u00A0mislabeled as \u0022royalty free\u0022\u00A0(wherein the listed source of the mislabeled audio\u00A0was left\u00A0unclaimed during that period of time).

There needs to be a system of trust involved.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 If a Rights Holder\u00A0wishes to continue taking advantage of Youtube\u0027s Content ID service to automatically monitor for copyright violations, rights holders need to agree to new ToS.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 To use Content ID, The\u00A0Rights Holder\u00A0agrees to grant Youtube a limited license granting it\u0027s third party\u00A0content creators\u00A0permission\u00A0to use transformative\u00A0forms of that content, but \u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0in the original form,\u00A0in all\u00A0video uploaded \u003Cu\u003EBEFORE\u003C/u\u003E the Rights Holder added a new Content\u00A0ID sample.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 The\u00A0Rights Holder is expected to claim the ORIGINAL upload that claims to be royalty free. It is \u003Cu\u003ENOT PROTECTED\u003C/u\u003E under this ToS change.\u00A0They can block or monetize that upload as they see fit, or choose to negotiate a license or monetization sharing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 If audio that claims to be royalty free is claimed by the\u00A0Rights Holder, then Youtube\u0027s Content ID system performs two different behaviors when it flags a third party video that triggers that match:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 If the upload is from before the Content ID sample is added by the\u00A0Rights Holder, then they receive a notice that the old videos are okay, but the audio is no longer royalty free, and should not be used in future content, or it will be claimed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 If the upload is after\u00A0the Content ID sample is added by the\u00A0Rights Holder, then they receive an automatic claim, and can delete, edit, or replace the content.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 If the\u00A0Rights Holder chooses to manually claim a third party\u0027s content, they are essentially denying Youtube that limited license for past uses, and are thus in violation of the Content ID Rights Holder ToS.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 The\u00A0Rights Holder has every legal right to pursue all valid claims, but are prohibited from enjoying the benefits of Content ID, if they choose to do so. No rights are taken from them. They are simply denying Youtube the limited rights they requested in exchange for use of the Content ID system. They are kicked off of Content ID by \u003Cem\u003ECHOOSING\u003C/em\u003E to deny Youtube the requested license, and lawfully pursuing claims to the fullest extent they are allowed, and Youtube will not stop them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2022 The\u00A0Rights Holder is banned from using the Content ID service until they either release ALL claims on old third party content, or the ban duration matches how old the claimed content was, relative to the claim date.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s still a lot, so the T\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ET\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003EL;DR version:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor a Rights Holder to\u00A0participate in using Content ID, Youtube would require\u00A0Rights Holders to grant a limited license that permits all third party content creators to keep their old\u00A0content intact and un-claimed if they used audio that was claimed to be \u0022Royalty Free\u0022 in the past, even if that content\u00A0uses samples (but not whole or partial original songs) that the\u00A0Rights Holder owns. The\u00A0Rights Holder is expected to claim the source that claims to be \u0022Royalty Free\u0022. Old videos that used that audio will be okay (cause the\u00A0Rights Holder has granted Youtube that limited license), but NOT new videos. The\u00A0Rights Holder can CHOSE to claim the old videos (they have the legal right), but by doing so, they are denying Youtube the license they request in exchange for use of Content ID, and thus the\u00A0Rights Holder is kicked off of the Content ID program. They still can make all the claims or strikes they want, but now have to do is ALL MANUALLY, and search for the videos MANUALLY. They can get back onto content ID by letting the claims go, or waiting for their ban to expire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that would be the best solution to this copyright problem. It keeps everything legal, takes no one\u0027s rights away, and forces\u00A0Rights Holders to actually do the work to ensure their content is identified, but doesn\u0027t let them abuse third parties who had no way to know, unless the\u00A0Rights Holder is willing to greatly increase their own workload to pursue it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, this is all a hypothetical ToS change. I think it\u0027d work. I think demanding a limited license for all content that is sample matched by Content ID, to make a limited subset of older transformative content, offered inauthentically as royalty free to unknowing masses... I think that\u0027s a fair solution. It doesn\u0027t grant people any rights to post entire songs, or significant portions. It doesn\u0027t grant people the right to use commercial music within their video content. It creates a VERY narrow band of permission for old content to remain in existence, for creators to not be suddenly burdened with these mass claims, and rights holders get the automation of Content ID in exchange for the limited license offering, essentially, forgiveness to these unsuspecting third party creators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-05T02:28:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2019 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-06T07:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd YouTube strikes again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/post/UgzBKWoc-FI0M4HBsFJ4AaABCQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/post/UgzBKWoc-FI0M4HBsFJ4AaABCQ\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnjlvS2zxhbNJuGNo_TxkQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThe Mighty Jingles\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/post/UgzBKWoc-FI0M4HBsFJ4AaABCQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E10 hours ago\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\nSo game developer American McGee is getting hit with copyright claims when uploading Let\u0027s Play videos of himself playing the game he actually created.
