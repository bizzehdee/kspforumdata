It wasn\u0027t complicated, and neither was the launch system. The more complicated you make the rockets, the harder they are to steer, the more fuel you need to carry up, and the more stuff can go wrong. So as others have said, start small and build up only as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best spaceplane launchers have always been \u0027Apollo\u0027 style (with the plane mounted centrally at the top of the rocket) rather than \u0027Shuttle\u0027 style (strapped to the sides of rockets). It;s far easier to balance the rocket by keeping the centre of mass....well, central.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy spaceplane had a central mini-lander engine, and two of the new radial-mounted mini engines (one on each wingtip). I\u0027ve taken the plane to both Mun and Minmus, and for both of those I performed a vertical landing on the big landing legs, but I suppose on a suitable section of terrain, a horizontal landing on the wheels would be feasable. I think the key stage was to use a conventional central engine rather than an aerospike or a backup jet engine, so that it could be attached atop the launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor launch, I used five of the big rockets, with 4 boosters strapped to each of them. However you build your launch stage(s), remember to set up fuel lines so that you can be more fuel effecient. Make the \u0027external\u0027 rocket tanks feed the central engine(s), so they can be jettisoned earlier, for example. But as everyone says, keep it simple! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-01T13:49:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2012 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by T10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI claimed my spaceplane wasn\u0026#039;t a plane \u0026gt;.\u0026lt; I meant to say \u0026#039;complicated\u0026#039;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T00:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the tips\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T03:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s actually possible to make an SSTO with just 3 aerospikes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECockpit, ASAS, 4 fuel tanks, engine, and on the two sides of that, another stack of 3 tanks and another engine on each stack.
