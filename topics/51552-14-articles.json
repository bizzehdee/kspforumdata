Series launch a rocket, put it in parking orbit at 120 km, and deploy/activate all antennae and solar panels. Then move on and repeat that until you have nine in LKO parking orbits. Then wait for the next available operations window with KSC, take one of your sats up to the 742 km operations orbit. Remain patient as you may require a few link-passes before you can do a circularizing burn. Once the first sat is in position, you\u0027ll quickly find that placing additional sats in orbit quickly starts to get easier. Once four are in position at the cardinal directions, coverage should be complete.
