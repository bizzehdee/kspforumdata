I assume it would be using fuel to do so but I was wondering if, in the game, a station could be placed in some kind of orbit that would allow it to go back and forth between Kerbin and the Mun - allowing me to send landers, crew, and fuel back and forth without cost? I doubt it - but has anybody with better math skills and better skills at the game tried it?

It is not a stable orbit in both RL and in KSP. When you do a figure 8 type slingshot, you will lose energy, so often you would be put on a trajectory that likely would re-enter Kerbin atmosphere. To have a continuous loop, each time around you would have to do one burn to keep your trajectory out of the atmosphere, and another burn to rotate you major axis enough for another Mun intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T22:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NASAHireMe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NASAHireMe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, on second thought, it might not be possible.
