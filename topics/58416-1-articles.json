I\u0027ve just finished my first youtube video, part of a series of my attempt at sturmstiger\u0027s Duna Outpost Mission Architecture Challenge (Which I said wrong in the video... Sorry!). I know there\u0027s a few issues, like the bar on the video (youtube doesn\u0027t like 16:10 aspect ratios) but hopefully that\u0027ll be sorted out for the next one. Anyway, I plan to do more episodes shortly, and my friend will also be posting content on the same channel. Anyway, here\u0027s the first episode! I hope you enjoy it, and please leave me any feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;iframe width=\u0022560\u0022 height=\u0022315\u0022 src=\u0022//www.youtube.com/embed/o2YENAORubI\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weegee","CreatedById":72084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T01:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust finished the second episode -- Take a look!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;iframe width=\u0022560\u0022 height=\u0022315\u0022 src=\u0022//www.youtube.com/embed/258_pa26H7o\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
