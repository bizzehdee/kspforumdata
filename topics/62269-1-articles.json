As it is, the cursor goes wherever it wants while you rotate the view, which means it ends up interacting with buttons outside of the game window when you\u0027re not playing in full screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I could solve this by playing in full screen, but that isn\u0027t an option when I\u0027m doing a screen capture (at least with the software I use). Besides, even in full screen it would be nice to know where your mouse will be after rotating the camera.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T17:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with that suggestion, it doesn\u0027t bother me much but if it moves around when on windowed mode it\u0027s a fair request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also suggest that when moving the camera around on the KSC view, the mouse passing over the buildings should not select them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt KSC view it gets locked on the center but keeps passing on the buildings which can cause lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T19:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just like to note that even at fullscreen, you can still mouse out of it.
