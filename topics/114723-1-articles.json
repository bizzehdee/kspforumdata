Say you want Stages 1 and 2 to get you into Orbit. Under the first final destination of Eve, in the next bracket you\u0027d click \u0022Kerbin Orbit\u0022, and then Stages 1 and 2.

So you know your ship has a total amount of delta V required to get to Eve, but stages 1 and 2 don\u0027t have the delta V to get you into Orbit like you\u0027d like, meaning you\u0027d have to burn into stages 3 or even 4 to get into Orbit.
