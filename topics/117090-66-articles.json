These generally work poorly in KSP due to its limited gimbal/trim mechanics, and lack of precise information regarding CoM/CoL/CoP.  He\u0027s just trying to add/\u0027cheat\u0027 some extra control over the craft through the use of reaction wheels.\n\nHonestly, I have not yet managed to get a shuttle-styled craft to orbit yet myself due to those limitations, though I\u0027m working on it slowly (as precursor research for the SC-E parts).  My last attempt ended with RUD right after takeoff; was a pretty hilarious sight, with the shuttle cockpit somehow surviving and ending up next to the wreckage of the rest of the rocket.\n\nShielding -- I\u0027m being serious about it though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  It will be good for both decreased dV to orbit -AND- stabilizing the wobbly rockets (which you had questioned earlier in the week).  I\u0027m not sure which is the more important reason to do it, as they are both pretty major points in a physics-based game.  \n\nI also design my rockets with a bit more... finesse?  I generally only end up discarding stages with ~5-10% fuel remaining (often \u003C200 dV), as I often design my rockets with very slim margins.  Granted, I still do some rockets vastly over-engineered, where they return-to-kerbin with their LKO injection stage, still half-full of fuel...; but for the most part they only carry -just- enough for the mission \u002B a small reserve for inaccuracies in dV requirements and course corrections.  My last/current game, I designed a manned Moho mission, where the lander makes it back to orbit with \u003C100m/s of dV left; repeatedly and reliably... just enough for rendezvous and docking (which was necessary, as the overall mission was -very- tight on dV for the interplanetary stages... Moho is expensive to attain orbit around if using \u0027optimal\u0027 transfers)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T19:51:13Z","Content":"Gheghe, last few I sent up to rendezvous with a departure stage already in orbit, had enough dV left to go to Duna on it\u0027s own.

The cost saving is negligable, so fine tuning is not really needed. I play sandbox sometimes, then it\u0027s fun to try things out to optimize an orbit, and maybe import that into my career save.\n\nSTS: Check out the Energia-Buran mod. It has a complete Buran shuttle the launches properly. they shifted the CoM, I got it to fly and land in my first attempt, not hard either. Yeah, stock versions are a laugh, typicsl Kerbal launches, straight into the buildings or ground.

You just tell it the name of the model file, give it some parameters for height/volume/offsets/node positions, and its good to go (you can in theory do the same thing for the main tank models, though they need to have their origin at center of height).\n\nAnd then I realized that I could use the existing tank models as another nosecone option (they are a model after all...).  Its just another option for the \u0027next nose type\u0027 for the MFT.  So you can pick either a nosecone, or a tank extension, or an adapter.  You could use the stock tank models too if you wanted, or, really, nearly any model that is available in game.

It clones a MODEL{}, or mesh (specifically, anything that is a .mu file) -- geometry only (and animations, though those are unsupported with this implementation). \n\nIt is intended for \u0027dumb\u0027 models only, and does not support anything that would need a MODULE{} to control. however it will accept any **model** in the game.  You could add a cockpit model as a nosecone; but you would get no crew capacity, no sas/asas, nothing aside from additional fuel volume.

Is this compatible with realism overhaul? I *really* need this.\n\u003E \n\nmost should be compatible, the last patch I made for RO was in late december to cover the Apollo CSM and the AJ-10-137, many things have changed since then, like the Orion pod, but stratochief updated many other things since my last patch. (however idk what\u0027s the current state because stratochief also maintains a lot of other RO stuff, all I know is that at one point there was a problem with the new Orion spacecraft and some engines, but this has been sorted out already)  \n\nRight now, the lack of x64 support on KSP made me burn out for a while, so I haven\u0027t made KSP patches since the last one I said above, but once 1.1 comes with a stable x64 and SSTU is updated to 1.1 I ***\u003Cu\u003EWILL\u003C/u\u003E*** get back to maintaining the SSTU RO patches (unless someone else steps in), until then I\u0027m just closely following the development ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) (in fact, SSTU and Buran are the only mods I\u0027m following the developments)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-27T12:23:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2016 12:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JoseEduardo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T12:31:59Z","Content":"I\u0027m loving this mod.
