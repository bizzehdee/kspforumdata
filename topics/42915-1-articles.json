I like mods a lot and use lot\u0027s of then, but i also like to do stock missions since they are more easily related to and more difficult. I\u0027m not a particularly mechjeb hater, in fact I even use it sometimes when i am a little lazy, but since this one was so audacious and i decided to share it, i did it WITHOUT mj to even increase it\u0027s \u0022merit\u0022. (Only actual mod i ended up using was KE to design the ascent vehicle and keep track of d/v, angle phases, TWR, fuel, etc. However the KE broke down on me on calculation of Delta/v in later stages of the design, unfortunately I had to try 3 times landing on eve and ascending till i got enough fuel with without KE to guide me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole mission took 2 days to plan and build, most time were used to build the ascent vehicle and later a LIFTER to it that didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t lag. The rest of the mission where then quickly planned afterwards, the decision to use two large 2.5 meters docking ports for the interplanetary boosters were used in the middle of the ascent design to make a not so absurd large vehicle and avoid wobbling in the large interplanetary burns from a single standard docking port booster. Another two days were needed to actually do the mission entirely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended with nearly 5 hours of raw video footage, with I at first wanted to do a single very resumed video with less than 10 minutes. People usually don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t like to watch videos longer than 6~8 minutes on youtube, but since that proved to be impossible later, due to the complexity of the mission, I, then, decided to do 3 videos, with the mid one, the 2nd, focused on what most people actually wanted to see: The landing and the ascent back into orbit in less than 10 minutos. It is this video now that i\u0027m posting here in the first post of this new thread, the climax of the mission from eve, landing and returning from it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPIlofZV_WA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease rate and comment!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other two parts should be ready at the end of next week, but i already did the first cut on all the material.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst part should be around 12~15 minutes and will describe all launch rockets used to put the vehicle in orbit, transit to eve and aerobraking, the last part should be docking in eve\u0027s orbit with the return vehicle, returning and landing in KSC. I\u0027ll post the remaining videos after feedback from this video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of quick saves and quick loads in the DESCENT phase during the mission were needed since I had to save all fuel for returning to orbit (I decided not to try and refuel it on site) and thus, couldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t manoeuvre properly to a landing site, so lots of trial and errors on the entry of atmosphere till i finally managed to land on a good plain near to the rover not so close to sea level, the rest of the mission, even landing at KSC i managed to do in the first try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn total, 6 launches were needed: First the RETURN interplanetary nerva booster vehicle, with also sent an rover to scout for a good landing site and drive around eve, 2 large double Interplanetary nerva booster docked in orbit with the manned landing and ascent vehicle and sent it to eve, and two refuelling vehicles after the two booster docked in kerbin\u0027s orbit were used. The ascent vehicle itself weighted 176 tons at the moment it started it\u0027s descent to eve. I\u0027ll post later pictures with more details of the mission if anyone gets interested.

However, even with my experience as an (semi)professional videographer(but with not much experience for youtube videos), I realized there was just too much information to resume it that much in a single 10 minutes video. Still I think it has a nice summarized view of the main parts of the mission without feeling too rushed out, or boring like so many \u0022youtube-gamers\u0022 videos with half an hour recorded video with added narration and virtually no edition whatsoever with whole minute loading-screens and failure attempts uncuted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you guys can enjoy it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/QCoq468-nvY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/QCoq468-nvY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 3 will be the shortest and should be up by the next weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I realized I should have posted this in Mission log, I think I\u0027ll do a new thread there when the videos are complete specially for a log of this mission and use this thread for eventually new videos I release. When I do i\u0027ll add some text info and Screenshots of the mission and post the .craft files too. Meanwhile if you are curious about the videos, you can pause and check the comments I added on youtube, they give in-depth information about details of the construction and progress of the mission. However, I recommend watching the videos twice, first without the comments to have more \u0022immersion\u0022 with the build-up climax of the mission, and later if interested in the mission itself, watch again pausing and reading the comments!.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022\\\u0022 data-cite=\u0022\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Certificate Of KSP Grandmastership\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This Certificate shows that sephirotic is a KSP grandmaster, allowed to have a picture in the KSP Museum and play in the same ranks as Scott Manley.
