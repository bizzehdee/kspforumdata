Opt out model for time synch.","CreatedByName":"Habalabam","CreatedById":132821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T09:39:22Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Habalabam","CreatedById":132821,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T09:39:22Z","Content":"(I didn\u0027t find a recent thread on multiplayer)\n\nTo me, the griefer potential of KSP is too massive for MMO.\n\nMultiplayer, to me, will be my friends and me trying to set up some joint effort.\n\n- Mining/refueling orbital stations.\n- Establishing some large colony.\n- Multicraft missions. Rescuing/Supporting each other. Space tugs.\n- Flyby shenanigans (formation flying/dogfighting on Kerbal).\n- Roleplaying a lunar mission (each one controlling a member of the crew in the same craft).\n\nGameplay wise, the large discussion seems to be around time warp. I\u0027ve already dismissed the idea of MMO, so it seems to me that the best solution would be to have time acceleration set to the lowest that is desired by any one player. If somebody is in the process of landing on the Mun, the rest of the players will spend the time at 1x acceleration.\n\nAs long as it is easy for me to either watch the other players (performing their docking maneuver or whatever) or spend the time in the VSB, then I do not see it as a big problem. Of course, some good alarm clock thing is needed so that if the time warp is accellerated back up, then I have the time to jump back into my ship and proceed with my mission.\n\nHowever, what if a player is driving a rover around or flying an airplane? These are long running activities that are spent in 1x. While doing this he may not really care about planets positioning. Should then the whole game wait for him? I don\u0027t think it would ruin his gameplay if suddenly the sun raced across the horizon, even though he was driving in 1x. So I feel that, in the name of players respecting each others time, you should be able to time accellerate in space while 1x operations are going on planetside.\n\nBut what operations are \u0022planetside\u0022? How would the game know that you are not caring about rendezvous, transfer windows, day cycles etc?\n\n**So here is my suggestion:**\n\nI believe that this must be a **new toggle button alongside the Time acceleration controls**. Call it timesynch, global time or something.\n\n**When enabled:**\n\n- You are part of the time control that includes satelites, planets, moons etc.\n- Time accelleration for everybody in \u0022global time\u0022 is decided by the lowest desired time acceleration among the players in \u0022global time\u0022.\n\n**When disabled:**\n\n- You are NOT part of the global time. You can be in any time accelleration *lower* than the global time. You risk some weird effects. Such as the sun suddenly racing across the sky and turning things to night without affecting your driving your little rover. If you forget to enable \u0022global time\u0022, you risk that your planned rendezvous target suddenly is on the other side of the planet. You may crash land on the mun and try to fix stuff (in 1x speed) for just 6-7 minutes and suddenly see the rescue mission coming for you even though it strictly speaking took much longer for the mission to get there.\n\nIf a person in \u0022global time\u0022 desires 1x time acceleration, absolutely every player will be brought to 1x.\n\nThe crux of this idea is that although you cannot opt out of being \u0022hampered\u0022, but you can opt out of *hampering* if your current mission/activity allows for it. It brings flexibility. It allows for a mostly FFA model if everybody has it disabled, and it allows the die hard gaming people of forcing 1x across the board.\n\nThis requires a good alarm clock feature, so that you can spend time in VSB if you do not want to follow the landing/launch/docking or whatever which is going on.... without having to baby-sit your in-transit vessel in case the time acceleration suddenly kicks back in.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:18:45Z","Content":"As a rover lover, I would mind if the sun started rushing in the sky, even at 100x timewarp.\n\nWouldnt matter a lot for planes, unless youre flying an SSTSomeCelestialBody that needs its launch window.\n\nWaiting for someone to go to even Dres and making my sun rotate around Kerbin (haha) incredibly fast while I am on a mining operation would also be bad.\n\nAlso, do atmosphereless power landings count as planetary actions that do de-sync?

Unless you want players to go in different time lines, and then later \u0022synch up\u0022, I don\u0027t see how you can avoid this.\n\nThe crux of my idea is the opportunity to opt out of global time so that lengthy treks with the rover are not frowned upon by people doing orbit transfers because they want to time warp. The pace of the game varies extremely. \n\nAlso, it is just a toggle button that with a simple concept allows to play the game in many ways depending on how the functionality is used. \n\nBut there are of course many things that still would need to be hammered out. For instance: \n\n\\* How do we handle when players at different time accellerations come into proximity? \n\nA: I\u0027d say that they need to be slowed to the slower of the two.\n\n\\* When you are doing small maneuvers out of global time on the Mun, will the Mun suddenly spin underneath you (\u0022Smacking\u0022 you with a mountain peek)? \n\nA: There seems to be a certain altitude for celestial bodies in KSP where the indicated speed jumps from surface speed to orbit speed. If you are below this threshold, I would say that your craft should follow the rotation of the planetoid (the sun will be racing around). If you are above this threshold, that\u0027s a tougher call. \n\nThe ideal thing would be to have EVA and such possible to be done outside global time as such activities can also be time consuming all the while you may not care about the rest of the universe. However, I cannot see how that could work. Multiple vessels (including the EVA kerbal) involved in any EVA/docking operation will have slightly different trajectories which needs to be reflected when global time accellerates. \n\nSo, I tentatively conclude that opting out of global time can only be possible planetside, which results in everybody having to wait for docking/space station assembly/EVA/repairs etc to be completed.\n\nI still think it would be a big win if you were able to do 1x stuff planetside while not stopping others from doing time accelleration, even if it is restricted to planetside operations below the aforementioned altitude."},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T19:10:01Z","Content":"Or they could have a time warp poll.\n\n\u0022\u003Cusernamehere\u003E wishes to timewarp \u003Cfactorhere\u003E for \u003Ctimehere\u003E.

If we are allowed to time accelerate completely independantly, our two game sessions will not agree on where anything (moons, planets, space crafts, orbital stations etc) is. The point of multiplayer is that we operate in the same universe. \n\nLet\u0027s take an example: If we are able to time accelerate completely independently (as you suggest), and we are both floating in space by the same space station. I press time accelerate, what do you expect to happen? Shall the position of the space station and your vessel be dictated by my 10x time acceleration or your 1x time acceleration? \n\nAnother example: What if we were both trying to reach the Mun?
