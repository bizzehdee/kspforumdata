I\u0027ve already dismissed the idea of MMO, so it seems to me that the best solution would be to have time acceleration set to the lowest that is desired by any one player. If somebody is in the process of landing on the Mun, the rest of the players will spend the time at 1x acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as it is easy for me to either watch the other players (performing their docking maneuver or whatever) or spend the time in the VSB, then I do not see it as a big problem. Of course, some good alarm clock thing is needed so that if the time warp is accellerated back up, then I have the time to jump back into my ship and proceed with my mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what if a player is driving a rover around or flying an airplane? These are long running activities that are spent in 1x. While doing this he may not really care about planets positioning. Should then the whole game wait for him? I don\u0027t think it would ruin his gameplay if suddenly the sun raced across the horizon, even though he was driving in 1x.

For instance: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* How do we handle when players at different time accellerations come into proximity? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: I\u0027d say that they need to be slowed to the slower of the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* When you are doing small maneuvers out of global time on the Mun, will the Mun suddenly spin underneath you (\u0022Smacking\u0022 you with a mountain peek)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: There seems to be a certain altitude for celestial bodies in KSP where the indicated speed jumps from surface speed to orbit speed. If you are below this threshold, I would say that your craft should follow the rotation of the planetoid (the sun will be racing around). If you are above this threshold, that\u0027s a tougher call. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal thing would be to have EVA and such possible to be done outside global time as such activities can also be time consuming all the while you may not care about the rest of the universe. However, I cannot see how that could work. Multiple vessels (including the EVA kerbal) involved in any EVA/docking operation will have slightly different trajectories which needs to be reflected when global time accellerates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I tentatively conclude that opting out of global time can only be possible planetside, which results in everybody having to wait for docking/space station assembly/EVA/repairs etc to be completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still think it would be a big win if you were able to do 1x stuff planetside while not stopping others from doing time accelleration, even if it is restricted to planetside operations below the aforementioned altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T19:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr they could have a time warp poll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u0026lt;USERNAMEHERE\u0026gt; wishes to timewarp \u0026lt;FACTORHERE\u0026gt; for \u0026lt;TIMEHERE\u0026gt;.

One vessel. One guy controls the pilots, the other engineers/scientist. The pilot flies and can time warp while the other guy welds stuff together/does sience.

The pilot has types of missions for pilots, like \u0022fly there, make a report/land there take a sample\u0022. The scientist has something like \u0022check the sample/take a science report at X spot, etc.\u0022 The engineer would need KIS/KAS abilities: \u0022weld this with that, connect X and Y with fuel pipes, then pump the fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo space race. No multiple space programs. Pure cooperation. No need to figure out the time paradoxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And multiple missions could be ran at the same time that way.

Mission Control tells you to slow down and tries to overall help you to make the mission not be a failure. You forgot what\u0027s the speed of the reentry? Ask the ground crew!

Of course you may have occasional serious roleplaying sessions where this would be cool, but mostly not as there is only one pilot to a craft.

There are multiple approaches that are simple, but I don\u0027t see any that is without drawbacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crux of the problem is to have long running treks in 1x time accelleration (like rover missions, atmo flights, probe hopping, base mining/trucking/assembly/management) without forcing everybody else in 1x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that you can mitigate this by having time elastic activities, like tinkering in the VAB while others are out flying an airplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf SQUAD has the time warp system down, then I would very much like to see a thread describing the details.
