Only have the head with basic skin textures and partial rigging done for right now, but it\u0027s already in a state where it could be used for basic animation. Here are some basic expressions.\n\nExcited: \n\n![17231395043_2eb87e0058_b.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8815/17231395043_2eb87e0058_b.jpg)\n\nNeutral:\n\n![17825446896_b1657bf3df_b.jpg](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5453/17825446896_b1657bf3df_b.jpg)\n\nScared:\n\n![17852271641_47d75dfec6_b.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7677/17852271641_47d75dfec6_b.jpg)\n\nStudio render:\n\n![17852274101_335e5d4e6d_b.jpg](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7759/17852274101_335e5d4e6d_b.jpg)\n\nCritiques welcome!"},{"CreatedByName":"MoffKalast","CreatedById":74080,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T11:24:15Z","Content":"Pretty damn cool, could use a bit more yellow to that green maybe."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T11:25:57Z","Content":"The green color is just about perfect I think.

It even has the leathery texture to the skin I would imagine Kerbals would have.\n\nThese are worth animating, and continuing to create. Is there any ideas of what you might use it for? Like, maybe speech animation replacements for cinematic videos, or maybe making videos that aren\u0027t purely in-game footage, sort of like your own work of it? Just curious."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T02:44:31Z","Content":"Amazing! The only thing I find a bit creepy are those eyelids around the eyes (which Gregrox already pointed out). Otherwise, awesome! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyWest1218","CreatedById":139209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T03:50:12Z","Content":"Yeah, truth be told I\u0027m not totally sold on the eyelids thing either. I modeled them to get some better control on the facial expressions, but definitely they do kinda make it look a little creepy. What I can\u0027t decide is if I should simply make them smaller/less obvious or just scrap them entirely.\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t really have any plans for this, it\u0027s just something I wanted to try to get some experience with character modeling. Though I will say what initially got me thinking about it was an idea I had for a short that would involve a kerbal composited into live-action footage. If I ever come up with something interesting to do with it I might produce it. Otherwise, I\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll post it somewhere for anyone to use when it\u0027s finished."},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:30:09Z","Content":"This is just awesome!
