Only have the head with basic skin textures and partial rigging done for right now, but it\u0027s already in a state where it could be used for basic animation.

Is there any ideas of what you might use it for?

Though I will say what initially got me thinking about it was an idea I had for a short that would involve a kerbal composited into live-action footage. If I ever come up with something interesting to do with it I might produce it.
