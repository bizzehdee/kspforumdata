And, I only mentioned editing the files as an attempt on my end to fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary: It\u0027s modular fuel tank specific. MFT does basemass \u002B (additional tank mass based on fuel type per tank). Base mass is only a fractional amount of the final tank mass In the end, for stock fuel types it works out to the same as it would for a stock tank. But you\u0027re assessing full tank mass against it up front just for the base mass. It\u0027s about 5 times too massive and then it\u0027s throwing additional tank mass on top of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize the summary. Scale back the basemass to 20% (x0.2) and it should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027m only trying to help you here. That infinite fuel crack is a little insulting. It was unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientGammoner","CreatedById":77111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T23:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could have started with \u0022I\u0027m using modular fuel tanks with this mod and....\u0022 instead of saying \u0022If I have a stretchy tank whose dry mass is 5 times a stock...\u0022 like it was an issue with the mod in general.
