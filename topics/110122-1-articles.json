In the new version of mechjeb you can set the AoA limit degree which prevents flips. It limits your angle of attack against your prograde so lets say you set it to 3 degrees it won\u0027t turn the rocket more then 3 degrees infront of the prograde untill the prograde catches up. This is just not humanly possible so you do need mechjeb. I recommend 3 degrees AoA.\n\nAnother trick you can use is to have a fairing at the bottom and at the top of the payload and connect the bottom one to the top inverted one. I carry big payloads at the middle of the rocket using this and they are always stable. You can use this however bulky your payload might be. It will just cause more drag as you make it wider tho."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:22:41Z","Content":"Yeah, fairings are the way to go. As far as getting them to the Mun or Minmus, I\u0027ve found what helps me is to make one part and kinda \u0022step back and take a look\u0022. With most medium 2.5m size things, something I would expect a base to be made out of, I\u0027ve found that a half size 2.5m tank(half of an orange tank) and a skipper has plenty of Delta-V, and more than enough TWR to get the burn done reasonably fast. Then, I would make a fairing around it, and now you step back again and say, \u0022I need to get this to Low Kerbin Orbit. What\u0027s the best way to do that without overengineering my rocket?\u0022 For rockets this size, I usually use a Delta-IV Heavy style of rocket, with a bunch of orange tanks and mainsails.

You need to let gravity do the work for you, tilt yourself just a bit off the launchpad and gravity slowly tips the rocket over.

Im talking about payloads that are not symetrical and that pulls the rocket towards one side and flip. Here is my minmus operation:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/58oAZ)\n\nWhat you see here is a Fuel refinary and a science jeep with basicly 50000dV and can go anywhere fast on minmus. Collected all the science in 30 minutes and visited atleast 20 sites for crew reports which was my mission. (I know 50k was a bit op. Ended up using 15k for everything on Minmus) The Lander works as a refueling station for the 4 ion engines at the bottom of the jeep \u002B its the way back home leaving the jeep at minmus. As you can see the minmus bus is not symetrycal and this causes alot of problems when i try leaving the turn to gravity itself. I have to force it to stay straight because of the uneven drag forces. Could i have built a rocket that is balanced with the Bus? Ofcource i could. But that would take alot of trial and error and maybe 5 times more time which i just don\u0027t want to spend for a refinary operation. So mechjeb provides me with the easy solution to this = Precision which is humanly impossible. I can give you the craft file and i bet you won\u0027t be able to make orbit with that bus without changing the design or going straight up till you reach 25km then start turning.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T09:59:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 09:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:26:11Z","Content":"I have put something similar on the minus.

Once strutted properly it allowed for schoolbook gravity turn.\n\nThe top one - I couldn\u0027t get it to do a gravity turn - I couldn\u0027t even get it to fly straight up! At 400m/s it would flip if it strayed one degree from prograde. I overcame it with a pinecone nose - a nose cone thickly lined with Vernor engines.\n\n![screenshot21.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2/screenshot21.png)\n\nAnd this one would perfectly follow a gravity turn, except - as normally - the nose wouldn\u0027t point exactly prograde. Which resulted in dumped stages to crash into the main hull or rip the drills off. The ascent had to be done with SAS on, set to prograde.\n\n![2015-08-08_00005.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-08-08_00005.jpg)\n\nBy the way, ever tried to bring a standard-sized airplane into orbit as a rocket payload?

The point is you never ever need to point anywhere but prograde while going faster than 30m/s.\n\nIf you don\u0027t care about your orbit inclination. Rockets often stray off the 90 degrees course.\n\nIf you don\u0027t really care about the gravity turn being optimal. You can end up anywhere between flying horizontally at 25km and aiming 30 degrees from vertical with 80km periapsis, all depending on your payload\u0027s lift/drag profile."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T15:27:05Z","Content":"Delabu: Find Warzouz\u0027s SSTO Cygnus rockets.
