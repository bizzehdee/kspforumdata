As far as getting them to the Mun or Minmus, I\u0027ve found what helps me is to make one part and kinda \u0022step back and take a look\u0022. With most medium 2.5m size things, something I would expect a base to be made out of, I\u0027ve found that a half size 2.5m tank(half of an orange tank) and a skipper has plenty of Delta-V, and more than enough TWR to get the burn done reasonably fast. Then, I would make a fairing around it, and now you step back again and say, \u0022I need to get this to Low Kerbin Orbit.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you see here is a Fuel refinary and a science jeep with basicly 50000dV and can go anywhere fast on minmus. Collected all the science in 30 minutes and visited atleast 20 sites for crew reports which was my mission. (I know 50k was a bit op. Ended up using 15k for everything on Minmus) The Lander works as a refueling station for the 4 ion engines at the bottom of the jeep \u002B its the way back home leaving the jeep at minmus. As you can see the minmus bus is not symetrycal and this causes alot of problems when i try leaving the turn to gravity itself. I have to force it to stay straight because of the uneven drag forces. Could i have built a rocket that is balanced with the Bus? Ofcource i could. But that would take alot of trial and error and maybe 5 times more time which i just don\u0027t want to spend for a refinary operation. So mechjeb provides me with the easy solution to this = Precision which is humanly impossible. I can give you the craft file and i bet you won\u0027t be able to make orbit with that bus without changing the design or going straight up till you reach 25km then start turning.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T09:59:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 09:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have put something similar on the minus.
