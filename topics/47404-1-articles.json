The hotter they run the more efficient they can be, but beyond a certain point the materials we use will just melt (causing the small reactor to actually melt down and spray hot uranium out of the exhaust. Or... just cause it to explode). Disregarding all that melting point problem, pretending we have a super material that can withstand really really high temperatures, I want to know exactly how increasing the reactor\u0027s temp would increase efficiency, namely how much it would increase exhaust velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example the game\u0027s NTR has an ISP of 800s (or around 7800 m/s exhaust velocity), we don\u0027t know how hot the reactor runs, but we can guestimate it\u0027s somewhere between 500 C and 1000 C. If I... doubled that to ~2000 C, by how much would the exhaust velocity increase? I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s more complicated than just doubling the ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this equation on the Atomic Rockets site: Ve = sqrt( (2 * E) / m )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein which Ve is exhaust velocity, E is energy, and m is mass of the fuel. We know the fuel is something like uranium, so using the Heat Capacity equation (Q = m * c * deltaT) we should be able to find out how hot a given amount of uranium will have to be to yield a given exhaust velocity. (C for uranium is 0.116)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for the game\u0027s engine we have \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emass = 2250 kg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVe = 7848 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE = ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ = E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec = 0.116\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta T = the final temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsolating E gives us 6.9 x10^10 joules. Putting that into the heat equation gives us... 265 million degrees. So I figured, okay, maybe the mass is a bit small for a nuclear reactor, let\u0027s tweak the game\u0027s units and see what happens. I gave it a mass of 10 tons, and ran it again, and... it looks like the mass units in each equation cancel each other out. What this means is that regardless of what mass we pick, the given energy density is the same and out comes 265 million degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure a typical NTR wasn\u0027t meant to run that hot.

The 3.75m nuclear reactor provides the same thrust and Isp as a real NERVA and the other nuclear reactors are essentially scaled using that as a reference point. The scaling is very non-linear down to the smaller sizes, where I\u0027ve used the SAFE-400 nuclear reactor as a very vague guidline for the smallest nuclear reactor size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear reactors all begin as solid core reactors but you can retrofit them later to produce closed cycle gas core (nuclear lightbulb) versions, obviously with much improved core temperature. The antimatter reactors are, obviously, entirely fictional and use values scaled up by energy density and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8D1gQSW.png\u0022 alt=\u00228D1gQSW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, for a game, it\u0027s important to get a balance between realism and gameplay concerns but I\u0027d definitely be interested to hear thoughts and suggestions in this kind of discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"architeuthis","CreatedById":57137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T01:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PTNLemay\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PTNLemay\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan someone please check my numbers?

The units for R in this case are J/(kmol*K) so you have to multiply that constant by 1000. Also if your propellant is water m will equal 18. This gives an exhaust velocity of only 2700 m/s, but 2000 is a fairly conservative number for combustion chamber temperature. Note again, this is the ideal exhaust velocity, the actual velocity will be lower for a real nozzle with efficiency losses, about 2600 m/s or 266 seconds isp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T02:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@architeuthis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for clarifying. I did want to use water, but I can\u0027t find y values for it at temperatures greater than 200 degrees Celsius. Hydrogen seems to be the only propellant where the numbers are easily known for temps as high as 2000. Does it matter that much for me to have an exact y value? They seem to all hover around 1.3 and 1.5, with a consistent tendency to get lower as the temperature gets hotter. So would it be okay for me to approximate that when water reaches 2000 C, y = 1.300? Or even lower, if I want to experiment with really high temps like 5000 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Fractal_UK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh no problem, that looks quite relevant to my line of questioning so feel free to bring it up. It looks quite... complicated, but it also looks really interesting. The radiators especially are a nice touch. If Nyrath taught me anything about rocketships it\u0027s that it\u0027s worth obsessing over waste heat, lol. I\u0027m also really curious about that 3.75 meter NTR... that sounds pretty epic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-06T02:17:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2013 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
