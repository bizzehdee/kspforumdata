Prior to this happening, i have noticed on previous missions that whenever i want to look through the contract list in the upper right tab it freezes for 5-10 sec before resuming, which seems odd. any one seen this before? i couldn\u0027t seem to find anything related being previously posted, so any help would of course be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T10:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi I have the same problem with the freeze on mouse-over contract, though it\u0027s in a modded install and I didn\u0027t check whether it happens in stock too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereproduce: have some contracts, launch or load a vessel, mouse-over contracts symbols\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeffect: game pauses for several seconds, gamescreen get white, windows suspects critical failure of game and suggests killing the process, everything\u0027s normal after that and the contracts tab opens without hassle after that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elikely cause: I guess the code which checks for achieved goals and completed contracts, looks in way too many places and has too many numbers to crunch. the \u0022mission accomplished\u0022 seems neither to be affected nor causing or solving problems (seperate code-modules/gameobjects?). It\u0027s always the initial loading of the contracts tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epossible solution: (1) if numbers have been crunched previously, use them instead of crunching them again. (2) check the contracts while loading the flight scene. (3) assign missions/contracts to special flights. the contracts-building could be reworked to support n flights with x contracts each. that could also cure some current contract exploits and keep the number of simultaneous flights down in early career. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(guess I should make a suggestion out of that last one...?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
