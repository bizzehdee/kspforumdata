However I\u0027ve got following issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - Service Bays have no storage for life support items. Am I doing something wrong ? From videos it seemed like they were to be used to transfer life support materials. Only option I see on a Service Bay window is Open/Close. If it is not them, what can I use to resupply my space station ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - I cannot tell if Kerbalism Config Engine is working as it should be. It appears as an actual engine, having food, water, oxygen as propellants, and gets added as an additional stage. Is this the expected behaviour ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - Most importantly I cannot access kerbalism windows neither in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or in flight. Is there a secret key combination ? Or am I missing a button on the toolbar ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther things seems to be working, I get warnings when a supply is low, scrubbers etc are installed and seems to be working. Tried to remove/re-install Kerbalism and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E Configs but it didn\u0027t help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas you can suggest before I give up and go back to TACLS ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-18T14:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to tech Support, Modded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-20T07:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich service bays are you referring to, the stock ones? There\u2019s a big difference between a service \u003Ci\u003Ebay\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0and a service \u003Ci\u003Emodule\u003C/i\u003E, the latter of which will hold supplies etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbalism config engine is only meant to be used in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E to get the right ratios of food/water/oxygen or liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen for crew and fuel cells respectively. If you\u2019re using fuel cells, though, you\u2019ll have a nearly-continuous supply of water and if you have a lox-to-gox converter then you\u2019ll have a supply of oxygen too, so use the config engine as a guide but pack loess water and oxygen than it gives you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbalism window should be on the (stock) toolbar on the bottom right of the screen in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. There are two Kerbalism buttons- one opens the vessel information which gives you the estimated time your power and supplies will last in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and gives you control over science experiments and processes in flight, while the other shows all science experiments and which ones you\u2019ve completed where, which can be filtered to only include the experiments on the current vessel to show if you\u2019ve already completed them or where there\u2019s some science left to be gained. They should be right beside the stock message button, both have an ECG (wiggly line) and either a transmitter dish or (I think) a science symbol\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:science:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/science.png\u0022 title=\u0022:science:\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
