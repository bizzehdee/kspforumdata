The tanks could use a bit more detail, I think, like rims around the top of the tank similar to both Jebedish Kerman and Rockomax parts. The adapter could use some texture details. Sure it\u0027s just a cone, but so are the other adapters, the command pods, and the nosecones, and they all have detail on them. I am overall happy with the new parts, but I wish they were 5 meter instead of 3 meter, as the command pod appears too large, and a stock Saturn V is still not possible with the new parts in propper scale. The new parts will allow an S-IVB, but not an S-II or S-IC.

Its a damn good game, and I don\u0027t think anyone ever expected perfection so I\u0027m happy we\u0027ve gotten this close. I would rather see them flesh out some of their bigger ideas and let us do more with the engine than wait for them to remake all the stock gameplay over and over. I think that if they are able to wrap up this current project sooner rather than later, it will give them an opportunity to expand as a company and start new projects and make more money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T20:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FITorion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FITorion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUm they have said that... it\u0027s in ARM.

Squad will cut off all contact after the 24hr streaming event and in a couple weeks we might see the release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: at least that\u0027s how things have been done so far...
