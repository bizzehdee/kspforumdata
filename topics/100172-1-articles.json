The problem is that when I add the part to a ship in the VAB, it automatically deploys.\n\nHere is my config file for the deployable solar panel:\n\nMODULE\n\n{\n\n name = ModuleDeployableSolarPanel \n\n animationName = Deploy\n\n pivotName = sunPivot\n\n IsBreakable = true\n\n raycastTransformName = suncatcher\n\n runOnce = true\n\n resourceName = ElectricCharge\n\n resourceName = ElectricCharge\n\n chargeRate = 18\n\n powerCurve\n\n {\n\n key = 206000000000 0 0 0\n\n key = 13599840256 1 0 0\n\n key = 68773560320 0.5 0 0\n\n key = 0 10 0 0\n\n }\n\n}\n\nTo see what I mean:\n\n![RD979St.png](http://i.imgur.com/RD979St.png)\n\nThe game automatically plays the \u0022Deploy\u0022 animation and leaves the panel fully open. \n\nTo see if there was an animation issue, I replaced ModuleDeployableSolarPanel with ModuleAnimationGeneric. When I do that, the panel starts folded as I expect. Here is what I mean:\n\n![mPr4jRH.png](http://i.imgur.com/mPr4jRH.png)\n\nYou can see that it works just fine with ModuleAnimateGeneric.\n\nAny ideas about what is going on? Why would ModuleDeployableSolarPanel play the animation and keep the panel fully open, while ModuleAnimateGeneric has no issues deploying or folding the part? Is there a setting in Unity that I\u0027m missing?\n\nThanks for the help!"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T07:11:28Z","Content":"Yay!
