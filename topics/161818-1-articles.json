You want to go low enough to brake within an acceptable time frame (one pass for aerocapture) but not so low you burn up and/or crash. That altitude highly depends on the amount of drag your vehicle can generate and how much heat it can survive. That means you should really be wary of something having a lower max temperature than the rest of your ship and it not being in a service bay or protected somehow. If you plan on aerobraking, part temperature values are always worth looking at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you don\u0027t need a capture on the first pass there is always the option of quicksaving before the maneuver that will set your braking altitude (aka periapsis) and messing around until you get something survivable and simply make multiple passes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
