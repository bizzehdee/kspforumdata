The easiest way to create negative energy is to cause a laser beam to enter a \u0027squeezed\u0027 state, this causes amplitude to increase, and as the trough of a laser waves energy density is zero having an increase in amplitude causes the energy density to drop to negatives. A negative energy laser can do something that only multiple positive energy lasers can accomplish, when a negative energy laser contacts an item, it cools the object instead of heating it. This effect is quickly turned around by quantum interest, much like a bank, for any amount of negative energy that is generated a positive energy will return to fill it up. So a negative energy laser cools then heats the target to a higher change than the negative energy change. This has many combat applications such as, firing a high level negative energy beam into a target to fracture a piece of armor, or even incinerate a human. My main question is, would a weapon system like this be efficient/effective?

The reason squeezing has applications in laser cooling has to do with entropy, not energy. Energy density of any laser beam is always strictly positive. This is very easy to demonstrate by using the fact that photon\u0027s 4-momentum is a null vector. The consequence is that a beam with negative energy density cannot propagate freely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
