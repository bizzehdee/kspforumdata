The first stage is equipped with all the fuel lines the real Atlas V has, and the Centaur stage has realistic thrust. This replica is at 98 parts and weighs 288 tones. I have also managed to fix the tumbling and vulnerabilities to loss of control. The bottom of the Centaur had serious overheat problems (as well as my Delta II Heavy), but I have managed to fix it. \n\nThis Recreation has high TWR (around 1.8) though not as high as the real Atlas V, which had about 2.1. The Atlas V 551 was used to launch spacecraft such as New Horizons and Juno. \n\nThis recreation has a Boattail like the Atlas V, made with wing parts, but there is the stock fairing too. \n\nIf you enjoy this replica, feel free to post pics down below, and if you have a subassembly, submit it here. This replica has been inspired by Majorjim\u0027s amazing Atlas 541/Curiosity replica.\n\n![13XAShf.png](http://i.imgur.com/13XAShf.png)\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/SaturnianBlue/Atlas-V-551)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Continue to turn, and ditch the first stage as you reach high into the atmosphere.\n\n-Use the Centaur to circularize/ raise apoapsis. With an flea SRB, this rocket can be used to send a New Horizon like probe out of the Kerbol system.\n\nThanks for reading! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T00:16:02Z","Content":"Ha ha! awesome dude. you made my day.
