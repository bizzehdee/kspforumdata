Link tot he Kethane wiki is in OP of this thread, and a really good read for anyone using the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, more scanners lets you use higher time-warp to scan. 62 of the big scanners can scan most bodys with almost no loss of per pass resolution, allowing scans to be completed in much less real-time (CAUTION using this method along with life support mods, as your not really changing the amount of mission time required...youve been warned =P...warned the guys in my space station, they didnt listen...now they dead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe Im the odd ball out on this issue, but I honestly hope Majiir keeps the scanning mechanics as is until the time the varibale hex mechanics that were spoken of in the past are implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T18:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know if this will work with the real solar system mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripod27","CreatedById":68324,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T19:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny chances of having the kethane pockets being generated as smaller chunks (like maybe 3 hexes together at most) but more evenly spread throughout the surface?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain reason I\u0027m asking is because currently there\u0027s no reason to mine kethane in any way other than to have a lander that has a kethane refiner and stores a decent amount of kethane, then have it land, mine kethane, refine some into the fuel it just spent, mine more kethane to refill and then fly back and redock to fill the ship it launched from\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoving refineries take forever to drive to the nearest kethane deposit if you land in a bad spot and the deposits are so big that it takes no effort to land on them from orbit anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really that kethane is broken or anything, I\u0027m just wanting a bit more variety with mining it to the point that having a refinery on the ground is more effective than having one just attached to your lander on your interplanetary ship\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T19:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I was thinking as well.

I just got the new version of Kethane and it was working fine for a while, but now the grid doesnt show when the box is checked. I get a graphical issue it seems with the grid. It kind of flickers as I move the camera around. No errors in the alt\u002BF2 window. Only other addon is latest Mechjeb. Any help woujld be greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b8RKl1l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b8RKl1l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T21:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tripod27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tripod27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny chances of having the kethane pockets being generated as smaller chunks (like maybe 3 hexes together at most) but more evenly spread throughout the surface?\u003Cp\u003EMain reason I\u0027m asking is because currently there\u0027s no reason to mine kethane in any way other than to have a lander that has a kethane refiner and stores a decent amount of kethane, then have it land, mine kethane, refine some into the fuel it just spent, mine more kethane to refill and then fly back and redock to fill the ship it launched from\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoving refineries take forever to drive to the nearest kethane deposit if you land in a bad spot and the deposits are so big that it takes no effort to land on them from orbit anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really that kethane is broken or anything, I\u0027m just wanting a bit more variety with mining it to the point that having a refinery on the ground is more effective than having one just attached to your lander on your interplanetary ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what page its on but awhile back majiir was talking about new code for mining that would varie the deposits and how mining is done. He was saying the deposits wouldnt change to much, but that a single drilling unit could no longer drain an entire deposit, but rather you could drain the hex your on and each hex touching it. Deposits would still have grand total, but it would be unevenly spread among the hexes, giving deposits sweet spots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, smaller deposits in higher numbers would make things a bit more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hremsfeld","CreatedById":23422,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T03:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy would you make such a statement when Majiir himself has talked about FUTURE changes to Kethane, and lil bits of code he is working on...\u003Cp\u003Ealso....people should pay attention to the forums and other sites before claiming a dev is \u0027absent\u0027...Majiir has been active several times on the forums in the past couple weeks, and activity on ghub.....he dont seem absent to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know he\u0027s been around on the forums, policing developer\u0027s licenses and what not.
