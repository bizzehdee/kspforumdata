But my memory could be off on the details. To be honest current Kethane scanning wouldn\u0027t be that time consuming and dull if there was a wide scanner scanning three or more hexes wide at a time as it passes over them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think that mining/converting and time-warping is not much of an issue. It is an issue for things like getting income or science or tech every X days since the player can just warp and get stuff with no effort while still on the launchpad. With mining and refining the effort is finding the deposit, landing there and using those resources for bigger things (like refueling or possibly construction). Mining and refining could be instantaneous, but having it work while warping like kethane mining/refining does now would have little negative effect on gameplay if any (other than still having to wait, but not much). Also push button\u0026gt;get resource would work oddly with power generation, you would need to stack batteries, recharge them, dump power into conversion/mining, recharge again. Click, click, click, click until you get the desired ammount. Doesn\u0027t really eliminate the warping issue as you still need it if the mining/refining uses power, not making it use power would be plain silly and inconsistent. Clicking once to turn on the drills or the refining module and warping is less mindless busywork and like I already said it isn\u0027t really a \u0022press one button, get rich with no effort\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I just remembered how lovely Nova\u0027s models for the resource parts looked. That water-pump drill and rock drill for instance. With the biome system implemented you could do some pretty cool stuff with random resource generation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaRocketCat","CreatedById":32377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T00:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFYI, recources/mining got delayed in favor of career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of work was done though, including a bunch of scanning parts, pumps, drills, etc...as well as a system detailing the distribution of recourses in a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T01:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESure, just as long as we don\u0027t have the current Kethane or MapSat paradigm of setting an orbit and doing the timewarp while I watch the football game.

Meanwhile you should be able to head back to the space centre, build your next ship, play around with aircraft, whatever. Eventually get ready to launch another mission to the place you are scanning. By the time you get there the scanning should be pretty much done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, in my opinion, the most natural approach, because that is, of course, what happens in real life. People don\u0027t have to sit and watch automated processes to make sure they keep being automated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limitation right now seems to be with the game engine / game design, because as far as I know KSP can\u0027t keep track of the activities being performed by a non-focused craft on rails. However, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s actually necessary to keep track of its activities the same way the game does it for other ships. Rather, there could be some simplified \u0022remote autonomy\u0022 code that is simply aware of a few base properties (altitude, speed, eccentricity, etc) and some autonomous function that simply operates on timer ticks. Rather than simulate the whole operation of the craft, you simplify it down to a deterministic result. Have the automation module run the automation function of any autonomous craft once every game heartbeat, and let the craft define the result of that function. Ultimately all it comes down to is, say, populating text files revealing scanned areas, resource quantity mined/remaining, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T02:17:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T03:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI very much doubt there will be a need to do scanning for resources.
