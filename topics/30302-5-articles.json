Recycling is always better then inventing a new wheel when there is a used one out there which still can be used. In this case; adding more and more (duplicated) data into a database, while the data is already in it. What are the general rules/timeline before topics start running out of time?

If there\u0027s a post that\u0027s been inactive for a number of months and it\u0027s suddenly brought back to the forefront, it seems inconvenient at best, so myself and the mod team use our judgement on what to do in these instances. I intend to flesh out and define this sort of thing a little closer in the near future, though.
