Use solid boosters, as many as possible. Some of my ships use 18 solid boosters and 1 of the huge liquid fuel thrusters. Yes, that\u0027s how much raw power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, once you get to 10 KM start turning. This is called the gravity turn and if you do so at around 10 KM you\u0027ll benefit from it. Do avoid doing so if you\u0027re still on the raw power phase. If you have lots of solid boosters burnin\u0027, it\u0027s not a good idea to turn your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you\u0027ll want to stay above 75 KM. That\u0027s the edge of the atmosphere, and unless you REALLY want to get back to kerbal you\u0027re better off staying above that level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T13:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting Kerbol is easy. All you need to do is get to an escape trajectory from Kerbin. So once you\u0027re in orbit, just keep accelerating until your trajectory takes you out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Any rocket that get you to the Mun should be able to do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what I assume you want to do, is to orbit Kerbol at a closer distance than Kerbin, which means that once you are orbiting Kerbol in the vicinity of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, you simply need to lower your orbit to go closer to Kerbol by decelerating. This can take a lot of Delta-V and time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the return trip will be tricky \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ypkerbal","CreatedById":38690,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T00:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips guys:D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MurderOfAKiller","CreatedById":34695,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T03:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cykyrios\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cykyrios\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI found that a 7-engine launcher with 2 tanks each, and another 2-tank plus a smaller engine can take you to Kerbol orbit without any trouble (except the Kraken).
