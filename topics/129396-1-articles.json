They have a lot of users, and people have a lot of questions. And the problem is: they have different questions.

And actually, I would take the opposite approach - it\u0027s not the big popular threads that need to be hived off into a sub-forum, it\u0027s the relatively niche threads that otherwise get lost in the noise. For both those reasons, I don\u0027t like the way the forum migration got rid of some of the sub-forums but no doubt there were good reasons related to maintenance, moderator coverage or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly, I have a personal bias on that point. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E My main forum \u0027thing\u0027 is writing, which I think it\u0027s fair to say as a bit of a niche (compared to say, cinematic videos or artwork) within a niche (Fan Works in general). Hence I wasn\u0027t terribly happy when two of the old Fan Works forums got rolled together. But I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure that creating the number of sub-forums that you\u0027re suggesting is a good idea. Somehow it just seems a step too far. What would help is a better search function (which is being worked on), so that searching those 50\u002B pages of a thread isn\u0027t quite such a chore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing that I would also very much like is to bring back a standard set of thread tags. In the old Fan Works forum, there were a set of tags you could apply to your thread title: writing, art, inventions, video... etc. They made it very easy to quickly flick through the forum and pick out the kinds of Fan Work that you were especially interested in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the current tagging system, whilst more flexible is a step backwards \u003Cem\u003Ebecause\u003C/em\u003E of that flexibility and also because the tags are smaller and harder to read. Assuming that people bother to tag their threads in the first place, there\u0027s a lot more variation in the tags they\u0027re using, which sort of defeats their point. An indexing system is great - but it doesn\u0027t work very well if anyone can add new entries to the index at random. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-06T12:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2016 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T21:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently there\u0027s a lot of subforums already, adding more is not something I\u0027m a big fan of. I can certainly understand that some mod threads are huge, but another alternative if the threads become too big is to simply start a new one. Most of the information posted in those threads is over a year old, related to versions of the mods and KSP that are no longer available. I\u0027d also like to add that I can\u0027t recall a single time a mod maker has requested a sub-forum for his or her mod.
