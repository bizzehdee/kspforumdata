What I want to know is your opinion on having an interplanetary tug push a payload versus pulling a payload. In other words, put the tug behind the payload or in front of it? I\u0027m testing with my space station now (well last night) and the only thing I\u0027ve noticed so far is that it seems easier to keep it on course when you pull. Any thoughts about efficiency etc?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T18:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have two tug designs currently in space. One can pull (due to a brain fart i installed only small clamp-o-tron on the nose), and second (bigger one) can both pull and push. It uses 4 SM-FFR engines from the mod, but it could work with 4 NERVAs i think. In both designs engines are mounted on the ends of long trusses, and every truss ends with a RCS thruster for maximum leverage. My bigger, 77 ton tug is surprisingly maneuverable and stable under thrust when pulling something. I haven\u0027t tried to push anything on the size of jumbo fuel tank with it yet. I noticed one important thing: when using long engines on the end of trusses, it\u0027 important to watch where Center of Mass is and connect trusses avove CoM - this way engines don\u0027t stick too far, which creates problems with maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T19:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepend, long items should be pulled as they tend to buckle if pushed.

I instead like to go on long journeys to other planets with reasonably sized landers, where I think pushing is better since I think gimballing engines will have a slightly better effect. It\u0027s also a lighter, not having to build the engines radially and outwards.

It seems to me there isn\u0027t a clear consensus on this. I will say that I\u0027ve done some more testing tonight, after I had to re-install due to not being able to end any flights and with stock only parts at the moment, it seems pull is easier to pilot. I can\u0027t see a clear difference in efficiency either. Apparently it doesn\u0027t matter on your gas mileage if you push or pull. I guess it\u0027s a preference thing then. Again, thanks for the input.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
