B9 does need some work, and having it on Github will help out considerably. Perhaps when KSP 0.24 comes out, and we have B9 fully updated for it, we can create an official release thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing considering the 0.23.5 patch: the patch was only meant as a temporary solution and not a permanent solution. We used a \u0022fix thread\u0022 when KSP 0.23 was out, because everyone thought that the author\u0027s hiatus would end sooner than what it has along with the agreement that if the author did not return by the time the next version of KSP was released, a MM patch would be developed to help extend the life of the mod. That MM patch was the 0.23.5 patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we are going to be releasing the B9 pack in its entirety, then there is no need for a MM patch; we can directly edit the cfg files. This eliminates the requirement for MM and eliminates a point of failure that was not present in the original mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, I think before we make a release, a message should be sent to the original author asking him about his plans for B9. Since we do not know what he\u0027s planning, it is a possibility that he could be working on a release 5 and is simply not telling anyone; I read somewhere in the release thread that the author had a number of unreleased parts back before Christmas.
