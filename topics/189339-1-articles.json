Answer those questions and you will see that you would kill all the crew with Gs and tear the ship apart on exit unless it was made from unobtanium with an unrealistic profile. But the crew would be dead and all the cargo squished so, what would be the point? Lowering the exit speed would easily make the whole system irrelevant. And sure, more mass slows down less in atmo but then you have more mass.
