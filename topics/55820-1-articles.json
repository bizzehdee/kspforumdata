Not sure how hard it is to do, but maybe it could be an option when we have different game modes and difficulties, you could set whether you wanted a \u0022hard\u0022 setting with inclined orbits and axial tilt when you were starting the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrisd857","CreatedById":57291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T17:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, all the planets are axially aligned to the galactic axis.
