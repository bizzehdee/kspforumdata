Started off being light headed and dizzy. Slowly and surely it got worse. Then the headaches started. Now I feel like if you stand up really quick and you are dizzy... well I feel like that all the time. I constantly feel drunk along with the headaches of being hung over at the same time. NOT FUN.\n\nAnyway, I had an EEG 2 weeks ago and an MRI last Thursday. I just got the results of the MRI and here is the results:\n\n1. A CSF signal lesion on the cranial Fossa.\n\n![2631b572-7095-49f7-be4b-ae952a767984.jpg](http://i1247.photobucket.com/albums/gg635/Joken63/2631b572-7095-49f7-be4b-ae952a767984.jpg)\n\n2.

I was wrong earlier... it is a tumor.\n\n Went to the doctors yesterday. Basically, I am going in to surgery to have the growth removed on May 12... two weeks from today.\n\n In simple terms, the hole in the skull that has the auditory and facial nerves going out, is being blocked by the tumor. The expanding growth is pushing against the cerebellum into the area that controls my breathing. 6 months of waiting and I could have a stroke or lass control of my breathing.\n\nThey are going to open a \u0027C\u0027 shaped hole behind my right ear and take out a piece of the skull about 3\u0022 (7.5 cm) and try and get as much as they can. A piece about a grain of rice is expected to stay to save the nerves. I may then need chemo or a \u0027gamma knife if it is cancerous... But that is only a 2% chance of that. I then get some hexagon shaped plates put in to hold the piece they take out.\n\nI have a good chance to loose 75 - 100% of my hearing and a small chance of permanent loss of feeling in my face and tongue on the right side.\n\n I am checking in to Swedish Hospital at 5:30 on the 12th and surgery starts at 7:30. It will take about 6 hours or so. 1 - 2 days in ICU and 3-5 days in the hospital.\n\nBelow is a video of the basic surgery... DO NOT WATCH IF SQUEAMISH!!! You have been warned.\n\nI\u0027m not kidding...This is gross! \n\nBe kind to me moderators if this is out of the norm...\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEROVO5cYdU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T04:14:30Z","Content":"Oh, yikes.
