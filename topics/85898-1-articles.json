It\u0027s a crash that happens fairly often, something to do with the display output, as I\u0027m having to use a really old and small monitor since my better monitor broke. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m not sure whether or not the crash is relevant to my problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI restarted the PC, loaded KSP, and everything seemed fine. But when I went to click on Resume Saved Game, the text flashed slightly, but nothing else happened. It would not open the window showing my list of saved games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI restarted the game, but the problem remained. I restarted the computer, then the game, but no joy. I checked my KSP file, and the saves file seemed fine, in the usual place and with the usual list of my saves in it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i started a new career save, and exited it, to see if it would then give me the option to resume that game, but no, the problem was still the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne option which I guess I could consider is a full reinstall. I can keep my saves files and gamedata file and overwrite them once I\u0027ve reinstalled. But I\u0027ve never done this, and am not 100% sure how to. I guess I just delete the whole KSP folder, then I\u0027ll be able to download the whole thing again via Steam? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut perhaps someone knows an easier fix to this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oafman","CreatedById":110386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T14:29:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe save file for one of my saves had somehow become corrupted.

I had spent quite a while working on things in the VAB and SPH, but I was able to start a new save, drop in the files for the ships I had built, and launch that active ship again.
