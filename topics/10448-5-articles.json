The rest of our intrepid engineering team has been busy going up and down into (almost) space and researching technologies to be bolder and go further. Many craft were commissioned on governmental order to facilitate the foreseen construction of a space station, I\\\u0027m pleased to announce that there was a lot of design variety. \u003Cstrong\u003EFireblade\u003C/strong\u003E carries away the prize for achieving the mission objective using only two engines, whereas \u003Cstrong\u003EAwaras\u003C/strong\u003E is the king of efficiency by using only three fuel tanks. The missions itself where not uneventful, Awaras\\\u0027 rocket was damaged in orbit during a separation maneuver, losing the center engine and possibly more importantly the \\\u0027mechjeb\\\u0027 avionics and flight control package. Fortunately the craft and pilots were robust enough to set down on kerbin safely. Less fortunate were the crew contracted by \u003Cstrong\u003Efireblade\u003C/strong\u003E, upon touchdown their RCS tank (doubling as landing gear) exploded, incinerating and killing the entire crew. The families of the deceased have been compensated to the tune of 2250 credits, according to the 25% of mission profits per deceased kerbal standard reimbursement policy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news the government and private sectors have unveiled their intentions for the funding of space exploration. The program goal for now will be the permanent colonization of Mun, which has been discovered to consist of solid rock (as confirmed by the recently launched Kubble telescope) to build on. Before this can be even attempted extended space habitats will be constructed, the previously mentioned space stations. However before that can even be considered it has to be shown that kerbals can in fact survive prolonged exposure to zero-gee and the general space environment. To this end it has been declared that the mission \\\u0027complete one full kerbin orbit\\\u0027 needs to be accomplished at least once, then a joint program to build a space station will be initiated, after the completion of which munar exploration will be put back on the table.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contract for this turn will again be space station related, it will entail the construction of a lean crew transport to facilitate cheap and easy crew rotations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETurn 5 financial breakdown\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer:\u003C/strong\u003E Awaras \u003Cstrong\u003EMission Completed:\u003C/strong\u003E Launch probe to kerbol orbit \u003Cstrong\u003ETech purchased:\u003C/strong\u003E Liquid Tech II Spent:$27900 \u003Cstrong\u003EIncome:\u003C/strong\u003E$53500 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E $69605\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer:\u003C/strong\u003E Fireblade \u003Cstrong\u003EMission Completed:\u003C/strong\u003E80km \u003Cstrong\u003ETech purchased:\u003C/strong\u003E Liquid Tech I \u003Cstrong\u003ESpent:\u003C/strong\u003E$18000 \u003Cstrong\u003EIncome:\u003C/strong\u003E$20500 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E $19600\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer:\u003C/strong\u003E Robsr3v3ng3 \u003Cstrong\u003EMission Completed:\u003C/strong\u003E 25km \u003Cstrong\u003ETech purchased:\u003C/strong\u003E Booster Tech \u003Cstrong\u003ESpent:\u003C/strong\u003E$10200 \u003Cstrong\u003EIncome:\u003C/strong\u003E$11500 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E $11750\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer:\u003C/strong\u003E Issarlk\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Completed:\u003C/strong\u003E80km \u003Cstrong\u003ETech purchased:\u003C/strong\u003E Salvage Tech I \u003Cstrong\u003ESpent:\u003C/strong\u003E$12050 \u003Cstrong\u003EIncome:\u003C/strong\u003E$19500 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E $19850\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer:\u003C/strong\u003E Bellaby\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Completed:\u003C/strong\u003E25km \u003Cstrong\u003ETech purchased:\u003C/strong\u003EDecoupler Tech \u003Cstrong\u003ESpent:\u003C/strong\u003E$10500 \u003Cstrong\u003EIncome:\u003C/strong\u003E$14500 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E $14400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn 6 details are up in the OP.
