The rest of our intrepid engineering team has been busy going up and down into (almost) space and researching technologies to be bolder and go further. Many craft were commissioned on governmental order to facilitate the foreseen construction of a space station, I\\\u0027m pleased to announce that there was a lot of design variety. **Fireblade** carries away the prize for achieving the mission objective using only two engines, whereas **Awaras** is the king of efficiency by using only three fuel tanks. The missions itself where not uneventful, Awaras\\\u0027 rocket was damaged in orbit during a separation maneuver, losing the center engine and possibly more importantly the \\\u0027mechjeb\\\u0027 avionics and flight control package. Fortunately the craft and pilots were robust enough to set down on kerbin safely. Less fortunate were the crew contracted by **fireblade**, upon touchdown their RCS tank (doubling as landing gear) exploded, incinerating and killing the entire crew. The families of the deceased have been compensated to the tune of 2250 credits, according to the 25% of mission profits per deceased kerbal standard reimbursement policy.\n\nIn other news the government and private sectors have unveiled their intentions for the funding of space exploration. The program goal for now will be the permanent colonization of Mun, which has been discovered to consist of solid rock (as confirmed by the recently launched Kubble telescope) to build on. Before this can be even attempted extended space habitats will be constructed, the previously mentioned space stations. However before that can even be considered it has to be shown that kerbals can in fact survive prolonged exposure to zero-gee and the general space environment. To this end it has been declared that the mission \\\u0027complete one full kerbin orbit\\\u0027 needs to be accomplished at least once, then a joint program to build a space station will be initiated, after the completion of which munar exploration will be put back on the table.\n\nThe contract for this turn will again be space station related, it will entail the construction of a lean crew transport to facilitate cheap and easy crew rotations.\n\n**Turn 5 financial breakdown**\n\n**Player:** Awaras **Mission Completed:** Launch probe to kerbol orbit **Tech purchased:** Liquid Tech II Spent:$27900 **Income:**$53500 **New Balance:** $69605\n\n**Player:** Fireblade **Mission Completed:**80km **Tech purchased:** Liquid Tech I **Spent:**$18000 **Income:**$20500 **New Balance:** $19600\n\n**Player:** Robsr3v3ng3 **Mission Completed:** 25km **Tech purchased:** Booster Tech **Spent:**$10200 **Income:**$11500 **New Balance:** $11750\n\n**Player:** Issarlk**Mission Completed:**80km **Tech purchased:** Salvage Tech I **Spent:**$12050 **Income:**$19500 **New Balance:** $19850\n\n**Player:** Bellaby**Mission Completed:**25km **Tech purchased:**Decoupler Tech **Spent:**$10500 **Income:**$14500 **New Balance:** $14400\n\nTurn 6 details are up in the OP. I\\\u0027ve decided that the first joint project will kick off next turn to give you all a chance to raise a little more funds. Also it will give me a little bit more time to work out the details. As I\\\u0027ve previously said I\\\u0027m moving house starting tomorrow, for that reason I\\\u0027ve slated this turn to last a full week. Should my moving proceed quickly and you guys all submit earlier, we can proceed faster.\n\n@Sjwt \u0026 Sal\\_vager; because of the lenghty turn and dwindling amount of players, if you guys decide you want to keep participating after all you\\\u0027re free to use the extra time to submit both turns 5 \u0026 6 this week. \n\nAlso, please answer the following questions:\n\n-Do you guys want to see more (space)plane action?\n\n-What are your views on joint projects, being milestones that need all of you guys to complete, will carry little to no pay but will pave the way for future missions. Intended as a (financial) equalizer, the richer more advanced players will be able to contribute more to these projects, spending their excess cash in exchange for brownie points.\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Bellaby","CreatedById":23894,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T14:38:14Z","Content":"Sweet monies, finally have a reasonable amount, although still no-where near enough for liquid fuel rockets ;(\n\nAh well. As for your questions;\n\n[More Space-plane stuff?] - Yes please!\n\n[Joint ventures?] - Definitely, seeing as i\\\u0027m one of those guys with the smaller wallets, but you may want to add some greater incentives than \u0027brownie points\u0027, for example (if this is even possible) when/if a space station is constructed, the biggest donaters get the most launch slots from it or get use of the space station\\\u0027s labs (allowing for an extra research slot) etc.\n\nBut yeah otherwise i\\\u0027m all for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T15:38:48Z","Content":"Don, can you please clarify the \u0027Raise apoapsis to 350km\u0027 and \u0027Demonstrate at least 100m/s dV capability using only the RCS system\u0027?\n\nFirst of all, boosting with RCS prograde from a circular 200x200 km orbit for 100 m/s dV WILL increase the apoapsis of the ship almost to 350 km. Does that count? \n\nSecond, do we need to actually reach the altitude of 350 km? Circularize the orbit there? or just raise apoapsis to 350km and go straight to deorbiting maneuvers?"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T15:50:13Z","Content":"You need to just raise the apoapsis, not go there. No need for circularization needed either. the RCS dV has to be applied after the apo-raising. How you utilize that is up to you, probably retro-grade to facilitate de-orbiting. In short, the flight plan needs to be executed in order.\n\nI made these requirements with a space-station rendez-vous capable ship in mind. to apo-raising to demonstrate fuel capacity for orbital maneuvering (raising/lowering to catch up) and RCS capacity to perform fine maneuvers. 100 m/s on the RCS is probably way more than needed, but you know, redundancy and all ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-08T16:00:01Z","Content":"Thank you for your answers.\n\nAs for the space plane parts and joint ventures I am all for that."},{"CreatedByName":"issarlk","CreatedById":17336,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-09T09:57:47Z","Content":"I don\\\u0027t care about spaceplanes but don\\\u0027t mind them.
