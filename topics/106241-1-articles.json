Engines lose heat by radiation, convection and conduction.\n\n***Heat loss is proportional to area / mass.***\n\nIf you increase the mass of engines, they will lose heat slower, thus gain temperature faster for the same heatProduction. In essence, of two engines with the same heatProuction the one with higher mass will overheat faster. The lighter the engine - the more slowly it overheats.\n\n**Deep explanation:**\n\nEach second, an engine part\u0027s heat is increased by:\n\n***T/s = heatProduction \\* currentThrust / maxThrust / flowMultiplier \\* PhysicsGlobals.internalGenerationFactor \\* thermalMass***\n\nheatProduction is measured in Kelvins/s, although with modifiers (0.03 for the PhysicsGlobals.internalGenerationFactor which is set in the Physics.cfg). You will quickly see that for rocket engines, heat production increases as you go from sea level to vacuum (because thrust increases), and for jets, heat production is linear with respect to throttle no matter the altitude.\n\nflowMultiplier is the jet airflow multiplier. It\u0027s the product of evaluating atmCurve on density/1.225, and evaluating velCurve on mach.\n\n----\n\nheatProduction is now scaled by the part\u0027s thermal mass (as well as the internal generation factor). So assuming the latter is 1 (it\u0027s not, it\u0027s something like 0.03) then heatProduction=1 literally means \u0022this engine produces enough heat per second to raise its temperature 1 K per second\u0022.\n\nYet increasing 0.02t of mass 1K means waaaaay less energy than increasing 6t of Mainsail. And that heat (the energy, not the temperature) conducts outward. \u00A9 NathanKell\n\n**2)** A new line **emissiveConstant** was introduced for heat dissipation and varies between 0.1 and 0.95.

From 0 to 1 the speed increases. The less the number, the better a part protects adjacent parts from its own heat. Your PC\u0027s heatsink probably has around 0.7\n\nheatConductivity increases with the area of connection of two parts, as does in real life.\n\nThe default value is 0.12 when this line is missing.\n\nIt was given to:\n\n[TABLE=width: 250]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]- solar panels[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.04[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]- service bays[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.04[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]- \u0022shielded\u0022 aero parts[/TD]\n\n[TD]0.06[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n**5)** There\u0027s a hidden parameter **heatConvectiveConstant** which is not used by the stock parts, but is available for modders. It defines how fast a part convects its temperature via surrounding atmosphere. It defaults as 1.0 and can be increased to simulate a wet surface which cools faster in the air.\n\nSplashed-down parts cool much faster.\n\n**6)** **Radiative Area**\n\nThe game calculates the radiative area of parts from their meshes and is the theoretical area that emits or absorbs radiated heat. Parts emit heat when in shadow and absorb it when in sunlight. Parts with a larger radiative area gain or lose heat faster than those with smaller radiative areas.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u00A9 Red Iron Crown\n\nRadiative area is used for three things:\n\n**1**. black body radiative emission and reception\n\n**2**. solar flux\n\n**3**. body flux (if your current SoI is not the sun, you get reflected solar flux based on body albedo, and emissive flux based on body temperature).\n\nAll three occur all the time.\n\n**1** is proportional to ***part temperature***^***4***^ ***- background temp***^***4***^.\n\n**2** is proportional to distance to the sun and to unoccluded part area facing the sun.\n\n**3** is proportional to distance to the body and to unoccluded part area facing the body.\n\nThe density of the atmosphere (if you\u0027re in an atmosphere) will also lower the solar and body flux incoming, but raise the background radiation temperature above 4 K. Background temperature is interpolated by density, though not at all linearly, between 4 K and the current external temperature, i.e. shockwave heating is included. \u00A9 NathanKell\n\n**7)** **Ingame thermal flux**\n\n[TABLE=width: 830]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]The tooltip of the debug menu contains several thermal outputs:\n\nTemperature\n\nTemperature External (includes the shockwave heat from deceleration)\n\nThe flux is measured in kilowatts\n\n**\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u2122** **negative number** is for outgoing thermal power\n\n**\u002B** **** **positive number** is for incoming thermal power\n\n**Conduction Flux** - heat transfer between adjacent parts\n\n**Convection Flux** - heat gain/loss via the help of atmosphere, velocity and surface area\n\n**Radiation Flux** - influenced by emissiveConstant and surface area;\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201A\u00ACradiates heat in shadow, takes heat if sunlit\n\n**Internal Flux** - heat production of the part itself (e.g. engines, drills...)[/TD]\n\n[TD]![r4KCmNs.png](http://i.imgur.com/r4KCmNs.png)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\n* * *\n\nI decided to make this thread because I believe many modders are having trouble fixing the temps of their parts for KSP 1.0\n\nBig thanks to [NathanKell](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/76989-NathanKell) and [Red Iron Crown](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/12867-Red-Iron-Crown) for clarifying many of the new mechanics.\n\nHave I missed anything or made a mistake? please comment in the thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T06:58:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 06:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**\n  \n1.0.2"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:16:39Z","Content":"Thanks for comprehensive guide.

While tweaking the NERVA to make it non-explosive I\u0027ve made something weird. First, I toned down the heat conduction to other parts to simulate cryo isolation, and then I started searching for a way to simulate cooling, that in this design is obtained by the hot fuel leaving the engine. However the engine doesn\u0027t have any simulation of something like that, (convection seems to work only in the atmosphere) and I decided to bump up the emissiveConstant to 1.2. While it is a physical abomination it is the only way without a plugin that I found to simulate this behavior within sane working temperatures, and indeed an engine dissipates more heat than simply from blackbody. There is a saner method or am I stuck with this?"},{"CreatedByName":"SymbolicFrank","CreatedById":138922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:07:25Z","Content":"How/where is the current amount of heat stored?
