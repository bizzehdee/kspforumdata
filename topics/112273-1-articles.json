Of course, I can\u0027t just do a logical Jool-5, I have to impose some pointless restrictions. So, this is a one capsule Jool-5 without docking or ISRU. Basically, I wanted to create a serially staged spacecraft where the entire thing has to land; take off from a moon; transfer to another moon; land... No refueling or docking in between.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4T0UCoyDuDQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nLet me know what you think!"},{"CreatedByName":"redsh","CreatedById":118322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:27:24Z","Content":"Nicely done!\n\n27 years before Jool arrival.

Turns out the lazy Kerbin-\u003EKerbin-\u003EKerbin gravity assists are not all that useful. Sure, they are somewhat easy to do, but they don\u0027t save you that much deltaV (I spent 1687 m/s, as opposed to 1950 m/s for a direct Jool transfer (no insertion burn)). In hindsight, I should of just slapped some more fuel on the transfer stage and did a direct Kerbin-\u003EJool transfer burn. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This amused me, particularly the part where you FLIPPED OUT about him not climbing the ladder xD\n\u003E Although I must say, 30 years for a mission is a reeeeally long time... o\\_o\n\nAlthough it seems like an exaggeration, I really was ticked off by that ladder ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif). It was especially frustrating since I TESTED it on Kerbin before I launched it. I have no idea why he couldn\u0027t climb it... Maybe the Kraken adjusted it slightly so that it wouldn\u0027t work. IDK, but next time, I\u0027m just sticking an extra capsule to the base of my craft so that I never have to deal with ladders again.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T20:04:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Stratzenblitz75**"},{"CreatedByName":"redsh","CreatedById":118322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:43:51Z","Content":"I think maybe sloped surface and legs damaged during landing caused parts of craft to shift relative to each other so ladders become misaligned slightly.

However, the rest were taken by setting up a maneuver node and skipping ahead a few orbits until I got the nearest approach with Kerbin that I could get. From there, I would play with the maneuver node to turn the approach into an encounter. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I really enjoyed this, nicely done.

This forced him to let go of the lower ladder and grab the upper one, allowing him to climb up the rest of the ladder system (thankfully, without any other incidents)."},{"CreatedByName":"GRS","CreatedById":179502,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-14T09:20:08Z","Content":"How did you pulled this off, i want to do things like this (as my 4th Jool 5, or maybe earlier), any tips ???"}]}
