Of course, I can\u0027t just do a logical Jool-5, I have to impose some pointless restrictions. So, this is a one capsule Jool-5 without docking or ISRU. Basically, I wanted to create a serially staged spacecraft where the entire thing has to land; take off from a moon; transfer to another moon; land...

Turns out the lazy Kerbin-\u0026gt;Kerbin-\u0026gt;Kerbin gravity assists are not all that useful. Sure, they are somewhat easy to do, but they don\u0027t save you that much deltaV (I spent 1687 m/s, as opposed to 1950 m/s for a direct Jool transfer (no insertion burn)). In hindsight, I should of just slapped some more fuel on the transfer stage and did a direct Kerbin-\u0026gt;Jool transfer burn. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022parameciumkid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis amused me, particularly the part where you FLIPPED OUT about him not climbing the ladder xD\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I must say, 30 years for a mission is a reeeeally long time... o_o\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it seems like an exaggeration, I really was ticked off by that ladder \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E.
