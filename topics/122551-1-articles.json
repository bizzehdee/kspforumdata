The theory says that if such a particle remains in a space filled with a vacuum it decays at a different pace than when in the vicinity of many other particles interacting with it. Thus if in a system of extreme acceleration more particles can be seen as a result of the Unruh effect, the average decay times of particles such as muons should change.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese results are in the verification process. The bottom line is that fundemental properties of the universe can be tampered with below the types of forces in which relativistic gravity gives way to quantum gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
