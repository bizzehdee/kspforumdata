For example, Deadly Reentry was a mod long before Squad added heat damage. I don\u0027t think that was a ripoff seeing as most people know by the time they\u0027re 10 years old that stuff burns up in the atmosphere when coming from space. A deep space network and relays is a similarly common-sense idea."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:33:49Z","Content":"Here, this is the article link where you can leave comments:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:35:47Z","Content":"Please take your comments over to the article: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay), as klesh was so kind to mention.\n\nClosed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T16:39:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"}]}
