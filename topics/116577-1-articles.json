For example, Deadly Reentry was a mod long before Squad added heat damage. I don\u0027t think that was a ripoff seeing as most people know by the time they\u0027re 10 years old that stuff burns up in the atmosphere when coming from space. A deep space network and relays is a similarly common-sense idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere, this is the article link where you can leave comments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T16:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease take your comments over to the article: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/350-Development-Relay\u003C/a\u003E, as klesh was so kind to mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T16:39:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
