It\u0027s mainly intended for new players, but you might still find some of the information available to be useful, particularly for your first interplanetary mission. Feel free to ask questions in the How To section of the forums as well. Since you seem to be the creative sort, I\u0027d also recommend that you take a look in the Fan Works section and offer your opinions on other people\u0027s work, or maybe even contribute some of your own if you\u0027re interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarking","CreatedById":69044,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T07:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks alot mate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i need any tutorials i\u0027ll be sure to go to the drawing board.
