I will say as much as I love the Saturn V it was a behemoth and was unbelievably expensive. If we want to get to Mars or back to the Moon we need something that big. However we should have been developing a cheap reliable rocket to make trips back and forth to the ISS like the Soyuz. We Americans just can\u0027t do anything small. Our launch vehicles have been expensive and huge, and amazing but the Russians knew how to play the long game. Yes yes I know SpaceX is gonna pick up the lost slack and finally allow us not to rely on the Russians to get to the ISS but we should have been developing one as we were building the ISS.

If we only adapted or developed a launch system like that before we retired the shuttle fleet we wouldn\u0027t have to rely on the Russians. Once the grasshopper is fully developed and implemented for SpaceX the Dragon, and falcon rockets will be the some of the most powerful and cost effective rockets ever made. I don\u0027t think the Ares I or the Liberty were ever really viable launch vehicles. I don\u0027t like the idea of strapping people to the top of a single SRB. Kerbals? Yes. But humans, I don\u0027t think so, it just seem innately unsafe. You can\u0027t shut them down! Also how do you control an SRB? I mean its over with now. SpaceX will service the ISS baring any unforeseen circumstances. My real gripe is that they retired the shuttle which of course was entirely necessary and doesn\u0027t serve a purpose anymore and had nothing prepared to replace it. I mean NASA of all things couldn\u0027t predict or see the potential for geopolitical conflicts and tension? Anyway its too late dwell on it now.

A Shorter engine length means a quicker throw if you will. Also less mass to counteract. I have noticed on several multi engine builds I have done (not just with FASA parts) that more small gimbaled engines offer better maneuverability than the same or fewer number of bigger engines.
