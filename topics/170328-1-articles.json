Adding an option to have a tank with only LO makes a lot of sense. Plus, for any stages designed to operate completely outside of the atmosphere, having balloon tanks with a better propellant fraction than the rest of the stock tanks would mean a wider range of lander designs and transfer stages. However, the low impact tolerance and large cross-sectional area of these tanks would necessitate their inclusion in a fairing for ascents from Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also build more real-life-analogue stages and landers, since numerous real-world vehicles use spherical tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-03T15:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink I saw something like this in update pics from the weekly.
