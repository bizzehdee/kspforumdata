I also tried a shallower descent with a higher AoA on reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all the ship handled great... There was a bit of overheat (1200\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA) at one point which kinda scared me but I managed to pull through and land on KSC. Although I wasn\u0027t able to do it on my first pass but nothing a go\u0027ol U-turn can\u0027t handle! :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery sadly though I did take a couple of screenshots with the whole crew celebrating on the runway but for some odd reason the screenies don\u0027t seem be saved... But either way it was night time so they weren\u0027t thaaat great... :-P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again thanks for all the help!
