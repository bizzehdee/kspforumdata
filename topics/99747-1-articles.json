However, the general advice would be to make sure that the center of mass when empty is ahead of your center of lift, and to make sure you have enough control surfaces and lifting surfaces. In stock KSP, that just means adding plenty of wings and elevators. It might be too late if your shuttle is already in space though, which is why it\u0027s a good idea to do atmospheric tests ahead of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T13:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn answer to #4 - a reasonably reliable method I use is one suggested in DocMoriarty\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Space Plane Construction and Operation\u003C/a\u003E Guide:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Set a marker out at KSC. Preferably, this is a set of flags set put on either side of the runway lengthwise (i.e. one on the ocean-side end of the runway, and one on the other side) - you can use the flag to check your alignment on the KSC Runway. Additional markers at 1, 5, 10 and 20 kilometers out on the landward end of the runway can be placed as well; this would give you a rudimentary ILS. If you\u0027ve got a mod like NavUtilities, you just need a single mark for KSC itself. A powered probe core on the Launchpad will do just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You want to put a maneuver node on the far side of Kerbin \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eexactly opposite\u003C/span\u003E from KSC. You\u0027ll want to position it so that your craft will reach the node within one minute; for each additional minute of lead time, you\u0027ll need to add a lead angle of one degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Set the maneuver node to put your periapsis over KSC at an altitude of 44,000 meters. If you\u0027re at a higher orbit than 100x100, set the periapsis lower and vice versa (DocMoriarty suggests 45,500 for a 72x72 orbit, for example). Burn as indicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this method I usually wind up in the situation where I\u0027m subsonic (generally below 400 m/s) within 100 klicks of KSC. Done right you can glide right in; I\u0027ve never accomplished that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind - this procedure works for the souposphere (i.e. stock aero). If you use NEAR or FAR, you\u0027ll need to make a series of tight turns as you approach to bleed off speed - otherwise you\u0027re going to wind up going WAY too fast, and won\u0027t be able to do much besides wave as you overshoot the runway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to take another look at your shuttle to see what its flight characteristics are late in its flight. Depending on the design, your CoM could be shifting behind the CoL when you make your final burn for orbit, in which case a safe recovery is going to be highly problematic. The RCS Build Aid mod would be able to tell you if that\u0027s what\u0027s going on (it will show you your \u0022dry center of mass\u0022, and let you know how much/in what direction the CoM shifts as you burn fuel); you could try that out with the orbiter in the SPH to see if that\u0027s what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T17:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome tips guys, thanks a lot! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to do some test runs with a remote controlled shuttle and see how can I make this work...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso thanks a lot for the re-entry method, which I\u0027m sure will help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post here with screenshots after I do the test runs, and will put the updated shuttle if I ever needed to modify it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T17:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, so I changed the shuttle, I was able to make it to orbit around 250km and now I am trying to get the best position to de-orbit and enter kerbin straight to KSC...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the new shuttle I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4vxG7-rvmD2SEdOOS1tRngweVU/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4vxG7-rvmD2SEdOOS1tRngweVU/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SalehRam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SalehRam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so I changed the shuttle, I was able to make it to orbit around 250km and now I am trying to get the best position to de-orbit and enter kerbin straight to KSC...\u003Cp\u003EHere is the new shuttle I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4vxG7-rvmD2SEdOOS1tRngweVU/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4vxG7-rvmD2SEdOOS1tRngweVU/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good practice to accompany craft files with pictures or post only pictures.
