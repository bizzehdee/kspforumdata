docking ports are a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E less stiff than normal connections.\u00A0 The tiny 0.625m ports in particular are extraordinarily wobbly.\u00A0 This is a simple fact of KSP, there\u0027s not really anything to debate about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether that lack of stiffness \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ematters\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E or not totally depends on the player\u0027s situation and what the player is trying to accomplish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some situations where stiffness doesn\u0027t matter much.\u00A0 For example, if all you\u0027re doing is building a static station, where all it has to do is just hang there motionless in space, then stiffness doesn\u0027t matter a lot, if you don\u0027t mind a bit of swaying now and then.\u00A0 Sometimes SAS resonance can cause runaway wobble and hilarity ensues, but just turning off SAS lets things settle down.\u00A0 From your description, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/131939-seaces/\u0022\u003E@seaces\u003C/a\u003E, I would guess that this covers your situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there are other scenarios where the stiffness \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E matters.\u00A0 (I assume that this is the OP\u0027s use case, or he wouldn\u0027t have been asking about it.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, a common use of docking ports is for \u0022tugs\u0022 or motherships, where one ship is moving another one under thrust.\u00A0 Stiffness really matters there, especially if the ship doing the thrusting is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epushing\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the other ship (which in my experience is the most common case).\u00A0 The floppiness of docking ports really matters there, and has a major impact on ship design:\u00A0 it affects the size of docking port choice (the bigger the better), the physical arrangement of the ships involved (try to keep them short on the longitudinal axis to minimize moment of inertia relative to the docking-port joint), and the ability to daisy-chain multiple items in a line (don\u0027t do it if you have a \u0022pusher\u0022 tug, it\u0027s a recipe for tears).\u00A0 The floppiness of docking ports substantially reduces the practicality of building large ships in orbit by assembling them out of docked sections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re in a situation where docking-port floppiness is causing problems for you, there are various things you can do to try to mitigate the problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUse bigger docking ports for better stiffness.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor tugs, consider a design that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epulls\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the load (which is an inherently stable configuration) rather than pushes it (which is inherently unstable).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible to attain stiffer docking-port connections by carefully designing ships so that you make multiple simultaneous connections (e.g. instead of connecting with one docking port, you use, say, three ports arranged in a triangle).\u00A0 This is doable, and some people have had good results with it.\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(I tend to stay away from it myself, mainly because I don\u0027t like the looks, it makes for ship designs whose appearance I don\u0027t care for, and I find the docking experience to be more finicky than I\u0027d like.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnother option for stiffening connections, if you\u0027re willing to use mods:\u00A0 Kerbal Attachment System has a really nice part available, \u0022strut sockets\u0022.\u00A0 These are small, light, radially-attachable parts that you can put on your ships.\u00A0 You can send out a kerbal on EVA and click on them to establish a strut connection between two ports.\u00A0 So you can get a nice stiff docking-port connection by making sure you\u0027ve got some strut sockets around the port on each of the two connected ships.\u00A0 Dock the ships, then send out a kerbal to reinforce the joint with some well-placed struts.\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(I\u0027ve frequently used this technique for assembling big ships in orbit, and I really like it:\u00A0 works great, has minimal visual impact on the design, and it gives my EVA kerbals something fun and \u0022astronauty\u0022 to do.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re pushing rather than pulling, ship design matters.\u00A0 Two ships docked together will wobble less if there\u0027s a big mass disparity between them (i.e. one\u0027s a lot less massive than the other).\u00A0 You\u0027ll also get less wobble if you can reduce the moment of inertia around the docking-port joint, i.e. keep your ships squat and short on the longitudinal axis, try to keep the CoM as close to the docking port as possible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

So, as long as your vessels are properly balanced, you can put just about anything you want on the other end of the docking port as long as your thrust is about at the LV-N level. Also, since the LV-N has no gimbal, SAS is safe to use indefinitely with such a setup : no kraken, no undampened wobble, even when the drive section is all on its own behind a docking port and you have a lab, lander, ISRU, drill, ore and LFOx refuelling tanks on the forward side of the port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd of course, if the thing you\u0027re pushing is fairly light (your standard 3km/s minimal 1-man science lander, for example) you can stick just about any engine on the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as a test the other day, I had twin Aerospikes pushing a full Rockomax 32 tank for over several thousand m/s dv on 4x physics warp without any problems.
