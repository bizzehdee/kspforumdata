Especially on the Mun and Minmus.\n\nwhen I get a contract to do some EVA reports / surface samples on the Mun I have a hard time getting my kerbals on EVA to the exact location. Since there is no navbal in EVA and the Mun has a fairly boring grey surface I end up flying my kerbal past the location. \n\nIs there a simple mod or trick I can use to get my kerbals in the right heading to the contract location ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T19:58:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hugix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T21:19:57Z","Content":"Sure, Waypoint Manager will show you the locations of the waypoints within the flight view.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-0-90-Waypoint-Manager-v2-1-4-2015-02-23-%28Formerly-In-Flight-Waypoints%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-0-90-Waypoint-Manager-v2-1-4-2015-02-23-%28Formerly-In-Flight-Waypoints%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T21:21:49Z","Content":"Staying in the lander until you\u0027re in the area isn\u0027t optimal fuel-wise, but it\u0027s the easiest.
