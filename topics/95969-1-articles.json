I am have been following a basic format of a Mk1 or Mk2 cockpit, followed by a Mk2 bicoupler with a few fuel tanks, a radial intake body and either basic or advance turbines. I then slap some delta wings on it near the middle so that the center of lift is nearish the middle of the plane, and put an elevator and alerion on each wing (I assign one function to each set). Then I\u0027ll center some liquid/ox fuel tanks in the wings and add a rocket engine for space flight. Trouble is that my plane doesn\u0027t want to be a plane. It wants to be a backhoe. I\u0027ll hold down the S key on the runway and see the elevators lift up, but once I get rolling, it doesn\u0027t seem to want to pitch up. Sometimes if I make it to the end of the runway, I can manage some level flight, but not much up flight. (plenty of down flight though). What am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso one of the default planes The Stearwing D45 doesn\u0027t seem to fly well when I transition to the jet engines. If I make it out of the atmo and back, it won\u0027t fly once I hit air, just a gradual decent into terrain. (that\u0027s if I am holding the S key the entire time. If I let it do what it wants, it dirt darts. If I drop the jet engines in the air and switch to rockets, it also won\u0027t fly anymore, even if I have decent speed of 150m/s, just does the slowly drop thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d appreciate any suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T01:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you happen to have any screenshots of the craft in question handy?
