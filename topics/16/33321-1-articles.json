Also choosing locations to place these goes a long way to improving overall performance, if your ship has allot of weight out side the center of mass (hanging off the side of the central stack) then additional SAS on those should help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T19:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKarolk, Tomcat, does SAS help maneuvering?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T19:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022karolk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022karolk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESAS modules DO help maneuvering, they provide additional torque.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethey don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecommand pods and probes do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T19:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust found that Ampyear lets SAS help with turning, so I\u0027m gonna use that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T19:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022karolk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022karolk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESAS modules DO help maneuvering, they provide additional torque.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Torque\u0027 (The stat) can only be used by the SAS system and only while active.
