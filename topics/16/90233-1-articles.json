Then, on that second maneuver node, play with the radial burn indicators. Fairly quickly you should get a close approach marker. If it\u0027s not where you like, you can drag that first node around your parking orbit.

What you do is wait until you can draw a line straight out from the space center which crosses Minmus\u0027s orbit (you are directly under the orbit), and launch six degrees away from east (either north or south, depending on whether you are under the ascending or descending node). If you do it right, you wind up in almost the right inclination, which minimizes the amount of effort you spend on the plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easy way to do it from there is to create a node at ascending/descending node to exactly match planes, and then do your Hohmann transfer, but the more efficient way is usually to transfer first, match inclinations second. The reason that works is that plane changes are easiest at low velocity, so if you have an ascending/descending node halfway out in the transfer, when your rocket is at a much lower velocity than LKO, your plane change will be more efficient. The only exception is if your AN/DN will be immediately after the transfer, when you still have a lot of velocity from the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: An extreme, illustrative example of plane changes: I once launched a rocket into Munar orbit, but accidentally sent it into the opposite direction from the rest of my orbital flotilla. A direct 180 degree plane change in low Mun orbit (reversing the orbit) would have cost more dV than I had remaining. However, I discovered that a bi-elliptic transfer would work: I raised apoapsis almost to Munar escape, reversed my orbit at apoapsis, and returned to low Munar orbit on a dV budget which would have been just barely enough to cancel my velocity in low Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T03:35:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 03:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"locustgate","CreatedById":81277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T11:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m asking more along the lines of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E, but one that works with moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T12:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not really a need for a transfer calculator for going from LKO to the Mun or Minmus as there\u0027s an efficient transfer opportunity every orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re doing Mun-Minmus or Minmus-Mun then transfer windows become relevant, you can use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlexmoon\u0027s excellent calculator\u003C/a\u003E to plan them.

The idea is to arrive at Minmus when it\u0027s at or near its AN or DN with Kerbin\u0027s equatorial plane. That way, you don\u0027t have to worry about doing a plane change to get an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch into an equatorial LKO as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Set Minmus as the target so you get the AN and DN markers on the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Create your maneuver node at whichever of the AN or DN markers is behind the current position of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Pull on the prograde node handle until you get the closest approach markers, then fine-tune the amount of prograde until you get an intercept. That\u0027s really all there is to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens most of the time using this method is that your burn puts your Ap out beyond the orbit of Minmus and you get your encounter after you pass Ap on your way back towards Kerbin. Thus, by varying the size of the burn, you change your Ap, which changes the time of when your ship crosses the orbit of Minmus. So what you\u0027re really doing when you\u0027re pulling on the prograde handle is changing the timing so that your ship gets to the crossing point at the same time as Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the most efficient way to get to Minmus because your Ap will be out beyond Minmus instead of right at it. However, the difference is insignificant. You\u0027re talking a difference usually of less than 50m/s, which isn\u0027t enough to make or break you. You\u0027ll also have to burn a tiny bit harder to capture at Minmus but again, not enough to worry about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s why this is the quick-and-dirty method. You get the \u0022quick\u0022 in having a sure-fire, simple, no-brainer method of getting a Minmus intercept.
