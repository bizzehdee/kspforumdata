I have gotten to Minmus before but not directly. I couldn\u0027t get the lead angle on the transfer right from my parking orbit. What I ended up doing was going to the Mun and then using the fancy web calculator (this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E) to make the transfer to Minmus from there. That obviously is not the best way to go. Aside from matching planes while in parking orbit, what lead angle do I use to hit Minmus? I THINK it\u0027s about 90 degrees. Am I right? Or was that why I screwed it up?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T22:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually about 120 degrees, same as with the Mun. People used to use the old \u0022Munrise Burn\u0022 trick to get there, because when you\u0027re at about a 100km parking orbit, the visible edge of Kerbin is is about 30 degrees below the horizontal, so when the Mun, or Minmus rises into view, the angle between you, the center of Kerbin, and the rising object is about 120 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T22:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to get there is to set a maneuver node that goes from KO out to Minmus\u0027s orbit, then dragging it around until you get an intercept. adjusting your angle midway also costs less delta V than matching orbital planes before transferring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T23:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA good trick is to set Minmus as your target while still on the launch pad. Minmus\u0027 orbit is inclined by 6 degrees, so wait until either the ascending or descending node passes over KSC and launch directly into its orbital plane (either 6 degrees above or below the equitorial plane, you\u0027ll be able to see from map view). The closer you can get to its orbital plane during the launch, the easier this will be. This will allow you to create a maneuver node, once in orbit, out to Minmus orbit, and drag it around your Kerbin orbit until you get an intercept, much like people do with Mun from a standard equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T23:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds easy enough.

Doing it by hand isn\u0027t all that hard either: You\u0027d launch vertically as per normal, do an eastward gravity turn as per normal, and then nudge north or south a little bit (using MechJeb\u0027s orbit info display will tell you what your inclination is, as an assistance to a manual launch).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
