What I always do is \u003Cstrong\u003Eburn directly up\u003C/strong\u003E if i see that my orbit is falling in front of my target due to planetary rotation. Burning up won\u0027t speed you up it\u0027ll just widen your orbit, then once I\u0027m above my target i kill my horizontal speed and drop down. I then set my target as my target and i use the pink markers together with my retrograde marker to go directly towards my target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AnalogAddict","CreatedById":59758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T19:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Duna and other atmospheric worlds, I try to pick a spot 110 degrees from my landing site and lower my periapsis to 4~5km ASL (So periapsis is ~70 degrees ahead of desired landing target). This technique works from altitudes of 75~100km. Someone made a very handy chart that is more fleshed out than my method. At that point I let \u0027chutes and atmosphere do their work. Also I\u0027ll fire what expendable fuel I may have to fine tune the approach - albeit before the \u0027chutes deploy. This technique gets me back to KSC and repetitive landings making extra-planetary bases. This may take some trial and error depending on the drag of your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow I do this is fairly simple for non-atmospheric landings, I position my craft roughly on the opposite side of the planetary body from the desired landing site and lower my perigee to 4~5km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this maneuver is properly completed, the perigee node should be almost exactly above the landing site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I approach the landing site, I begin to kill my lateral velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found it easier to start burning before I think I should as to leave a decent amount of lateral velocity to get a more precise landing site in relation to my desired target, also during this phase I might burn normal or anti-normal to fine tune the final landing location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour mileage may vary depending on the style of craft you\u0027re attempting to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the most efficient landing technique, however its reliable time and time again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some tests with various landers and its 15~20% less efficient due to killing all horizontal velocity 4~5km above your target, then killing off the remaining vertical velocity as you approach the ground. As you get used to this technique you can improve that efficiency or fine tune one particular approach to be as efficient as possible (maybe 5% overhead vs suicide burns)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-18T12:08:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2013 12:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AnalogAddict\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T19:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you should remember is to switch your nav ball to \u0022Surface\u0022 as you begin your descent. That way if your retrograde marker is directly at 0 (middle of the blue) you are matching the orbital speed of the planet and will have zero lateral speed relative to the surface. In other words, if you\u0027re over your target and set it to surface, just keep the retrograde marker in the center of the blue and you\u0027re coming down on top of your target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PixeledGaming","CreatedById":69412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T04:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!
