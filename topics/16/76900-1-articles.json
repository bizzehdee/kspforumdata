You don\u0027t need to worry about adding engines or fuel or anything else. I can take care of building the rockets to land it. All I need is a barge that can hold that weight, and allow kerbals to walk around on deck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal payload is just under 19T. If anyone has suggestions on how to build such a craft, please let me know. I have really been struggling to build something that will survive the landing. I am happy to upload the craft file if needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boat can be as big as necessary, though, obviously I would like it to be as small as possible.

And like |Velocity| said, make pontoons with empty tanks. If needed, use girders to widen the pontoons to create more stability. Just like a lander needs to be wide to keep from tipping over, same thing with this. I would put some of the long girders on the corners horizontally, and put some empty 32s at the ends.
