That only necessitates a flyby low enough to do biome-sensitive science, though most people circularize anyways since doing a gravity assist flyby is a hard thing to do. Getting that deep in the gravity well can really bend your trajectory. If you bend it too much, you could end up needing more dV than if you were to do aerocapture (possible on all kerbol-orbiting bodies except Dres, Moho, and Eeloo) and another ejection burn. That said, you\u0027d need to circularize high to keep your ejection burns reasonable if this is an ion probe we are talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T14:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, that\u0027s the meaning of \u0022grand tour\u0022 I was going for- as used in the real-life Voyager probes where they called it a \u0022grand tour of the outer solar system.\u0022 I recognize it\u0027s come to mean something different in the KSP lexicon, where it does imply a landing on each and every body.
