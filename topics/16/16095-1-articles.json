It worked good until he smashed down a little bit too hard. He died. Well, I want to get him into the command pod (Mk1, but I edited the files so it has a 3 crew capacity) somehow. I suppose I have to edit my persistent.sfs-file if I don\u0027t want to fly a ship there (and even if I do want to), but I don\u0027t know what to edit for him to be in the pod. Or even near the pod on EVA. So, here are my questions: Is it possible to get a kerbonaut into a ship by editing the persistent.sfs-file? If yes, how? If no, how do I get another ship and/or EVA-ing kerbonaut near the first ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!
