After returning to orbit around kerbin I docked my craft with my space station and tried to transfer my experiments over to the moblile processing lab. I was however unable to, I got the following message \u0022not enought data storage to research [my experiment]\u0022 I\u0027ve tried transmitting from the lab and trying again but the same thing happened.

To empty it, you have to have scientists performing research, converting that data into science points (and then *that* has a maximum of 500 points at a time as well).\n\nWould you mind right clicking on the lab and taking a screenie, please?"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:31:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is purely cosmetic\u0027 date=\u0027 if you check the lab you should actually have the data in there.[/quote\u0027]\n\u003E Seconding this just in case you had doubts.

But yea this is a well known little bug, nothing serious enough to issue a hotfix so it should be fixed up in the next patch.

As you can see from the next screenshot there is data in the lab but no science [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491630068](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=491630068)"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T19:37:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just a guess but I think you may be confused with how the mobile processing lab works. When you perform an experiment, keep the data, and bring it to the MPL (or have the experiments attached to it) it will present you with a data value. The MPL has a data storage capacity of 500, meaning that you can transfer up to 500 data into the MPL for processing. You then must make sure it has at least one scientist on board and click \u0022Start Research\u0022 to begin actually turning this \u0022data\u0022 into science we can spend on tech. You\u0027ll notice that you\u0027re shown a \u0022sci per day\u0022 number which will be higher the closer you are to the maxium 500 data load. The data will start to be consumed over time as the lab produces science. To then retrieve this science, you must have an antenna to transmit.\n\nPosted this a while ago for a different thread just in case this is what you mean but I am still confused. You don\u0027t transfer SCIENCE to the lab, only DATA."},{"CreatedByName":"Powbag","CreatedById":149133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T19:56:18Z","Content":"Ah right that makes sense, thanks for the answer!
