Pointing retrograde and translating forward with H does the same thing as pointing prograde and translating backward with N.

A cluster of four LV-T30s attached to a quad-adapter weighs 0.8 tons less than a single Mainsail and has a specific impulse 50 s higher at 1 atmosphere and 40 s higher in a vacuum.
