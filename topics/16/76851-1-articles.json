After all, you\u0027re probably looking at 1000 m/s in delta-v each way between semi-low Kerbin orbit and Minimus orbit, it\u0027s a bit of a waste to make that run with any mass you don\u0027t have to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T09:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut your kethane extractor on Mun.

The objective is to get back to LKO with as much fuel as possible and Minmus allows you to burn less of it getting off the surface and leaving orbit. You should also be areobraking at kerbin to drop your AP without using fuel. Start with your PE at 45km and work your way lower with later trips till you find an altitude that drops your AP just enough to get to the altitude of your station. Then once you get to AP you just use a bit of fuel to raise your PE and you\u0027re ready to rendezvous and dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you build your tanker try and keep the non-fuel stuff as light as possible. No 3 man capsule just cause it looks cool. The larger probe cores work great for tankers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince your tanker will have a lot of mass when docking, don\u0027t skimp on the RCS. I use 2 rings of 4 quad blocks on each end of an orange tank. and either the big RCS tank or 6 of the larger radial mount tanks. This gives you plenty for docking and you still have lots left to resupply the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you land your tanker on minmus you might want to deactivate the RCS ports at the bottom and leave the top ones active. When landing tall ships the RCS on the top can reduce your chances of tipping. Try to start with a kethane deposit on one of the flats to make for easier landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T13:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy have a tall ship for mining?

My space tanker are normally a docking port, probe core, large sas, large battery, orange tank, poodle, and some solar panels and RCS tanks and thrusters on the tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was landing on the flats of minmus I\u0027d add some girders to the base to widen it\u0027s stance and some large landing gear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf he\u0027s got a refueling station in LKO then it\u0027s probably got lots of parts and may have ships docked at it.
