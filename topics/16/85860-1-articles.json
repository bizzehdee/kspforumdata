The big problem that the post you linked misses is the complication of Isp varying with pressure. Using F = dm/dt * v_e would only work if dm/dt wasn\u0027t also a function of height z. F is the quantity that\u0027s fixed, not v_e as the author of that answer assumed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI worked on this problem for a good couple hours before I decided I have better things to do. Suffice it to say that only for engines like the aerospike, where Isp is essentially fixed, is terminal velocity the best. For anything with a substantial Isp change, I\u0027ll bet that hauling ass through the thick lower atmosphere is the best, so that you can get up to where the drag is negligible and your Isp is maxed ASAP. Besides, you can only surpass terminal velocity if your TWR is 2.0 or more. For most rockets, your TWR won\u0027t be more than 3 or so, so there isn\u0027t really a lot to be lost by gunning it the whole way. You definitely minimize gravity losses once you are getting to thinner air that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T19:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy intuition tells me that gunning it is not best because in order to gun it you need to be burning a lot of fuel in the lower atmosphere where it\u0027s less efficient. Sure, you get out in less time, but time doesn\u0027t matter here because we care about the amount of fuel consumed for a given change in height. To test this, build a rocket with a TWR of about 3:1 and about 3km/s deltaV. Launch it strait up at full throttle and again at terminal velocity using Mechjeb. The one that achieves a higher apogee is more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T21:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareful with the terminology, the linked derivation minimizes delta-V expended, not fuel used. Minimizing fuel used results in a much lower initial TWR (1.2-1.3) and never approaches terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like a contradiction to consume more delta-V but less fuel, but it happens because of the lower engine mass in the fuel-efficient craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
