All but Seismic scan and Athmosphere analysis can be done in high/low orbit. Some can be done flying over a biome, other at high altitude but i can\u0027t say for sure which. Best carry a suite of all instruments you\u0027ve unlocked in sciency craft (athmospheric planes, suborbital turbojets, science landers, etc...)\n\nTemp - available in all situations.\n\nPressure - available in all situations. Gives no reading in vacuum (but can still gather situational science for a biome).\n\nSeismic scanner - only when landed and stationary. Gives reading in flight/space though (but no situational science/experiment).\n\nAthmosphere analyser - only in athmospheric flight. I think it treats high and low altitudes separately but can\u0027t say for sure.\n\nGravioli detector - haven\u0027t used it much but it should be available in all situations. It refused to conduct an experiment a few times, maybe when the craft was moving/burning/in flight.\n\nGoo/Science Jr. - all situations.\n\nCrew report - all situations.\n\nEVA - all situations though cannot be safely performed in athmospheric flight. Can be done unsafely...\n\nOre scanner - Not science but should point out that it gives a continuous readout best used when moving on the surface and trying to pinpoint the richest spot.\n\nMobile lab - Can analyse all experiments to gather research data, wheter done in the craft with the lab, or delivered by hand from elsewhere. Can reset equipment (goo canisters, science jrs.) on docked craft. Does not need a scientis for this. Needs a scientis to convert data into science.\n\n[edit]\n\nFor max science it\u0027s best to remove data from each instrument by hand before moving to another biome. If you have duplicates, place them in separate capsules/cockpits. Then cover a new biome with fresh instruments. For example on Minmus it\u0027s possible to score midlans, slopes and one of the flats with minimal fuss. It\u0027s generally more expedient to analyse results in a lab, then transmit back home. I\u0027m a pedant so i carry the damn things with me, but you don\u0027t have to. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T22:46:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF**"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:50:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I discovered I can do TEMP analysis high over bodies (which was only allowed in near spaaace)\n\u003E It seems I can also do PRESSURE experiment in vacuum.
