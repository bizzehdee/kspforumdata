They are aesthetically pleasing to have. But actually having to put cargo in them can be quite frustrating, especially if when you are placing a new part inside of them that nothing won\u0027t snap (it acts like it is on non-angle snap), so you usually end up placing something slightly off semetry. Because of that I don\u0027t even attempt to place anything, and it\u0027s hard to really do anything with those bays.\n\nHow in the world do you make stuff inside of those bays? And more over, why are docking ports so stubborn about being snapped into place when cargo bays are involved?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T01:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Der Anfang**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:07:12Z","Content":"I build the part to put in the cargo bay separately then save it as a subassembly. Using a docking port as the rootpart, so I can attach it to the docking port inside of the cargo bay. Makes life so much easier when you do it this way.\n\n![H4UuHyj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/H4UuHyj.jpg)\n\n![ar83LKA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ar83LKA.jpg)\n\n![RWXYQTx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RWXYQTx.jpg)\n\n![mQtvdEK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mQtvdEK.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T19:09:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Michaelo90","CreatedById":98783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:30:48Z","Content":"Hold alt to turn off surface attachment."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T20:17:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hold alt to turn off surface attachment.\n\nI was about to say that - I\u0027ll just \u0022this\u0022 you instead ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlt is the best key you never knew did anything!"}]}
