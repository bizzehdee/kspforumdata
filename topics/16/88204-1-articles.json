Put the decoupler just below the second engine and put it\u0027s stage icon in a second stage. Radial decouplers push pieces outward from the sides. This is good for SRB\u0027s if you imagine the NASA Shuttle, but it\u0027s not restricted to just SRB\u0027s (nor is it required that your SRB\u0027s be radial)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing, there is another item called a separator, this disconnects from both sides while decouplers only disconnect from one side and stay attached to the other (typically they stay attached to the stage being dropped).

If you overheat an SRB (Solid Rocket Booster), it explodes, so if you deliberately design your rocket so that you can overheat RT-10s the moment before they run out of fuel, you can eliminate the weight associated with them. One of Scott Manley\u0027s videos features this. For now, though, I would suggest sticking with regular decoupling: it\u0027s not too hard to get a suborbital or maybe even orbital flight without decoupling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe sure to abuse science: get a crew report on the launch pad, EVA and get a report \u0022flying\u0022 over the coast, get another crew report shortly after liftoff, get a crew and EVA report from upper atmosphere, get a crew report from space and as many EVA reports from over different biomes as possible, and do as much as you can on re-entry. Remember that, with starter tech, the only way to regenerate electricity is by firing rockets, so there\u0027s a limit to how much you can transmit after you finish getting to orbit. Different EVA reports can just be stored infinitely, crew reports take 30 electricity to transmit if I remember right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T14:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
