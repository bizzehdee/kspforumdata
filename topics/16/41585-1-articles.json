I tried to dock a shielded clamp-o-tron to, I\u0027d guess you call it the male-end of, a standard clamp-o-tron.

So I tried using RCS to reduce the acceleration from the magnet and finally got it to stabilize, but it never considered itself logically docked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I screw myself by not orienting my docking ports correctly on my station? Or is this a manifestation of the docking bug that requires a save file fix? I only seem to have one docking node in my quicksave, which is in state \u0027Acquire\u0027. Checking it to \u0027ready\u0027 and \u0027docked\u0027 just resulted in my shielded clamp-o-tron being permanently locked close with no way for me to open it. Although both the ships I\u0027m trying to dock with have multi-nodes with four docking ports on them, each. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/594759049875043741/E893531A17EE5D8A83FE732CE4A89610998452B5/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is greatly appreciated.
