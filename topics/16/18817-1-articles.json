([Mech]Jeb Controlled Orbiter) into a 600KM circular orbit around the planet. It was originally at 180degres, but now it at something like 45. Well I then created the \u0022Orbital Retrieval .5\u0022 and wanted to see if I could go retrieve it. Now even if I fail at getting it in my clamp thing, I still want to get right up next to it, and our orbits cross at the North and south poles. We do not meet at the same time, how do I go about shifting my orbit to match it using the MechJeb? And once I do that, is it just a waiting game until we meet, then I can try to capture it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94666991\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy Orbital Retrieval .5, being auto-piloted by MechJeb, with Jeb riding shotgun.

The J.C.O. would be at 90degrees and I\u0027d be off a few. Eventually I burned though too much fuel meaning I couldn\u0027t get home so I ended the flight and deorbited the J.C.O. and let it crash into the sea at 60m/s (Was able to slow down to that using a little fuel I had left and my RCS thrusters) but it was my first try. Trying to land on the Mun now, will try again later. Thanks though!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
