I\u0027m trying to get a station, that is fairly static, and my station is pretty hefty, with each modular component weighing in at anywhere from 25-50t each, and I\u0027ll have upto 4 docked. This gives each of my space stations anywhere from 100 to 200t in mass, and a tiny little 20t shuttle that misses it\u0027s docking approach at 0.1-0.5m/s sends the whole array into a tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI keep the main \u0022hub\u0022 of the station with SAS turned on, but so far just prior to docking a new portion, I turn the SAS off for each new piece, so the only SAS being operated is from the station command point. Is this the right thing to do, should I only have SAS turned on for sub pieces, turned off for everything, turned on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T05:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, turning off all SAS is usually the forum answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, however, I find it depends a lot on the size of the elements being docked and how far off axis you come in. Generally I leave the target\u0027s SAS on (usually the station) and turn off the SAS for whatever is docking. I usually turn it off at the last minute though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the docking craft is small, I might actually leave it on so the force of the port doesn\u0027t send it flinging off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s heavy and I came in off axis, I might turn it back on briefly as the parts align to stop/slow any more rotation or movement. Realize though that this can lead to port misalignment, so use it sparingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, maybe not the answer you\u0027re looking for but that is (in general) what I do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should also say it depends on the station. Some stations perform poorly when bumped with SAS on. So if you are getting a lot of flex and the torque modules are bouncing around, you may want to turn it off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T05:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKeep SAS turned on on both ships until the magnetism starts pulling ports together.
