It works, but the only problem is that the wings are constantly wobbling when flying. I had hoped that rigid attachment and auto strut would solve the issue, but sadly it didn\u0027t.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know a way to solve this problem? Perhaps a mod or something that could fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still fairly new to the game (and to the forums!) so any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-22T00:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi. I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re using hinges. Have you tried assigning an action group key to toggle locking the hinges? Locking allows autostruts to pass through robotic parts. When unlocked, autostruts terminate at robotic parts. And when locked you might find you don\u0027t need autostruts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
