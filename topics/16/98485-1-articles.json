Usually magical ever-lasting SAS does the job for my craft. I do use RCS for a craft that has to dock and also for shifting big craft about, usually in LKO when I have big engines and tanks still attached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut recently I haven\u0027t bothered with RCS tanks - I just slam some Vernor Engines on the craft and its all good. No need for extra RCS tanks that add to the part count and mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would I use traditional RCS tanks and thrusters?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zuqq","CreatedById":133985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T19:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use RCS vs. Vernors as I feel the RCS gives me better fine control. As well as 1 RCS port is able to fire in 5 directions where I believe the vernor can only fire in 1 direction. So you would need 5 Vernor engines to give you the same attitude control I can obtain with 1 well placed RCS port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find Vernors are especially overkill unless you have a very large ship you are trying to move around. But the beauty of the game is that if you find vernors work for you and RCS thrusters are useless, go for it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T19:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried a 4 vernor engine station tender (offset with rotation control from SAS to half the number or thrusters needed).

That, combined with the more part-count efficient 4-way RCS thrusters, make monoprop-powered RCS systems desirable in many scenarios. And once you\u0027ve got small craft that use MP for docking, it becomes useful to carry monoprop tankage on motherships to replenish them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
