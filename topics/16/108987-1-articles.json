I haven\u0027t actually worked it out or tracked it very closely, though.\n\nAs the previous poster suggested, you want to have a decent ascent angle when you switch to rockets. 30degrees is my target, also. Spending too long below 40km (and especially below 30km) can result in considerable drag losses that are very expensive in terms of dV."},{"CreatedByName":"Olterin","CreatedById":116073,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:05:27Z","Content":"As the two posters above me said, you should aim for a (25-)30 degree climb by 20 km altitude. My latest ascent profile was somewhat like: go up to 10km while going at roughly mach 2, begin final ascent, go full throttle at 12-13km, switch to rockets when jets cut out. This leads to some overheating issues if the spaceplane isn\u0027t carefully designed though, but it worked for me. Final jet velocity was about 1350 m/s, from there I think I used around 1200 m/s to get a final circular orbit at 80km altitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:07:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Part of it might be your flight profile, too.

I\u0027ll go for a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 climb until 20km when the rapiers cut out, then I\u0027ll pitch up to ~20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and at 35km altitude I\u0027ll pitch down again (to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). Then I\u0027ll reduce throttle on the way so the apogee is never more than 1 minute in front of me. That\u0027s much more efficient...\n\nBasically I\u0027ll pitch up never more than 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (except for the sub-sonic part of the lower atmosphere but that doesn\u0027t really matter). And I\u0027ll make a very long low power burn \u0027towards the horizon\u0027 until apogee is 70km. Then circularisation is hardly required.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T15:09:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris\\_2**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T01:53:20Z","Content":"Oh ...., I did it! I finally did it! I got my little space plane into 100km orbit!\n\nI kept tweaking and retweaking my design and never understood what I was doing wrong, but the answer was all along in how I was flying it, not my design. I kept flying at a very shallow angle, no more than 10 degrees, and pushing the jets out until they completely cut out at about 25km, then hitting my rockets and that would never work.\n\nThis time I climbed at 25-30 degrees from the beginning, and hit the rockets as soon as my velocity from the jets dipped below 1,000m/s, and it worked! \\o/\n\nNow to see if this thing can land...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T01:57:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by guitarxe**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:23:38Z","Content":"... no, it couldn\u0027t land because the air intakes melted off during what I thought was a very shallow re-entry.\n\nTime to put some airbrakes on."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:49:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... no, it couldn\u0027t land because the air intakes melted off during what I thought was a very shallow re-entry.\n\u003E Time to put some airbrakes on.\n\n20km periapsis tends to be a failsafe reentry height.
