At some point designs that previously flew with no problems started having issues with un-commanded throttling. I am using MechJeb on the crafts but I am not using it during the ascent. I engage SAS and set the throttle to 100% before launch.\n\nCraft 1 has liquid fuel main stage and SRBs. During the ascent the main engine operates normally at first and then just throttles down. I can hold the shift key and throttles back up but then immediately throttles back down again. I press shift again and the same thing happens, after that it just stays down. At staging the throttle comes back up again and remains at 100%.\n\nCraft 2 has LF main stage and LF boosters. This one just sits on the launch pad with the engines sputtering (rapidly oscillating between 0 and 50% throttle) after 30 sec or so it starts operating normally and lifts off. (Note this design previously flew properly and has a TWR of over 1 so its not a question of TWR \u003C1). During the subsequent ascent it seems to run normally.\n\nFor each of the above the issue happens the same way every time I try to launch.\n\nEdited to add: Upper stages all seem to fly normally.\n\nI tried making a quick test example from scratch today (2 stage rocket with a Mainsail and 4 large stock SRBs (Kickbacks iirc) as the first stage) and that flew as expected.\n\nI replaced the first stage on Craft 1 above and it still had the throttle down problem, but it manifested differently than before. This time it even throttles down after SRB staging and then spontaneously throttles back up.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this?\n\nAround the time this issue started I installed the NavyFish docking indicator but I don\u0027t think it happened right after that but I can\u0027t be certain. Removing that mod didn\u0027t fix anything (and I doubt it had anything to do with it but who knows).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T02:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 02:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlammo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T02:09:11Z","Content":"Check Mechjeb\u0027s Ascent Guidance tab.
