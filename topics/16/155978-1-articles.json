In Semi-direct approach, you split the lander into two, one contain lab only and the other Habitat only. In either case, no mothership involve. The Earth return Vehcile would launch first, use the IRSU to generate fuel, then once it\u0027s ready (coincide with the closest window) the lander(s) would be launch and land on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince Kerbals doesn\u0027t really need a mothership in orbit, unless one want to generate all the science using a lab while en-route between Eve and Kerbin, I think it\u0027s definitely do able -- it\u0027s just the matter of staging and the thrust of ERV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
