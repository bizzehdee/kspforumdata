This happens when a part is behind the business end of the rocket or jet. Destroying parts with 6 or 8 sepratron motors could be a problem. As for re-downloading the game if you have already bought it there is no need to worry it wont cost you anything more. The only mod i could think of which might increase this effect is Deadly Reentry but its been ages since i last used it i wouldn\u0027t really know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cal\u0026#039;Mihe","CreatedById":65567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T10:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamage from exhaust also heats up the parts in question, which might cause a part to overheat or melt, thereby leading to !!FUN!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Euel","CreatedById":74093,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T11:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the the help!
