However, I recently discovered that, using only starter parts, I can easily build a rocket that will get into LKO and even have enough fuel to deorbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rocket consists of a command pod, a parachute, 10 or 11 FL-T200 tanks and an LV-T30. As long as I fly an efficient, nicely curved flight path, I can get apoapsis above 70km, cruise up there and make final insertion. I\u0027ve gotten into a nice circular 130km orbit, then deorbited and carefully reenter using the engine and fuel tanks as (exploding) heat shields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t seem right to me for some reason. I feel I should at least have to have two stages for a successful orbit, unless I have some really advanced engines. Could it be FAR or DR or some other mod? I use those two, plus visual enhancements, chatterer and TAC life support. Or is that just how KSP is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hesistant to start messing with the real solar system mod, cause it seems to require the whole realism overhaul to really work right. Anyone know if I can use RSS without the extra mods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-10T23:31:52Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2014 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NFunky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T22:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFar lowerers the amount of dV required for orbit to about 3200 m/s, if you want to up the difficulty again I suggest \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52882-0-25-Kerbal-Isp-Difficulty-Scaler-v1-4-1-10-7-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKIDS\u003C/a\u003E or you could try the 1/10th RSS config (Which will change your solar system to the real one, while keeping the same stock size, atmosphere goes up to 130km.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is entirely possible to use RSS without the overhaul, just use the 1/10th config (There is a link to it in the RSS OP)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T22:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei agree that KIDS is the way to go if you want to return the game to stock behaviour, and if you don\u0027t want all of the features it offers it supports custom profiles to change the Isp behavior to whatever you think is reasonable for your game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T23:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.

Normally RSS transforms the solar system into the Real Solar System (hence the name of the mod) with appropriately sized planets. The 1/10th config gives you the real solar system, but at Kerbal sizes, what changes the amount of dV needed is the extra atmosphere, it ends at 130km instead of the normal 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T17:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.
