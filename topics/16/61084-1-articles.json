Having to return to the space center, return to the mission selection window and then finally to the main menu. I\u0027d prefer being able to shut down KSP from the pause menu during gameplay. As reference Civilization 5 allows you to shut down the game straight to desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T18:51:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClose the window?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T18:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66904-Exit-the-game-from-anywhere\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethis thread\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
