Lift is generated by jamming the roll axis clockwise. I added some ion engines to give it some non-aerodynamic thrust, in the faint hope that I can somehow eventually skate this thing into orbit. It gets off the ground pretty easily without using the ion engines, but this version still doesn\u0027t fly very well. It starts off OK, but then it starts to want to process more and more as it spins faster, and eventually it gets really hard to keep it in control. I have nonetheless gotten it up to over 8000m, at which point it seems to be both spinning faster and accelerating upwards. I think if I put the tail fins from the rotor near the bottom instead of where they are its behavior will improve significantly, but it\u0027s obviously still a WIP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m sure somebody out there has made one of these already, and I\u0027d love to see it. Has anybody ever gotten to orbit this way? I will gladly give rep for images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, it occurs to me that if you were to attach control surfaces both to each other and to a massless strut framework in the right way, you might be able to \u0022flap\u0022 by pitching up and down and thus generate lift and thrust.

The reaction wheel copter concept OTOH seems to work even without any control surfaces, so it doesn\u0027t actually seem so much like a physics exploit to me so long as you omit them.
