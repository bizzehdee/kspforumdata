The only way is from the recover button when focused on the object. The option comes up, and I click on it, but the window stays open and the debris is still there. It doesn\u0027t happen every time, but most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a huge deal, but I jettison most of my upper stages before they reach orbit to avoid debris buildup, and then \u0022cheat\u0022 by deleting them instead of focusing on each one and waiting for it to reenter.
