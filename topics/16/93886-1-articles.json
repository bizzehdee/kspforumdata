If the prograde marker is too far below your attitude marker, then you\u0027re getting a high angle of attack and you need more wing surface area. If you are having difficulty pointing the nose up, you need more control surfaces (such as AV-R8 or Elevon).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have a plane with enough wing surface and control surface, you can come in for an easy landing. Don\u0027t start too high, just get yourself under 1km from the ground on a somewhat steep trajectory, and pull up as you get close to the ground. The extra speed actually makes it easier to pull up. Now try to level out. Watch your prograde marker. You are level when your prograde marker sits on the horizon on the navball. To land, just nose down a bit and let the prograde marker dip a little under the horizon. You\u0027ll see your altitude begin to drop, and the ground begin to get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your plane is controllable enough, you can turn off your engines completely during landing. This is a good way to make the landing at as low velocity as possible. You want to land ideally under 100m/s and preferably as low as 50m/s if you can manage that. Turn off your engines and allow your plane to slow down, then verify that you can still bring your prograde marker significantly above the horizon if you wanted to. As you slow down, you lose control gradually. If you need to, turn on your engines a bit. Eventually, as the ground gets really close, you want to be hovering over it, very slowly losing altitude. You should see the shadow of the plane glide smoothly under you, and in a perfect landing the shadow will shimmy up and gently kiss the underside of your plane. Immediately throttle all the way down (if you haven\u0027t already) and start braking intermittently (hotkey: \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E.

Send the kerbal occupant out on EVA, and have him trot west directly along the runway centerline. Keep going into the grass past the end of the runway, being careful to stay lined up with the center of the runway. Stop to take an EVA report every now and again, and if it says \u0022Runway\u0022, keep going. Once the EVA report says \u0022at KSC\u0022 rather than \u0022on runway\u0022, stop and plant a flag. Name it \u0022East End Runway\u0022. Recover the kerbal and the pod. (It\u0027s necessary to put the flag on \u0022KSC\u0022 ground rather than \u0022runway\u0022 ground because anything on the runway-proper will be deleted when you launch your next airplane...and you don\u0027t want to have to place a new flag at the beginning of every flight.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can now target that flag. The runway runs directly east-west, so your goal for a successful landing is to get the flag target marker, your direction marker, and your prograde marker ALL aligned directly on the 90 deg \u0022East\u0022 line on your navball. The target marker will be lowest, the prograde velocity marker should be above it but below the horizon, and the nose of your plane will be higher than the velocity marker (it may be above or below the horizon, depending on your speed and the characteristics of your airplane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the stock soupmosphere, not FAR, so everything from here on out should be taken with a large grain of salt, but I have found success with a glide slope of 10-to-1. Which means 1 meter drop for every 10 meters forward--which you can arrange by trying to keep your altitude at 1/10 the distance to the flag marker. So when the flag is 25km away, you should be at 2500m altitude. Those numbers may have to change with FAR (and again, depending on the characteristics of your plane), but the basic technique stays the same: come in on a set glide slope from way the heck out at the mountains (if you aren\u0027t dodging the Matterhorn while lining up, you aren\u0027t far enough out for a good practice run!), and keep that glide slope by targeting altitude to equal some set fraction of the range (I like 10-to-1 because it works for me, and because there\u0027s no math involved: if the range reads 16.7, I want to be around altitude 167(something), and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake course corrections often, early, and TINY. Make your corrections on the basis of \u0022the 90-degree line intersects the dot in the middle of the target marker slightly to the left of center\u0022, not \u0022the 90 degree line is off to the left of the dot\u0022. Last-minute adjustments to heading, especially, are a Bad Idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do all this right, you\u0027ll need to nose up *a little bit* just before reaching the flag, and you should overshoot the flag (especially important in the Level 3 fully-improved runway, which is elevated above the surrounding terrain) and settle down onto the runway with nose slightly up so the main gear touches down first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs already stated, the ground in front of or on either side of the runway is just as flat as the runway itself--and because it\u0027s so expansive, it\u0027s actually easier to land on. There\u0027s no shame in that. (Several folks in other threads have noted that the grassy grounds of KSC are actually FLATTER than the crappy rutted-and-potholed starter runway in the beginning of 0.90 Career; I\u0027ll note that if you have a fully-improved Level 3 runway, landing on the SLOPE at the runway edge is doable but hazardous, and it can be tricky climbing up onto it for recovery on the runway after landing in the grass.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut mostly, it\u0027s all about the practice. Keep at it, and before you know it you\u0027ll be landing in box canyons in the mountains to do ground survey contracts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T23:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Srpadget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Srpadget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Launch\u0022 a \u0022plane\u0022 on the runway that consists of nothing but a Mk 1 pod.

They use the power in case that something gone wrong and they can\u0027t land then they have enough power to pull up and circle back. If you check especially how a fighter jet lands on a carrier : 50% throttle while landing , when the pilot feels that he touched the ship they throttle up to 100% in case they missed the cables they can pull-up without any problem. Also real plane engines have a function called \u0022 thrust reverse\u0022 basically the engine exhaust is reversed to the front so the engine will push the plane backwards helping to break down and take the huge amount of breaking stress away from the gears.
