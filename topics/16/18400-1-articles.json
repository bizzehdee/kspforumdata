I mean, I play BF3 on high settings with an average 40FPS\u002B, but on KSP, fly a ship that\u0027s barely capable of reaching the moon, and you\u0027ll be getting a slideshow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is KSP has to do LOTS of calculations to figure out gravity, drag, mass, trajectory, how parts interact, collisions, landscape, etc. There\u0027s a lot to do. But the problem is that KSP is on the Unity engine, which unfortunately is single-threaded. I mean, my computer has two processors, each with four cores and then hyperthreading to boot (doubles the possible threads). Because of how much sheer power it can output through all the cores, it lowers its single thread use. I go from having 36.62GHz of max processing power to just a wimpy 2.27. There is no fix. SQUAD legally can\u0027t upgrade Unity to being multi-threaded. So I highly doubt you found a cure-all situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T05:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to run KSP.exe, dont doubleklick on the icon.
