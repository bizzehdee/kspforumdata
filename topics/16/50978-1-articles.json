My first design was like a four legged tube. On the rocket it would be upright(the legs/landing struts facing horizontal), but on the Mun it would be the way it\u0027s supposed to be, standing up(the struts facing vertical, standing). The problem is I can\u0027t figure out how to get it from the vertical position, to standing on the surface of the Mun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture link, the ship on the right-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://rakshasa.no/downloads/ksp/mystery_08.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mystery_08.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T14:43:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by A1catraz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T02:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA1catraz,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done two techniques to solve this problem: Jettisonable descent pods or skycranes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one, which I don\u0027t recommend, is to mount on the top and bottom of the module an engine/rcs control pods. I say top and bottom to reference the vertical stack at launch. When you begin your descent to the Mun surface, with the module horizontal, the engine/rcs \u0022pods\u0022 will be on each end. After touching down, I pushed one of the grouped action buttons to jettison the descent pods. It\u0027s simpler to design and execute, but it leaves debris scattered all around your projected colony site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe configuration of the descent pods will be up to you, but mine included small rocket/mono tanks, rockets, RCS thrusters, and used the small solid rocket boosters to separate during jettison. If your module doesn\u0027t have a control pod/probe core, you\u0027ll need to mount one of those to at least one of the descent pods as well. One more tip: I mounted the descent pods to each module end with docking modules instead of decouplers for two reasons. Due to the low gravity of moons, I wasn\u0027t sure what kind of decoupler force effects would have on my module...the last thing I wanted to do was tip it on it\u0027s side after placing it on the surface. The other reason is that you now have two docking ports on each side of the module to assemble follow-on modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second, and seemingly most popular technique, that I recommand using is the \u0022skycrane\u0022 concept. If you search the spacecraft exchange section for skycranes you\u0027ll find an endless supply of examples. Basically a lander designed to carry a payload below it, hover over the surface, drop it, and then ascend back into orbit (or land nearby, or crash, whatever). The good thing about this approach is that (if you design the skycrane properly) you can accurately place the module next to others, and then ascend and grab others to bring down. It can be tricky in the fact that you will need to be fairly proficient at rendezvous and docking, and hovering over a zero-atmosphere body (unless you use MechJeb). One more thing to remember: whatever you use as the connection point (ie docking ports are what most people use), it needs to be placed over the center of gravity of your payload. Otherwise the payload will be dragging one side of your skycrane down the entire descent, using all your RCS fuel just to maintain attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a little while, I\u0027ll post some pictures of each that I built as a concept. My KSP computer isn\u0027t what I\u0027m using to type this, so I\u0027ll have to get the screenshots from that. But hopefully this can get your gears turning about how you want to approach this problem. Great thing about KSP, people come up with all kinds of ways to solve problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T02:48:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe method I used was to attach small engines to each end of my lander and attached a detachable probe core to the part I wanted facing up.

On the bottom I used a large fuel tank with radial landing engines. The smaller legs sat really nicely on the ground and nothing broke. So if you make a base with landing engines, make sure it can leave the ground or at least hover on Kerban before you take it anywhere else. If you\u0027re trying to make a tube base like the one in the picture, then you build the entire base vertically and then flip it horizontally when you put the legs on. Alternatively you can build your base in the space plane hangar and then save it as a sub-assembly and import it into the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/1046252431431405359/0E0D977D4546E4A35EACA5A5AB468CAE059B0291/\u0022 alt=\u00220E0D977D4546E4A35EACA5A5AB468CAE059B0291\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T14:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit your first post and up near where you can change the title, you can change the tag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T14:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am confused, because you seem to have a picture of the ship in the deployed position, so you\u0027ve done it once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed my base vertically, with a lander stage underneath.
