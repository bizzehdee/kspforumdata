I\u0027ve noticed some pretty large variations in what the calculator tells me, and what my actual orbit is. If I input altitude and velocity at apogee, errors of 500\u002B m in altitude between what the calculator thinks my perigee should be and what it actually is are not uncommon (this is for a pretty nearly circular orbit around 45-50k). Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a known reason why I would be consistently getting \u0027off\u0027 results?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the calculator, I tried to do a Hohmann transfer from 60k to about 40k. I plugged in the values and got my deltas, did the first burn at apogee... did my second burn at 180 degrees around the planet... and watched my goal altitude go screaming past as my kerbonauts plummeted into the atmosphere. When you guys do Hohmann transfers, do you do your second burn when you reach your goal altitude or before it? It would seem like you\u0027d have to burn before you got there, because the ship is going to have some inertia from the descent it has to bleed off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: inconsistencies between the calculator output and my results. Wondering if other people see the same, and what I can do to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-04T19:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe calculator consistently outputs orbital velocities that are too low; I\u0027ve noticed this as well.
