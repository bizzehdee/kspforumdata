I have a rocket at Kerbal Space Center ready to launch, But I\u0027m trying to figure out how to launch my rocket so that, upon stabilizing my orbit, I\u0027m as close to the other ship as possible. So basically a launch-to-rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some sort of way to figure this out? I mean, I know the speed required to obtain a circular orbit at 100km, and I have mechjeb on both ships, so I was thinking that maybe there\u0027s a way mechjeb could assist in this process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have any tips or have an equation to model this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m wondering is I\u0027m going to be sending an orbital construction yard up, but instead of having my astronauts go up with the construction yard, I have a very simple rocket take them up to rendezvous with the yard, they then get in the constructed vehicle and fly off to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll help is greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Dan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T18:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dumb but simple way is to just quicksave, launch to orbit and time it, then do a little math to figure how far your target\u0027s orbit will have carried it in that time.
