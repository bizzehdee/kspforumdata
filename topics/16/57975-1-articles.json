After a successful landing, I dropped my kerbal onto the pink giant to gather some info and samples, as I believe to be the norm after an interplanetary flight. I plant my flag and grab some soil, and then make a jump for my crew hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to have forgotten the effects of a high gravity and air density planet include little jumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone got any idea how I can tip over my ship on foot? It\u0027s not got any unmanned-control or anything... I can load my quicksave from Apoapsis on decent but I still think tipping the ship over might be a tad difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - to those of you who haven\u0027t found it, don\u0027t know, and suck as much as me, the IIIGACFKSP is a great little tool, requiring you to get yourself into a relatively stable orbit and put in your altitude to the nearest km, then input the body you\u0027re orbiting and a destination, and it\u0027ll show you when to start burning, what speed to burn to, and what angle to burn at - if I was a little bit more accurate with a protractor, I could have made a jump without burning from Kerbin to Eve, but I am not, and I also decided I should burn out the descending nodes and such to line the orbits up nicely. Anyway, give it a shot if you\u0027re still struggling on the less erratic planets\u0027 landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
