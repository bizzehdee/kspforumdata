Since when you launch a rocket that has parts that have clipped through the floor, it automatically sets the lowest parts at ground level, could you potentially build a rocket that has a sort of tail of structural parts that have been stacked so far the top part, the actual rocket starts in space? I doubt it does work, and if it does I doubt any standard computer wouldn\u0027t crash from trying to figure out that many parts, but if you could potentially do it, there would be a lot of things you could do with it. Especially since Saved parts are coming. It could just be a universal launch platform called \u0022The Tower of Babel\u0022 that automatically puts massive rockets into orbit, completely negating the need for atmospheric escape.
