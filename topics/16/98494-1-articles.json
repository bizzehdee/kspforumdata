Specifically, how do I bind keys to parts that are from mods? If you still don\u0027t understand my question, take BDArmory for an example. I\u0027ve seen many youtubers use it and fire the weapons without the need to right click on one of the guns or missles and fire it from there. Or in B9 Aerospace when you have a cargo bay, how do you bind a key to that so when you press it, you close/open the cargo bay without needing to right click and close/open from there? Screenshots or videos will be much appreciated!
