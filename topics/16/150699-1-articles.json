For example, remember how the LV-T engine series is always worse stats-wise than later Rockomax and Kerbodyne series, even taking size into account, just because they come so early in the progression? Now you could put a PartUpgrade into a later node that buffs the LV-T\u0027s to the same standard as the later engines. One PartUpgrade can affect one or multiple parts, and a part can have one or multiple PartUpgrades (or none, of course). They can even change the role of a part completely. For example, I have played with the thought of writing my own PartUpgrade that turns the Flea \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E into a solid upper stage motor with less thrust and better vacuum Isp, but worse sea level Isp. So halfway through the tech tree (depending on where I put it), the thing suddenly becomes useful for a completely new use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe system doesn\u0027t seem fully finished yet - for example, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E part info cannot display updated stats, you can only see them by adding the part to a spacecraft and then using the rightclick menu on that part. But it\u0027s technically functional, and it works off of the same ConfigNode syntax as all other part configs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T20:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
