The only wing overlapping was what was necessary to get the wing shape I wanted; 95% of the wing surface is single layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane is essentially built like a tuning fork; despite appearances, the only thing connecting the back of it together is a lot of struts. The main inspiration was in realising that a pair of rotated type 2 fuselages would make a pretty decent open-air cargo bay. There\u0027s no roof or floor to it, which is handy as a lot of cargo loads protrude above and below. Cargo is secured via a docking port at the front of the bay and a mesh of struts coming from radial decouplers along the sides of the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower is a pair of turbojets plus four RAPIERs.

There\u0027s an abort system, emergency brakes for short runways, and enough spare weight capacity that adding further luxuries is no problem.
