Go to your installation folder, open the saves folder, make a new folder that you name race or whatever you like. Then copy the sfs file from the zip into the new folder and rename it persistent.sfs. Or make a new game from within the game, copy the sfs file into its folder and rename it to quicksave.sfs to load it as a quicksave. Loading it from an existing game will most likely overwrite any progress you made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T16:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you found Scott Manley\u0027s air race video.
