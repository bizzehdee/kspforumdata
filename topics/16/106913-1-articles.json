So in career mode i was given a contract to put a base station on the surface of minmus. The problem I\u0027m having is that I have no clue how i\u0027m supposed to do that, and put wheels on it. One of the requirements is that it be on wheels and the only powered wheels would cause massive drag and instability. and since i don\u0027t have KAS i can\u0027t attach them on later. I thought about using plane wheels (like landing gear) but the problem again is that its not powered and it has to be as i have to land 3 seperate modules then link them togeather (requires 12 kerbals on the base @\\_@). another problem ill get to later is TACLS but im not too concerned about that for now. any thoughts on how to get these beasts onto minmus?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T20:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ackley14**"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:21:33Z","Content":"Wrap the base in a fairing until you\u0027re at ~40km or so ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).
