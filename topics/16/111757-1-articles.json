It gains a massive torque and completely flies apart. Usually leaving the probe and parachute flying off at a constant speed away from Kerbin.\n\nHere is the craft: [http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=07989745302126851392](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=07989745302126851392)\n\nVideo coming soon.\n\nThanks in advance.

Of course, why hadn\u0027t I done that? Thanks!\n\n\u003E Fuel cell is unnecessary unless you plan on retrieving parts from, say, Jool.\n\nWell it\u0027s a probe spacecraft and I sometimes run out of power behind bodies like Kerbin. Maybe I should just add a battery, but I also wanted to try the fuel cell out for the first time.\n\n\u003E Action groups? For e.g. solar panels?\n\nI\u0027ve had problems with this. Often I make the action group and then in flight it only moves one panel. I\u0027d stopped caring :/\n\n\u003E You dump the Poodle but not the X200-16 fuel tank it feeds from?\n\nThis is because a heat shield is above it, and I can recover the tank \u002B fuel if not used (funds! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\n\u003E Sepratrons can lose two-thirds of their fuel.\n\nDefinitely, I keep forgetting to change this.\n\n\u003E I think you\u0027re short on parachutes. Maybe stow the probe core inside the cargo bay (beside the Klaw) and replace the sub-1.25m stuff with a Mk16-XL?\n\nI know I\u0027m a little short on parachutes, I another 4 would be safe, this configuration was new - they all used to be at the top - so I was guessing (badly).\n\n\u003E No torque, reliant on RCS for attitude control.\n\nI find reaction wheels unrealistic except for small probes.\n\n\u003E Mainsail stage has a little too much fuel if it\u0027s discarded just before LKO. Maybe lose the X200-16 and move its fuel to the Poodle stage (using the Mk3-to-2.5m adapter tanks).\n\nNot really, if it helps me get to the Mun then why not?\n\n\u003E You could just not timewarp? It seems to not fly apart until you actually timewarp, so don\u0027t do that, and fly your mission. Maybe it won\u0027t fly apart if you timewarp after you dump the Mainsail.\n\nDumping the Mainsail doesn\u0027t help, and I\u0027m going to the Mun, which takes many hours...\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u0022Have you tried turning it off and on again?\u0022\n\nSo I turned on KSP and it\u0027s happy again... hmmm."}]}
