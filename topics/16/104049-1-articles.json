I just just can\u0027t manage the thrust/mass in a right way. Don\u0027t get me wrong, symetric lander cans from the VAB are not the problem. I am talking about such ships like from the old sci-fi series \u0022Moonbase Alpha\u0022. I know there are crafts out there to use but i want to creatoe my own ships.\n\nIs there something in the stock game that helps with that? Or is there an easy to use mod that manages the thrust of the crafts engines to hover without crashing every ten seconds?\n\nThx.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T23:00:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Melcom**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:59:43Z","Content":"Gonna point you to DocMoriarty\u0027s [KSP Space Plane Construction and Operation](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation) Guide. It\u0027s a PDF file that goes over spaceplane design in general in stock atmo, and it includes an extensive section on the construction and operation of VTOLs. You might also consider a mod called RCS Build Aid; among the many wonderful things it does, it shows you how much and in what direction your CoM will shift as your fuel tanks drain, and the usefulness of such data oughta be obvious.\n\nShort version:\n\n\\* Basic Jets rule as VTOL vertical engines.\n\n\\* Set the CoT of your vertical engines about where you\u0027d want your CoL on a normal plane.\n\n\\* Lock the gimbals.\n\n\\* You can\u0027t have too much SAS."},{"CreatedByName":"Melcom","CreatedById":89393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T20:10:02Z","Content":"well, Thank you for that.

Otherwise the craft does not have the capability to counteract the torque reaction from the thrust being so far off the CoM. As per capi3101\u0027s suggestion, RCS Build Aid is a very helpful tool. It will tell you how much torque will be applied, and in which direction. From that you can see how many reaction wheels you\u0027ll need just to fight that torque..."},{"CreatedByName":"DavidBowman","CreatedById":111419,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T21:38:27Z","Content":"For mods, you should definitely try [Throttle Controlled Avionics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-2-2-0-0-90-Continued).
