Internally, the parachute is actually \u0022deactivated.\u0022\n\n- Active: After you right-click \u0026 deploy or stage the chute, it enters \u0022Active\u0022 state. The chute is now looking for atmospheric pressure greater than the selected \u0022Min Pressure\u0022 so it can semi-deploy.\n\n- Semi-Deployed: The parachute is semi-deployed and looking for an Above Ground Altitude less than the selected \u0022Altitide\u0022 so it can fully deploy.\n\n- Deployed: The parachute is fully deployed (maximum drag) and is waiting for landing with speeds less than the auto-cut speed, or splashdown.\n\n- Cut: This state is auto entered after the above touchdown conditions, or when user-selected.\n\nThere is a belief that Activated chutes (staged but not yet deployed) will burn up on reentry. I cannot find any evidence of this, and I believe it\u0027s actually that the Min Pressure setting selected is too low. When this happens, the chute moves to semi-deployed and is immediately ripped away or burned up. Putting the pressure up to 0.5 (on Kerbin) will offer the best chance for chute survival in this scenario.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T05:16:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No. That\u0027s not quite right.
