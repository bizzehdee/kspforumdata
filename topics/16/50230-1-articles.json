I bought this game about an hour ago and I started up my career mode.

Once you\u0027re on the landing pad you can for example right click on your command pod and take a crew report. It\u0027s worth some science points. You can either store the data in the pod (green button, only 1 per pod) or transmit it to KSC via an antenna (blue button). You can take Crew reports while ascending your rocket. And once your in space you should also go on EVA with your Kerman and take an EVA report. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s some science you can use to unlock new parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrozeNauts","CreatedById":89915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T16:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick reply \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I will try it out now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skbernard","CreatedById":67569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T16:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do lots of science just all around Kerbin - go to different environments on the planet, water, sandy shores, rocky mountains, polar ice caps, cold dry tundra and do science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Kerbal can get out, take a look around, review the environment then write a report on that.

Take your very first Command Pod, hit launch, get a crew report, do an EVA, get an EVA report, collect a soil sample (yes, right on the launch pad), get back in your ship and slide your mouse up to the top middle of the screen above the altimeter and hit Recover. That should give you enough to unlock another part. Do the same exact thing when you unlock the Goo pod. Also, if you put an antenna on the pod you can transmit a few times right on the launch pad so you maximize your science before you recover. Just make sure you collect another sample to return when you recover. Science is a constant, you never \u0027lose\u0027 science by transmitting, you\u0027re always just sending a little bit of the pot of science available at any spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrozeNauts","CreatedById":89915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T17:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have to properly land to gain the science?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T18:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FrozeNauts\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FrozeNauts\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you have to properly land to gain the science?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but this is very easy on Kerbin, just slap some chutes on it.
