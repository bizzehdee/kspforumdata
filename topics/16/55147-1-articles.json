You need about 12,000 m/s delta V to get to orbit from sea level, but only around 7,500 to make it from the tallest mountain. (For comparison, you need about 4,500 to get into orbit from kerbin.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, asparagus it all to hell, use aerospikes, and keep the payload as light as possible. One trick that many people use is instead of sending down a whole command pod, just send down a single kerbal on a chair, sitting on top of the smallest probe core. For my eve lander, the final stage was just the second smallest 1.25m tank and a rockomax 48-7s, with some batteries, a probe core, couple solar panels, and a kerbal. It was god for about 4,000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T04:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/577876279766665628/0E987822F6CB45BB16C7A685C56D56C8D36CA5A9/\u0022 alt=\u00220E987822F6CB45BB16C7A685C56D56C8D36CA5A9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what my lander looked like; managed to land it with completely full tanks at a good altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/577876279766692937/A177737658AE0B88AD045B4B240042D8969355DC/\u0022 alt=\u0022A177737658AE0B88AD045B4B240042D8969355DC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s the last stage that I was talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T06:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found it easy to build a lander having 10k dV but adding last 2k is a challenge.
