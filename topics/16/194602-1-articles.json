However, i\u0027ve found a new spot on flat biome which is 28\u00B04\u00278\u0027\u0027N with an ore concentration of 11.47%. My obital station is on a 0\u00B0 inclinaion so it\u0027s easier in average for returning the fuel back on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. is it worth it to move my mining rig up north ot the greater concentration considering the amount of fuel that i will loose when Rendez-vous in orbit with my minmus station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-09T22:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, no. A mining rig anywhere except Kerbin will always end up producing more fuel than you actually need (or can use) at that location. Ore concentration really makes no practical difference. Storage and transport are the bottlenecks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirius123","CreatedById":159683,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-09T22:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok Thanks for the quick answer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
