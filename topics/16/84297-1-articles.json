The Bernoulli\u0027s principle explanation is over-complicated and usually explained incorrectly. It is also not intuitive. Most people are coming to realize that it\u0027s much more simple to teach that wings produce lift by pushing air down. So it is the angle of attack that creates the lift. A non-symmetrical wing, if angled so that its geometric average direction is parallel to the air flow (instead of the bottom surface) will also produce zero or almost no lift (maybe even negative lift).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, wings push air down, and so they get pushed up. Very, very simple, and it\u0027s a correct explanation of the forces at work. Whoever is responsible for mixing Bernoulli\u0027s principle into the explanation should be shot, as they left at least two generations of people not understanding how wings actually work. That included me, until I played enough flight sims (where the relationship between angle of attack and lift was made clear to me), and looked up enough resources, to realize that the Bernoulli explanation was bull!@#$.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo demonstrate how wings work, just stick your hand outside your window while driving your car fast. First, angle your hand so that it is directly into the wind. You\u0027ll feel no lift. Next, angle your hand upward, so that your hand pushes down some of the air streaming past. You\u0027ll feel your hand (rather strongly) being pushed up. Really, that\u0027s it. Lift is that simple. It\u0027s a travesty that they over-complicated it to the point that they did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and by the way, the reason that wings are curved and not flat isn\u0027t because of Bernoulli either.

When the chordline is horizontal, the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Lift involves action and reaction at the airfoil surface and is felt as a pressure difference. The airfoil shape and angle of attack work together so that the airfoil exerts a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton\u0027s third law, the air must then exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.[14][15] The force is exerted by the air as a pressure difference on the airfoil\u0027s surfaces.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last bit got me thinking, are Pecan and Velocity really saying the same thing -- that the vertical component of the action/reaction against the airfoil and air IS a pressure difference?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T04:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022godefroi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022godefroi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe \u0022wings just push air down\u0022 explanation is just as over-simplified and wrong as the \u0022bernoulli\u0027s principle makes airplanes fly\u0022 explanation.
