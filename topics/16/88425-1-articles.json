I\u0027m getting at best in the 5-10 FPS range. Once I put a few mods on I get max 5 FPS to the point where the game is unplayable. I\u0027ve turned down the settings to absolute minimum, installed ATM and the 60FPS cfg file. They\u0027ve helped somewhat but I can\u0027t get hire than 10FPS. MAYBE 15 every once in a while. My time is always yellow and running at 33% physics time. My computer is an older gen i7 with an HD Radeon 6370M with 4gb RAM (laptop) So two questions, is there anything more I can do to increase my FPS and performance in general? Or should I just get a new computer? If so, what specs? I\u0027m thinking of a new gen i core with an Nvidia graphics card and 8 or 16 gigs of RAM. Please any help is appreciated. I\u0027ve been addicted to Kerbal lately and I realize I could run unmodded and get barely tolerable performance, there are so many great mods I\u0027d like to run a dozen or so. I\u0027ve seen people with 70 plus so I know it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T00:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you run other games well?
