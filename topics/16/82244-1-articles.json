I recommend doing this. If you attach them to wings, use the attach option who\u0027s Icon looks like a circle. When attaching onto fuselage or fuel tanks use the hexagon Icon symbol. This should at most keep them at a straight angle. I\u0027ve had wobbly results doing it differently.

This might be it, or not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother tip is to use less powerful control surfaces, they tend to act more jerkier than SAS, so if u have a powerful control surface on a light plane, when the sas moves it a little, it will move a lot, then a lot more to compensate, then even more to compensate causing massive wobbles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is parts wobbling and moving. usually when u add two wings together, or fuel tank to a hardpoint then to a fuel tank.
