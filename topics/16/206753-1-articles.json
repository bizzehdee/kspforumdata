If the stock tracking station doesn\u0027t do this, the mod Tracking Station Evolved definitely does- as well as sorting by celestial body, craft type, mission duration and ordering by various parameters including name and MET, it also allows you to search for a specific craft name in the tracking station and go right to it. I\u0027m not entirely sure that it\u0027s working fully with KSP 1.12 due to the stock alarm banner covering up some of the TSE buttons, but on 1.11 and earlier it\u0027s a massive improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"modus","CreatedById":207631,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-04T22:24:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s working well on 1.12.
