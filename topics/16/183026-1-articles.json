Since you cannot actually go anywhere without the use of kinetic energy, there is no way to avoid it--even my wildly impractical exercise above is only an approximation that links kinetic energy changes to minuscule potential energy changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, I can no longer say with surety that you are right in your assumption--all I can say for certain is that your challenge is plagued by an ambiguous understanding of what the Oberth Effect is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-28T10:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223568335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183026\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553534293\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zhetaan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/25/2019 at 7:18 PM, Zhetaan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve thought some more about this, and the Oberth Effect is exactly that; it\u0027s an \u003Cem\u003Eeffect\u003C/em\u003E that naturally arises \u003Cstrong\u003Efrom the use of propulsive thrust\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really cool how you can also achieve the same thing in a car driving towards an uphill \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cem\u003E* Note:\u00A0People in said car did not understand why I got so excited at that same hilltop every time\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-28T12:31:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2019 12:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Blaarkies\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-29T06:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding Oberth effect in automobiles, I know it wasn\u0027t meant seriously,\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut it made\u00A0me think about the differences between automobiles and rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRockets are limited by the fact they have their own exhaust to push against.\u00A0Best efficiency means making the most of the exhaust, which means getting the highest exhaust velocity possible from the combustion.\u00A0 Then\u00A0thrust = (fuel-mass per second\u00A0\u00D7 exhaust velocity).\u00A0 To boost your orbit to the Moon, you need a given amount of energy = thrust \u00D7 distance.\u00A0 Firing the engine when moving quickly gets the needed thrust\u00D7distance in less time, so less fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutomobiles take full advantage of having the entire Earth as reaction mass.\u00A0 The engine has some maximum torque, but with a gearbox you can convert that to whatever propulsive force you need to accelerate.\u00A0 If we need more thrust to get up a hill, we downshift.\u00A0\u00A0Without the constraint on thrust per fuel-burn-rate, automobiles reach efficiencies limited by the energy in the fuel -- power per fuel-burn-rate.\u00A0 To get the energy to climb a hill, we need to run the engine for a certain time at its speed for best power per fuel-burn; we can do that in 5th gear when approaching the hill, or in 3rd gear while climbing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when driving through hills, the Oberth effect would let\u00A0me avoid downshifting, by accelerating sufficiently before each up-hill section, but that doesn\u0027t save me any fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
