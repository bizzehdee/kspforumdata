Your jet weighs way too much, use no more than 3 tanks -- I see nine. You also need to complete the line of Elevon control surfaces on the rear wing edges. Get rid of the delta wings with small control surfaces on your wing tips and replace them with a structural wing surface that will fit while keeping your CoL back -- add Elevons to that new surface. Get rid of the active control wings on the sides, near the engines -- move those to the front. They will give you the nose lift you need to get off the ground faster. Get rid of the goo canisters and material bays -- you\u0027ll never use them on Kerbin for contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother tip, get rid of those ISP difficulty mods.

Sounds like your gear mounted on your wings is causing them to flex upwards throwing your landing gear out of alignment and thus sending you off in a random direction. Also looks like you are going a bit to fast on take off. Most aircraft should be off the ground around 70-80m/s. If you are going faster than that you should look at the amount of wing your craft has vs the the mass of your craft. Check the FAR diagnostic charts see what they kick back, what are the numbers in it. What do the graph lines look like when you sweep the AoA and the Mach numbers.
