The 7:8 resonance will take less time, as you can release a satellite every 7/8ths of a geostationary orbit, instead of every 9/8ths. Note that the 9:8 resonance means you will be releasing satellites at perigee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth noting that real-world global navigation systems don\u0027t put their satellites into geostationary - instead, they\u0027ve got half-day orbital periods. Similarly, they\u0027re not in equatorial orbit - GPS has six orbits all at 55 degrees inclination, while GLONASS has three orbits at 64.8 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T23:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks! I didn\u0027t bother caluculating (drawing pretty pictures with circles) 9:8 after I saw 7:8 worked, but the inclinations hopefully will work.
