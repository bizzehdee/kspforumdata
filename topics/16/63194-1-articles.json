I like to build the rover in the SPH, because symmetry is keen, but then I can\u0027t load up the ship in the VAB to put it on a launch vehicle. Can someone help me not be stupid anymore?

You can keep your root part as long as it still has an exposed attachment point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to figure this out the hard way before I joined this forum and even learned what a root part was. When I first tried to build a pair of rovers to stick on the sides of a ship I did what most people would do: I started with a probe core, put girders on the front and back, wheels on the girders, slap on a seat, lights, batteries, and... Unable to save part as sub assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:bangs head on keyboard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... If you start with a probecore, and leave it as ether the \u0022nose\u0022 or \u0022tail\u0022 of your rover, and leave one side of it open, it will let you save it as a sub assembly. Stupid I know, but it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thescientist","CreatedById":69046,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T14:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use this mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768-0-23-Editor-Extensions-v0-6-5-Aug-%28EdTools-Editor-Tools-replacement%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768-0-23-Editor-Extensions-v0-6-5-Aug-%28EdTools-Editor-Tools-replacement%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressing Tab with this mod the editor switch between VAB and SPH simmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
