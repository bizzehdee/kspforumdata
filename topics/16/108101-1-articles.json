It allows you to extend the burn time of SRBs without changing thrust output. Just making SRB\u0027s longer would increase thrust because of how they work, but a fuel plug allows you to \u0022segment\u0022 them to maintain a more constant thrust rate while extending burn times.\n\nEDIT: ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:36:35Z","Content":"This also means thrust curves would be possible, similiar to the space shuttle just google thrust curve."},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:23:15Z","Content":"I was under the impression that this was related to the ability to choose the amount of fuel in the SRB, but maybe I\u0027m wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T23:58:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was under the impression that this was related to the ability to choose the amount of fuel in the SRB, but maybe I\u0027m wrong.\n\nSolid fuel in SRB\u0027s is already tweakable."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:08:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Solid fuel in SRB\u0027s is already tweakable.\n\nThat\u0027s probably a good compromise to limit part count."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:53:11Z","Content":"An SRB plug is the mold around which the solid fuel is cast inside the rocket casing.

I knew that SRBs had that shape on the inside for more surface area and a thrust curve, but I didn\u0027t know that that\u0027s what a SRB fuel plug was. So, how would this be implemented, and how would it affect gameplay? It sounds very complicated."},{"CreatedByName":"Zyffyr","CreatedById":138032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T22:42:52Z","Content":"I assume that the intent would be to allow you to set the \u0022Thrust Limiter\u0022 to multiple values based on percentage of fuel used.

IIRC the STS SRB\u0027s started with a star shaped core/combustion chamber, for the maximum surface area to burn (= max thrust). As it burned the shape became rounder, reducing the thrust as the vehicle became lighter."}]}
