Even then you can only have 4 tabs open. The problem is, when you press \u0022out\u0022 on the source tank it only transfers fuel to the other 3 selected tanks. For some reason you can\u0027t select the other tanks for transfer on console, it just replaces the source tanks tab so you can\u0027t get the fuel out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
