However it appears docking collars are a bit too wobbly for this and combined with the fact that the collars don\u0027t snap to position meant I ended up with an off center payload and an unflyable wobbly rocket. With several struts on it was rigid enough but pulled to one side and my plan to reattach the booster stage for the flight home made Jeb feel seasick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk 2 has a docking collar on the top of the nosecone and one on the side of the main tank, with the lander attatched to the booster by a normal decoupler ring.
