Microsoft Flight Simulator is not a realistic\u00A0flight sim (the procedures and ATC is, but actual flight simulation, not really). KSP is somewhat more realistic, because you can properly stall, and get into unrecoverable spins and all that fun stuff. The best way to fly aircraft is with a joystick, but WASD is still possible. One thing you have to unlearn from FSX (or whichever one you had), if you pull up really hard, you won\u0027t just go up: you\u0027ll stall, and go down/spin. You\u0027d have to do it gently. Now landing in KSP is kind of tricky, because you have to eyeball and figure out the proper landing speed. Sometimes you can be way off (and that\u0027s disastrous). Simply line up (which may not be that simple), keep your surface prograde vector at 3 degrees below the horizon because this is how approaches are done, you should have some angle of attack, not zero. If it\u0027s zero, you\u0027re going too fast. Adjust throttle to keep the prograde vector at 3 degrees, and pitch to control speed, while tweaking it slightly to make sure you\u0027re actually headed toward the threshold of the runway. When you\u0027re maybe 50 meters away from the runway, throttle down completely, and nosedown VERY SLIGHTLY so you don\u0027t stall. You don\u0027t want to nose down too hard, otherwise you\u0027ll hit nosewheel first, and hard (other people might not nose down, I do, because that\u0027s what I was taught in real life).\u00A0Flare before you touch down to smooth out. Apply brakes. Possibly spin because the wheels are weird.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSummary: 3 degree decent, pitch for speed and throttle for vertical speed,\u00A0throttle to idle when almost to the

\u00A0Gimbal is horribly implemented in KSP. \u00A0Instead of being a useful trimming tool, it\u0027s a ham-fisted, stability-destroying Hellspawn of zero practicality for any other atmospheric

speed, even with physical warp on\u00A0\u00A0(unless you just totally hosed the design by\u00A0misplacing\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of

fly, then you should be OK if only you can get slow enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding a KSP plane is all about making ground contact with a vertical speed \u0026lt;= 5 m/s and a horizontal speed \u0026lt;= 50 m\u0027/s. \u00A0It is, of course, possible to \u0022grease one on\u0022 at 200 m/s on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr

game where such silliness is possible. \u00A0Out in the field (on any planet with an atmosphere), there is no such thing as more than a couple hundred meters of ground at the same orientation before you hit a change of slope, so there\u0027s a premium on STOL performance. \u00A0This is not just not stalling at low speed but also being able to stop forward motion quickly once down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo kill\u00A0airspeed, the game gives you various tools. \u00A0There are the A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E. parts, reverse thrust (on only some engines, not all), drogue chutes, and HARD S-turning on final approach. \u00A0Back prior to 1.0, it was possible to apply opposite rudder and aileron and just lose altitude without gaining speed as you can with a real plane, but that no longer works very well since 1,.x.x.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main issue with getting slow is that KSP planes actually stall at about 1/2 the airspeed they need to ROG by themselves (assuming the plane has a slight nose-up attitude when sitting on its wheels). \u00A0There is no actual ground effect but it acts like there is one. \u00A0So if you left the ground at 70m/s, don\u0027t expect to stall until you reach 35m/s. \u00A0And because you\u0027ve got lots of torque and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr

drop vertically while maintaining the same attitude. \u00A0So the goal is, as in a real plane, to have the wheels hit just a hair before you reach stall speed, which usually means getting below ROG speed considerably short of the threshold, which means substantial braking is needed during the approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
