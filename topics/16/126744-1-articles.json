If you want to recover science from the surface of Minmus, you\u0027d use a probe. For science in orbit, you\u0027d use a satellite. You\u0027ve really only got 2 biomes in the space around Minmus (low \u0026amp; high), but they\u0027re very easy to do. A lander probe will give you the flexibility to hit all the biomes, but is more difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanic","CreatedById":149920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T01:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lander with a single FL-T 200 tank and lightweight science instruments (anything but materials bay) can visit all the biomes on Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chakat Firepaw","CreatedById":150121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T05:50:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbes and satellites can indeed get more science, provided you haven\u0027t \u0022mined out\u0022 the biomes in question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHowever\u003C/strong\u003E, note that they are probably going to be transmitting their results rather than returning them.\u00A0 For most experiments this means a far lower cap on how much science you can get, so you probably won\u0027t get anything from Minmus orbit even if R\u0026amp;D says that you don\u0027t have 100% yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you have unvisited biomes:\u00A0 Go ahead and send a probe to grab some more science from where you haven\u0027t been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you are in career mode, (as opposed to \u0027just\u0027 science mode), you should send a satellite to sit orbiting Minmus even though you probably won\u0027t get any science from it directly[1].\u00A0 Remember that one type of contract that pops up is \u0022we would like some science data from \u0026lt;location\u0026gt;.\u0022\u00A0 Should you happen to have a satellite or probe just sitting there with a thermometer, a radio and some power, you will have a customer that will give you money and a bit of their science in exchange for data which costs only taking control of a craft and clicking three times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[1] And given that you are sending a probe to land, a minimal satellite can easily tag along for the ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T06:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH, there\u0027s no reason why a probe can\u0027t be a return mission.
