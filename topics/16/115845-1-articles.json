(Yes, I juggle way too many missions simultaneously; it\u0027s actually pretty rare for me to warp more than maybe half an hour at a time. But that\u0027s not the point just now.)\n\nMy question: What\u0027s a good reentry profile in V1.0.4 for the standard early-game combo of Mk1 pod, Mk16 chute, 1.5m heat shield? Yes, I know I could pop up a temporary sandbox save and find out for myself, but I also know that\u0027d take a bunch of time that I don\u0027t want to spend and I\u0027m perfectly okay with cribbing those lessons from those of you who\u0027ve already done it. I\u0027m currently aiming at a Pe of 37km and have tweaked the chute to fully deploy at 1500m altitude. I\u0027ll manually stage the chute once velocity drops below 250m/s. \n\nI figure the chute is okay as is, but that I\u0027ll want to lower the Pe a bit further if I want to avoid having to brake across multiple orbits given the new lower-drag physics in 1.0.4. OTOH, I don\u0027t want to lower it TOO much given the new more sensitive thermal models in 1.0.4.\n\nSo, Oh Wise And All-Knowing Forum: Where should I set my periapsis for a Minmus return with a basic pod/chute/shield reentry vessel?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T01:11:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 01:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:12:38Z","Content":"As long as you have a heatshield protecting all important stuff you can go for immediate lithobraking if you want."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:13:49Z","Content":"37km should be fine. You can go a little higher for a more gentle slowdown but you\u0027ll have to do more passes. Anything in the high 30s to low 40s range should bring your apoapsis inside the Mun\u0027s orbit on the first pass.\n\nETA- a heatshield won\u0027t save you on a very steep reentry. Too low too fast will exceed the temperature limits of the shield and it will explode taking your entire ship with it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T00:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 12:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reactordrone**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:28:11Z","Content":"I usually aim for about 30 km myself for such situations, and it seems to work fine.

The second has an Octo probe core between the pod and the chute (launched later, with a scientist on board so I could do more biome-science-farming).\n\nI\u0027d like to avoid having to take the time to do multiple passes (let\u0027s face it, the way I play? If I do an aerobrake followed by a pass out to \u0022inside Mun\u0027s orbit\u0022 before a second pass which may or may not do the rest of the job? It\u0027ll probably be a week or more real-time before Val FINALLY lands. I think I launched her sometime in early June, but I\u0027m not sure....) and do a single-pass reentry direct to ground.\n\nSo it sounds like I should probably retarget down to a Pe around 30 km or just slightly above.

My experience is that anything over 25 km is safe, and anything under 35 km will aerobrake to the surface in one pass.
