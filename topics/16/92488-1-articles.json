I have tried two different designs, but I\u0027m not sure if either of them is optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The first design uses a probe core to command the ship and I put 2 Kerbals inside the processing lab. This has the advantage of only using 2 crew members, but I cannot do crew reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The second design uses a Mk1 Command pod to drive the ship leading to 3 Kerbals on board in total. I have full access to all reports and the only real disadvantage is I need 3 Kerbals instead of 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had really hoped that I could send up a pilot and one scientist and then once in orbit just shift the pilot back and forth between the processing lab and the command pod in order to do crew reports and use instruments and transmit data. I was hoping to be efficient with only 2 Kerbals on board and have full access to crew reports, but unfortunately this didn\u0027t work. When both Kerbals are in the lab, it does not function because apparently the lab cannot function without someone also in the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way I could make this work with a lab, only 2 Kerbals and still get crew reports and full functionality (and also just stock game)? It\u0027s not a huge problem to send 3 Kerbals instead of 2, it\u0027s more a of a preference for me, I was really hoping for just a 2-man crew.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-11T01:52:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2014 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eanswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowfax","CreatedById":3742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T20:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECombine the 2 designs.

I only just got this game after Thanksgiving weekend, lol, so I am still trying to learn and there are so many things that I look forward to. Thus far I have sent science orbiters to Moho, Eve, Gilly, Duna, Ike, Jool, Tylo, Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. I have sent landers down to the Mun, Minmus, Eve, Duna, Ike, and I even did an EVA landing on Gilly which was fun. All of these so far have been one-way trips except for one or two successful round trips to the Mun and Minmus surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my second career in my short time with the game. I decided to restart for a new career after I unlocked all the technologies way too fast in the first career (normal difficulty) mostly because of the strategies. I found those strategies to be highly unbalanced and I felt that it ruined my career experience if there was no need to explore to gain science. So I started up a new career on moderate difficulty and am not using strategies at all. Funds come easy with contracts, but the science I have to work for which I like. This is all just for learning the game right now and I plan to restart my career again when 0.90 hits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T19:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you take crew reports from a command chair?
