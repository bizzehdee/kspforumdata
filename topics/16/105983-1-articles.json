I haven\u0027t had to use any since I was a wee kexplorer still trying to get to the mun. \n\nI find that if you place your decoplers in the center of mass of the empty tanks/engine stack, then they just slide past you after a second or two. It is pretty close and can seem super scary, but as long as you\u0027re not turning one way or another too much you should be good. I find that if I place the decopler 3/4ths down on the stack its pretty close to being balanced."}]}
