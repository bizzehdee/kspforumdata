You should eject such that it puts you prograde along Ike\u0027s orbital path, and Ike should be at the correct ejection angle to get to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can probably reduce the inclination along with your ejection burn (it may not even be necessary).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
