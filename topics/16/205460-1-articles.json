So the landing figure is equal to the return to orbit. Make sure to budget extra. The maps usually reference an almost perfect suicide burn landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-01T17:11:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you need the same amount to get back to orbit. \u00A0 Obviously the actual amount you use will depend greatly on your descent profile, and thrust to weight (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-01T17:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always try to budget more than I need, primarily because I am not perfect.\u00A0 Heck, even the computer gets it wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut thank you for the answer!\u00A0 I thought that was the case, but I needed to just be sure!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-01T17:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe values on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map can simply be added no matter which direction, with the exception of planets with atmospheres.
