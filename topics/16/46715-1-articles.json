You can\u0027t just thrust up to be in the same place as your station. Anything in orbit will have a lateral velocity of over 2km/s. You need to get your ship moving at the same speed or your station will just wiz right by you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put my stations @~75km altitude. I do this because I use them as fuel stations before taking my ships further out. A lot of other people put their stations @~100km. The altitude matters because the higher you go, the faster you have to be moving. I don\u0027t know what the orbit is like for your station, so I\u0027ll give you directions for both altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, you can\u0027t launch when your station is directly overhead. You have to give yourself time to get up to speed. You also have to factor in that you\u0027ll be accelerating pretty much the whole time. This means your relative velocity will be dropping. This will make the station seem to slow down over time; it will close most of the distance with you early on. For a 75km rendezvous, you\u0027re going to want to wait until the station is ~45-50 degrees behind you, depending on how fast your craft accelerates. (Heavy loads need more of a lead, lighter loads need less.) For 100km, you\u0027ll want a 75-90 degree lead. Launch like you normally would to attain a circular orbit. You should be a bit ahead of your target. This is a good thing. In low Kerbin orbit, it\u0027s easier to drop back relative to another craft than it is to catch up to one. Select your station as a target. Wait for either the ascending or descending nodes (green triangles) in the map screen. For ascending nodes, place your navball reticule on the horizon between the orange and teal hemispheres at 180 degrees. Wait until you\u0027re about ten seconds away from the node and thrust until your relative inclination drops to 0.0. For descending nodes, point at the horizon at 0 degrees, which will be marked with an orange line, and thrust until your relative inclination drops to 0.0. Watch out, the lower the inclination, the faster it will drop. The node should have moved ahead of you after you thrust. Wait until you approach the node again (it doesn\u0027t matter which one for this part). Then thrust prograde (the upside-down T in your navball) until the close approach icon drops as low as you can get it. When you approach the the station, you want to switch your navball from \u0022ORBIT\u0022 to \u0022TARGET\u0022. Then thrust retrograde until your relative speed drops to 0, or at least below 5. The point at the target vector (magenta circle) and thrust to head towards the station. I wouldn\u0027t let your relative speed get much above 50m/s. Flip around to the retrograde marker again. When you get close enough to the station to start using RCS, thrust retrograde to bring your relative velocity down to below 5, or less if you don\u0027t have many RCS thrusters. Then just dock normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T00:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get close to it you first need to zero out your velocity.

You\u0027ll make fewer burns and be able to take shortcuts like accurately changing your velocity vector without zero-ing out first.
