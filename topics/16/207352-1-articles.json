The canister had gotten to the point where it displayed 100% collected but only 40-something% transmitted and it was off as well. So I launched a service mission that landed at the camp and flicked it back on. Went back home, checked in the Tracking Station...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and it was off again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I reloaded the quicksave I made prior to returning to debug the issue. Flicked the goo canister on again, engaged timewarp - it turned off by itself after a while. Seems like as deployed science does its work in \u0022ticks\u0022, if it detects during an update that it\u0027s already at 100% science collected, it automatically powers itself off... and since it\u0027s off, it probably won\u0027t transmit the last bit of collected data either despite having a real-time direct connection to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at all times (I got the DSN up in the meantime), nor is there a way to manually transmit the data either unless I have a kerbal pick it up and put it back down, which transfers the data into the kerbal\u0027s inventory (and also resets science collected/sent to 0%).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnd result is that once the canister hits 100% collected, it will never transmit anything ever again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-21T13:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2022 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Fraktal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-22T17:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are tricky parts to use.
