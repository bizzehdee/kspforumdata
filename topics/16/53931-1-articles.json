I am in the process of doing it but I\u0027m just getting the stuff there after a new start due to stuff. The ways I\u0027ve known without mods are either vertical or horizontal. I\u0027ll let someone else do vertical as my somewhat expertise lie with horizontal. When you are making a base, \u003Cstrong\u003EPlan.\u003C/strong\u003E You will help yourself understand purpose as well as construction of a base. How you create it is in two ways. Modular is most common- lots of compartments docked together with a crane; they are do-able too but require planning. Modular is the one I took but the other way of doing it is less pleasing as well as less challenging- landing a bunch of ships next to each other. This normally happens in vertical but I\u0027ll leave it like that. After planning the way you will lay out your base for maximum benefits, find a site. Its requirements- I suggest its flat, near interesting terrain and is in view of Kerbin for communications (up to you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) I would suggest you launch multiple probes around an area of interest and move them around in a manner of your choice until you find a good spot. Unless you want to, don\u0027t make the position of the base far off the equator as much fuel is needed to get there and there are only certain times in a orbit which you can get to the base. Once you have a base location, probe further, using the nav-ball to make sure its reasonably flat for the base to sit on. Finally, I\u0027d do a manned mission to investigate, publicize ( \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ) and confirm the landing spot.

But I\u0027ve been doing tons of research and finally built the Rover Mk I.I (towing the Command Module for the start of the Kerbal Munar Command) and then I made the Command Module, finally I decided to make a smaller rover, the Experimental Rover Mk II.IIa (it has a special attachment, decouple-able, that allows it to dock with the Command Module.

Practice, design, planning, and testing, all needed for a Munar Base. I had to do extensive testing and experimenting with the Experimental Rover, in order to be able to get it to dock with the Command Module like that. And same with the Rover Mk I.I. The unmodified version was TOO LOW and was incapable of towing the Command Module. So I adjusted the Axle (whatever \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and the wheels just enough and walla. Docks like a charm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, um, I haven\u0027t found a place for it. Sure flat surfaces and Equator is best, but I\u0027ve figured out how to maneuver to get to where I want to be, whether its on the Equator, to the north or south, don\u0027t matter. Just be sure you have enough fuel to do it. And, look for a Rover Tutorial Youtube video or find KSP Keybindings if you haven\u0027t already, they help you a LOT in how to place certain things in a special way!! AND, Lights are important when it gets very very dark.... You\u0027re not afraid of the dark...are you? ....... BOOO!! Just kidding. One last thing, when you are bringing something in for landing on the Mun, ALWAYS QUICK SAVE!!! (F2. Hold F9 to load quicksave if you do not know this already) because believe me. Nothing is worse than the feeling of having to start all over from the launch pad. I\u0027ve had to a number of times until I realized there was a Quicksave feature (god did I feel dumb when I realized this lol!!) and it has saved me LOADS of time. Quick save is your VERY best friend. But can also be your enemy if you accidentally load a OLD quick save after putting up a couple satellites. (Like I put up a ISA Map satellite around the Mun...accidentally loaded an old quick save, even though I save practically EVERY VESSEL I make, it just meant that I had to redeploy the satellite cuz it wasn\u0027t there :/ it sucked.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T06:18:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 06:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by BlazeKerba\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Icycrysis","CreatedById":93870,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T06:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to make one of these.
