As it has three 2,5m service bays and 6 docking ports it is very kraken friendly. It doesn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t help that I play on a mac that crashes every 10 minutes. I finally got the piece of s\\*\\*t to orbit after two days of bugs, so relaunching is not an option. When I got it to space I noticed that one of my docking ports are attached the wrong way. \n\nCan you forum gurus help me edit my save file so i can turn the docking port the right way round? I have included the code of the faulty part from the save file. It is not supposed to be docked to anything.\n\n    name = dockingPort2                cid = 4293826132                uid = 3325031882                mid = 1862789253                launchID = 42
