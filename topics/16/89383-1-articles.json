But you have to keep in mind that an atmospheric apoapsis is a very movable thing; as soon as you get the plane climbing again, your apoapsis will be right in front of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, the nose drop is probably largely due to losing the vectoring ability of the RAPIERs when you turn them off. You can counter this by just pulling back on the stick and holding the nose up with the canards and other control surfaces; that\u0027s what they\u0027re for. A Vernor or two under the nose can also help to brute-force it if you\u0027re having trouble keeping the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly. the climb rate of a plane is chiefly dependent on three factors: Angle of Attack (AoA), altitude and speed. As you go faster, the AoA required to maintain a given climb rate decreases. However, as you go higher, the AoA required to maintain a given climb rate increases. Your plane is descending because you have insufficient speed to maintain a climb at that altitude and AoA. So, either increase the AoA (by pulling the nose up, as described in the above paragraph) or increase the speed. Fortunately for you, planes tend to accelerate quite easily when they\u0027re in a dive...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you keep the 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch, your descent should eventually level out and turn back into a climb as you speed up. The drop is only really a problem if you end up descending so far that the atmospheric drag starts to slow you down again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, \u0022turn the RAPIERs off when they switch modes\u0022 is a simplified version that isn\u0027t as efficient as possible. A bit more complicated (but better) is to toggle off the turbojet as soon as the RAPIERs begin to sputter but before they switch modes. Then run the RAPIERs alone until they do switch modes, then disable the RAPIERs and reengage the turbojet. Then, when the turbojet begins to stutter, leave the RAPIERs off and gradually throttle down in order to keep the air intake requirement just below what is available. Once you can\u0027t throttle down any more without completely throttling off, fly like that until the turbo dies or the plane starts to slow. \u003Cem\u003EThen\u003C/em\u003E turn the RAPIERs back on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, constantly adjust the number of engines to match the intake air available, and get every last metre of speed and altitude before switching to rockets. Also, keep the turbojet on for the final ascent: even if it\u0027s already choked from lack of air, the rockets will drive a ram-air effect that should let you get a bit more thrust out of it. After that, once the turbojet finally chokes for good, close your intakes to minimise drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: as you may have heard many folks say, if you\u0027re getting into aircraft then it is very much worth giving NEAR or FAR a try. Aircraft are vastly more fun to fly with a sensible drag model and realistically thin and slippery air. A lot of the drawn-out plowing through the atmosphere that characterises a stock spaceplane ascent is caused by the soupmosphere rather than anything innate to spaceplanes. With more realistic aero, it\u0027s quite easy to get from runway to orbit in five minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secuas","CreatedById":126000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T13:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
