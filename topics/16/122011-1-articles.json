Curious if I can spare a little bit more, I started playing calculus around various physics quantities (mainly aero drag F ~ rho*v^2 and heat power P ~ rho*v^3), until I figured out all the calculation can be summarized as one phrase - energy conservation. Another typical day that I realize I\u0027m more stupid than I think I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now here are my questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is it true that for the same ship, same initial speed (usually from a interplanetary transfer) and same target speed (usually low-orbit speed), basically same everything except trajectory, I\u0027ll always end up with roughly the same heat produced into the ship, no matter how I aerobrake (different altitude/multiple pass/etc.)? Note I\u0027m talking about the heat in Joules, not ablation consumption for this question. In other words, does almost all the kinetic energy of the ship gets converted to heat into the ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Does KSP model the heat in a similar way, so that the above estimate is close enough to what actually happens in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Is there any way to reduce ablator consumption, other than making too many aerobrake passes to prevent ablator kicking in (I\u0027m fine with two or three but probably impatient for more), and reducing mass (usually payload will be fixed thus hard to optimize)? I can for sure add ablators but I want to know if can reduce its consumption first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-01T03:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2015 03:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T04:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s very close, the difference is that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
