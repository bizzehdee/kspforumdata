There\u0027s also a smaller difference between core and skin temperature, but in my test case that difference wasn\u0027t very large even for the parent.\u00A0In effect, they increase the surface area of the parent. Compared to fuel tanks of 16t and above, even the large panel doesn\u0027t provide much extra area, though. And anyway, radiation depends very much on temperature: in order to radiate well, a part has to be very hot. Which in this case means that the panel\u0027s parent has to be very hot -- a situation you probably want to avoid from the outset. Still, a panel or two may make the difference between a part going poof, or merely running dangerously hot.

If you add static radiators, they only directly cool the parent and child parts, but they do assist with that conducted heat by making their parts cooler. \u00A0Then, heat from other parts has a path to slowly flow to the cooler parts and be radiated away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s basically academic though. \u00A0We run into heat from atmospheric flight, where are deployable radiators are uselessly draggy and fragile. \u00A0Static panels can help cool parts a bit in flight, but it\u0027s a tiny bandaid where the real cure is part selection (parts have different temp limits), cargo bays (where parts are shielded from aero friction), and flight path (flying too fast too low blows up parts radiators or no, and doesn\u0027t get you\u00A0to space any better if that\u0027s where you\u0027re headed). \u00A0The nuclear engines used to get hot enough to blow up parts, but they don\u0027t now in ordinary use - radiators just aren\u0027t required. \u00A0Mining - this matters. \u00A0There is no effective mining without effective cooling, but it is 100% possible with statics (as described above). \u00A0That leaves sundiving - flying so close to the sun that parts overheat. \u00A0This, finally, is where you will have to do a lot of thermal engineering to see how close you can get before exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all other situations, radiators are essentially just roleplay. \u00A0My Apollo LM replica has one, because the real one does. \u00A0The panels\u00A0also make nice fashion fairings and covers for ugly parts, edges, corners, lines, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-13T18:24:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2017 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by fourfa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T10:58:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe: confusion regarding static radiators: They cool only the parent part.

The child part would need to conduct heat to grandparent through the radiator - and radiator \u0022pumping heat\u0022 from its parent doesn\u0027t conduct heat TO parent, and will most likely be much hotter than the child part. So: do NOT attach drills to radiator panels.

You can attach them then use the offset tool to move them to the opposite end of the craft, or clip 50 radiator panels into each other, and they will work just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- they don\u0027t work well when they are over the capacity.
