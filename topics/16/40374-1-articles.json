Spam them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * If a biplane, strut your wings together at the tips for more strength. Strut un-connected wing segments together too (hover over them in the VAB - connected \u0027child\u0027 wings will be highlighted together).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Put fuel towards the middle of the plane, jets towards the back, and anything you can towards the front. When fuel runs out, if your rear-mounted engines are the only heavy thing left on the plane, you will re-enter flipping backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Intakes are the 2nd hardest thing to get enough of. Spam them too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * ~4 intakes per turbojet and always use odd-numbers of jets. Use action groups to turn them off 2 at a time as you climb out of intakeair at 25km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T09:18:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by antbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T22:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in the same boat here.

The ones I\u0027ve built used actually about 1 turbofan per 15 ton, and utilized about 6 RAM intakes per Engine, which allowed them to got to 26Km\u002B and 1500 m/s\u002B, then I use the Nukes\u002BRadial engines to climb to 30-36km where a TWR of .5\u002B (just Nukes) and a speed around 1800 m/s is able to keep the vessel climbing to orbit. At which point circularization becomes easy since the delta v of just nukes was usually around 4500 m/s, and I was usually left with ~800 m/s delta v after circularization. The biggest one I made was 42 tons, had 3 turbofans, and 4 nukes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever when I tried to make a 10\u002B Kerbal VTOL SSTO Thats when the problems hit. To get enough fuel for IP travel (Which to me was a must), the vessel started to weigh 100-200 tons. This wouldn\u0027t be a problem if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that 30 engines (with Ideally around 60 intakes for the Jet engines) taxes my computer too much to be practical (I can\u0027t even play with the aerodynamic effects because they crash my computer).
