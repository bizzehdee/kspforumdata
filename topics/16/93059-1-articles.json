That is, I\u0027ve recorded each of their Flights, achievements, EVA Time, etc. So with the release of Kerbal XP and Specialization, I was hoping to fix the random assignments to better match what My Kerbals have actually achieved thus far.

I\u0027ve become something of a master of save file editing, but I can\u0027t for the life of me find out where the information on Crew Roles is stored. I checked the ROSTER[] section of the .sfs and found the flight experience logging, but there\u0027s nothing there, at least as far as I can tell, indicating what role each Kerbal is assigned. I\u0027ve searched the entire .sfs and come up dry.

There is no obvious pattern to any of the attributes of a Kerbal being used to assign their roles either. Not Brave, Dumb, or BadS. The only conclusion I can draw from that is the role is determined by using the Kerbal\u0027s name as a random seed, or used against some pattern in a similar method, which seems rather lazy and overly clever at the same time. I\u0027m a bit disappointed by this. (It does mean Kerbals are predetermined to their fates simply by their names alone. There is no fate but that which we create? Ha.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m only a few (7) flights into a test save, it appears that Kerbal experience level is determined either by raw number of flights or by a number of flight events.
