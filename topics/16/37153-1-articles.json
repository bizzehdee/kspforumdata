I would like to know if I can do without the ASAS module and core all-together, and place them somewhere on the frame so I can transport my base. When I dock (attach) to the rest of my parts, one of them having a core and ASAS module, would they apply control to the entire constructed ship? Doing what I hope will work will help reduce weight in shipping the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are still confused, I can provide more clarification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading my post!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-15T18:24:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2013 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RedKosmos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T07:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems fine with me if that\u0027s what you want to do.
