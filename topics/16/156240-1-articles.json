I\u0027ve considered docking everything together at the M\u00FCnar surface, but I\u0027m terrible at precision landing, and that\u0027s why the two landers I wanted to be close together ended up 2km apart, so I don\u0027t think this is an option. I\u0027ve also considered constructing it in orbit and then landing it, but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E would be off, so this would be fine if I could use parachutes, but since the M\u00FCn has no atmosphere, and I can\u0027t use parachutes,\u00A0It would\u00A0probably fail. I\u0027ve considered (and already have) landing a bunch of facilities in roughly the same area as each other (their compactness would depend on my more or less non-existent\u00A0precision landing skills), but this just turns out to be a mess, and I see no use for a spread-out colony other than to waste some time and funds.
