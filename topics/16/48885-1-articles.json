Any section of your craft which doesn\u0027t include the root can be detached, saved as a subassembly, and then be attached to another craft. That attachment can only be done with the same node where you detached the section from your current craft. So if you want a lander to use on multiple missions as a Subassembly, simply build the first mission (or just use a dummy docking port as root where you want to attach the lander to the rest), then detach the Lander and you should be able to save it as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LunchIn10Seconds","CreatedById":67073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T15:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks for all the replies.
