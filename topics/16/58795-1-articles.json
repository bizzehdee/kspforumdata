The problem is, I fudged the transfer a bit and ended up having to put it in a retrograde orbit. Rather than send a propulsion module out to dock with the station and turn it around, so far I\u0027ve left it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is, is there any particular use for a station in this scenario? Other than having to match other ships\u0027 trajectories to it, is its usefulness not affected? Not to mention I\u0027d hate to send out a correction mission only to end up annihilating both craft. :S\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T00:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, there\u0027s no difference, you\u0027ll just loose a few hundred dV from having to go into a retrograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robogungt8","CreatedById":81071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T00:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technicalK3rbal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technicalK3rbal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eyou\u0027ll just lose a few hundred dV from having to go into a retrograde orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot always.
