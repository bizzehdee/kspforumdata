This should be the heaviest piece of the station. I\u0027ve had several unsuccessful attempts to get this section into kerbal orbit without burning around 80% of the fuel I intend to take with me to the Mun. I need this fuel for the lander. The obvious answer to this problem is to launch a few fuel transfer rockets, but I fear that might eat into my budget to much. I have a budget of 300k to make this happen, and I\u0027ve already spent around 100k of that setting up a satellite network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m under the impression that my station is designed horribly wrong. I\u0027ve done this once before and I don\u0027t recall it being this much of a challenge. Maybe I\u0027m taking to much fuel? Maybe the stations engines are overkill? maybe I have to much Mono Propellant? Hell I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m kind of a noob at this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station really only needs to be a working processing lab with fuel storage. Perhaps the Solar array section wouldn\u0027t even be necessary? I could probably just slap a bunch of panels to the outside of the lab? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is, this station will likely be abandoned after the fact, so I really don\u0027t want to throw a lot of money at it. However, if it\u0027s built to some kind of standard, I could use to to eventually explore Minmus as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the engine section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt consists of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Liquid Fuel 360x4 tanks = 1440 (burning off about 80% of this before orbit) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Mono Propellant 100x3 = 300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-engines 2x200 thrust = 400 (overkill?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom of the cross shape is a docking port that the processing lab will later attach to.

Can you even transfer fuel through that scaffolding stuff? If I had a lander attached behind the processing lab, could I transfer fuel from the 2 main tanks at the front of the station, all the way to the back and into the lander?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice to make this work? \u0022When in doubt, add more boosters\u0022 doesn\u0027t seem to apply here.

Just looking at the TWRs launching with 3 is pretty excessive. You should either reduce the number of SRBs firing or throttle them lower. After teh first stage it then drops to low at 1.2 and 1.1.

For station parts of \u0026lt;= 20t, I use two or four LV-1R towards the bottom and shoot for a TWR of about 0.1-0.2 at most and maybe 500 m/s of DV.

Use that to dock a \u0022tug\u0022 with larger engines and fuel tanks to move station parts from orbit to orbit (or to another orbital body).

If not, here\u0027s a ship I\u0027ve used to harvest science from Minmus and the Mun for the last few career restarts. I\u0027ve done minor variations, but stuck with the same basic design since it works pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3298062012329246822/DDDAD79AA7A791F91BDA6CD9D4CAEDCF157E4EBD/\u0022 alt=\u0022DDDAD79AA7A791F91BDA6CD9D4CAEDCF157E4EBD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 man capsule give you enough crew to man the lab module and still keep someone in the capsule. (required to run the lab) This version has 4 docking ports on the fuel tank and 1 shielded port on the nose. Fuel is the same capacity as the big orange tank and the engine is a poodle for decent fuel economy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen fully fueled in kerbins orbit it\u0027s got about 4000 dV and you will have to refuel it in LKO. A full orange tank is too heavy for a poodle to lift. If it you tweak it to half full in the VAB it\u0027s easy enough to get into orbit. I use 4 of the radial mount monopropellant tanks. It\u0027s enough to keep the lander topped up for enough dockings to harvest every biome of the Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI normally send the lander on it\u0027s own booster and transfer stage to Minmus or the Mun. I\u0027ve usually got a bit of fuel left in the transfer stage so I\u0027ll dock with the mothership and transfer out any remaining fuel in the transfer stage and jettison it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander design is also something I\u0027ve stuck with through a few career restarts. I used a 2.5m main fuel tank to keep the COM low, still carry a decent amount of fuel and provide a nice wide landing gear base. It uses the LV909 for fuel economy and has 2 science jr and 2 goo canisters. 2 of the small radial mount monopropellant tanks are mounted on the bottom next to the engine. This lets you use lots for docking and landing assist and keeps the COM low. (important on the mun where flat spots are rare)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time I\u0027ve harvested all the science and am ready to move on, I\u0027ve usually set up a kethane mining base on the surface that I use to refuel the mothership. Stock players could send a tanker from kerbin. When you\u0027re ready to move on you just dock the lander to the nose of the ship to be in line with the COT and deactivate the lander engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small ship docked is a data courier. After a number of landings and storing the data in the pod of the mothership, a small courier ship comes from kerbin to pick up the data and take it home. This way the mothership never has to go back to kerbin unless you replace it with a better one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this version uses 4 radial docking ports, I found 2 plus the one in the nose was enough in later versions. Still gives you room to dock habitat modules for crew comfort or refueling tankers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a while since I haven\u0027t launched one in .90 yet, but if memory serves the booster was a mainsail with 3 orange tanks and 8 basic jet engines radial mounted.

If you\u0027re comfortable getting to Minmus, I highly recommend starting there instead, since you\u0027ll need far less fuel for your lander to get down to the surface and back up to your lab. Plus you\u0027ll get more science points from exploring Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign-wise, I don\u0027t have much to add to the rest of this thread. The one time I did this, my space station consisted of a mobile lab with a docking port on one end, a Hitchhiker module (because role-playing), and a fuel tank \u002B engine to get the whole thing out to Minmus. A fairly simple in-line design that sits nicely on top of a booster. These days you might need to include a probe core, or somewhere to put a pilot, to give you SAS control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent the space station up on one launcher, got it to Minmus and then sent the lander over separately.
