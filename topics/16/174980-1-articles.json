When you put wings on your plane, they are by default (most of the times) parallel to the body of the plane, but if you increase the angle of attack of the wings, this can have a pretty substantial effect on the performance of the plane. This is always a compromise. The higher the angle of attack, the higher the lift factor, but also the drag. Simplified: high angle of attack for slow planes, low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E for fast planes.\u00A0Also making your wings dihedral or anhedral can have a huge impact on the flying characteristics/stability/maneuverability of your design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same is also true for stabilizers. Enable the good old Center of Lift-indicator and watch it when you change the angle of your horizontal stabilizers for example. You simply have to play around with that a little. Soon you\u00B4ll have a pretty good idea what change will lead to the desired effect. sometimes you want more lift at the back of your plane, sometimes you might even want a little bit of downforce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this little technique I can build my planes so that they can fly on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E set to prograde and hold (mostly) course and altitude.
