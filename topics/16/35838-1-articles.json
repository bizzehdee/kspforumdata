I have FAR installed and used some of their planes, and it went pretty smoothly, more or less. But then I get to my designs and things fall apart. I understand the basics of getting to about 20k, and can tweak my designs to do that reliably. However, once I get to the cut over from jets to rockets, my own designs always start tumbling. It\u0027s uncontrollable and not recoverable every time. There\u0027s usually quite a bit of rocking to start, and then a full tumble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried SAS, ASAS with RCS, and the avionics package. I\u0027ve tried cutting off the jets earlier (around .14 air intake) to make sure I\u0027m not having flame outs. I\u0027ve tried cutting the jets and coasting before engaging the rocket and I\u0027ve tried running them simultaneously. Either way, the same result every time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of my latest design. Generic, sure, but it\u0027s mine and I want it to work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/577867923916416316/39EFEA913A88CFE3246729C8CE007F00AC183B14/1024x819.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x819.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips or help is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T07:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell first off, the engine you\u0027re bringing along can\u0027t gimbal, so for the force it applies to your rather small craft, it\u0027s understandable that RCS can\u0027t keep it straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, those huge \u0022tail fins\u0022 are probably moving your center of mass upwards, making it even worse for the problem mentioned above.

It seems to me you have a T30 on your plane. I might be wrong, it\u0027s hard to tell from that angle, but if you do have a T45, ignore that comment.
