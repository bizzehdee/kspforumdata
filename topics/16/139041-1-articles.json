Radiators are used to manage heat in a variety of situations.\u00A0 The Nerva engine generates significant heat and with its low TWR leading to long burn times, can overheat.\u00A0 The ISRU equipment (drills and refineries) generate large amounts of heat which must be managed.\u00A0 Operations near the Sun (aka Kerbol) may require cooling equipment to prevent overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Aerodynamic fairings are part of the stock game and allow objects with poor aerodynamic qualities to be shielded from the air turbulence during ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T15:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
