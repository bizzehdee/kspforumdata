But I got some quite small crafts that use rather strong RCS (Vernors) and if I activate both SAS and RCS it\u0027s less than minute before my fuel is all gone. SAS just keeps wiggling the craft around, even in precision mode (and even worse, in that mode no plumes of gas are visible, so I don\u0027t know my fuel is leaking unless I watch the resources window).\n\nI could really live without SAS ever touching the thrusters. It does a really lousy job of it anyway.\n\nAre there any mods, config tricks or other methods to achieve that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T10:50:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 10:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T17:55:15Z","Content":"Try to disable the gimbal of your engines (right click on them).

To clarify minimal attitude control: place single Vernor engines, or the single place-anywhere RCS thrusters centered with your CoM on all 6 sides and they will only be used for translation because they will not rotate your ship, so KSP won\u0027t use them for that. He also asked for mods that do this which is why I suggested MechJeb."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T20:55:54Z","Content":"I mentioned stock only approaches since those are the only ones I know of.

Brought to orbit by SSTO, recovered after deorbiting, the only losses are the fuel, the percentage on distance from KSC (and with the airbrakes I can usually get within 90%) and a couple dumb struts and beams of the \u0022base\u0022 on which they are sitting in orbit (only so that I\u0027m not cluttering my map, one object instead of 6 or 7)\n\nThough I admit the big parachute is an overkill. My new batch got Spark engines on stack decouplers, and are fully symmetric. (the parachute on the side was missing to provide room for a radial separator, as you see they are quite packed and there was simply no room to attach them radially.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T22:25:11Z","Content":"I suggest adding few classic monoprop maneuver nodes, and designate vernors to a group as \u0022toggle on/off\u0022. This way you can use vernors only for propulsion to encounter debris/whatever you want to bring back home and deorbit, and maneuver jets for fine control to catch up the debris or stabilize the craft. When toggled off, vernors should not consume any monoprop for stabilization. Also, they are a bit too powerful for stabilizing such a small craft, so they most likely \u0022overshoot\u0022, tilting the ship too much, which mean that vernors on the opposite side have to counter that, again with inappropriate force...thus waste of fuel."}]}
