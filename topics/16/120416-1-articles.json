It\u0027s loosely based off the Valkyrie shuttle from Avatar - a large, thickly-swept flying-delta design. I\u0027ve taken up the Mk. IV spaceplane parts mod and B9 Procedural Wings to assemble it, and its engines are four 2.5m RAPIER-style engines. The whole thing, fully-fuelled, weighs in at about 368 tonnes, give or take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it just refuses to get off the ground, no matter what I do. Thrust demonstrably isn\u0027t the problem - the thing hits over 160m/s before the end of the runway - but after the end of the runway, it slowly descends and can\u0027t gain altitude fast enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added some VTOL engines from the same mod underneath, but that made practically no difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

That worked great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I re-engineered her to use some KAX liquid fuel tanks (sine the old Hypersonic Mk. 3 ones were a little low-res for my taste) and that worked great. A whole bunch of extra dV now, too, although at the expense of some extra weight. While I was at it, I added an extra pair of Mk. 2 RAPIERs (I think that the mod calls them BROADSWORDs), which now means that I have ample thrust. She still struggles to break the sound barrier, but once it\u0027s up past 425m/s, it pretty much doesn\u0027t stop accelerating.

I hit 20,000m or so (I\u0027m not sure of the exact altitude - I was fiddling around with map view at the time) when all of a sudden, it \u003Cem\u003Eviolently\u003C/em\u003E pitched down. What followed was an exhilarating series of explosions and debris, some very well-timed use of engines and a solid landing with recovery parachutes (on the bright side, they work great!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea what would cause it to pitch down like that? It was really sudden - the whole thing must\u0027ve gone from 10 degrees positive to 35 degrees negative in two seconds or so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T14:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ That might be a game issue and not related to your plane design. I\u0027ve had planes blow up suddenly when I go from normal view to map view, especially when I was doing the Velocity Circumnavigation challenge. It\u0027s something about thermal temperature of your plane\u0027s parts and the map view. The hotter the plane gets, the map view seems to exaggerate this. It may also be related to the memory leak that the thermal gauges work off of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the violent pitching down, I\u0027m not sure either. The last time this happened to me is when I was (again) doing the Velocity Circumnavigation challenge and I was running the angle of attack too close to zero and I had to drop altitude, then the wings snapped off. I think the wings went into negative lift suddenly from positive, and I\u0027m sure it was my plane\u0027s balance that was the cause.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T14:09:10Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"March Unto Torment","CreatedById":149317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T23:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWasn\u0027t an overheating problem - my heat was dropping rapidly as I passed the 17,000m mark, and everything looked fine when I switched out of map view (the same could not be said following a re-entry into low atmosphere at close to 2,000m/s) - miracle enough of it survived for a coordinated landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if my engines ran out of thrust?
