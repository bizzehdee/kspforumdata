What you need to do is tap space to get her to let go of the ladder. Once the kerbonaut is free floating tap R to activate the thruster pack. Maneuvering on EVA is the tricky part, but you can use the WASD keys as well as the left shift and ctrl keys to control the thrusters. Also, point the Kerbonaut at the target by aiming the camera and tapping W, the Kerbonaut will automatically turn to face whatever you\u0027re looking at. Another pointer is don\u0027t mash down on the movement keys, just like with space ships, a touch of thrust goes a long way, burning too long will just mean more thrusting to slow down later."},{"CreatedByName":"zhollett","CreatedById":62547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:21:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d suggest practicing with EVAs before trying one of these missions, they can be hard to master.

Hunt\n\nI\u0027m old hat at this game so that info isn\u0027t new to me, but I greatly appreciate having your answer and the level of detail you went into, that is surely a great service and deserves to be in this Q\u0026A Section.\n\nMy specific problem was there was some sort of bug with the \u0022R\u0022 key not turning on RCS, and since I had not done a rescue mission in a while, I was flustered that something may had changed in 1.0 and I didnt know about it. I re-loaded the game and switched to Janlinne, pressed \u0022R\u0022 and her RCS turned on, rescued moments later.\n\nAgain, thanks for the information."}]}
