This is the ship I\u0026#39;ve been using: [URL]http://pastebin.com/6ASKMhuu[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s being flown by 1-star pilot Jeb.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese are the problems I\u0026#39;ve been having:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST=1]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]My electrical charge is constantly draining, even when SAS is turned off, so I\u0026#39;m empty by the time I reach the Mun (I don\u0026#39;t have solar panels yet). Is something else draining my juice? \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Although I have managed to safely land on the Mun a couple times, every time I haven\u0026#39;t had enough fuel to return home. (And I can\u0026#39;t send a rescue ship because the whole reason I\u0026#39;m landing on the Mun is to get science so I can build a rescue ship to save Valentina and a couple of tourists from Minmus orbit.) Am I running out of fuel because of my design, or because I\u0026#39;m not doing a good job of flying it? Could an experienced player fly this ship to the Mun and back? \u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Relating to the previous problem, I\u0026#39;m trouble flying my ship the way wiki and video tutorials are telling me. For example, I\u0026#39;ve heard form some sources that I should tilt over 45 degrees once I reach 10km. However, although my ship\u0026#39;s design is similar to those I\u0026#39;ve seen in videos, it starts to somersault if I tip over more that 15 degrees before I reach 30km. Again, is this because of my ship or me? \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T01:36:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 01:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hunter-K13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T04:33:32Z","Content":"\n1.

On the other hand, if you post a screenshot, anyone in the forum can see it instantly and you\u0026#39;ll probably get a pretty good volume of useful critique.

The radiators drain electricity. You don\u0026#39;t need even a single radiator for that ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Loading the ship up into KER shows it as having 7353 dV, which is more than enough to land and return from Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. The ship is slightly unbalanced because of that mystery goo, but probably not enough to cause issues. More importantly, those radiators create a lot of lift and drag above your center of mass, which makes the ship flip happy. Put fins on the bottom, get rid of the radiators at the top.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT:You also put the heatshield on wrong. It has to go to the bottom of the stack, otherwise everything below it will likely melt. \u003Cbr\u003E\nHilariously, your craft manages to avoid the problem by having another one - namely, those radiators. On reentry, the capsule flips parachute-first and they manage to cool the capsule and parachutes off just enough that they don\u0026#39;t explode. \u003Cbr\u003E\nIt flips because the heatshield is above the science junior with no decoupler between them, so the center of mass is toward the top of the craft. I\u0026#39;d suggest leaving the science jr. with the lander stage, collecting the science on EVA and reentering Kerbin with a simple parachute/capsule/heatshield combo.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s a simple guide: Get your ascent speed close to 100 m/s, then tip the rocket over 5 degrees east, wait for the prograde marker to start dropping and follow it without deviating from it during the first ~30 km, or your ship will do more somersaults.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T06:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by disembodied\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T06:42:49Z","Content":"\nOkay, I tried your ship. 4 steerable winglets near the bottom of the central stack are enough to keep it from flipping during ascent, and it does have more than enough fuel. As disembodied points out, the radiators were the power drain, and are not needed on this ship. The design has a couple of other problems, but I don\u0026#39;t want to ruin the learning experience by fixing everything for you. :D Let me know if you would like more tips, though.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T08:21:08Z","Content":"\nI don\u0026#39;t think you realize how over built this rocket is. With a proper flight profile, remove the radiators, and add some fins to your center stack, you can make it to the Mun and back with plenty of wiggle room. I will however advise that you bring all of your science into the capsule before you leave the Mun.
