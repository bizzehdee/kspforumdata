Your antenna network serves two main functions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The antenna on your unmanned probes allows it to receive a remote control signal from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is a signal going FROM Kerbin TO your probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The antenna on your manned or unmanned craft allows them to send science data back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is a signal going FROM your ship TO Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALL antennas can do BOTH 1 and 2 at all times (as long as those that need to be deployed are in their deployed state.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there are two types of antennas in the game: direct antennas and relay antennas. The direct antennas act as an end point only. They receive the remote control input from Kerbin that\u0027s directing an unpiloted probe they are attached to, and they also send science data out from the craft they are on back to Kerbin. It doesn\u0027t matter if this control input is coming from a relay, or Kerbin itself, nor does it matter if the science data it sends is being sent through a relay. All that matters is that there is an unbroken series of connections with Kerbin at one end*, and your direct antenna at the other. What direct antennas can NOT do is act as a middle point in the chain; which means that they can\u0027t pass along signals from any other craft (aside from its own) that are trying to talk to Kerbin. The relay antennas can do everything that the direct antennas can do PLUS they act like an extra link for any craft that can\u0027t \u0022see\u0022 Kerbin if they might be on the far side of a moon or planet, or they are out of range due to their power. They pick up signals from other craft and pass them along to Kerbin, as well as pass along remote control input from Kerbin and pass it along to unpiloted probes. Remember, both direct and relay antennas are always doing both 1 and 2 from the above list at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have a ship with no pilot on board? Then you need an antenna, because it needs to receive remote control input from Kerbin. Do you have a ship with a pilot but want to transmit science? Then you need an antenna because the antenna beams the science data back to Kerbin. Do you have a ship with a pilot on board and want to bring all your science data back with you without transmitting it? Then you don\u0027t really need an antenna at all IF your pilot is inside a command pod or command chair. Pilots cannot control a craft from inside a passenger compartment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most confusing thing for new players trying to understand the new antenna system is that you have to consider the strength of BOTH antennas that will be communicating together. Think of it like shining a light across a distance. You can use a flashlight up close and still see it with your own eyes, but the further away it gets you might need binoculars, or a small telescope or a huge observatory if it\u0027s really far. But if the light is as bright as the sun then you can see it with your own eyes at many millions of kilometers away. Radio waves work exactly the same way. A big dish can \u0022hear\u0022 a faint signal from far away, or a small antenna can \u0022hear\u0022 a powerful signal from far away, but a faint signal is too dim to be heard by a small antenna at far enough distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the antennas back on Kerbin are almost always going to be the largest, most powerful link in the chain and they get bigger as you upgrade the tracking station. So, if you right click an antenna in the part menu of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it will tell you how far away each antenna can be to communicate with the tracking station at different levels (tier 1, 2, 3) in millions (Mm) and billions (Gm) of meters. But what if you aren\u0027t talking directly to Kerbin and you need another antenna to pass the signal around the planet? This is where relays come in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe HG-5 is the first relay antenna you have access to, and it is pretty weak, but it has some good uses. For example, they are far too weak to communicate with EACH OTHER if they are orbiting on opposite sides of Kerbin out past Minmus. BUT the large dishes at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E are large enough and powerful enough to communicate with each of them individually. So? Have a small rover on the far side of Minmus with just a Communitron on it? Put a few satellites with HG-5 relays on them in low orbit of Minmus itself. They will be able to communicate with the small antenna on the rover when it is in their line of sight, and they can feed that signal to one of the other satellites in the same low orbit because the distance isn\u0027t very great. If one of those relay satellites is in view of Kerbin then the big sensitive dishes back on Kerbin\u0027s surface will then be able to communicate with the relatively weak antenna of the HG-5. The relay will also boost the signal it receives to match its own power level, no matter how small the source is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the above example, the light shining metaphor might help. The small antenna on the surface of Minmus is like a small flashlight shining onto a rather small reflector in orbit around Minmus that magnifies that light a little. The huge telescopic observatories back on Kerbin are large enough to resolve such a faint light at that distance, but if you were hanging out in keostationary orbit with nothing but a pair of binoculars you would have no hope of ever seeing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main upshot is this: Small antennas need to stay close to each other if you need one of them to act like a relay. The further away you get then the bigger at least one of the antennas has to be.

Your antenna network serves two main functions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The antenna on your unmanned probes allows it to receive a remote control signal from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is a signal going FROM Kerbin TO your probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The antenna on your manned or unmanned craft allows them to send science data back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is a signal going FROM your ship TO Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALL antennas can do BOTH 1 and 2 at all times (as long as those that need to be deployed are in their deployed state.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there are two types of antennas in the game: direct antennas and relay antennas. The direct antennas act as an end point only. They receive the remote control input from Kerbin that\u0027s directing an unpiloted probe they are attached to, and they also send science data out from the craft they are on back to Kerbin. It doesn\u0027t matter if this control input is coming from a relay, or Kerbin itself, nor does it matter if the science data it sends is being sent through a relay. All that matters is that there is an unbroken series of connections with Kerbin at one end*, and your direct antenna at the other. What direct antennas can NOT do is act as a middle point in the chain; which means that they can\u0027t pass along signals from any other craft (aside from its own) that are trying to talk to Kerbin. The relay antennas can do everything that the direct antennas can do PLUS they act like an extra link for any craft that can\u0027t \u0022see\u0022 Kerbin if they might be on the far side of a moon or planet, or they are out of range due to their power. They pick up signals from other craft and pass them along to Kerbin, as well as pass along remote control input from Kerbin and pass it along to unpiloted probes. Remember, both direct and relay antennas are always doing both 1 and 2 from the above list at all times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have a ship with no pilot on board? Then you need an antenna, because it needs to receive remote control input from Kerbin. Do you have a ship with a pilot but want to transmit science? Then you need an antenna because the antenna beams the science data back to Kerbin. Do you have a ship with a pilot on board and want to bring all your science data back with you without transmitting it? Then you don\u0027t really need an antenna at all IF your pilot is inside a command pod or command chair. Pilots cannot control a craft from inside a passenger compartment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most confusing thing for new players trying to understand the new antenna system is that you have to consider the strength of BOTH antennas that will be communicating together. Think of it like shining a light across a distance. You can use a flashlight up close and still see it with your own eyes, but the further away it gets you might need binoculars, or a small telescope or a huge observatory if it\u0027s really far. But if the light is as bright as the sun then you can see it with your own eyes at many millions of kilometers away. Radio waves work exactly the same way. A big dish can \u0022hear\u0022 a faint signal from far away, or a small antenna can \u0022hear\u0022 a powerful signal from far away, but a faint signal is too dim to be heard by a small antenna at far enough distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the antennas back on Kerbin are almost always going to be the largest, most powerful link in the chain and they get bigger as you upgrade the tracking station. So, if you right click an antenna in the part menu of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it will tell you how far away each antenna can be to communicate with the tracking station at different levels (tier 1, 2, 3) in millions (Mm) and billions (Gm) of meters. But what if you aren\u0027t talking directly to Kerbin and you need another antenna to pass the signal around the planet? This is where relays come in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe HG-5 is the first relay antenna you have access to, and it is pretty weak, but it has some good uses. For example, they are far too weak to communicate with EACH OTHER if they are orbiting on opposite sides of Kerbin out past Minmus. BUT the large dishes at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E are large enough and powerful enough to communicate with each of them individually. So? Have a small rover on the far side of Minmus with just a Communitron on it? Put a few satellites with HG-5 relays on them in low orbit of Minmus itself. They will be able to communicate with the small antenna on the rover when it is in their line of sight, and they can feed that signal to one of the other satellites in the same low orbit because the distance isn\u0027t very great. If one of those relay satellites is in view of Kerbin then the big sensitive dishes back on Kerbin\u0027s surface will then be able to communicate with the relatively weak antenna of the HG-5. The relay will also boost the signal it receives to match its own power level, no matter how small the source is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the above example, the light shining metaphor might help. The small antenna on the surface of Minmus is like a small flashlight shining onto a rather small reflector in orbit around Minmus that magnifies that light a little. The huge telescopic observatories back on Kerbin are large enough to resolve such a faint light at that distance, but if you were hanging out in keostationary orbit with nothing but a pair of binoculars you would have no hope of ever seeing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main upshot is this: Small antennas need to stay close to each other if you need one of them to act like a relay. The further away you get then the bigger at least one of the antennas has to be. If you get even further away then you have to make BOTH of the antennas big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* P.S. to add: There is a special case with remote probes being controlled by pilots on other ships instead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but there are a lot of requirements that have to be met.

Your HG-5 will be able to be communicate back and forth with Kerbin from just about anywhere around Kerbin or its moons, as long as the signal isn\u0027t blocked by the moon being in the way. Whether or not the HG-5 can communicate with another ship in order to relay a signal is a lot more complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t feel bad, it\u0027s confusing for a lot of people because of what\u0027s called the \u0022inverse square law.\u0022 If you\u0027ve heard of that term before you may remember it as one of the bedrock principles in physics. It\u0027s the reason that the intensity of broadcast energy propagating through space diminishes with distance. Light, sound, gravity, radio waves -- they all lose intensity as the signal spreads out from the source, expanding over an exponentially wider area the further and further out it goes. The intensity of the radiation is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a link that you may find helpful \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommNet Wiki\u003C/a\u003E. For now, only concern yourself with the numbers posted to the left of the antenna names in the topmost chart. 5k, 500k, 5M, 2G, 15G, and 100G. The \u0022k\u0022 means thousands, \u0022M\u0022 isn\u0027t meter (which would be lowercase) the uppercase \u0022M\u0022 means millions, and the uppercase \u0022G\u0022 means Giga, or billions. Those aren\u0027t distances exactly. What they indicate is the power of the relevant antenna. So, the command pods with no antenna have a power of 5,000; the communotron16 has a power of 500,000; the HG-5 has a power of 5,000,000; the DTS-M1 and the RA-2 both have a power of 2,000,000,000 and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can you use those numbers? Well, the maximum range of any two antennas depends on the inverse square law. For the case of any two antennas talking to each other you multiply together the power each antenna and then take the square root of that. The resulting answer is the maximum distance over which the two antennas can connect in meters. You\u0027ll want a calculator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you notice that along the top of that chart it shows you the power rating of the KSP tracking station at different tier levels? At level 1 the Kerbin tracking station has a power of 2G or 2,000,000,000. If you want to find out at what distance the communotron16 can talk to the tier 1 tracking station then you take the power of the communotron16 (500,000) multiplied by the power of the tracking station (2,000,000,000) = 10^15 and take the square root which equals roughly\u00A0 31,622,776 meters or 31.6 thousand kilometers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to find the maximum range between the antenna on a probe and a relay satellite then replace the values with the power ratings shown for those antennas in the info panel when you right click the part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. For example, the HG-5 has a power level of 5M. We know that means 5,000,000. That\u0027s three orders of magnitude weaker than the tier one tracking station. So their connection range should be a lot less. Let\u0027s try having a communotron16 sending a signal to an HG-5 relay satellite that then forwards that signal on to Kerbin with a tier 2 tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n500,000 * 5,000,000 = 2,500,000,000,000 and the square root of that is roughly 1,581,139 meters or 1,581 kilometers. That\u0027s how close those two antennas will need to be to communicate. That gets you a signal from the surface of the Mun or Minmus to just about any satellite orbiting within their sphere of influence, but it won\u0027t reach a satellite much further away than that. Now will that HG-5 be able to relay the signal to the tier 2 (50G) tracking station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5,000,000 * 50,000,000,000 = 2.5x10^17 and the square root is = 500,000,000 meters or 500,000 kilometers. You\u0027d have to go interplanetary to lose the signal. So all together, the probe on the surface of Minmus with a communotron16 can send a signal to a relay satellite up to 1,581 kilometers away that has an HG-5 antenna on it. We know that the HG-5 in orbit of Minmus is well within the range of the Kerbin tracking station (500,000km) so we have a continuous link to and from Kerbin through our relay to the probe on the surface of Minmus with only one \u0022hop\u0022 or relay needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow none of this takes into account the STRENGTH of the signal but that only matters if you are concerned about getting a boost to your transmitted science points. I wouldn\u0027t worry about that for now since you will still get full control as long as you are within your maximum range. Just be aware that the lines on your map will fade and turn red when you start to get to the limit of your range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that\u0027s not all too much of an info dump for you. You know what I do? I put the biggest relay dish I can carry on my satellites and cross my fingers, haha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. you may have noticed something cheeky about the power ratings of those antennas. If you have two relay antennas of the SAME type that you need to talk to each other, how would you find out their range? If you multiply together the power of each antenna and then take the square root you just end up with the same number again. In other words, the power rating shown for each antenna is equal to the range of a connection between two of those same antennas. This only matters of course for relay antennas, since direct antennas can\u0027t talk to each other anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T09:28:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 09:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoridinUK","CreatedById":110633,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T18:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHG-5 is both direct and relay, so I could get more distance from my mun/minus sats if I put a HG-5 on the probe/pod rather than a comm 16 right?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOk so distance they can talk, check and yes I remember the inverse square law once upon a time, a long LONG time ago I did a year of a four-year Masters of Physics\u00A0course at the Uni of Leicester...

Two HG-5 antennas talking to each other will have a combined range of 5 million meters. A communotron16 trying to talk to an HG-5 will only have a range of only 1.5 million meters. Minmus and the Mun each have a sphere of influence that is around 2.5 million meters. And Kerbin has a sphere of influence that extends out to 84 million meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, a communitron16 \u002B HG-5 pair will be able to communicate within all low orbits of the Mun or Minmus. You have to consider that the distance at which they need to connect won\u0027t be limited to just straight up. The satellite may be several degrees to the east or west adding significantly to the distance the signal has to travel. A HG-5 talking to another HG-5 in orbit of the Mun or Minmus is a much more reliable combination. But it\u0027s really only a stopgap until you can research bigger relay antennas at higher tech levels. Remember that with a range of 5Mm an HG-5 in orbit of the Mun won\u0027t even have enough power to talk to another HG-5 in low orbit around Kerbin. You\u0027re relying on your Kerbin ground stations to resolve the signal instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the legitimacy of the inverse square law, I always thought it seemed rather straightforward. As a sphere of energy expands the surface area of that sphere increases with the square of the radius, thereby diluting the energy across the wider area. A sphere with a radius 2 times longer than before has a surface area that is 2^2 or 4 times greater. A sphere with a radius 3 times longer has a surface area that is 3^2 or 9 times greater, a radius of 4 is 4^2 or 16 times the surface area, etc... Yes, integrals do seem like an awful kludge though. Infinitesimal values are not particularly comprehensible in a satisfying way.
