Hmmm....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, things are a little better....it doesn\u0027t explode any more. But now at seemingly random points my sleek procedural wings fall off. But Kerbal seems to think they\u0027re still attached to my plane the camera focus slides away always at a midpoint between my plane and its descending wings. I can still control the plane and deploy my chutes. Got crew and science home safely, kind of. I can switch to IVA but the external view is always half way between plane and it\u0027s wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone seen this?

Built a SSTO with stock parts and some parts glitching into each other (without f12). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainly the large wings had some octo-struts with intakes attached. Launch and ascending into orbit went without any incidents. The main part of re-entry went fine, too. As soon as I hit about 10km above ground, the left wing fell off. Luckily the vessel had so much SAS, so it still were barely controlable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few Km before KSC the right wing fell off, too. So I had to take eager measures and tried to land the SSTO like a rocket on its back. Landed with like 30 m/s and the whole plane broke apart.
