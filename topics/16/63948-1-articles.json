Has anyone done this? Can I deploy this network with a single mission or two missions at most? If so, how? I can achieve the eccentricity and inclination with no problem but I\u0027m not sure how to get the true anomaly timed correctly for all satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for helping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T07:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can deploy a three-sat mission with ease. Go to the synchronous orbital altitude, circularize, then burn into an elliptical orbit 2/3 the period of the existing one (i.e. 4 hours on Kerbin). Decouple your satellites, then once per orbit, burn one of them back into synchronous orbit. dV intensive, but more accurate than anything else I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"docfish","CreatedById":83007,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T08:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT: \u003C/strong\u003E *sigh* should have clicked the link to see what you meant, sorry late at night brain broken. Well what comes after this won\u0027t be precise enough to be of any use seeing as how precisely you\u0027d need to position it all. Still I\u0027ll leave it in case someone else runs across this and actually wants to do what I thought you wanted (which rereading it again... man how did I misread your request so badly lol) So again, yeah this won\u0027t help you across multiple planes like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick I\u0027ve used to do triangular satellite deployments with multiple launches might actually work with some fiddling (I\u0027d never considered the 2/3 orbit thing, may have to try it sometime), it\u0027d probably take someone smarter than me (or a few trial runs) to turn it into a working plan. I\u0027d put my first satellite up in it\u0027s final orbit, then put the next one in a lower parking orbit, then when directly across the center body from the lower one (phase angle 180 yes? sorry it\u0027s late and I\u0027m a little fried), I\u0027d burn for the higher final orbit before circularizing. Obviously this wouldn\u0027t do exactly what you want, but while I was tweaking that I experimented with burning before that point and got what might actually be usable for what you want. Granted at the time it wasn\u0027t what \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E wanted at all, so I didn\u0027t really make a point to do it repeatedly lol. Unless someone can give you something more precise (and lets face it, it can hardly be less precise than what I sketched out), quicksave is your friend, as is rotating to facing down in map view to eyeball the results \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T08:12:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by docfish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EShould have clicked the link first \u0026gt;.\u0026lt;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T08:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, now that\u0027s why understanding orbital mechanics is helpful. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T08:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could be a real a*#hole right about now, MaverickSawyer.
