In fact, in many respects they\u0027re more important when DRE is in effect; the lifting surfaces of a spaceplane allow for much better descent control than a capsule, allowing you to reenter as fast or slow as you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re burning up during ascent, you\u0027re accelerating too much at too low an altitude. Climb more steeply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, you may have DRE misinstalled. When things are burning up, what speed are you doing at what altitude?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, however: what other mods are you using? Most importantly: are you using FAR (you should)? If you post some screenshots of your ship, we\u0027ll be able to diagnose the most obvious issues with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put together a tutorial the other day on spaceplane construction, piloting and reentry with FAR and DRE.

All I do is SSTOs, and I can tell you a thing or two about DRE and FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as climbing to orbit and burning up, Wanderfound is dead on, you are going to fast to low. Climb to over 12km before you start to go supersonic, and you should ideally be over 20km before you go hypersonic. I am usually going mach 3 by the time I hit 20km, and mach 5 around 25km. My hull temps rarely climb over 900deg during the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
