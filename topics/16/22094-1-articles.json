I am wondering the demo versions orbital plane for the mun. I have always wanted to go to the moon, me and my dad was close to the moon but not quite. He asked me about the obital planes of the moon. I could not tell him. He said to post about it in the forums and here I am. I have been using yaw to get into my obit. Does it madder if I use yaw or pitch?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T16:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to get your orbital plane the same as the moon\u0027s, which is either going in towards 90 or 270.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daman453","CreatedById":52109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T16:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I told my dad!!!

You can then check the map to see the orbital plane of both your and the Mun\u0027s orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they are aligned and you are low enough, you can transfer when the Mun rises over the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: I also moved this to How To.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qumefox","CreatedById":43197,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T17:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting to Mun is relatively easy. Launch vertical for the first 10km or so, then start your gravity turn. You\u0027ll want to turn to a heading of 90 degrees on the navball, and to an angle of about 45 degrees. Which way you have to turn your ship just depends on how it\u0027s oriented. Doesn\u0027t really matter if it\u0027s yaw, pitch, or both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep burning until your apoapsis is 80-100km or so then cut your engines and drift to 10-30 seconds before apoapsis depending on how much thrust you have available. when your 10-30 seconds from apoapsis, burn prograde until you circularise your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your orbit is circular, just timewarp until mun is just starting to rise over kerbin, then burn prograde until your orbit reaches out to about where the mun\u0027s is and you should get an intercept. if you don\u0027t, keep burning and see if you can get one on the return leg.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daman453","CreatedById":52109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T17:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daman453","CreatedById":52109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T17:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks very much folks.
