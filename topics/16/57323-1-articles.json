I have not tested this so it is just a theory right now.\u003Cp\u003EIf for example your lander has 3 of each science part on it so your return section would have 3 command pods. You could then land on a biome and take all 3 experiments and return to the command section. Once back you EVA and transfer 1 of each experiment to all 3 command pods and reset the tests.
