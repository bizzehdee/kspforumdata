There\u0027s a big difference between a vertically and horizontally launched \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, between an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E spaceplane and things like engine and payload placement can create vessels that handle in dramatically different ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat speed do you reach before you start your gravity turn, what altitude are you at and how far do you pitch over? Starting your turn earlier (50-100m/s) and pitching only slightly (5-10 degrees) minimises the forces applied to the craft from aerodynamic drag and is less likely to cause the rocket to start flipping and tear itself apart,\u00A0 whereas waiting until you\u0027ve built up a lot of speed and then aggressively turning causes a lot more stress on the craft and is more likely to cause things to break apart. Try to stay close to the prograde marker on the navball to minimise drag, throttle your engines back once your time to apoapsis reaches about 40-50 seconds and keep burning until you reach the desired apoapsis, then do a circularisation burn- if you do a gravity turn right, the final burn to enter orbit should be pretty small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets are hard. You need to build something with the thrust to lift off the ground, the delta-V to make it all the way to orbit and still carry a useful payload, then preferably return it to the surface in one piece. Atmosphere-optimised booster engines are inefficient in space, while vacuum-optimised engines don\u0027t work well (or at all) in the thick air near sea level; aerodynamic features are critical at low altitude, but dead weight in space; carrying extra weight reduces delta-V, requiring more fuel, meaning more weight, meaning more thrust is needed, meaning more engines, meaning yet more weight, and so on. It takes a lot of effort to make a functional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket, never mind a good one, and there\u0027s a lot of trial and error involved.
