Using the actual airbreak part is unnecessary, you may want to consider using some of those instead."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:08:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is it just me, or does the new aero give aircraft uber glide rates below 3000m.

Or in flight you can right click the control surface for the options and hit deploy (or wording similar) - can you even edit basic action groups in the basic SPH?"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:09:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E can you even edit basic action groups in the basic SPH?\n\nNo, if you are playing career mode you will have to upgrade the SPH at least once to get access to basic action groups (and upgrade fully to unlock custom action groups)."}]}
