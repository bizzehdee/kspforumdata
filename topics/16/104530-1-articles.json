I have landed ships in every body in the system. Should I put all Kerbals inside the Command Pods and destroy all debris to decrease the amount of objects in the simulation?\n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T13:05:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 01:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seyss**"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T20:13:10Z","Content":"Yes, destroying debris and keep kerbals into pods is a good idea.
