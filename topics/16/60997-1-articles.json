I\u0027ve had it work a few times too, but usually, i\u0027ll have it only work with one of the three engines. The rest flameout immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried a rapier and a turbojet on the back of a normal fuel tank, clipped them both in, tried it with one first, then the other, still flameouts on both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat am i doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(see the proton III space plane for example of it working) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64159-SSI-Proton-III-(Type-1A-Shuttlecraft)-Mun-Capable-Mini-VTOL-SSTO-Pic-Heavy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64159-SSI-Proton-III-(Type-1A-Shuttlecraft)-Mun-Capable-Mini-VTOL-SSTO-Pic-Heavy\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T03:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThread moved to gameplay questions, where it is more likely to receive helpful attention.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SHaFT7","CreatedById":82120,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T01:58:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebump for today\u0027s crowd\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T02:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may need to enable part clipping in the debug menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SHaFT7","CreatedById":82120,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T02:20:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou may need to enable part clipping in the debug menu.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ve already done that, or it wouldn\u0027t let me mount one engine inside the other.

When the flameouts happen try clicking each engine to see if it is deprived of a particular resource. You might need to run fuel lines to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SHaFT7","CreatedById":82120,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T03:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s not flameout from intake air, I have like 12 intakes on this jet. it\u0027s fuel flameout. and i\u0027m not sure why.
