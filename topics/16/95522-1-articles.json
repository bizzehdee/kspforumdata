That gets me an apoapsis around 40km or so, with 10-15s to apoapsis. At that point I treat the situation as if I were on the surface of an airless body: I burn my rockets at full throttle mostly horizontally, but with just enough pitch to keep the apoapsis slowly rising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a basic jet, four intakes, and about 25-30 units of liquid fuel, along with a pair of LV-909 and FL-T400 for circularization, and a pair of radial parachutes for the return.
