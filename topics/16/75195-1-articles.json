The problem with this is that it\u0027s difficult as all heck to work out what direction you want to burn in and where from, when there\u0027s no markers to adjust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a problem that seems to occur regularly with meetups to inclined orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the usual solution to this? I feel like the game really should give you a better indication of how to make correcting burns from situations like this. I must have lost over two hours just making random nodes and moving them around to see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T09:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not seeing intercept markers, it\u0027s because your encounter is not close enough to generate them. Try putting a manoeuvre node along your flight path and adjust the handles gently to see if you can tweak the encounter sufficiently to bring the markers up. Once you do, you can fine tune the encounter to get it as close as you need, which will also give you a blue target on your nav ball for direction of required correction burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T12:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scarecrow88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E it\u0027s because your encounter is not close enough to generate them. .\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t think it\u0027s just about distance.

It started about a quarter of a orbit away, I keep clicking it until I\u0027ve almost got it, then, \u002B1 prograde and suddenly there\u0027s no intercept. Put in -1 normal, and there\u0027s that intercept. Another \u002B1 prograde, and the pe is much better. Try bringing the pe down to \u0026lt;1 million meters, then remove that -1 normal. Suddenly there\u0027s no intercept markers at all, despite the orbit change barely being visible.

Low dV needed = easy to over/undershoot your target. High dV needed = easier to be more precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that you said it was a 6m/s burn. Changing your dV by 1m/s is a 16% variation. Try 0.1m/s or 0.05m/s changes. Changing anything by 16% is going to probably result in a miss. If you launched towards the Mun and changed your dV by 16% you\u0027d miss it as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind there are 6 basic spots on your orbits to get the most efficient course corrections. Apoapis, Periapsis, Ascending Node, Descending Node, and the two points that are 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA ahead/behind your periapsis and apoapsis.

Like, your encounter shows you clearly miss the planet. Then you modify your maneuver node, getting closer and closer, and all of a sudden, it just doesn\u0027t display any encounter at all.
