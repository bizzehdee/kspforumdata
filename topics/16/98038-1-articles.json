Lightly modded: EVE, KAC, KJR. Several missions going on simultaneously; one is a probe on its way to Minmus to fulfill a stationary-orbit contract--so the transfer burn was set up to give a very high Minmus Pe during flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 4 days away from Minmus SOI, roundoff error reached that critical value where it stopped being \u0022intercept Minmus with high Pe\u0022 and became \u0022no intercept at all\u0022. Sigh. This happens, I\u0027m used to it, that\u0027s why I checked up on the vessel. I go to map view to set up a correction burn, and ... I cannot for the life of me get the little \u0022put a maneuver node here\u0022 blue sphere to appear (or, obviously, the node-creation popup). Went back to KSC, reselected the craft in the tracking station. No joy. Picked a different vehicle that also happens to be Minmus-bound, and it\u0027s perfectly happy to set up a maneuver node. Back to the problem-probe, and nada.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuit out of KSC, restarted the game. That one specific probe doesn\u0027t seem to recognize that maneuver nodes exist at all. Other vehicles are fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI note that I had a KAC alarm set up for the Minmus SOI entry. The map view widgets for that (Warp to SOI, Warp to PE, etc.) are still there in map view, but they\u0027re scattered all over the background...presumably because there is no change of SOI anymore? Makes me wonder if this is perhaps a bug associated with KAC, which I\u0027ve only recently installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a known bug? Is there a workaround/fix? Is there something I should look for (and edit) in my persistance file? Or will I have to tweak my orbit \u0027blind\u0027, as it were?

If you get really big, ecliptic orbits, you can start to see that the predicted trajectories aren\u0027t rendered as smooth curves, but as line segments drawn between points (aka vertices; probably every so many radians/degrees around the orbit). The points seem to get further apart near Ap and closer together in Pe. I think what happens is that the game gets confused about how the cursor and the rendered trajectory interact when the points are far apart, resulting in the player\u0027s inability to create nodes near Ap. The vertices being far apart may also be partly responsible for the \u0027disappearing\u0027 intercepts as was described in the OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr I\u0027m totally off and rambling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, you got the best advice possible: create a node elsewhere on the trajectory and drag it to the desired location.
