And please guys, read what I\u0027m going to type, because it\u0027s almost as frustrating having to deal with off topic replies as it is the actual problem here ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nOk, so ever since version 1.0 came out, I\u0027ve been having massive issues launching (any) rockets.\n\n**What happens:** *The rocket starts its gravity turn and over turns, spinning completely round, sometimes more than once, thus wasting a tonne of delta V and fuel, not to mention looking stupid.*\n\n**What I\u0027ve tried:**  *Launching with Mechjeb with countless variations on ascent path settings and so forth. Launching manually with no mechjeb with SAS on and SAS off (stupid, but I had to try). Adding control fins.*\n\nCome on guys, this is f(\\*\u0026ed, what is wrong with this? I know there\u0027s a new aeronautics model in this version, but come on, this is starting to seriously .... me off. I never had this issue before it went full release.\n\nPlease help ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:27:47Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my quick summary:\n\nSpinning out of control essentially comes down to a contest between drag and control. When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\n\nAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 280-400 m/s.\n\nOn a rocket control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty."},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:37:02Z","Content":"There are tons of threads addressing this \u0022issue\u0022 (Really it\u0027s just people not wanting to learn something new)\n\nI don\u0027t feel like searching for the forum threads for you, but I assure you they are out there. \n\nIn order to stabilize your rocket you need to \n\na. Design your rockets so that the center of mass is far above the center of lift. This means putting fins/control surfaces on the bottom of your rocket. Gimballing engines also help.\n\nb. Quickly and gradually initiate a gravity turn; you don\u0027t even need SAS. Don\u0027t let your attitude deviate to much from your (surface) velocity vector. It will take several tries to master.\n\nc. Most importantly, experiment, research, and learn: there are tons of resources to help you. Just look a little harder.
