So why not take this into advantage and use the atmosphere to launch things into Laythe orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically it involves some sort of air launch aircraft (either White Knight style or hypersonic style) that uses the jet engines to propel itself to 10-12 kilometres and accelerate to 600-700 meters per second. The aircraft carries a payload - either a small spaceplane or a rocket - which is then separated and ascends into space using first a solid rocket booster and then it\u0027s own engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on that?

You can only launch things that you delivered there previously. Bringing a complete multi-stage rocket or attaching some kind of payload to a lifter on ground just because you want to launch it certain way does not have much sense, it is better to come with single stage design which can land and return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart of that, Laythe has the same property as Kerbin: untracked craft too far away in atmosphere disappears.

I suggest using liquid fuel only for the rocket section, not solid boosters, that way you can refuel it more easily, though you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E dock replacement boosters if you like.

These pics are of my state of the art for Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first image is of the Lander/ Return vehicle and Rover Boat posing on the launch pad:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/13192238193_1f329b3ec1_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213192238193_1f329b3ec1_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve successfully deorbited them using parachutes only. The image shows them connected, but I actually separate them during the deorbit process. Each lands separately. Each will \u0022land\u0022 on land and also successfully splash down; desirable given Laythe\u0027s water to land fraction. The Lander remains upright, ready to launch. The leg girders separate once the Lander clears the surface, followed by the jet assemblies, outer tanks and aerospike assemblies once in orbit. This is due to the Lander being a return vehicle to Kerbin (using an LV-N); so this is definitely not an SSTO in the pure sense. It achieves orbit with more than enough dV for a Kerbin return. I might be able to asparagus stage the outer tanks, but right now they are \u0022onion\u0022 staged. The science group at the front of the Rover is primarily for balance. Kerbals can do EVAs and collect science prior to their being detached in Laythe orbit, prior to deorbiting. In the version the pic was taken, a Goo canister fell off, but that was later fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rover Boat does well anywhere, using jets for water propulsion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7353/13192339823_0226c3510b_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213192339823_0226c3510b_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third image is not the entire mission package.
