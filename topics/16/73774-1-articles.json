Using stock, B9, procedural dynamics and procedural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even made a seemingly realistic looking STS launcher analog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had big obstacles in actually making the launcher work in the first place by getting the center of thrust right and choosing the right action groups on my engines and all that kind of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres a pic of the shuttle I originally made \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MWlDWzo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had major problems with the old shuttle in terms of re-entry. And simply put I couldn\u0027t re-enter the thing at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I build a new one that actually can do a re-entry.

This version is ofcourse the KSP STS analog on steroids as it has radial turbofan jumpjet engines to Ensure total aircraft capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe problem(s)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProblem 1:\u003C/strong\u003EEven although it can re-enter the atmosphere it can only do so under the condition that it skips the atmosphere with a high AoA. This ofcourse is pretty realistic. The real spaceshuttle had to do so aswell. That\u0027s what sets aside capsules from spaceplanes. The former you aim in near uncontrolled fashion through a safe trajectory to aerobrake. The later (a shuttle) needs to control her Aerobrake maneouvre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for my KSP shuttle to control the re-entry is because if I go in to steep aerodynamic forces (FAR) brake my shuttle and usually spins here out of control. As long as I do a re-entry with a static 15degrees nose up AoA all goes fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQuestion?: \u003C/strong\u003ESo how do I now aim for the KSC? Because I have to control my Aerobrake it can sometimes take 3/4 quarter of Kerbins circumference before I get into the lower atmosphere after actually entering the atmosphere itself. It will be vital to me that there is a way for me to construct a re-entry procedure that ensures I\u0027ll Always land near the ksc. With near I actually mean within like 100-200km. Remember it has jet engines to keep her going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Problem 2: \u003C/strong\u003EThe 2nd major problem is my shuttles tendency to lose control in the upper atmosphere. When I said to re-enter with a AoA of \u002B15 it doesn\u0027t just mean that there is a threshold below that descend plan for my control surfaces to brake from the fuselage. But for some reason my shuttle has the tendancy of pitchting, rolling perhaps even yawing in random directions after passing through 35km altitude. And the greater my speed at even lower altitudes mean that I get to a threshold where the shuttle cannot be further controlled and brakes into pieces the moment it flips over. Unless I keep her skipping the atmosphere so I miss that threshold. But even staying within the safe zone the shuttle just wobbles up and down and banks side to side. Sometimes banks (wobbles) from 30 degrees left to 30degrees right just in a matter of 2 seconds if not less in a continues fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly after decending through 6 km altitude the wobbling and pitching stops altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf turning sas and/or ass off she just points wherever she wants to and changes her mind at any moment she wishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManual input is actually worse then letting Smart A.S.S. take control of the descent. And whenever I tell A.S.S. to turn prograde or control a heading with a pitch up and I get to low in the atmosphere to fast it cannot even control the descent prior to failure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA.S.S. does best jut by wobbling the shuttle in the proper direction while it is able to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou got pictures of the shuttle. The small control surface just under/behind the central lower engine is for pitch. The 2 control surfaces on the B9 wing (SW Winglets) are also for pitch. The B9 control surface next to that (SE 1m) is for both roll and pitch. And the stock outer control surface (delta deluxe winglet) is for roll only. The center tailfin made from 2 procedural wing surfaces and a procedural control surface is for yaw (Obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the parts have been symmetrically attached in the spaceplane hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m posting this because I need help after having spent to much effort, for to long without getting the damn shuttle to work. Atleast not in flight capabilities I so far desire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that creating a spaceshuttle is pretty hardcore. Even more so if you want to make it look any close to a real life STS. I\u0027m not expecting answers straight of the black/smartboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERebuilding it over and over again might eventually present a usefull design. But after all this time I can\u0027t get my brain straightened out on all the possible modifications.

Just in case you try suggesting that to me. It\u0027s not part of the challenge which is what I want.

It\u0027s not that I never deorbited a spaceplane before and not landed it near the ksc. But in the case of the spaceshuttle it\u0027s a whole lot trickier since the B9 cockpit and the B9 cargo bay have so little drag with FAR and your basically in a atmospheric decent halfway around the globe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo remember that my shuttle Always flies in a uncontrolled wobbly fashion.
