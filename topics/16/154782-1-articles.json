not sure whether you are planning a gravity assist. \u00A0It depends on how you fly the mission (okay, that should be obvious), and I\u0027m not really clear on what you intend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission you describe, and please correct me if I\u0027m wrong, involves piggybacking a tiny Minmus lander on a larger Mun lander. \u00A0Whether this mission involves a gravity assist depends entirely on what you do when you get to Minmus. \u00A0The big difference is the number of destinations you reach with a single burn. \u00A0One destination is a transfer. \u00A0Multiple destinations is a gravity assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go to Minmus, make orbit, detach your Minmus lander, and burn to break orbit and send the rest of the stack to the Mun, then that is an advanced transfer which requires a porkchop plot to plan accurately. \u00A0It\u00A0is not a gravity assist because you burn to brake at Minmus. \u00A0A proper advanced transfer to drop from Minmus towards the Mun will point your trajectory along the same vector as you would get from\u00A0a gravity assist, but it is not a gravity assist in the popular sense because you\u0027re doing the trajectory pointing with rocket fuel, not ballistics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, on the other hand, you set up a manoeuvre at Kerbin that sends you through Minmus\u0027s sphere of influence in such a way that it bends your trajectory back to get an encounter with the Mun, and while you are travelling through Minmus\u0027s sphere of influence, you decouple the Minmus lander and have it burn to make orbit on its own while the Mun lander goes on to the Mun, then yes, that is a gravity assist--for the Mun lander part only, but it is still a gravity assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that second one is what you plan, then there are some things to keep in mind as you design the mission:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst, the Minmus lander will need to have fuel not only to land, but also to brake to orbit and possibly also to alter the orbit to what you want for a good landing spot. \u00A0Maybe you don\u0027t care where you land, but it may work out that the flyby you need puts you in high Minmus orbit and you\u0027ll need to come down to close orbit for the landing (unlikely, but you need to consider it).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSecond, Minmus is a little space pebble: \u00A0it doesn\u0027t have enough gravity to bend your trajectory as much as you need for\u00A0good assists.\u00A0 The amount of speed you can get from a body is limited to exactly double your closing speed for a theoretical ideal of an assist that spits you out on a vector precisely 180\u00B0 from a sphere-of-influence\u00A0entry point exactly at the prograde or retrograde vector of the assisting body. \u00A0Getting the entry point right is easy; that\u0027s what you do with a (theoretically ideal) simple transfer orbit. \u00A0Getting the right amount of deflection is the hard part. \u00A0The faster you go with respect to the assisting body (this is the\u00A0closing speed) the more assist you can get, but the faster you go, the less time the assisting body has to warp your trajectory. \u00A0The less warp you have, the less assist you get (and the more you have to alter your entry point so your exit is in the correct direction), so there is a definite optimum that balances the speed you approach against the direction it spits you out.\u00A0 Low gravity only magnifies the problem, and that\u0027s why assists work so much better with massive bodies.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThird, the space pebble orbits far away: \u00A0its orbital speed is so low that what it can give you just isn\u0027t very much if you\u0027re starting from Kerbin.\u00A0 Minmus orbits at a snail\u0027s pace of 274.1 m/s. \u00A0Using the cheat sheet that\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022

Hohmann transfer (also known as a minimum-energy transfer) requires 160 m/s to capture and circularise. \u00A0In effect, capture is the same as making your orbital velocity equal that of the thing you want to capture you, so the difference between these two numbers is our rough closing speed. \u00A0It isn\u0027t exact because you usually want to be on one side or the other of the thing you\u0027re capturing around (you could go for the middle\u00A0but that\u0027s hard on the paint job) and\u00A0Oberth has an effect\u00A0as well, but the point is that our closing speed is 114\u00A0m/s. \u00A0A perfect Minmus assist would give us a total possible change of something a little over 228\u00A0m/s, but that\u0027s not possible. \u00A0It\u0027s still doable--for this job, we actually don\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a perfect assist--but it will be tricky. \u00A0Aim for the idea that a Minmus assist will help you a very little, but you\u0027re probably still going to need to do the lion\u0027s share\u00A0of the job yourself. \u00A0Also, while it is possible to get more closing speed by going with a less-than-ideal Hohmann transfer, you definitely don\u0027t want to do this, for two reasons:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Mun orbits closer in than Minmus, so any energy you add to the orbit beyond the minimum, you\u0027ll need to take away again. It\u0027s inefficient to put energy into an orbit that you\u00A0don\u0027t intend to use, and we\u0027ve already gone over how Minmus can\u0027t give you a perfect assist, so that means more burns and more wasted fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe difference between reaching Minmus orbit and Kerbin escape velocity is 20 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E by the chart. \u00A0You\u0027re too close to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence to go fiddling with inefficient transfers. \u00A0It\u0027s different if you\u00A0are \u003Cem\u003Etrying\u003C/em\u003E to go interplanetary, but you\u0027re not, so there it is.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFourth, remember that gravity assists still depend on transfer windows. \u00A0It\u0027s not a once-a-decade thing, but Minmus\u0027s orbit is inclined by 6\u00B0 from the Mun\u0027s orbit, and you need to take that into account: \u00A0it does not good to arrive with perfect timing\u00A0at the Mun\u0027s orbit only to find the Mun a few million metres to your celestial north. \u00A0You need to start from Kerbin at a point\u00A0that will put you at Minmus in a way that will throw you to the Mun at a time that both the Mun and Minmus will be there when you\u0027re there. \u00A0If the trajectory isn\u0027t getting you anywhere close, you may need to change the time of Munth (or Minth, or both) that you go.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLastly, decoupling the Minmus lander needs to be done in a way that it does nothing to the Mun lander\u0027s trajectory. \u00A0This means either turning the decoupler force to zero in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or using docking ports. \u00A0Don\u0027t turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E until you\u0027ve undocked.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this is probably intimidating; don\u0027t let it be so. \u00A0Gravity assists are a fun, though\u00A0advanced,\u00A0way to play the game, and you can get a lot out of them if you learn how to do them correctly. \u00A0All that is really required is experience with transfers; with that, the next step is\u00A0to grasp how to squeeze several\u00A0transfers out of one rocket burn. \u00A0The real issue here is not that gravity assists are too difficult; the issue is that the gravity assists available from Kerbin\u0027s moons simply aren\u0027t very good. \u00A0It\u0027s just the same as how rendezvous leads to docking leads to orbital space station assembly: \u00A0you need the right skills, but you also need the right tools. \u00A0Imagine trying to dock using\u00A0only\u00A0solid rocket boosters and you can see what I\u0027m trying to describe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun can send you to Minmus with little trouble (in fact, you may want to try that one first), but that\u0027s the end of it. \u00A0It can send you\u00A0interplanetary, but\u00A0it won\u0027t get you anywhere else. \u00A0If you can reach Eve, on the other hand ... well, then you can go\u00A0anywhere. \u00A0Eve is a high-gravity world, easy to reach (under 1400 m/s), inclined with respect to Kerbin (this is needed for gravity-assisted inclination changes) and though it has a moon, it\u0027s nearly impossible to hit that moon accidentally (it\u0027s also nearly impossible to hit it deliberately--\u003Cem\u003Erotten\u00A0125\u00A0km
