It functions identically, except that it is hidden until you right click and extend it. It is most practical for SSTO space planes, where it can easily be incorporated into the design. Although you could just put a clamp-o-tron on a fuel tank like you normally would, the Inline docking port can be more aesthetically pleasing. It just occurred to me that its center of mass is(probably) in the middle, so if you\u0027d like to place a single docking port on a ship or discarded stage you can do so without having to use multiple normal docking ports to balance it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T23:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust one thing about it: When it opens, some of the weight shifts.
