Tackling problems is what a space program is all about. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe root issue here is the weird way KSP handles aerodynamic friction. For some reason, the math includes an extra term for mass. The friction on each part is proportional to the mass, instead of incident surface area. As a result, when your solid booster runs down, it becomes lighter and has less friction than the stage above it. Once this happens, your rocket will want very much to fly backwards. It\\\u0027s like trying to shoot an arrow with feathers on the front and metal at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why you\\\u0027ll see a very stable rockets that are wider than they are tall. As long as the fuel burn is symmetrical, these pancake ships are much easier to fly.
