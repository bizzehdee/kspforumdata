Whilst it\u0027s the obvious answer, I just didn\u0027t think two of the lowest thrust engines in the game would actually need them- the implication would be that the bi-coupler would be just about unusable as a part without struts if they were needed in this simple case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T06:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s odd. I regularly use LV-Ns on bi-couplers and have never needed to strut them like the stronger engines. Pics of the ship might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
