KSP wheels are a bit weird and only a small area at the bottom of the wheel actually generates any traction, so rotating them so they\u2019re oriented correctly could make it move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other thing- traction control is BAD. Traction control \u003Ci\u003Ereduces wheel torque\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0to stop the wheels spinning when you have low grip- great when you\u2019re driving your car on an icy road, not so great when you\u2019re driving a rover on a low gravity moon with questionable wheel friction and traction. Friction control to maximum to get some grip, traction control down below 1 (preferably below 0.5) so you actually move when you press the keys. Oh, and make sure you set the wheel controls to something different than attitude control: by default they\u2019re both set to WASD which makes low-G driving nearly impossible, so set your wheel controls to e.g. the arrow keys instead so you can use them both at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miklkit","CreatedById":201493,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-27T19:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at that screenie I see a problem I have had several times.\u00A0 The wheels are partially sunk into the ground and that rover is stuck.\u00A0 Try ramming it with your rover or pushing it with a Kerbal.\u00A0 If it is pushed hard enough and far enough it will eventually fly out of the ground and then will drive away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-28T17:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was the wheels being to tilted.
