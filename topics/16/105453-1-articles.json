With this new update brings much to our tables. More parts, more power, but most of all, a different aerodynamics system. With new aerodynamics comes new responsibility. I would like for this to be a small section describing the more obscure and less obvious things with new aero.

However, it is more dense because it is cooler, so the speed of sound is lower too.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Air is more dense the farther from the equator one is.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Less dense air means less air in the air-intakes at higher altitudes. Air hogging got massive nerf to the point of being impractical. The diminishing returns of each next air intake are too high.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Since drag is no longer based around the center of Mass, the center of pressure of a craft can change depending on Angle of Attack, leading to behavior the Center of Lift indicator would deem otherwise.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Wing aero is not dependent wing shape and design. To compensate for this, the Lift and Drag values of the wings vary with the Mach of the wings. At low Mach, wings tend to act like they had a high aspect ratio, giving substantial lift but substantial drag. At high Mach they tend to act like low aspect ratio wings, with less drag but less lift.

I\u0027ve always enjoyed performing simulations outside the game in order to test/optimize my designs and to predict performance. Even though the old aero model was flawed, it was well understood and easy to simulate. I\u0027m now trying to get a handle on the new physics model so I can update my simulations. I\u0027ve performed several experiments to try to reconstruct what\u0027s going on, but I\u0027m seeing some things that don\u0027t quite add up.\n\nFirst off, the old model was internally inconsistent and couldn\u0027t have existed in real life. For example, at constant temperature we have the following relationships:\n\nHg = RT = P/\u03C1\n\nwhere H is scale height, g is gravitational acceleration, R is specific gas constant, T is temperature, \u03C1 is density, and P is pressure.\n\nIn the old model we were given the following sea level values: H = 5000 m, g = 9.81 m/s^2^, T = 293.15 K, \u03C1 = 1.223095 kg/m^3^, and P = 101325 Pa. With these numbers we see that Hg does not equal P/\u03C1.\n\nOne of the first things I did was to test the conditions in the new model for internal consistency. Taking pressure, temperature and gravity measurements at different heights at the launch pad I was able to reconstruct the following sea level conditions: H = 6749 m, g = 9.81 m/s^2^, T = 309.75 K, and P = 101325 Pa. (I can show the work if anyone wants to see it.)\n\nAssuming that everything is internally consistent, I computed R and \u03C1 as follows:\n\nR = (Hg)/T = (6749\\*9.81)/309.75 = 213.75 J/kg-K\n\n\u03C1 = P/(RT) = 101325/(213.75\\*309.75) = 1.5304 kg/m^2^\n\nAnd from R we can compute the gas molecular weight, M = 38.9 kg/kmol.\n\nRight away we see some issues. Squad has always made Kerbin very Earthlike in terms of its gravity and atmosphere, yet these values of R, \u03C1 and M are very un-Earthlike. I do not trust that these are the numbers actually being used in the game. In fact, I\u0027ve conducted some other experiments that suggest that the density of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is similar to the old model. I am therefore left to conclude that we again have some internal inconsistency in the way the atmosphere is modeled.\n\nThis leaves me with a problem. It is difficult to reconstruct an atmospheric model if the atmosphere doesn\u0027t follow real-world laws. I\u0027m sure I can devise a model that can reasonably replicate the results that I\u0027m seeing in the game, but my task would be much easier if I could understand exactly what Squad has done and use their modeling method and equations.\n\nIn additional to the above, I\u0027ve performed other experiments and measurements that have provided useful information, but I keep getting to a point where the computations stop making sense. For example, I dropped a barometer through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and recorded a series of pressure-height measurements. From this I was able to compute the scale height at various altitudes. From H, T can be computed if R is known. Although I don\u0027t trust the R value I computed earlier, using it does produce temperatures that are in line with what I expect. However, I also performed tests in which I experimentally derived the drag coefficients for some difference nose cones. In this case, using R = 213.75 produced wonky results. I got much more realistic and believable results using an Earthlike value of R = 287.\n\nI looked through most of the game .config files hoping that I\u0027d find something that reveals how the game computes some of this stuff, but I found nothing.\n\nIf anybody here has any additional data or advice, it would be extremely helpful.\n\n*(EDIT) After making my original post I discovered that the flight stats in the debug menu includes \u0022external temperature\u0022. This a better means for measuring air temperature than the 2HOT thermometer. I\u0027ve already edited the above post to include some revised data. I\u0027ve also been able to collect some temperature-height data that should prove quite useful. I\u0027ll post the results latter.*  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-19T20:35:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2020 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:11:16Z","Content":"Kerbin Atmospheric Temperatures\n\n*(Moderators, feel free to split my posts off into a separate thread if you don\u0027t think this is the appropriate place for them.)*\n\nI\u0027m starting to get a handle on the atmospheric model. I\u0027ve obtained some good temperature measurements and a logical pattern is starting to emerge. \n\nI obtained atmospheric temperatures using two methods. First, I sent up a probe and took direct temperature measures. To do this I used the debug tool\u0027s \u0022external temperature\u0022, which is a better tool than the 2HOT thermometer for obtaining instantaneous ambient air temperatures. This method only worked below 25,000 meters when I could suspend the probe on a parachute. Above that altitude the probe was experiencing aerodynamic heating, either from powered flight or reentry, which elevated the temperature reading and made it useless for my purposes.\n\nFor the second method I sent up a probe with a barometer and took over 100 pressure measurements as the probe descended through the atmosphere. By analyzing the pressure rate of change I could calculate the scale height. From scale height, temperature could be calculated using T = Hg/R. For R the value 213.75 J/kg-K was used, which I computed from temperature and pressure measurements obtained at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E launch pad (described in my previous post).\n\nFrom the direct measurements it became obvious that the temperatures are based on the U.S. Standard Atmosphere (USSA). Major changes in temperature gradient were observed at 8.8 km and 16 km. The USSA has the same gradient changes occurring at 11 km and 20 km. This tells me that the vertical height scale of the USSA has been compressed by a factor of 0.8 to make it better fit the smaller scale of Kerbin. Between the altitudes of 16 km and 25 km, the observed temperatures correspond exactly to the USSA (accounting for the compressed height scale). Below 16 km the measured temperatures were greater than the USSA, though this is likely to be due to a latitudinal modifier. The USSA is based on cooler mid-latitudes while KCS is located at the equator. More measurements are necessary to know for sure, but my guess is that Squad applies a temperature modifier based on latitude and time of day. This modifier is added to the USSA temperature. The adder is greatest at sea level , follows a curved function, and eventually tappers off to zero at 16 km.\n\nMy second method of temperature determination is less accurate and displays considerable fluctuation. However, the results clearly show that the Kerbin temperature profile follows the general shape of the USSA temperature profile. Once above an altitude of about 35 km, the pressure-derived temperatures are consistently lower than the USSA. Because of my inability to take direct temperature measurements at these altitudes, I don\u0027t know if this is a real observation or an artifact resulting from some inaccuracy in my method. I would not be surprised if Squad has also applied a latitudinal-diurnal modifier to the upper atmosphere temperatures as well. As a general rule, when lower atmosphere temperatures are greater than the norm, upper atmosphere temperatures are lower than the norm, and vice versa. This pattern seems to hold true in my pressure-derived temperatures.\n\nAll of the above is summarized in the graph below. The USSA temperature profile includes the 20% reduction in vertical scale.\n\n![Kerbin_TempZ.gif](http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP/Kerbin_TempZ.gif)\n\nI\u0027m encouraged enough by the pressure-derived temperatures that I think this method should work reasonably well to obtain temperature-height data for other planets. So far I\u0027ve focused entirely on Kerbin, though I hope to also reconstruct other atmosphere models.\n\nOne final note regarding the specific gas constant. Although R = 213.75 J/kg-K produces some unrealistic values for molecular weight and air density, it seems to be the value that you want to use for anything involving pressure and scale height calculations. A more Earth-like value of 287 J/kg-K seems to be what you want to use for any calculation involving density, speed of sound, drag, etc. This is an internal inconsistency that exists in KSP that wouldn\u0027t in real life. In KSP, air pressure decreases with increasing height more rapidly than it should according to the values of temperature and density.\n\nNext up, a discussion of drag coefficients. I\u0027ll post some experimental results latter today.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-19T20:28:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2020 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"barfing_skull","CreatedById":126825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T23:22:21Z","Content":"Okay, managed to get a craft to the surface of Eve. I\u0027m trying to see if I can return to orbit.\n\nNow, somebody riddle me this - what\u0027s an engine that has a reasonable enough ISP to get off the surface at those pressures? The LV-T\u0027s were running at about an ISP of 64s on the surface. Great if you want your craft to fall over. I haven\u0027t tried the aerospike, but it\u0027s listed at 290s ASL, whereas the LV-T\u0027s were 280s and 270s. So I\u0027m not sure the Aerospike would fare much better.\n\nOr is getting off Eve\u0027s surface just not possible any more with stock parts, unless you have a nearly weightless craft?\n\nCheers,\n\n-BS"}]}
