Does it simulate turbulence caused by flat faces facing away from the air stream? Any edge near the back of an object causes turbulence, which causes lots of drag, and the larger the flat face, and the sharper the angle between the face and the side of the vessel, the worse the turbulence. I\u0027m wondering specifically for the case of fairings. If you are enclosing a very wide payload, is there a benefit to having the longest possible tapered section behind the payload?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T06:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aero model simulates drag using cubes for each part.

Back then (and up to version 1.1.3) the debug window included a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xkPjGjc.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPhysics/DragProfile\u003C/a\u003E tab that allowed to see what contribution to drag coefficient (Cd) the different faces would generate, variable with speed (in Mach). The profile with Tail (surfaces facing away from the air flow) was representative of the multiplier applied (or rather the divider, as it always seemed to go in reverse to me); that value changes mainly to represent the onset of turbulence approaching and beyond Mach 1. Of course nothing as accurate as using fluid dynamics models (which would be quite expensive to compute, though Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research add-on makes a very good job doing as close as possible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Have no idea why DragProfile was removed in KSP 1.2, but it was mainly used as a debug tool for the early versions of the aerodynamic model).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T08:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know the drag cube model stuff for it but, yes, the effect is there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you taper the rear of a stack as well as the front then the drag is a lot lower.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T18:01:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a long tear drop shaped payload does perform better then a mushroom shape, even if they are the same width and height?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T19:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222975601\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157294\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488650509\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118622\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Errol\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n50 minutes ago, Errol said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo a long tear drop shaped payload does perform better then a mushroom shape, even if they are the same width and height?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say, if mushrooms had to withstand serious aerodynamic flow, they would have evolved in a drop shape too \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. More seriously, yes, long thin objects work best (due to limited cross-section and minimal drag from surfaces parallel to the flow), and having tear drop shape at the extremities greatly reduces front and tail drag coefficient (from the dragcubes geometry with the parts, cosine of the flow incidence angle with each exposed face, and the drag multipliers that mimic Reynolds dependency as a function of speed for different attitude).
