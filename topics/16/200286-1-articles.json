I am a PS4 KSPEE player and I am trying to perfect my landing on the launch pad, now with that being said it is going to require allot of math and I just don\u0027t know the formula, I was thinking about how it should include the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, the weight of the object being landed, how quick the fuel is being drained, it is kind of like the rocket equation but with added steps and it will lead to a different outcome, if there is someone who could make a calculator I know that not only I will appreciate it but so will the\u00A0KSPEE players and the stock KSP players alike. Thanks everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-12T00:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn CBs with no atmosphere, what you are looking for is called a \u0022suicide burn\u0022, and it\u0027s already basically working in your game -- you just need to create the proper manuever node and do a simple mental calculation. However, there are some additional issues. To stick your landing on a very particular spot, you need to burn additional fuel -- there is really no other choice. You place a waypoint on the spot you want to land, target it,\u00A0and do a \u0022docking\u0022 maneuver (you have to be rather good at docking first). But on Kerbin or any other CB with an atmosphere, there is too much variation from drag to make any calculator work at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
