My current career is 3x scale with a 1.2x atmosphere and stock aero and heating, and I\u0027ve been unsuccessful in making one for a larger Kerbin. \u00A0Is it possible to do an SSTO at 3x scale? If so, are there any particular tips? Orbital velocity\u00A0is about 4 km/s and a typical rocket needs 5.4 km/s of delta v to make it to LKO. Any help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T19:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is actually not unexpected behavior. You see, the only reason why spaceplanes are even a thing in KSP in the first place is the fact that Squad has given us jet engines operating at better-than-RL speeds, for use on a planet where orbital velocity is less than one third of RL speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJet engine top speed on Kerbin: roughly Mach 5\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin orbital velocity: roughly Mach 8\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJet engine top speed on Earth: roughly Mach 3.5\u003Cbr\u003E\nEarth orbital velocity: roughly Mach 25\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^--- That\u0027s why we don\u0027t have spaceplanes yet IRL. While technically possible, the atmospheric engines make so little difference that you might just as well build a full-on rocket. Only better jet engines will potentially fix that (see SABRE).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is also the reason you\u0027re failing to build a classical SSTO spaceplane in an upsized solar system. Your jet engines continue to have the same performance, but orbital velocity increases; therefore, the advantage that using jet engines over a pure rocket stage brings with it shrinks rapidly. In stock KSP, a spaceplane is basically \u0022a jet aircraft with a little bit of onboard rocket assistance\u0022. In an upscaled system, a spaceplane will trend more and more towards being \u0022a rocket that airlaunches itself\u0022. Trying the former approach instead will not yield results, because you won\u0027t be able to reach orbital velocity if you rely on jets as much as stock spaceplanes do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy recommendation is therefore simple: stop trying to build an aircraft that goes to space. Start building a capable rocket instead, and then figure out if you can improve it by attaching wings and jet engines. You\u0027ll want to budget at least 2500 m/s worth of acceleration on rocket engines alone. Try and build a rocket stage out of spaceplane LFO fuselages that has about 3.5k dV. Then, see if you can get that thing transsonic under jet power, without the vessel\u0027s total rocket dV falling below 2.5k due to the added weight. I\u0027ll wager a guess and say that breaking the sound barrier with such a craft will be the biggest challenge; due to the way ramjets work, once you\u0027re past that, you\u0027re probably good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-06T19:48:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2016 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T22:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222444943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133594\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457293689\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy recommendation is therefore simple: stop trying to build an aircraft that goes to space.
