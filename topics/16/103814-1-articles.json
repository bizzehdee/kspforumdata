Happened to me too many times to admit...\n\nOne possible solution is to disable the motors (right click and there should be an option there) on the wheels that are spinning the wrong way. This basically puts them into \u0027neutral\u0027 and allows them to spin freely whichever way you\u0027re moving.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T18:20:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to get them spinning in the right direction?

So is it the case that the front and rear wheels now spin in opposite directions? Generally unless wheels are upside-down they all spin the same way, and \u0022forward\u0022 is determined by the POV of the controlling seat or probe. (I can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve put an OKTO on upside-down and had the darn thing drive the wrong way)\n\nDo you have Hyperedit installed? [http://www.kerbaltek.com/hyperedit](http://www.kerbaltek.com/hyperedit) This is a really useful debug tool. If it were me, I would try the following:\n\n--make a new instance of the rover directly from your SPH or VAB craft, and drive it around the space center to confirm it works there. \n\n--use Hyperedit to put a clean ship on the mun (perhaps in a sandbox save, or a copy of your persistent.sfs) and see what happens\n\nIf all else fails and you can\u0027t figure out why the wheels are backwards, then maybe hyperedit a \u0027clean\u0027 copy of the rover up to Mun to replace the glitchy one.

Try to make a modified version with all vertical wheels. If that works, tilt them slightly and make sure they still work.

Launched it the first time, had no problems.  Landed on Mun, scouted about, ended up hitting a crater it couldn\u0027t handle.  Launched rover #2 - exact same design as saved in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E from the first launch.  Get to Mun, start driving it, and the right side of the rover is going the opposite direction of the left side (net forward/reverse motion of 0 - I end up just spinning in circles, depending on the level of traction I can get).  Could I independently control the directions of the four wheels, I would be set, but since I made the rover in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E with mirroring, it thinks I want the same action on the left side as I do on the right.  Going to try to edit the persistent file to make the change to the independent wheels.  Hopefully it will hold.\n\nAfter editing the Left Front and Right Rear wheels to be \u0022Inverted: False\u0022 and the Left Rear and Right Front wheels to be \u0022Inverted: True\u0022, it works as expected/desired.

The navball was always in the correct direction.  \n\nMy theory is that I had the probe core for the lander selected as \u0022Control from Here\u0022 before deploying my inline-decoupleable rover, and so it changed it to thinking it had been made in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.  When I launched the third lander, I made sure not to select \u0022Control from Here\u0022 on the lander\u0027s probe core (letting control just transfer via staging), and it worked out just fine after I decoupled the rover and switched to it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-02T19:42:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2016 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by everchanging02**\n  \nTypo"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T10:54:24Z","Content":"Something similar happens to me all the time. I never tilt my wheels, so I doubt that has anything to do with it. Two suggestions:\n\n1. The quick fix that works quite often is to get your Kerbal out of his seat, and then just let him/her board again (take the seat again). That resets quite a few of the wheel problems.\n2. If that fails, then toggling some \u0022control from here\u0022 between a small probe core and the seat may work. I usually let my Kerbal board a capsule or pod, and then EVA again to the seat... but since you don\u0027t have a pod, you may hopefully let the Kerbal leave his seat, control from a probe core, then let the Kerbal take the seat again.\n\nMy gut feeling is that solution 1 will work, because the rover worked initially, and started failing only after reloading."},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T15:57:39Z","Content":"People!
