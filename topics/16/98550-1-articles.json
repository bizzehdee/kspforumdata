Once your apoapsis reaches your target altitude, cut the engines and start to coast. In map mode, create a maneuver node on your apoapsis, and drag the prograde handle until the predicted periapsis is above 70,000 m.

Your thrust to weight ratio should be \u0026gt;1 but not by too much since too big TWR will result in greater drag losses. Powerful thrust is not ultimately a good thing because such engine has less IsP (burns more fuel and provides extra thrust you don\u0027t need). Your first stage TWR should be around 1.2-1.3 (1.5 at the most) and your final stage TWR can be 1 or even slightly less since you burn horizontally with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you need to turn your vehicle in the direction of your desired orbit and increase your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your apoapsis (the highest point of your trajectory) hits the desired altitude you stop burning and coast towards it (you might want to make additional short burns if you lose speed due to drag).

This further means, that if you have zero payload, and weightless tanks and engines, you will use at least 7/9 of your fuel (the resource - not the bar displayed in the staging sequence, which I think is proportional to the remaining \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv of the current stage) just to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket equation is unforgiving when it comes to \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv. There\u0027s a good reason why we didn\u0027t do any manned return missions to Mars yet in real life...
