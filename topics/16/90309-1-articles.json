I love the Mk2 inline docking port, so I\u0027ve incorporated it into the design facing down, so now the Arrow attached to the Longbow by the two shielded ports on top and the inline port facing down. This design, while a bit more fiddly to dock with, is a much better design from an overall combined craft stability point of view, but I\u0027m having the wonderful problem of only one or two ports wanting to attach at the same time, leaving the remaining ones in contact but not locked together. This wouldn\u0027t be so bad if the fix wasn\u0027t to completely release, back off X distance, and try the whole thing again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is; Is there any way to force a docking port to lock on to another without having to back way off again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sNJDUuB.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022sNJDUuB.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only attached by the bottom one in this shot.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T22:17:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Assault Bunny\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T21:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot that I\u0027ve found.

Docking ports will re-attach without you needing to back off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the description of your problem, I suspect that some of your ports may already be stuck in a state that prevents them from connecting.
