One thing that has me scratching my head is the ASAS package weighs the same mass as the SAS. You\\\u0027d think something with more effect on keeping things stable would have more in it, therefore adding to the mass. It seems to defeat part of the point of just using one ASAS and throwing some regular SAS\\\u0027s throughout the stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I am thinking your final stage doesn\\\u0027t need uber-attention, so I usually put the ASAS on the orbital or the launch stage, and then add an SAS to the final stage which does the trick. But how much do you really need to maintain control? (If you aren\\\u0027t going for something outrageously Kerbal) I seem to do rather well with just one SAS package per stage regardless of how big the stages are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?
