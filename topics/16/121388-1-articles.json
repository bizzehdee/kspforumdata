KAS has been updated since I last used it extensively - back then the whole structure became one new ship and the joints were inflexible, but I\u0027ve since seen that the hose/connector joints can now be rotated and the hose can be (to a certain extent) stretched. When you want to undock, you EVA again and go disconnect the hose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T23:37:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xuixien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xuixien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, connector port to the mining/refining bit, then a connector port on the ferry?

For that matter the EVA kerbal can bolt on the connectors as needed so you don\u0027t have to orient vessels any particular way. Ground pylons can be used to extend pipe as far as reasonably needed or provide a buffer if physics are being unkind to direct connections between ships. The winches also function as docking mechanisms, so you could use one of those as a flexible hose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far the simplest method of doing fuel transfers IMO. And frankly better looking as Rocketeer says, I much prefer a simple hose/pipe hookup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly advise against leaving ships hooked up via pipe without KJR, though. The physics loading on stock tends to rip things up if you do this, KJR\u0027s physics buffer softens it enough to be pretty safe with stable structures though. Never leave them connected via winch cable though, that ends badly no matter what.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xuixien","CreatedById":149208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T23:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just have to figure out how to set up and land some USI parts to set up a kolony.

Use the grabbing claw rather than docking ports, and transferring fuel becomes much easier. I tend to find rovers on Minmus struggle for traction due to the low gravity, and since it will be operating around a fuel refinery, it might be a good idea to use landing gear and RCS thrusters for propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T22:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe good habits on general vessel design can be a problem on making a good refuelling setup. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a pure refuelling operation mass efficiency will hold you back, I find it more useful to think of it in terms of time efficiency. IE; how many tons of fuel can I get to an orbital refuelling station per hour of real time? For that I\u0027ve found having the refuelling station itself land and have all the drills and refining rigging built in. While it\u0027s inefficient to lug around 20-30 tons of extra dry mass, if you are lifting 500 tons of fuel at a time, it\u0027s still way less real time than doing complex docking manoeuvres over and over and over. Landers and refiners and rovers and storage depots are fun if you want to role play and build neat things, but it your goal is getting fuel to ships to do interplanetary work, then I\u0027d say giant lander station all the way. Once in position around Minmus it took about 3-4 minutes to land accurately and 2-3 minutes to hop back into a reasonable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using USI Kolonization, then your life is even easier. Just build a massive fuel depot at your base, and use the logistics hub to zip fuel to orbiting ships. No need for any orbital fuel infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
