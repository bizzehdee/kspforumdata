If you don\u0027t mind that, the only hazard is that other ship parts might block the thrust or be damaged by the heat. You\u0027ll need to place them so they are not obstructed, perhaps by sticking them on struts sticking out to the sides or the like.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-29T17:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nadditionally, having thrusters on the front will not remove the need to flip the vehicle. no way the direction you\u0027ll have to burn will be aligned with your vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
