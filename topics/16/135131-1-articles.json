I would get rid of the Mainsails and replace them with Skippers at the very least (they\u0027re also more efficient engines).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - thrust vector torque: this is certainly far too high. If I were you, I\u0027d make a custom action group to toggle engine gimbal off. Select an action group, select each of your lifter engines and select the \u0022toggle gimbal\u0022 option. You have aero surfaces for control so you really should only need engine gimbal if your ship starts drifting off prograde. The rest of the time it\u0027s probably hurting you because of the next thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - your \u0022control from here\u0022 part: I can\u0027t see where your control pod is. If it\u0027s inside the fairing, you\u0027re asking for trouble due to the first point above (fairing node strength). The payload in a fairing will tend to wobble; if your \u0022control from here\u0022 part is in that payload, then SAS is going to be overcorrecting all the time, probably ending up by ripping the craft apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 - the fairing lift bug: if you get off prograde in the atmosphere, the torque arising due to lift from the payload will wrench your craft around. Although some people complain mightily about this bug, it really isn\u0027t a great problem as long as your gravity turn is done properly: if you stick to prograde all the way up to the upper upper atmosphere, and you do it properly, you will (a) get the most efficient ascent to orbit and (b) never have a problem with the fairing lift bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 - ascent profile: connected to the problem with TWR (with such a high TWR you cannot get the most efficient launch from Kerbin) and the fairing lift bug (as above), and also involving the problem with fairing node strength. If your ascent profile is not good, you will put a lot more stress on your ship, on the fairing, and on the payload, you\u0027ll need to overcompensate with thrust vectoring, and you can easily end up shaking your rocket apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T17:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1 to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159757-n_danger/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022159757\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/159757-n_danger/\u0022\u003E@N_Danger\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s assessment.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think those struts are actually doing anything-- I think that the game doesn\u0027t treat the skin of the fairing as an actual structural element, so the struts are basically just a \u0022bridge to nowhere\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to have a strut between something that\u0027s actually solid (i.e. not the fairing skin) and the fairing-internal payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresumably you want to save mass on the fairing payload, which means you want to strut \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eto\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it instead of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efrom\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it, so that you\u0027ll drop the strut mass when you detach the payload.\u00A0 So find some good anchor spots on the ship, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Einside\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the fairing, so that they can attach to the stuff inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the game won\u0027t let you place a strut directly on top of the fairing base.\u00A0 What I usually end up doing in cases like this is to put the short, squat conical adapter on top of the fairing base, a decoupler on top of that, and my payload on top of that.\u00A0 Then I can strut from the conical adapter to the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news here is that this should become a moot point in 1.1.\u00A0 Squad has announced that fairings are getting two things in 1.1 that should make them a lot more useful.\u00A0 First, they\u0027re fixing the \u0022lift bug\u0022 so that the fairings won\u0027t cause aero instability and make your rocket flip all the time.\u00A0 Second (and more relevantly to your current problem), they\u0027ll add \u0022automatic internal strutting\u0022 so that stuff inside the fairing won\u0027t wobble-- basically, until you blow the fairing, the stuff inside it is rigidly held in place for you, not extra strutting required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your other option besides tinkering with your strut placement is to just wait until 1.1 comes out in the hopefully-not-too-distant future and the problem will go away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jakeb1993","CreatedById":125340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T18:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so a fair few replies so here it goes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I started with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153264-plusck/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022153264\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153264-plusck/\u0022\u003E@Plusck\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s ideas and replaced the engines with skippers to get TWR to 1.99, I placed a OKTO2 inbetween\u00A0the decoupler and the fairing and on launch clicked on \u0027control from here\u0027, Since i don\u0027t have VAB Level 3 yet i couldn\u0027t create a custom action group, but i locked the gimbal on the engines.

One difficulty is that even if you move the fuel line to draw from the brand adaptors at the top, the side stack engines will drain them quite quickly, while the Twin Boar in the centre (since it is drawing from four stacks) will draw much less from the orange tanks. In all cases with that setup, you\u0027ll find it hard to keep the top of the rocket full of fuel without manually locking tanks (which you most definitely don\u0027t want to do asymmetrically during flight).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the best bet would be to replace that 4x symmetry with 2x 2x symmetry, with asparagus-style lines from the top of the first pair to the top of the second pair then to the core.

If you have a long, skinny rocket with the bottom 1/3 as your first stage then as it\u0027s fuel burns, that stage as a whole will become lighter. This moves your CoM forward, increasing your stability. One of the problems (that Plusck already said) is the way the tanks for that one stage drain isn\u0027t ideal. Follow his advice on that, it\u0027s right on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem is that if you have 3 or 4 linear stages all on top of the bottom first stage, then it takes a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0big engine to lift all of that.

First off, the vertical fuel lines between stacked tanks aren\u0027t doing you any good. At least I don\u0027t think they are. What I would do instead is move the horizontal ones between radial stages to the top tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, when you mentioned that when you stage away the boosters they hit the center stack. I would move the decouplers down,\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0move the boosters down on the decouplers as far as you can go. Also make it so when you drop the first pair, that is the East/West pair, because as you start your gravity turn, the West booster is not \u0022on top\u0022 of your rocket. So drop those first when you\u0027re still mostly vertical. I would also get rid of the fins on the boosters and just use the ones on the orange tank.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a side note related to something you said before about the TWR reading differently in VAB than on the pad. The Mechjeb readout is correct, you just have to look closer. There are two columns for TWR, one is TWR and the other is the SLT column. It stands for \u0022sea level thrust\u0022 (I think) and it\u0027s the thrust that the stage will get when you take air pressure at sea level into account.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jakeb1993","CreatedById":125340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-29T15:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222478746\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135131\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459263622\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo real need for the fuel lines on the side (by abundance of caution I understand, but I\u0027m not sure it will give the result you really want...), but that\u0027s a detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor curing colliding tanks, it\u0027s easy. Once you\u0027ve placed your side stack, just use the \u0022offset\u0022 tool (default key = 2) and slide it down the stack a bit. You\u0027ve already strutted at the base so it should work just fine. The mass of the side stacks will be significantly lower than the decoupler, so it\u0027ll be pushed out into the airflow when it ejects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell i Manged to get around some of it by cutting the engines and then letting them go. But the when its the central stage on its own it wants to flip, i had to fight it all the way up but once more when the engines cut it went into a flip. Its costing me nearly 5000 Dv as well to get into orbit with this thing too.
