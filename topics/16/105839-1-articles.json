I ended the tutor and started over. This time I could move the camera, but my altitude was 0m, I could not see anything when in ship view, and I could not set target. I tried ending the tutor, but it wouldn\u0027t let me. It didn\u0027t do anything, the button would visual depress, then nothing would happen.\n\nReloading KSP seems to have fixed it."}]}
