I think that the game uses the intake air and therefore it wouldn\u0027t work but not sure. Besides, you wouldn\u0027t be able to run the jet engine for long with what you can carry you would run out of air way too quickly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-16T04:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK intake air used to be used by jet engines in the same way it uses liquid fuel.
