They only seem to want to attach to other things at the central hole. This leads to some strangeness, it looks like they are just hanging there. Plus it seems impossible to run fuel lines to them. Last, I can\u0027t figure out the rules about sticking them together. In the picture below, it is not immediately apparent but the pair at the top are somewhat clipped inside each other even though I don;t have clipping enabled or anything. I can\u0027t make them attach any other way. But on the side tanks, they will only attach normally - and then the engines won\u0027t attach to anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have resorted to using cubic struts everywhere, but that only got me this far.

I tried the following: pulled off the outermost cubic struts (engines came along) and threw them out. Then tried attaching a second ring of doughnuts and yep, they went on and clipped also. So yah, the above seems correct. But engines wouldn\u0027t attach. So I threw a cubic strut into the middles again, and then was able to attach engines. Up to 5500 dV! (2 engines per tank now to keep TWR up.) So, if I want to join the last two tanks to the main tanks in true asparagus fashion, I guess I need to have to build a wee tower of cubic struts so I can run a fuel line from them to the core somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear - there is no way to attach anything to these things except in the hole at the center? Seems odd to me. Maybe they just aren\u0027t meant for this kind of thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - this modification allowed me to reach orbit, then deorbit and land safely. I was watching dV the whole time and was relieved to see it at around 150 when I touched down. Then I looked at the fuel levels remaining and laughed because I had something like 0.8 units left.
