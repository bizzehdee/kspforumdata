My example. I have a ship in Moho orbit that I\u0027d like to return to Kerbin. Time frame isn\u0027t of importance. Now, to minimize dV, I have to burn at Moho periapsis, and raise apoapsis just to touch Kerbin orbit. However, the Kerbin will not be there at the right time. So, I coast to apoapsis, and then adjust periapsis just slightly so that I intercept Kerbin again at apoapsis after some orbits (usually 3-4). This can be much more fuel efficient than usual Hohman transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for it to work, I need to see predictions for future orbits, not just this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T23:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an easy trick to do this.
