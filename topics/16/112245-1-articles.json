I simply want to get this rocket into orbit but It\u0027s just impossible. First, when I try to get into an equatorial orbit, it starts veering south etc. When trying to get into a polar orbit it starts veering east. Also, it gets affected by aerodynamic forces like crazy. I even tried adding a second huge reaction wheel, guess what it did: NOTHING.\n\nHere\u0027s the craft file. If anyone knows why it\u0027s SO DAMN hard to control this, I\u0027ll love you forever.\n\nThanks.\n\nCRAFT FILE: [http://www.filedropper.com/showdownload.php/qstoss](http://www.filedropper.com/showdownload.php/qstoss) \n\nPS: The craft is called [QST] O\\_S\\_S\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T10:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool**\n  \nLanguage"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T11:31:00Z","Content":"Well, don\u0027t despair, that ship just needs a little help to stay stable.
