Im actually trying to get infinite capacity for both science data storage and science gain storage. Would changing this line to some big number give me the ability to store all my experiments in one go and then return to the science lab in 3 years to find all the data used and some huge number of science gained? Oh and would this cause an exploit like more science gained per data if all data added at the same time or would it be the same as using the normal system. What im trying to say is would the science gain be equal in total to the science gain from the stock system with the same ammount of data?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T20:33:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:00:54Z","Content":"The data change is above, for science also change the line:\n\n    scienceCap = 500\n\nAlso, look through the config file as it will likely answer most of you other questions like data per, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:16:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would changing this line to some big number give me the ability to store all my experiments in one go and then return to the science lab in 3 years to find all the data used and some huge number of science gained?\n\nYes, that will work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh and would this cause an exploit like more science gained per data\n\nNope. You always get the same amount of science per data (that number can be changed as well, by default it\u0027s 5 sci/data). However, the conversion rate goes up with the amount of data stored. If you pack in 5000 data, you will get a lot of science per day. You may want to tweak \u0022researchTime\u0022 figure (but then a lab of merely 500 data will barely generate any science).\n\nI have the impression that this is the most desired feature wrt the new lab mechanics: overstuff your lab and have it churning away without the need to check back every so often.

I\u0027ve only got three Scientists working there, and none of them are superqualified - but the only thing the data cap is stopping me doing is returning the processed experiments back to Kerbal,and that\u0027s only because they\u0027re mixed up wth the unprocessed science awaiting data storage.
