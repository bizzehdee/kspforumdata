Since they have a heat tolerance of 1200\u00B0K I pretty much always blow up most of them while aerobraking. Maybe I could try to break by barely hitting the upper atmosphere, but that takes several passes to have a significant effect. I was also thinking about storing them in cargo bays, but that adds a lot of weight for just solar panels. The other option I had in mind was to spam the smaller panels, but they can block each other, and it adds to the part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T03:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Disclaimer: I haven\u0027t got a chance to do this.
