My .23 career file and my probe only careers are examples of that. They tend to wear out once I\u0027ve progressed beyond technical limitations and reach the sandbox stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a few ideas to challenge myself for a career and I\u0027d like feedback - what you think would be challenging, what you might want to see documented/explored for your own reading enjoyment and what original ideas you might have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first challenge rule I call \u003Cstrong\u003Eslow scientists\u003C/strong\u003E: When using science points you must always unlock the least expensive item on the tech tree. This means that once you pass the starter technologies you\u0027ll be restricted to choosing techs from the current tier only (45pt, 90pt, etc). There is still strategy in deciding what to unlock but you can\u0027t just beeline toward the GravMax anymore which means science point will come much slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second potential challenge rule is \u003Cstrong\u003Elazy engineers\u003C/strong\u003E: All boosters must follow the same design - 2 fuel tanks and an engine in the center, and an optional set of identical radial boosters consisting of 1 fuel tank, 1 engine and 1 nose cone on radial decouplers using onion staging. The selection of engines and fuel tanks is open but the ship must not use any other propulsion until the boosters have all been released. By limiting the booster design it creates an upper limit on how much weight can be put into LKO at each stage in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative booster rule is \u003Cstrong\u003Eskyscrapers only\u003C/strong\u003E: Boosters cannot use any radial decouplers/fuel tanks/engines. It must be one tall stack (couplers are allowed, so you can have 3 tanks side by side fairly early).
