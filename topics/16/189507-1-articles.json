So my question: How are they intended to work together, especially when you choose settings that are asymetric ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fierce Wolf","CreatedById":200019,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-04T14:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what i get,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeploy angle is the default angle the wing control has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuthority limiter sets two things, how much can it deviate from deploy angle AND to which side it will move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CBase","CreatedById":189476,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-04T21:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223699841\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572876976\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200019\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fierce Wolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Fierce Wolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuthority limiter sets two things, how much can it deviate from deploy angle AND to which side it will move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was what I though, but in my tests I never saw a wing control go beyond the deploy angle, even if there was still room in its mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for instance set deploy angle to \u002B10\u00B0 and authority to \u002B5\u00B0. I only saw the wing move between 5\u00B0 and 10\u00B0, but never to 15\u00B0 although it could. However at deploy angle 0\u00B0 it semms to move from -5\u00B0 to 5\u00B0. All visual observations, I did not had time to throw together code to monitor control wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jclovis3","CreatedById":188635,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T10:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, take a look at air breaks and try this test. You will find that if you right click on them or any control surface, you can click a deploy button. With breaks, hitting the break key will deploy them. Air Brakes can also be used as control surfaces. Any control surface will apply control authority settings when used for control. Anything that deploys, such as breaks, will use the deploy setting. Note one other thing. If you mirror control surfaces, they will turn correctly for control, but will turn in opposite directions for deploy. This can be used to add mirrored rudders to your breaking action if you want them to invert opposite one another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want air brakes to use a smaller control authority if you\u0027re going to apply them as a control surface to pitch but the maximum deploy to be effective in breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took me a while to figure this out so don\u0027t feel bad.
