I had one rescue ship returning to Kerbin and I was sending a 2nd out to another planet. Once the 2nd ship entered orbit around Kerbol on it\u0027s way to my stranded science probe, I switched back to the first ship with Bill orbiting Kerbol on an intercept course with Kerbin.

Luckily both ships were on course for an SOI intercept, so I thought I could just accelerate time until one of them was out of Kerbol orbit. I closed the game and called it a night, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I had an idea- I installed KSP on a slightly older laptop and tried my save file. Amazingly, the Kraken did not show up, so I completed the rescue missions and exited and brought the save file back to the original computer. Kraken has stayed away since then.. so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO- Kraken definitely seems to be a pre-determined thing, but also random in a sense, as it seems to depend on the exact hardware running the game. Perhaps if you run into a particularly damaging Kraken attack, you could send your savefile to another player, have then open the game and load up a few ships, and if the Kraken doesn\u0027t attack, they could then send the savefile back to you and you can see if the Kraken has been dodged?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Designer225","CreatedById":48514,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T05:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECertain Krakens probably attack certain types of vessels (Kerbals are vessels... weird...) at random times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you finished loading Bill\u0027s ship, Hell Kraken and NaN Kraken (or just NaN Kraken, or just Hell Kraken) attack(s), sending KSP into a pile of shenanigans.
