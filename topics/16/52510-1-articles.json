The weight of the craft acting on all the parts will cause structural failure if it\u0027s not held in place properly. Usually it\u0027s because the craft in the center isn\u0027t supported. If you can\u0027t put clamps on the center of your craft, you can put a stack decoupler on the bottom of the rocket engine and then put a big metal plate on the bottom of that, then put one docking clamp on the bottom of the plate. When you launch the craft, stage it so the the decoupler releases, but the launch clamp that\u0027s holding it stay\u0027s attached by putting the clamp in the next stage. This prevents the shrouds from moving and bumping into the engines. If this doesn\u0027t work, try using different methods of lifting your payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyoung_mi","CreatedById":92312,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T18:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really sure, I think it was maybe the construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have an issue when I use prebuilt craft files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think perhaps, sometimes when i place a single item, I still have the mirroring on, and it tries to place 2 or more times in that single spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this happens, the connection is not really made, or glitched..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to pay better attention to my mirror settings, and things have been working much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T18:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn VAB, the ship is in weightless state.

You need to place them so they don\u0027t allow radially mounted parts to wobble along the separator or their other radial anchor point. Notice also that you can always only put a radial part on one separator or girder, if you try to use more (e.g. a radial tank mounted on two separators) only one will be actually used and the rest will be just facing the part. Only the \u0022strut connector\u0022 can be used as additional anchor, the whole rest of the ship will always be a \u0022tree\u0022, branching out from the first part you placed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart of that there are also some bugs. The ship may start breaking apart on its own if you either shifted the initial part too far from the center where it was initially placed (far enough to not be above the launchpad) or in certain cases when you append complicated parts using symmetry modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T18:34:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T19:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes this happens to me with well-built craft; happened last night with a craft that utilized one of Temstar\u0027s Zenith boosters - a design I\u0027d launched a hundred times without flaw alreadty.

When the rocket goes out to the pad, the game will automatically raise up your rocket so the engines are at ground level; this is a good way to ensure that they are indeed flush with the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Before the physics engine releases, try zooming the camera out away from the rocket. No seriously, try this; I don\u0027t know why this works sometimes but I can tell you from experience that it does.
