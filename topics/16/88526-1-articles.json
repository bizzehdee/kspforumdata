As usual, I\u0027ve come to forums for some assistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a lander on Tylo that needs to rendezvous with a return vehicle, in a somewhat eccentric orbit. The problem is the lander has nowhere near enough fuel to reach that eccentric orbit. It can get into a very low circular stable Tylo orbit (~20km), but not much more than that. This presents a significant problem for a direct-to-rendezvous launch, as I can\u0027t get my velocities anywhere near matched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe periapsis of the return vessel is at 21K, so it\u0027s something I can get to same altitude as, if only for a short period of time. Short of getting out and pushing (a LOT), is there anything I can do to get a temporary rendezvous? I can\u0027t control the return vessel thanks to a design oversight, so lowering its orbit is unfortunately out of the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can provide more info/pictures on request.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T04:39:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jodo42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T02:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027d better be ready to get out and push ... or send a refuel mission for the lander, or a \u0022control\u0022 mission (docking port, some sort of probe core, docking port) and maybe some fuel for the return vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T02:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI gather the orbiter has no probe core, but does it have propulsion and an empty manned pod?
