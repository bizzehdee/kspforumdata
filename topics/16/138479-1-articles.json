What\u0027s better/easier/whatever, sending all the parts up in kerbin orbit, connecting them, then using rockets to boost to the other planet (in this case, minmus), or sending all the parts to the other planet, and connecting them there? Or do you guys prefer something else? Or does it not matter at all? I\u0027m just trying to see what you guys think is best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T18:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the surface or in orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn orbit it depends... I wouldn\u0027t recommend more that 5-10t per module and run it over in sections. or 30-40 t in a one shot if it isn\u0027t too floppy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the surface build the whole base and sky crane it down... regardless of the size. Docking on the surface has been hard and futzy in previous versions. Precision landing even more so.\u00A0I don\u0027t know how nice it is in 1.1.x, I haven\u0027t tried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snikersnee","CreatedById":145105,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T19:17:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was talking about in orbit, but thanks for the advice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T19:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart-count issues seem to be improved under 64-bit / KSP 1.1, but they will always be a concern.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince putting lots of small things together adds parts (docking ports, if nothing else) and wobble if you have to turn or move the thing, I\u0027d tend towards biggish modules for the core of the station, with smaller ones attached to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it\u0027s pleasing to make a station that \u0022feels right\u0022 and is functional, so you might want to concentrate more on the logic of the arrangement (labs and crew modules separated from fuel storage / ISRU, for example) and ease of access (well-lit docking ports with plenty of clearance and no easily broken solar panels nearby). If those are your main concerns, the question of how many bits it needs to be broken down into will probably impose its own answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, everyone seems to have their own style. Mine are always a mess, like somebody ran through a spacecraft junkyard with a gravity gun. And I\u0027m constantly staring at my attached science experiments and never-again-used engines and wondering why I didn\u0027t make them separable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shikashi","CreatedById":152398,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T20:03:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just send a station core (one Rockomax Hub with a few docking connectors) with maybe one or two modules attached and send separate modules to it afterwards and dock them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T20:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to send up as big a thing as I (and my computer) can handle. If I need more than that, I send up 2 things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSending one thing to another planet (or moon) takes half the (real-world, you-playing-the-game) time as sending 2 things. For 2 things, you have to launch twice, set up 2 ejection burns, 2 insertion burns, etc. You don\u0027t have to time warp there twice if you eject them at the same time, but once at your destination you DO have to dock them together that takes time and (as has been pointed out here) causes the resultant vessel to be less rigid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough if you\u0027re new, you could very likely use the experience. That should not be ignored.

So In the end, even the station is expendable, I usually don\u0027t need to. Further more, my stations are usually build as a ship, so they can be moved to another SOI, even without undock lateral ships\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is what came with...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/119272-salamander-exploration-simple-and-efficient-space-station-to-everywhere/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
