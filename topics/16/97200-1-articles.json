First ship is the base and it\u0027s landing engines (dual LV-909s with enough fuel to land the thing and nothing else) Second ship is the command ship, built with a hefty amount of fuel and a single LV-N to push the thing and it\u0027s payload to the Mun, undock it, and head back to reunite with Mission Control. I docked the two successfully in low orbit but for some reason I can\u0027t access my maneuver nodes!

Give it a bang! Kick it! By which I mean, go back to the space center, switch to another ship, focus on another planet, quicksave then quickload, might even have to exit KSP and restart it. If timing isn\u0027t an issue, sometimes just warping around can help.
