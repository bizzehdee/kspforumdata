The problem is the high dv requirements to lift a tank of fuel, transfer to LKO rendezvous, then return to Mun base afterwards. Today I set up a mining platform on Minmus to see if it brings much in the way of fuel savings. It will have to wait until tomorrow to find out as the transfer tanker with Jeb and Bill left Mun then tumbled into Minmus and exploded because I ran out of fuel. Too many course corrections and unevenly loaded tanks (yeah, I\u0027m an idiot). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong explanation to ask - how do you efficiently transfer to Minmus from Mun orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T13:15:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Shirt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T22:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMining in the Kerbin area really isn\u0027t a great idea anywhere, it\u0027s just not worth the effort compared to just launching fuel from KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the question though, you just need to exetend it out until you find an encounter. Play with the maneuver nodes till you find one. It\u0027s actually a bit easier in the opposite direction unfortunately because ejection from Minmus often puts you at the right inclination for the Mun. Whenever I do a tour contract, I got to Minmus first. Nevertheless, you should be able to find one. Worst case scenario, try to get close to it and then treat it like a rendezvous in LKO. Really there is no difference between catching a craft orbiting Kerbin and catching the Mun or Minmus, except the latter two have their own gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T23:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMining in the Kerbin area really isn\u0027t a great idea anywhere, it\u0027s just not worth the effort compared to just launching fuel from KSC.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t disagree.

All rules that apply to interplanetary transfers also appy to going from Mun to Minmus, and it in fact makes a great practice mission for newcomers before really committing to sending your poor Kerbals scary far away from home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing to learn is the ejection vector. To go \u003Cem\u003Eoutwards\u003C/em\u003E (Mun to Minmus), you need to burn so that you leave the body\u0027s sphere of influence in its direction of travel. You will perform your burn on the \u0022night side\u0022 or \u0022far side\u0022 with respect to Kerbin, and eject \u0022forwards\u0022. This raises your apoapsis on the other side of Kerbin. To go \u003Cem\u003Einwards\u003C/em\u003E (Minmus to Mun), you need to burn so that you leave the body\u0027s sphere of influence in the direction opposite to its travel. You will perform your burn on the \u0022day side\u0022 or \u0022near side\u0022 with respect to Kerbin, and eject \u0022backwards\u0022. This lowers your apoapsis on the other side of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, to make an efficient transfer, you need to wait until the two moons are aligned correctly with respect to each other (your \u0022transfer window\u0022). Where is that alignment? Well, when you make your ejection burn from the Mun as described above, and raise your apoapsis just far enough for it to touch Minmus\u0027 orbit, you want Minmus to be in that exact spot at the time you reach that apoapsis. You can technically figure this out with math, or even let a mod or website tell you where it is... But you can also approximate it quick and dirty via the close approach markers. Target your destination, make a maneuver node to simulate your transfer, and check look for the \u0022target position at closest approach\u0022 marker. If it is in front of where your orbits touch, you must wait longer for the window to approach; if it is behind, you just missed the window (but you may still be able to get an encounter by expending a bunch of extra dV to fly faster than normal and \u0022make up lost time\u0022). if you don\u0027t get any markers at all, you\u0027re nowhere near a window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept... you need to pay attention to inclination. Just like going from equatorial low Kerbin orbit to Minmus often makes it difficult to get an intercept, going from Mun to Minmus (and back) poses similar problems. To get close approach markers, you need to actually get your apoapsis close enough to the target orbit, and that may require a normal/antinormal component in your maneuver node or a midcourse correction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
