Once you finally leave the atmosphere it takes maybe 200-1500 dV to circularize depending on your apoapsis (the lower the more dV you have to spend to reach orbital velocity at your altitude) and then most orbital maneuvers don\u0027t take that much dV e.g. going to the Mun is 800 or so (to get there and smash into it, that is - realistically you will want to get captured into a stable orbit and maybe land, oh and maybe return as well). Interplanetary isn\u0027t actually that much more expensive, and if you are going to a planet with an atmosphere you can use that to slow you down upon capture instead of thrusting retrograde at the periapsis, it saves a ton of fuel (see aerobraking).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-19T09:21:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2013 09:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Bacterius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T13:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hughesj\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hughesj\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother question is when I put solid fuel rocket boosters on my rocket it didnt change my Delta V.

The way delta-V is calculated, it\u0027s dependent on two things: the potential change of mass and the \u003Cem\u003Especific impulse\u003C/em\u003E of the engine involved. Any time you burn a rocket, you\u0027re throwing mass out the fiery end; SRBs are no different. They\u0027re just pretty lousy about it, to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027m explaining this very well...okay, so let\u0027s say you\u0027ve got a two tonne payload and you want to throw that into space with a couple of the big BACC SRBs (you can\u0027t actually do this, but let\u0027s just go through the math real quick). When an BACC is fully fueled, it weighs 7.875 tonnes; when it\u0027s empty, it weighs 1.5 tonnes. You\u0027ve got two of them and a two tonne payload, so fully fueled your rocket weighs 17.75 tonnes, and empty it weighs 5 tonnes on the nose. With me so far? SRBs have a specific impulse of 230s in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we do the hard math: the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation - deltaV = ln (M-full / M-empty) * 9.81 * Isp, where ln is a natural logarithm (find the button on your calculator), M-full is the full mass, M-empty is the empty mass, and Isp is the specific impulse. So we have deltaV = ln (17.75 /5) * 9.81 * 230 = 2858.61 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong and the short of it: any fueled rocket gives you delta-V.
