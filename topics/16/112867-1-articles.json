The move you are doing is referred to as the insertion burn in that planner. If you leave at the first window of the game on day 231, and perform an optimal Hohmann transfer where your apoapsis just barely arrives at the planets orbit at same time the planet arrives there, then the planner says the insertion burn should only cost you 640-650 m/s dv.

This burn should be almost all prograde and cost a bit less than 1000m/s during a good time for a transfer (a transfer \u0022window\u0022).\n\nThe insertion burn (sometimes called the capture burn) is done at Duna periapsis to match velocity with the planet. This burn should be retrograde and cost about 600m/s for a low orbit (again assuming a good window). This is the one that can be significantly reduced by aerobraking in Duna\u0027s atmosphere.\n\nAlmost always it is useful to make correction burns between the ejection and insertion to fine tune the way the vessel will approach Duna and set the desired Duna periapsis. These burns should be all radial, antiradial, normal, or antinormal (depending on how the approach needs to be changed) and should only be a few dozen m/s at most."},{"CreatedByName":"KarateF22","CreatedById":143090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T02:07:48Z","Content":"If all you want is Duna orbit the easiest way to get there is with an ion Microprobe, their tiny mass and sky high delta-v essentially lets them do laps around the solar system, let alone Duna."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T21:26:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think I spent around 2200 including leaving Kerbin orbit which would be 950 so that would put me pretty close to 1100.\n\u003E But for me to put my PE inside Duna\u0027s atmosphere wouldnt that require me to first make the insertion burn?\n\nIt sounds like your transfer is less than efficient then -- the 1100 m/s I cited is for everything, including the escape burn (getting to Duna is less than 200 m/s on top of escape). Because of the Oberth Effect and because Kerbin is much larger than Duna, spending an extra 1000 on the escape will probably translate into a 2000 m/s capture burn.\n\nAs for aerocaptures, no you don\u0027t need to perform an insertion burn first (which is why it\u0027s called an aerocapture). Assuming you did your transfer properly, your craft should enter Duna\u0027s SOI and then zip through.

Corrections burns should almost always be in the plane of radial/antiradial/normal/antinormal, those sorts of burns are actually less efficient the faster you are going.\n\nThe reason early corrections are cheaper is simple geometry: An early correction to adjust periapsis might be a trajectory direction change of a fraction of a degree; the same adjustment to periapsis when much closer might be a direction change of several degrees and thus cost more delta-V."},{"CreatedByName":"Rocksummit","CreatedById":143864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:32:40Z","Content":"Ok.

The magnitude depends on the launch window (mine was in year 7, iirc), the difference isn\u0027t all that huge, and it\u0027s a hassle to set up. So I do by no means recommend it.

And specifying this is terms of Delta V doesn\u0027t tell us any of that.. but I am going to assume you want to be uber conservative on fuel.\n\nEveryone who says \u0022use a launch planner\u0022 is 300% right.. first, plan the most efficient time to launch from planet A to Duna.\n\nSecondly, the type of craft you use depends on your payload.\n\nI\u0027ve had some success in ultra conservative fuel payload transfer systems using Hooligan Labs \u0022Death Star\u0022 torpedo shaped airship envelope. You can do ultra heavy loads like this.\n\nSo for this idea, what you do is make a payload \u002B orbital transfer \u002B interplanetary stage (with a primary pusher like nuclear rockets, so you can use 100% liquid fuel) that will fit symmetrically between an even number of envelopes. Then you size the envelope number onto your superstructure so that the payload is essentially weightless up to at least 25k. Easy to test.. just launch this by itself and wait. If it reaches above 25k, you\u0027re all set. You attach the payload stage with docking clamps. \n\nSecondly, you attach a segmented, single winged body on the outside of each airship envelope and attach Jet Engines, fuel, control, electrics, etc. I like putting Kerbals into everything, personally, so I use Mk1 cockpits on each side, but you could use probe bodies for everything. I use a probe body for the orbital transfer stage. You want to keep the tanks symmetrically distributed along the center of of the airship envelope, and THEN attach wings to determine lift characteristics.\n\nTo fly it, launch it from the runway at low thrust.. it should lift very easily, or it may even liftoff without thrust..if it does that, lower the buoyancy or set the altitude control to 0.00 meters per second.... you want to bite into the air a bit to get forward momentum.. and just be gentle with the throttle and controls. Don\u0027t get to high speeds until you are above 10k.\n\nIt takes some learning to get used to.. and I lost a lot of them.. but I have gotten the profile down pretty well. With this idea, you can lift huge payloads to orbit with minimal fuel expended. You may have to add nuclear rockets to the Airship rig to maintain thrust at very high altitudes, but here the trick is to get higher altitudes with longer dwell time because this craft will have a lot of drag.\n\nTo recover is very very easy. Don\u0027t try to use the altitude control while plummeting... it ends up making you like a cork bobbing up and down.. unless you want to just leave it running for 3 hours while it figures itself out :-) Anyhoo, I would set the altitude control to -20 meters per second or so and have a few chutes for safety, but the wing body should bring it all down pretty easily on a glide. If you are gentle, you won\u0027t even see reheating.\n\nMy next step is to try to figure out how to take the whole thing into orbit, thus removing the need for an additional stage :-)\n\nAnyway, FWIW. There you go! This probably doesn\u0027t matter for smaller payloads and you\u0027ll want to go the spaceplane route for those, but I think for heavy and bigger loads, this design wins.\n\nMaybe at some point I\u0027ll perfect it so its more aesthetically nice and better performing and post! :-)\n\n--DLJ\n\nPS: I have had ideas of using structural wing parts tom completely enclose the envelopes and give the whole thing good aerodynamics and some extra lift.. like some of the lifters people make from girders and wing parts."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T02:47:36Z","Content":"I find inclination changes (normal burns) are best done midway. Any earlier, and you have trigometric loses. Later and you have a shorter distance traveled with the changed momentum. I strive to place Pe on the orbit I want so I can do a elliptic capture followed by a cheaper plane finalization.\n\nRadial changes are only to adjust arrival time, earlier is better.

An encounter on the opposite side from Kerbin, on a tangent trajectory will be less dV-hungry than just crossing the path at any random point.\n\nYou can \u0022simulate\u0022 the encounter dV by placing a node at (slightly before) the encounter point and tuning it in such a way that the resulting orbit will 100% overlay the target orbit. You\u0027ll know both the dV and where your \u0022retrograde relative to target\u0022 direction lies.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But for me to put my PE inside Duna\u0027s atmosphere wouldnt that require me to first make the insertion burn?\n\nYes. If you make it 100 days before the encounter, the burn will be of order of 3m/s of delta-V.\n\nJust don\u0027t delay your insertion burn until you enter Duna\u0027s SOI. Make the first corrective maneuver good 100 days or more from the target (\u0022Focus View\u0022 on Duna, turn in such a way that the node (somewhere far out there) is visible, then adjust the node so that the trajectory passes through the upper atmosphere. While performing the burn stay in the same view and instead of trying to get 0 on the maneuver dV clock, finish the burn at lowest thrust possible (if needed, set thrust limiter of your engine to 5%, this increases throttle accuracy 20x) and watch as your actual trajectory approaches the surface. Hover over the periapsis and when it enters the atmosphere, cut the thrust (and reset the thrust limiter back...)\n\nSeriously, if done early enough, the burn changing a \u0022distant encounter\u0022 into \u0022aerocapture\u0022 can be of order of 1m/s."}]}
