I put a fairing on it, that would shield away the experiments during aerobreaking. But I\u0027ve now run into an issue where, when I try to deploy the fairing, half of it gets stuck onto the rest of the spacecraft. The craft then proceeds to shake violently. If I try to EVA the game crashes, and I can\u0027t timewarp.\n\nAnother thing I tried was to send out the probe that I brought with me, fly it far away, and then jump back the the mother-craft with map-mode. But that just put it in a weird \u0022I am in space, but my status says that I am landed?!?\u0022 state, where I can\u0027t do anything. Accelerate. Timewarp. And my speed is \u00220\u0022.\n\nIt might be a bug/issue with the \u0022Close fairing\u0022 around another object.\n\nSo I was wondering if anyone had an idea to how I can fix this? One thought I had, was to go into the vehicle file, and edit it to make it deployed in that way? But I have no idea how to do that.\n\nSo any help would be very much appreciated, as this is a long run spaceprogram without any cheats, but this I find acceptable to do something about! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s a few images to clarify.\n\n![screenshot137_zpsvqj5lshq.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot137_zpsvqj5lshq.png)\n\n![screenshot138_zpstoe2h2m1.png](http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot138_zpstoe2h2m1.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T00:19:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The-MathMog**"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T15:18:04Z","Content":"It depends, but if push comes to shove, start rolling with SAS of and hopes it gets flinged away.
