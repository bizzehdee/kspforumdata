The assertion was that open docking ports constantly poll for other ports\u00A0and check distance and lots of them doing this causes performance degradation. So is this true? If so, one of the engineers at Icarus Station is going to hop in the orbital bug that\u0027s armed with a flame thrower and start disposing of unnecessary ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
