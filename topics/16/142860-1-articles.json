With Alt-right clicking or adding shift or control or some combination of keys, you are supposed to be able to break symmetry\u00A0and individually select things --\u00A0so that you can change individual settings. But that didn\u0027t work very well at all in that version. I could partially do it then, but I ended up modifying the settings on 3 out of 4 wheels or some damned thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tested that part of it since then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in the end I found I was being stupid in the first place. All I needed to do to fix the rover wheels was select a proper \u0022control from here\u0022 point on my rover.
