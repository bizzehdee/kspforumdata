You don\u0027t need only the center of lift to be behind, you also need LIFT itself, if you can\u0027t lift early enough, add control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T02:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, get Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research.

If you can only pitch 5 degrees up, it sounds like you don\u0027t have anywhere close to enough pitch authority; try moving the control surfaces farther away from the center of the plane in order to increase the leverage exerted.

Are they aerodynamically sound?
