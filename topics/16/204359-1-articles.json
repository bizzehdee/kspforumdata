I\u0027ve tried restarting the game but there\u0027s no change. I even tried shutting down the engines on one ship, but there was no change - firing the engines should have sent it pinwheeling, but nothin\u0027.

Then I added a Sr Docking Port to the top of the base, below the ship\u0027s docking port, undocked/re-docked in orbit and it still failed. Then I put a Jr. Docking Port on the bottom of the base, brought the ship around and docked it so it would be pushing the assembly, and VIOLA! it worked as normal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QFBlpgz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022116.69\u0022 height=\u0022769\u0022 width=\u0022659\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QFBlpgz.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0 !\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo: any suggestions on what I can do to get this beast to behave?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-14T22:22:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2021 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by maddog59\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded results of other scenarios\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-14T23:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s happening is that components below your engines are blocking the thrust from those engines. The game doesn\u0027t model exhaust flow around parts in the exhaust flow of the engines. If there is anything within a certain distance of a straight line coming directly aft of the engine then it assumes the thrust is getting blocked by the ship and you will have no net forward velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why your craft worked when you put the engine cluster behind the main vessel. There was no longer anything blocking the engine exhaust. Even a small winglet in the path of a jet engine won\u0027t allow exhaust flow around it. There literally can be nothing placed directly in line below the path of the engine exhaust within about 20 or 30 meters of the engine (I\u0027m unsure of the exact distance required.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolutions include rotating your engines so that they aim slightly away from the center-line so that the line of thrust will bypass parts below them; or mounting your engines with nothing under them or at least on arms long enough so that nothing is blocking their exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to account for engine thrust vectoring, too. Those \u0022Thud\u0022 engines have a very large gimbal angle and could very easily aim back towards parts of your craft during hard pitch and yawing. If that happens then the line of exhaust will be blocked on one side of your vessel but not the other, leading to an uncontrollable situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-14T23:15:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2021 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-15T00:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224020052\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221628982157\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to account for engine thrust vectoring, too.
