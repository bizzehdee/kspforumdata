I launched a science getting craft with goo, material bay, science lab, antenna and a crew pod that\u0027s meant to return and I\u0027m not sure how to get the most science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I can store reports and return them it seems I can get more science from doing that and cleaning the experiments with the lab. Or should I get the science, up it with the science lab and transmit it, then do the experiments again and store them in the crew pod. But what seems to happen whenever I transmit all my data is that it transmits the stored stuff too so each time I enter a new biome it seems I\u0027m going to lose them.

DO NOT \u0022transmit all data\u0022, instead ask to review the stored data, then pick and choose which ones you want to transmit (it\u0027s the same window as when you first take the data, except scrollable; hit \u0022store\u0022 to do nothing and hang on to the already-stored data).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can return the science lab to Kerbin, then don\u0027t transmit at all. Store multiple copies of each experiment in the science lab (unlike the crew pod, there is no conflict between \u0022identical\u0022 experiments) and return them all. 3-4 copies should be enough to max out your science, and 2 will get you close enough for all practical purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-02T20:18:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2014 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T21:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Starstrider I think I understand now.
