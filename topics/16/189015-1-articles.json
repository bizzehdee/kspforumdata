But that one requires a strong antenna, since the satellite will be way above or below the equatorial plane 98% of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor circular orbits, the larger the orbit is the less frequently the occlusion will happen, but the longer the occlusion will last. On average, the total fraction of occluded time vs. visible time improves quite a bit with a large orbit, but on the very rare cases where there is an occlusion, you\u0027ll have to deal with 20-30 minutes of no signal. Also, the larger you make the orbit, the better the antenna must be, because it will swing farther out on the opposite side of Kerbin from your vantage point on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, you can have a guaranteed 100% uptime with two satellites. Does not matter if you arrange them in an equatorial orbit, or a polar orbit, or anything in between... the Mun will always be able to see at least one of two satellites if they are phased 180 degrees apart. An orbit as low as 500 km above Kerbin\u0027s surface is easily enough for this, assuming you can reach this distance from the Mun. If not, any higher orbit works just as well, up until a point where you get so close to the Mun\u0027s own orbit that the distance to a satellite phased 90\u00B0 is approaching the distance to Kerbin again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are concerned about occlusion, I\u0027d go with the two-satellite solution. If you\u0027re concerned about cost, use one in as large a polar orbit as is practical, and accept that once in a blue moon you\u0027ll have a short blackout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-18T21:21:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-19T11:21:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223689491\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189015\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571409634\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022120544\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul23\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, paul23 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a commnet system active that works \u0022up to\u0022 3 Mega meter semi major axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess it won\u0027t be long until you get better gear.
