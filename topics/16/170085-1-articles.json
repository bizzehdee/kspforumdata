There are also circular orbits (a special case of elliptical), hyperbolic (an escape trajectory), and parabolic (a special case of an escape trajectory).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn elliptical orbit is an ellipse (an oval), in a plane, with one focus of the ellipse at the body that you are orbiting around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe oval is defined by the semi-major axis (which specifies 1/2 of its length along its long axis), and its eccentricity (how oval vs. circular it is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSemi-major axis is equal to (1/2 * (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E)), where periapsis and apoapsis are measured from the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecenter\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the orbited body, not its surface. This, by the way, is the only orbital element necessary to calculate orbital period (how long each orbit takes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEccentricity is equal to ((\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E) / (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E)) for an elliptical orbit. A perfectly circular orbit has an eccentricity of 0, though that might give KSP a fit because of the other orbital elements that depend on periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane of the orbit is defined by inclination (how tilted it is with respect to the orbited body\u0027s equator) and\u00A0longitude of the ascending node (at what point it crosses the equator going up). Inclination varies from 0 to 180 degrees, with 0 being an equatorial prograde orbit, 90 being exactly polar, and 180 being retrograde equatorial. Longitude of the ascending node is defined with respect to the First Point of Aries, which for KSP, is an arbitrarily chosen point in the skybox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow the oval is oriented with respect to the plane of the orbit is defined by the longitude of periapsis (in the save file) or argument of periapsis (if using Hyperedit). Longitude of periapsis is where your periapsis is with respect to the First Point of Aries, while argument of periapsis is the angle from the ascending node to periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re wondering what that means: you could imagine an orbit where periapsis is close to the equator, close to the poles, etc: this is what LPE/AOP represent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese five define the track of the orbit... but not where a vessel is in that orbit. That is usually defined with two parameters: epoch (an arbitrary point in time), and mean anomaly at epoch. Mean anomaly is related to the angle between periapsis and your current point in the orbit, and mean anomaly at epoch is \u0022what was the value of mean anomaly at that arbitrary point in time\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, the exact angle between periapsis and your current point in the orbit is true anomaly, and is exactly equal to mean anomaly for a circular orbit, but is more complicated to deal with for elliptical orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Allocthonous","CreatedById":169833,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-26T04:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may find it less nerve-wracking to use the in-game cheat menu to do this.
