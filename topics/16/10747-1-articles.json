If you would like you can add \u0027pogos\u0027 which are wheels that you drop off after lift off. \n\nTo do this add the structural pylons to the end of your wings and attach gears to that. Then once you are off the ground detach the wheels."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T04:18:06Z","Content":"Here\\\u0027s a decent basic training airplane. Simple, very docile handling, easy to take off and land. Use it to practice with before you go on to more adventurous designs. It works well with keyboard controls.\n\nI suggest before you start the engine, turn precision control on. Then hit ALT-S (that\\\u0027s trim) several times until the pitch indicator moves up to the second notch above the center point.\n\nStart the engine, throttle up, yaw to keep the plane rolling straight down the runway. When surface speed gets to about 70 m/s, pitch back a little bit and the plane should take off.\n\nI find it lands best at about 70 m/s again.\n\nAlso note that .15 still has a version of the old sticky pad bug. Restarting a flight will often cause the plane to load with a wheel or two embedded in the ground; I bet that\\\u0027s what\\\u0027s causing your planes to yaw around too much when you\\\u0027re trying to take off. Instead of restarting the flight, try going back to the SPH and launching again."},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Lag","CreatedById":23856,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T05:21:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also note that .15 still has a version of the old sticky pad bug.\n\nGlad I\\\u0027m not the only one running into this one still..."},{"CreatedByName":"Anomalous_Matter","CreatedById":24939,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T19:49:45Z","Content":"Thanks a ton for all the tips, guys!

Control of aircraft with the keyboard is tedious at best.\n\nCanards at the front AND the rear of the aircraft, this will seriously limit pitch and will probably annoy you at first but once you get the hang of where to place them you can still make highly maneuverable aircraft.\n\nAlso make sure all the wings have sufficient flight surfaces, this will allow for much better roll and yaw control even if it looks hilarious while using SAS to autopilot the aircraft."}]}
