For bodies such as Laythe, I would often miss land and splash down in water with disastrous consequences. Taking a hint from a forum member here (can\u0027t recall who, but thanks!), I made a lander that had pontoons (using many structural fuselages). If I got lucky and was over land, jettison the pontoons and land with lander legs. If not, keep pontoons and land on the water (wish they had currents!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, is all liquid equal? Meaning, if I sent a similar lander to Eve, could I splash down on it\u0027s liquid in a similar manner, or is some liquid less dense than others and I need to make my pontoon supported vessel more floaty? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T15:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood question.

That\u0027s why, with density of everything in the system, including Kerbals and spaceship parts, everything sinks right to the bottom of the pond as if it was thin air, our earthly water being so light it provides nearly no resistance to any of Kerbin matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T23:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA physics note: For buoyancy, gravity is irrelevant. Objects do not sink deeper if gravity is heavier, or float higher if it\u0027s lighter. The reason is that when the object becomes heavier due to gravity, so does the liquid it\u0027s floating in, by the exact same factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that matters for determining how high or low an object floats is the relative density-- i.e. what\u0027s the density of the object, relative to the density of the liquid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I have a chunk of stuff that has N% the density of water, then if I float it in water, N% of its volume will be below the waterline.
