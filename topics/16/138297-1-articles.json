How do I do that? I installed Remotetech because I thought it may be part of that, but when I right-clicked on the antennae there was no otpion to do that. Furthermore, what tips do you have for setting up a communication satellite constelllation, What mods should I use? What the heck does the button with the antenna and the waves coming out of it do/mean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T22:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222544291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461793602\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156273\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joeybafoey\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, Joeybafoey said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut when I right-clicked on the antennae there was no otpion to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor RT, there are two kinds of antenna. One omni which automatically connects everything within range, and another kind dish which can select target. You may be seeing the video with dish while you\u0027re playing with omni (which doesn\u0027t have the option to select target because it doesn\u0027t need to).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T02:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:RemoteTech2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E helpful when I first started playing with RT - it gives optimal altitude and configurations for Kerbin, Mun and Minmus\u00A0and advice on interplanetary networks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
