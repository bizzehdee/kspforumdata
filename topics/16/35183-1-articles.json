When they are empty however, the other 3 fueltanks are of course not completely full (at least according to the bar). However, when I let the two empty ones loose, suddenly the fuel-tanks appear to be completely full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope my question is clear.

They show the fuel available to the engine. So asparagus staging allows all fuel available to the engine, which would include your two almost empty tanks. Once those first 2 tanks are jettisoned, now the fuel available is only from the remaining 3 tanks, which up to that point, would be full. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly with the resources tab at the top right, which will show all the fuel in the s/c, but once staged, it may go from 800/1000 units to 800/800 if you dump two empty tanks with 100 units in each. It\u0027s the total ratio of resources remaining to space available for it, so as you stage, the space available is taken away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mr_yogurt","CreatedById":70148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T20:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s because the bar is current fuel/fuel total capacity, so if there is an empty fuel tank connected, it will count that towards total fuel, but not towards current fuel (empty). You can check the fuel of individual tanks by right clicking. You should see that the inner tanks are still completely full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: ninja\u0027d. :\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T21:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep. It\u0027s because your maximum fuel capacity decreases when you dump the empty fuel tanks; suddenly the ratio of fuel left to capacity jumps up. Ain\u0027t a bug; it\u0027s supposed to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waervyn","CreatedById":71159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T21:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat, thanks a lot for clearing that up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
