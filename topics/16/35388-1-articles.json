I have two landers down already, right next to each other.

I have plenty of fuel (650 m/s worth of delta-V), and a full tank of monopropellant. The lander is small, only 10 tons or so (really, all it\u0027s got is a monoprop tank, a 360 capacity fuel tank, a poodle engine, and KAS winches and connectors on all four sides).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice on getting this thing 1,900 meters away from where it is, to where I want it to go, in one piece?

This is one of the few instances where it can actually help you.

You should learn how to \u0022herd\u0022 your prograde/retrograde markers around. For a short suborbital hop you want to take off and lean in the direction you want to travel. You will notice that you prograde marker want to move towards the direction you are pointing while you thrust. When you have a good arc overshooting your target a bit, turn around to look at the retrograde marker. This one goes differently: as you start braking, you will notice that it wants to move \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E form where you are pointing the ship as you thrust, and it will move faster the farther away from it you point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo armed with that, and always keeping an eye into the speed indicator to make sure it stays on surface (and reasonably low!), perhaps even targeting something at your destination to have a marker for it in the navball (the pink thingy), all you need to do is to crash a few kerbals around until you get the hang of throttle control as you do all these things. In a few tries, you will notice you start getting better, and after a while you will be able to hover as you automatically kill lateral velocity, and start playing around with suicide burns and 0.1m/s precision landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
