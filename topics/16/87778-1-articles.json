Be sure to land in the water to get full recovery of parts. Next, add more fuel and do the 11,000 meter contract. This simple design will even do the 33,000 contract. Add a second stage, add Goo canasters and do the suborbital one. Even at the Hard level, work a step at a time, be careful what you spend research on when unlocking parts, and you will have more then enough funds to progress in your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F2ulVN4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F2ulVN4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J414vKk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022J414vKk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"albalma01","CreatedById":126381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T14:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA little late but thank you for your replies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
