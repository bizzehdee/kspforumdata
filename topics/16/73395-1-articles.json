So I re docked with my orbiting lab around Minmus. But I\u0027m having trouble refueling. So I can right click and then ALT right click to bring up the fuel transfer menu. But it seem to only allow me to transfer the small bit of fuel that I have in the lander tanks back and forth. It will not allow me to refuel the lander with any new fuel from the lab. It\u0027s like my lander tanks are now only a fraction of their original size. I can shift the .6 fuel that I have left back and forth but I can\u0027t get any more? Am I doing some thing wrong and what do the little green arrows and bar sinister mean at the far right of the transfer bar. Again am I doing some thing wrong or is the program misinterpreting the size of my tanks? Oddly it worked fine with the mono propellant.
