The navball shows relative to the currently selected control point (and sideways or upside down, if the control point isn\u0027t facing up/forwards). I\u0027m not sure how it picks the default, probably the first one it finds traversing the part tree from the root (frequently the root itself will be a command module). Command modules means both manned and unmanned modules, so probe cores, etc, as well as pods and cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh, and being pedantic, blue on the navball is not prograde. Prograde and retrograde don\u0027t exist until you are moving, and can be anywhere on the navball, determined by your current/instantaneous velocity vector. It\u0027s pedantic, but an important distinction, which could cause confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/1133/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://xkcd.com/1133/\u003C/a\u003E If the fire is pointing towards space, you are having a bad problem, and you will not go to space today. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-30T09:37:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2013 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"triphon","CreatedById":94992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T09:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUsually this means you\u0027ve built the ship so that the command module is upside down.
