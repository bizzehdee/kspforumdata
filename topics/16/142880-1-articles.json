But what keeps happening is this: When I try to put the decouplers on the wings,\u00A0One decoupler goes up and one goes down, I have tried pressing C and R and restarting ksp. When I press R it does nothing when it is on the wing. When it is on the fuselage it changes to mirror but when I move it it reverts to radial.\u00A0Yes it is in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.
