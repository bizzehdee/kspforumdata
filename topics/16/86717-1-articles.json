Just keep going straight up. I normally angle a bit to make sure I land in the water, if you don\u0027t angle be prepared to land in mountains. (Preservation of angular momentum will get you to land west of KSC.) There is no point in going vertical more then 270 kms or so. After 250 kms you are \u0022high above\u0022 and can do more science. You will stay high above right to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFarthest Horizontally is more difficult. I think just 45 will work best for shorter hops. (If your engine can just get suborbital.) For longer hops a more flatter approach works well. If you think about it, orbital is the whole planet and it is mostly a horizontal burn. In every case you want to keep vertical for a short while to get out of the lower atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using Deadly Reentry, flatter is essential. It reduces the impact of reentry greatly to come in shallower. Even suborbital will kill you if you come in too steep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using an aerodynamic mod like Near or Far, then 3600 DV is enough to get orbital. You should be able to reach anywhere on the world with that or less. With a light load, that is three of the longest 1.25 stock tanks and a lv-45 engine or LESS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T01:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo much depends on your TWR and speed/drag at any particular altitude, it isn\u0027t anything like as simple as \u0027angle\u0027.

A rocket engine will consume your fuel at an alarming rate, but you can archieve an very high AP (Apoapsis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn jet on the other hand is saving fuel as long as you are in the atmosphere, But the AP will often not be that high, if you can establish one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that reason jet\u0027s are often used for spaceplanes, to witch you can alter your suborbital plane afterwards:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the beginning you could e.g. build a very small plane with only one jet engine. Because flameouts doesn\u0027t matter with only one engine there should be no problems if they occur. Take two RAM air intakes for that engine, with should be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscend:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 20k altitude build up airspeed to 1400 m/s. At 26k altitude the jet engine will start to loose thrust. If a flameout occur, throttle down a bit to keep it working. Between 30-34k altitude you should reach an airspeed of 1870 m/s. Because the airintakes will work better the jets could be operated - depending on your plane - up to 45-54k altitude to keep an once archieved airspeed (with minimum thrust). If this airspeed is between 2300-2500 m/s you will have an AP at least out of the atmosphere up to 150k. And you will have an PE arround 30k at least - a suborbital hop nearly around the world.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T10:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m finding ascending at just under 45 degrees seems to be working best.
