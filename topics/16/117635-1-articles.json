Is there some decent solution to this? Editing the save?\n\nI personally wouldn\u0027t trust (or thrust?) this Geher...\n\nI don\u0027t think you understood what I meant. You are still pushing the asteroid. What I meant is you should surround the asteroid with a few boosters. Let\u0027s say one booster consists of 1 orange tank, the LV-N, a probe core, some rcs and of course the klaw. The klaw should be radially attached to the booster and not on front of it as you (probably) did.\n\nBut I\u0027m not so sure anymore if this is still a good idea. It\u0027s definitely a bad idea for a class E asteroid. You\u0027ll also have to adjust the thrust of some boosters to make the whole thing halfway stable and not rotating to one side while thrusting.\n\nThe pulling method is, as many on this forum suggested, probably the best one. Even if it doesn\u0027t look kosher, because in real life the exhaust of the engines would hit the asteroid and then it\u0027s like trying to power a sailboat with a fan. ![130383994795912580495201197_BlowYourOwnSail.jpg](http://netstorage.discovery.com/feeds/brightcove/asset-stills/dsc/130383994795912580495201197_BlowYourOwnSail.jpg)[![wumrMVO.png](http://i.imgur.com/wumrMVO.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot180.png)\n\nSee the similarities? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) But nothing against the Kranefly craft by Kuzzter. It looks really great and probably does its job very well, but I just wouldn\u0027t use it.\n\nI think next time I\u0027ll try the pulling method, but with a very long craft and the engines at an angle so that the exhaust should theoretically go by the asteroid.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T11:34:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geher**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:53:40Z","Content":"Actually, the pushing method with a crop field of engines works very well; yesterday I got the asteroid from being on a crash course with Mun into an orbit of maybe 5000km apoapsis. But the way they bobble gives me jeebies. At least they bobble, not wobble, keeping thrust going through the center of mass most of the time even if they sink most of the way into the asteroid, and after they run out of fuel they get ejected quite a way above its surface. It\u0027s really a problem with the klaw, not with the pushing method.\n\nRefuelling them is quite a bit of a chore, but the 400 units of fuel per tank last quite a while.\n\nNow I\u0027m pondering capturing more asteroids and making a cluster of them in LKO, binding them with dual-claw connectors.
