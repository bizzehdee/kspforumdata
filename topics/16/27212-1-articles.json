I accept that my rockets are probably for the most part unstable, but if I turn sas off it doesn\u0027t require an awful lot of effort on my part to keep it straight!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of sas, I read (while searching for this issue) and the difference between advanced and normal sas, would that be a possible solution?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been experimenting with some ion spacecrafts, using other rockets to get it up there and then breaking off, but I\u0027ve got two issues there, I can never get much electricity input, no matter how many panels I cover the wings with. And then I struggle to design it, I know I need to keep the weight low, but what can I make the body out of? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
