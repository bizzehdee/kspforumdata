Make sure your RCS thrusters are symmetricly placed on opposite sides of your CoM. When docking two vessels, it\u0027s usually easiest to control it from the smaller of the two. Also, make sure you select \u0022control from here\u0022 on your docking port before you start and select the docking port on the other vessel as your target.\n\nEDIT: Also, there is a difference between not having enough thruster power and not having them in the right locations. In the former case movement will be balanced yet slow (usually happens on large ships), in the latter your movement will be unbalanced and harder to control (translation moves cause rotation, etc.).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T19:17:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:26:54Z","Content":"Don\u0027t panic! Before you give up entirely, have you done all the things to make docking as easy as possible?\n\n--**Orient ports N-S** (one points heading 000, one points heading 180) Assuming you are on an equatiorial orbit, ports aligned in N-S direction will stay aimed in that direction. If you are not equatorial, point the ports orthagonal to prograde.\n\n--**Get as lined up as you can using main engines** This doesn\u0027t work on all ship designs of course, but sometimes when RCS thrust is weak its the only way. Hopefully you have sufficient gyro torque to orient the ships\u0027 headings where you want them. If main engine thrust is too strong for effective control, you can **tweak it lower by right-clicking**.\n\n--**Pick Up Your Visual Scanning!** Sometimes you cannot trust the navball to aim for the port, if the port is not on the ship\u0027s central axis. I like to put the camera directly under one of the ports and rotate views until I\u0027m satisfied the other port is lined up in every direction\n\n--**Sort Out Directions In Advance** You need to know as you\u0027re coming in which way the \u0022IK\u0022 and \u0022JL\u0022 key pairs are going to send your ship.\n\n--**Take It Slow!** Invariably you are going to end up 5 meters from the target and be misaligned. If you\u0027re going slow enough toward target you should be able to make a lateral correction (see Sort Out Directions In Advance, above) and magnetics will pick it up from there.\n\nLikely you are already doing many or all of these things, but often a small tweak to technique can be the difference. Good luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T07:36:18Z","Content":"Also note that H/N are most likely to be well-aligned on your ship, and hitting caps lock can help compensate for poor CoM placement (but gives greatly reduced thrust). Just do your best to line it up and if you can ever get everything centered (direction AND velocity), no matter HOW slowly you\u0027re drifting together, you\u0027re practically done."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T10:07:37Z","Content":"This is probably easier than you think - It\u0027s quite possible to dock without thrusters, if you\u0027re careful ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nGet the ships close to each other (\u003C100m) and kill relative velocity with the main engines. If you\u0027re struggling for fine control, right click and thrust limit the engines to 20% to give yourself more margin for error.\n\nControl each ship from the docking port, target the other ship\u0027s docking port, and tell the pilot (or MechJeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S.) to point at the target. You now have a vector between the targets that is one of the IJKLHN translation keys. If either ship has a nosecone docking port, that\u0027s obviously the one to move since it\u0027ll be better balanced ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\\*edit\\* As others have said however, MJ does have a docking autopilot - but I think some of the features are unlocked in the tech tree so it may not be available to you at this time. It usually does its job accurately, but it is woefully inefficient. Getting your ships into alignment first will massively reduce the amount of monoprop MJ burns on the final approach.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T10:10:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 10:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bidule","CreatedById":97384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T13:51:58Z","Content":"Thanks for you help!
