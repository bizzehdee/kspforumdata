Maybe it\u0027s just crews in general, but before updating to 1.0 I had far more than the 10 (of twelve) active crews it now states I have, and they are still there, scattered about at various bases and landed planes around the planet. Perhaps it\u0027s just a bug from upgrading that it doesn\u0027t count all the manned vehicles? I also have a ton of kerbals, and thus the astronaut complex states my next hiring cost is 00,000,000,000,000.00 or something like that. \n\nDoes anyone know if these values can be edited etc? I may just have to switch back to sandbox to have my massive string of bases and mining operations, but I do like some of the limits of career mode such as vehicle cost etc., so just wondering if there\u0027s anything I can do to continue without being limited by number of crews etc. Is it possible to transfer my persistent save file to a sandbox game if there is no way around the kerbal limits? Thanks for any light you can shed on this, the kerbal empire thanks you."}]}
