I can understand that some parts of a surface can experience an increase in velocity of wind relative to free flow enviroment. but the amount of IAS shown seems to be way greater than such phenomenon. and if such phenomenon is in play. is there anyway to make it so that it reflects IAS in free stream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS, most of this debate could be solved with a simple read out that shows the current Drag force in G #\u0027s or m/s/s or some thing easy to translate to gravity force. I am not trying to get you to copy MechJeb, but the Drag force readout that it has, that shows opposing force due to drag, is really helpful.
