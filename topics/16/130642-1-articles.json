I have been playing for about a week now, and just starting to send kerbal passengers and landers to the moon. but I am kinda stumped on one of the objectives that I have. \u0027fly by the mun\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is what I have done: I have gotten my passengers into a nice stable 10k orbit above the mun... And the seemingly more simple objective isn\u0027t checked. Do I need to enter and exit without orbiting?
