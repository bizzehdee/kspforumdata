Fly low and slow close to your target and pop the chutes for a gentle vertical landing. \n\nNot tried this with the new aero yet though.\n\nYou can then re pack the chutes before taking off for your next destination."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:14:35Z","Content":"yep; parachutes, with an engineer to re-pack them.\n\nyou can shield the chutes from aerodynamic drag by placing them in a service bay. (you can also put the non-radial chutes on the top and bottom of said bay). Just make sure you open the bay before triggering the chutes. (I\u0027d suggest wiring the chutes to the abort action group, since you might need to open them multiple times)"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T00:40:55Z","Content":"You also have the option of using the airbrakes and braking parachutes to slow yourself down before and after touchdown now. Parachutes don\u0027t detach on ground contact like they used to and the radial mounted drogue chutes are very small and easy to mount near the tail of the aircraft."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T00:51:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... until I try to brake then it nosedives into the ground.\n\nUseful advice for any vehicle: disable brakes on the front wheel(s)."},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T00:55:54Z","Content":"If run into landing trouble, I usually just land as close as possible and taxi it to where I need to be."}]}
