I just recently upgraded to .25 and am currently working on a transport SSTO. Everything was working fine but I realized I needed a bit more lift with the aircraft. To resolve this issue I added an additional set of wings. Since I added the 2nd set of wings every time I load onto the runway it spontaneously explodes. Previous to adding the additional wings I was able to load and make it to the end of the runway just fine. Is there some sort of weight limit for the runway that I am missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T10:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe runway is weak and so is the launchpad (too heavy a spacecraft/spaceplane will kablooey them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrdinarily, turning off the building destruction would be the only fix but magico13 came up with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99101-PadLock-Stop-the-LaunchPad-Runway-from-Exploding-on-Load-%2810-23-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea sly and light little plugin\u003C/a\u003E that should fix your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T11:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a bit more to it that sheer weight.
