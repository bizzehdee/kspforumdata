It handles successfully, pulling upwards of 18G in a turn. However, The AoA is so great, it decelerates. This (would) be good, but not all of the time. As soon as it goes below 280 m/s, it begins fishtailing. Any ideas how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T23:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPull more gently? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E real planes can\u0027t do those turns and far is a realism mod...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T23:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an option, but it\u0027s flown by the BDA AI.
