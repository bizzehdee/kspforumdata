To prevent us hijacking that thread, I made the current one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order for this to become a bit more general, it seems that many KSP players have trouble taking off or landing airplanes on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway, to the point that they believe that the 2.5 km stock runway is not long enough. I haven\u0027t had this experience: my 40 ton Shuttle is able to land on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway (and, in a pinch, the Island Airfield) just fine, even loaded with 80 tons of cargo, or with an asteroid on its back. And my hope would be that players with lots of experience with airplanes in KSP - perhaps including me - can answer questions of less experienced players and help them on their way to become better aircraft designers and pilots.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what qualifications, if any, do I have to pretend that I can give hints and tips on this topic? To begin with, and apart from my recently completed Shuttle challenge, I have quite a lot of experience with flightsims, having played most versions of Microsoft Flight Simulator starting with version 3.0 - I have more than 250 sim-flight hours in MS Flight Simulator X alone, having completed all of its checkrides successfully, and I am very much looking forward to MSFS 2020. I also played a lot of Orbiter, which is a spaceflight sim that is more focused on piloting spacecraft and controlling their various systems and less on spacecraft design than KSP. If that is your thing, I can highly recommend it. I also played Condor quite a bit, which is a dedicated Glider sim, with excellent simulation of atmospheric conditions such as thermals and updrafts. I regard being able to sim-fly a glider a real bonus in KSP, as it made landing Space Shuttles and spaceplanes much more intuitive for me, especially when making a unpowered descents and landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd on top of that I used to design and build my own model airplanes. So even before playing KSP I had some idea of things like the Center of Mass, Center of Lift, wing dihedral, Angle of Attack and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, that being said, how to go about designing, testing and flying your own airplane designs in KSP? I believe this is one of the hardest things to do in the game. The reason is that your job is a combination of two things that are both seen\u00A0 as very difficult in the real world: aircraft design and test piloting of high performance aircraft. Here\u0027s a few tips that I gave in the previous thread:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd enough wings to your craft that it is able to fly at a reasonable speed, no more than about 100 m/s.\u00A0 For comparison:\u00A0touchdown speeds of real-life high performance aircraft vary from about 70 m/s (F-16) to 100 m/s (Space Shuttle), 105 m/s (X-15) with 123 m/s (F-104 with its blown flaps inoperable;\u00A0with these flaps\u00A0touchdown speed was 85 m/s) the maximum I have been able to find.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t have the nose of the craft pointed down too much when it is on the runway. That way it will be hard to lift the nose (a maneuver called \u0022rotate\u0022 in aviation)\u00A0and get the wings to generate lift. If the wings point downwards with respect to the airflow, you are generating downforce. Useful if you are building a Formula 1 car, not so much for a plane.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPut the main landing gear slightly behind the center of gravity. If the landing gear is too far back you will not be able to rotate. I see a lot of spaceplanes that are only able to take off by running off the end of the runway, and often the problem is that the landing gear is too far back. A good test is to do a high speed taxi on the runway, and see if you are able to rotate. If your craft is well-balanced you should be able to taxi your plane a considerable distance on the main gear alone at a speed just below touchdown speed. A high speed taxi run also enables you to test the brakes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry to land with as little speed as possible while still flying. Approach the runway somewhat above this speed, and once you reach the runway threshold (at about 20 meters altitude or so), pull up slightly to lose more speed - this is called a flare. If done correctly you will start losing speed without gaining altitude. If you do gain altitude when flaring, try again with a lower approach speed.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA more general tip is to try to design aircraft that are able to fly with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned off. With \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned on, a KSP plane does not fly like a real plane at all, as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will try its best to keep the nose of the craft pointed in the same direction, whatever you do. Learn to use pitch trim (Alt-S for trim up, Alt-W for trim down). Pitch trim is used in real aircraft to keep flying level without applying any force on\u00A0the flight controls. The higher the speed of your craft, the less pitch trim you will need.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd another general tip: consider playing a different flight sim to learn to sim-fly. I for one can\u0027t wait for MS flight simulator 2020. Building and flying planes in KSP is in some respects much harder than, say, sim-flying a Cessna in MSFS: in KSP you take on the roles of aircraft designer and high performance test pilot, two jobs considered very hard in the real world. Whereas the flight characteristics of a Cessna are very well known, the performance of any KSP airplane design is anyone\u0027s guess untill you start flying it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne tip that I want to repeat because I think it is a very important one and it is in danger of disappearing in the mass of text is this one: If at all possible, fly your plane with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E OFF. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will try to keep the nose of the airplane pointed in a fixed direction in space. This has a couple of unwanted consequences:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* It is virtually impossible to make fine course corrections, as you are in effect fighting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* It makes it impossible for the plane to find its own balance, often forcing the plane into a slip (which means that it flies with the nose of the plane pointing to the right or left instead of straight ahead, adding extra drag)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* On long overland flights, it forces your plane to climb ever faster, which is due to the curvature of Kerbin. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E keeps the nose of the plane in a direction which is \u003Cem\u003Efixed in space\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* It appears that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is momentarily switched off when you are giving control inputs. This has the rather nasty consequence of nullifying pitch trim when you give small roll or yaw inputs as course corrections, often dropping the nose of the airplane. If this happens on final approach, you are in real danger of crashing your plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is a lousy autopilot. I only use it for long overland flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut enough from me for now: I\u0027d love to hear your tips and tricks, as well as your questions and any problems that you might have in flying or landing your airplanes.

I tried, but I was unable to get it to accept small inputs. I could not remove the large dead center of my yoke, which resulted in almost keyboard-like behaviour: If I tried to roll a little bit, nothing happened, and with larger roll input on the yoke I suddenly get very large roll input in KSP.

I mean, I\u0027m an Ace Combat player so I know what yaw does, but not how it works in KSP. So basically, each and every single one of my attempts to line up with the runway use pitch/roll only and end up diving headfirst over the edge of the runway because I\u0027ve got no fine control. Hence why I\u0027d like a wider runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlready doing this, I use 2\u00B0 most of the time and tweak until \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is slightly pushing the nose\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0while supercruising.

From what I read here you are quite an experienced flight-simmer, and I understand your frustration. From what you describe I think you play with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, as you describe some of the very behaviours that I outlined in my previous post. KSP, especially if you play with mouse and keyboard as I do makes it almost impossible to fly a plane like you would do in other flightsims (or when flying for real, for that matter), by giving small control inputs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your approach speed is 150 m/s while your take-off speed is 80 m/s your approach speed is way too high, and a flare at that kind of speed will result in overshooting the runway, simply because the plane will keep on flying. And if your flare results in a stall 30 meters above the runway you started the flare too early. I\u0027m sorry if this sounds blunt, but that would be no different in a real airplane. Perhaps you don\u0027t give yourself enough room to get your airspeed right? Have you tried doing an extra long final approach where you focus on getting the glideslope and approach speed correct? Problem with KSP is of course that you have no real way of knowing what the correct approach airspeed is for your aircraft design, and what glideslope you need to maintain that speed, so you\u0027ll have to do some testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off it is possible to side slip in KSP, by giving opposite rudder and stick inputs, and it will slow down your plane.

Basically, the farther away the rudder is offset from the longitudinal axis (the higher up it is), the more roll it will induce in addition to yaw, to the point where it acts more like an aileron if it is far enough. Which is actually one way to think of the rudder, as a single, asymmetric aileron.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen your aircraft rolls because you applied rudder, what I think happens when you release the rudder is one wing will create more lift, and depending on the design, roll the plane back towards the starting point. You can either apply opposite roll at the same time you apply rudder to lessen the reaction, or you can apply roll afterwards to stop the plane from rolling back on its own. You\u0027ll probably also need to apply some pitch at the same time if you want to keep the nose pointing in the same direction. This also ties into the sideslip technique mentioned above by QF9E to reduce your airspeed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll of this is significantly more difficult if you\u0027re flying with keyboard controls, but it is definitely something one can learn.

So like most student pilots, I flew a crappy Cessna since I\u0027m not a billionaire. I was doing a check ride to renew my currency (you need to fly within two weeks to keep flying solo before your license and I had not flown in 3 weeks). I was to do two circuits (laps around the airport to those who are smart enough to not pour all their money into flying)...when I did my pre-flight checks, I had a bad mag drop on the left magneto, but my instructor said it was fine...so I flew one circuit...no problem...then did a touch and go...and the engine basically said \u0022screw you\u0022 so I was in this position where I knew the Cessna had crap brakes...I\u0027m doing basically a wheelie down the runway with 50% engine power and hoping that I make 67 knots for best climb rate... I dragged that plane into the air and ATC was saying \u0022Land anywhere you can, just get it down safely, We declared emergency for you\u0022. In hindsight this was really really stupid of me, but I was 16 and invincible...so my point is that just because you can take off, doesn\u0027t mean you should.
