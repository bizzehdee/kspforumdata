When i press the middle mouse button (MMB), the camera does pan, but only by something like 2cm before becoming stationary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance; let\u0027s say that I want to pan the camera all the way to the left. I press MMB and move the mouse to pan left, but because this only moves the point of view by 2cm, I would then have to press MMB again and pan another 2cm, then again and again and again until desired camera view is achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get the same result regardless of whether I press the MMB once or press and hold the MMB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone please help?
