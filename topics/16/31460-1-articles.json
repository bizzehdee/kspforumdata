DeltaV is perhaps the most important concept in rocketry and there are several posts on the tutorial section, on the wiki and elsewhere on the Internet that explains it in detail. Simply put your rocket\u0027s deltaV is its capability to change velocity, and when it changes from one orbit to another (Kerbin surface to low kerbin orbit, low kerbin orbit to a Mun transfer orbit, and to an orbit around the Mun, etc), some amount of deltaV will be consumed. In another word, your rocket must have enough deltaV to perform these \u0022tasks\u0022. To get to a 70km ~ 100km circular orbit around Kerbin you need ~4500m/s of DeltaV. DeltaV is \u0022produced\u0022 when your rocket engines burn fuel. So the simplest way to increase deltaV of a rocket is to increase the amount fuel you carry. The second way is to use an engine of higher ISP (efficiency). And the third way is to decrease the weight your \u0022payload\u0022 - in this case anything that is not fuel is considered payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you go and use a rocket design someone else would undoubtedly try to \u0022sell\u0022 you, I recommend playing around more with your own designs, by considering the three ways to increase a rocket\u0027s \u0022deltaV\u0022 capability mentioned above. The fun of KSP (at least for me) is to figure out these things yourself by trial and error. You should be able to get to higher and higher orbits, and eventually to any destination in the Kerbol system. From the picture your Mun base probably weighs around 50 tons, and a rocket to lift 50 tons to low Kerbin orbit is probably not very easy to build for a new player. You could try a smaller (say 15~20 ton) Mun lander and then gradually increase your payload as you get more experience with rocket design. Another thing to consider is to download a mod that provides you deltaV information of your rocket / spacecraft, e.g., MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer. They can give you a good idea of your rocket / spacecraft\u0027s capability without needing to even launch it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-05T10:53:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2013 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by sturmstiger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl","CreatedById":58210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T11:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETotally agree, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-(might-contain-science)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee this \u003C/a\u003Eto improuve your rocket design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sould let Temstar make his own promotion, but as I am a great fan of his job, I just link here his \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33381-0-20-2-Zenith-rocket-family-%28modernised-for-0-20-x-with-perfect-subassembly%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EZenith Rocket Familly\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake care : one of the pleasure of this game is to buid your own rocket, with the Temstar\u0027s rocket familly you\u0027ll won\u0027t need to build any longer, it\u0027s too perfect \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way to put onto orbit huge playload is called asparagus.
