If you are trying to get to orbit with a lot of fuel remaining, then wings help you lift all that fuel to high altitude very efficiently, and they pay for themselves that way. BigS wing parts also have internal fuel tanks. So you get free fuel storage without having to add extra tanks. It takes a long time to fly a plane to orbit using the wings for lift. Some people don\u0027t like to wait that long, so they put little tiny wings and a big engine on the back and pretend that the plane is a rocket, and just blast their way up to 70km. This is fast, but it does not allow you to lift nearly as much weight. An additional problem is that all the stock wings are fairly small. The FAT wings (which are the biggest) have very low heat tolerance, and tend to snap off under high\u00A0loads. If you try to \u0022tile\u0022 a bunch of stock wings to make a bigger wing, it ends up looking silly most of the time. If you go with using plentry of wing area, then a good idea is to put enough to keep your high speed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E below 2 degrees (preferably adding inclination to the wings to bring the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to 0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I always either go for MK1 or 2.5M designs, and use a medium amount of wing.
