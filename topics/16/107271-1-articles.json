With the nerf in 1.0, my question is is this still an efficient strategy? Or should I just stick to using lv909 or something like that and only use the 48-7s for smaller probes and stuff.\n\nTypical mun lander for example would be a mk 1 or 2 lander can, a small rockomax tank, and 4 or 5 struts with 48-7s\u0027s."}]}
