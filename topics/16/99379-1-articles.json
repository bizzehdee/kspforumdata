One way i have tried is looking at it sideways, grabbing it with the mouse while holding shift and using the arrow keys. This does move the ship back, but also pushes it to the side wall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any words of wisdom? Some light that can be shed on this? I kinda have a lot planned, or a lot planned to figure out, lol, and i would rather not waste time on such silly issue. I spend enough time just trying to find the right angle to connect 2 items, but thats a whole nother topic lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T15:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little tricky but if you angle the camera just right, grab the root part and hold shift, you should be able to move it back to the center.
