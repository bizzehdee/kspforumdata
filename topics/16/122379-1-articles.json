About 10-20km up should do it. That way you have lots of time to bleed off speed and should easily be able to open your chutes by 5km. Remember, altitude matters when deploying chutes, but speed matters more. You want to deploy your chutes as soon as you slow down under 250m/s, the chutes should handle the rest no matter where you\u0027re landing- once partially open they always compensate for true altitude and by default always start to fully open at 1000m above land, not sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T17:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022moogoob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022moogoob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I do is fire retrograde until my periapsis is inside the amosphere, but still above the ground.
