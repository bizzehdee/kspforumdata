From my experience, i can overlap most parts with part clipping deactivated. I just recently tried activating it, but i can\u0027t see the difference. What am i missing?\n\nI can place as many rockets as i want stacked inside the other without part clipping acitaved, and i can place metal girders through fuel tanks and this, to me, feels like some serious clipping, so i wanted to know what passes for clipping in the forum challenges.\n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:27:53Z","Content":"I believe what is now allowed in the debug menu is for you to clip multiple parts onto the same attachment node. All other part clipping is just enabled in the game.\n\nI do not suggest having multiple things attached to the same node, though. It\u0027s just asking for a visit from Mr. Kraken."},{"CreatedByName":"SubzeroSpartan7","CreatedById":100972,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:30:22Z","Content":"It is helpful sometimes when you have parts that should attach that the game refuses to attach. Such as when making clusters of engines that visually have space between them but the gme for whatever reason wont allow you to attach them there. Before the offset and rotate buttons there was a lot more use for it though."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T20:42:46Z","Content":"That\u0027s because in .90, part clipping was made \u0022allowed\u0022 across the board.\n\nSee, back in the day, the \u0022part clipping\u0022 option did two things:\n\n1. It ignored part colliders when placing parts; otherwise you couldn\u0027t easily (yes, there were bugs/workarounds) clip one part into another.\n\n2. It allowed you to use an attach node more than once.\n\nIn .90, colliders were disabled across the board, so (1) is now the default (and unchangeable) behavior. Now the toggle only does (2)."},{"CreatedByName":"hobbez","CreatedById":138355,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T05:04:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s because in .90, part clipping was made \u0022allowed\u0022 across the board.\n\u003E In .90, colliders were disabled across the board, so (1) is now the default (and unchangeable) behavior.

I mean, sure it\u0027s fun to make a small jet plane with tons of stacked intakes, or a rocket with 20 engines stacked on top of the other (which does work without the clipping option), but it feels off for standard gameplay.

I think for challenges the important thing is to read into the OP\u0027s intent as much as the \u0027letter of the law\u0027--this is KSP not Space Munchkin! For example if the challenge is \u0022make the highest flying air-breathing ship you can\u0022, there is a huge difference in capability between ships that attempt a realistic-looking air system and ones that stack 60 radial intakes on top of each other...inside a cargo bay...with a nuclear engine embedded in the center. Of course if the challenge seems aimed to encourage abuse/clipping, and that\u0027s what makes the challenge fun, then by all means go nuts."}]}
