For the most part, you want to rely on fine-tuning your approach with your RCS system as you close the distance, gradually slowing yourself down as you approach until your docking ports start pulling on one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And yes, docking ports tend to compress under acceleration.

The problem is the mass of the section you\u0027re moving is so much more than the tug, so RCS impulse tends to cause it to rotate instead of translate. For handling bigger lumps of metal a larger more massive tug can actually require less work from the RCS system to move a given distance, as it isn\u0027t continually compensating for unwanted rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use a machine about this size:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://andyduffell.com/images/SpaceTractor.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SpaceTractor.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...for all my orbital handling.

This increases how much torque you have available. It doesn\u0027t improve translation per se, but it should reduce the rotation. Likewise the need for a powerful reaction wheel on the tug.
