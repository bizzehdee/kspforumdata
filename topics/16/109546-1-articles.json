It turn out to be a **S1 SRB-KD25k**. I managed to grab it with an advanced grabbing unit that was attached to the top of my MK1-2 pod then proceeded to drag it back into the atmosphere. The capsule and SRB did not come down gracefully . There was tumbling about but luckily nothing overheated. The SRB hit the water first at maybe 9 m/s and as the capsule hit the water it lost the SRB and I failed the contract.\n\nHow do you get things safely back to Kerbin? I had imagined I would be retrieving something small, not a huge booster.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T12:26:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Invader Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T18:47:55Z","Content":"I do pretty much what you did, except with a lot more parachutes.

It\u0027s all dependent on the cross sectional area of the parachutes that allows the ship to slow down. That\u0027s why the drag factor is represented by a number, rather than a ratio.\n\nTry making more compact versions of the capturing craft, and send up 2 of them at ones. Grab opposite sides of the SRB, and then initiate de-orbit. Your parachutes will produce the maximum drag factors they can."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T21:20:15Z","Content":"You can get KIS and attach parachutes and a heat shield and a probe core to it and deorbit them one at a time.
