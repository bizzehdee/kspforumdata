I got myself all the way through targeted manual Minmus landings before I downloaded it for the first time. I\u0027m used to MechJeb not acting smart during staging, and as such, when the accident happened for the first two times, I shut off MechJeb and attempted to fly the entire launch manually.

It was NOT turning or rotating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The staging is set up so that two of the radial rockets drop off first, then the other two. Staging occurs after the cutoff of the first pair of radials. When this is occurring, the core and two remaining radial rockets are at full throttle, and the two empty radials are not firing at all (as they are empty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The ship is flying in .16.

Replace your radial decouplers with the other ones and add struts(a lot of them). This usually allows you to drop used parts without blowing your rocket up.

Add a little more weight or drag to the outside surface of the discarded boosters, toward the bottom, so that they rotate away from the ship when discarded. Or place additional decouplers to throw them away with more force. Some players have advised rolling the ship to throw the boosters away with centrifugal force. You can put spacer pieces so that the outer boosters start a little further from the inner rocket to begin with. Or my most effective response, which would be to move the outer boosters down further so that they just don\u0027t overlap as much. Or some combination of these. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, are you piping fuel from the inner rockets to the outer ones?
