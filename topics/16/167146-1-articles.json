don\u0027t forget that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to get a good assist, you need to approach Tylo from behind:\u00A0\u00A0that is,\u00A0 your approach to Tylo must be from Tylo\u0027s retrograde side.\u00A0 To get the most from the assist, you want Tylo to warp your trajectory as close to 180 degrees as possible;\u00A0however, while it is important, your angle of approach is less important than your angle of exit.\u00A0\u00A0It is more important that your exit vector from Tylo\u0027s sphere of influence be exactly tangent\u00A0and retrograde with respect to\u00A0Tylo\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 The reason for this is because getting an exit vector that is tangent to Tylo\u0027s orbit allows you to more easily get additional encounters for additional assists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you cannot use Tylo, you can get a gravity assist from Laythe, but Laythe has an atmosphere and a much smaller sphere of influence;

the line through Tylo\u0027s sphere of influence ought to be dull orange, not purple, if Tylo is your next encounter.\u00A0 Since I don\u0027t have a larger picture, I cannot predict how your other encounters will affect this one, so I will refrain from saying more about this approach than to add that\u00A0you may already be too committed by how far you are in the Jool system to do anything about it, so you may need to learn to live with it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou enter Tylo\u0027s sphere of influence from its prograde side.\u00A0 You can see this from where the dotted purple line begins (in the upper middle of the picture:\u00A0\u00A0the circle-with-an-arrow is the escape point and\u00A0the blank end is the entry point).\u00A0 You get a close encounter with Tylo (10 km isn\u0027t a bad\u00A0altitude) but the problem is that the trajectory is almost straight through Tylo\u0027s sphere of influence.\u00A0 This gives you little to no assist.\u00A0 What you want is to keep the exit point where it is, but try to get an encounter that has your entry point in nearly the same place:\u00A0 that is, you want Tylo\u0027s gravity to warp your trajectory back on itself.\u00A0 That may not be possible with the orbital speed you have, so instead, it will probably take multiple assists, a burn, or a combination of burns and assists to shed your excess velocity.\u00A0 You may also consider taking your Tylo periapsis even lower; that will warp your trajectory more.\u00A0 In every case, it is okay to enter Tylo\u0027s sphere of influence from the side so long as you exit retrograde:\u00A0 retrograde exits\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0assist a capture.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nEdited to add:\u00A0 69 days to apoapsis is not insane if you came into the Jool system insanely fast;
