But I have made some awesome planes. And really the problem I\u0027m seeing now is that they keep bouncing when SAS is on. Is that due to the center of mass fighting the lift or vise versa? or is it just KSP mechanics. It\u0027s probably just my design or something.

It\u0027s adjusting the control surfaces many times a second to attempt to maintain heading and as such is affecting the lift characteristics. It then has to correct this so it moves your control surfaces more, resulting in the bouncing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T18:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak to FAR, but I find that if my planes a rapidly bouncing around, it is usually the flight controls. If I have too many flight controls (and too much control surface), they start fighting each other and start shaking back and forth. most notably when I get to a nearly perfect attitude like perfectly level. I think my case is due to SAS programming, but I don\u0027t know for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I deactivate some of the surfaces, it seems to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T19:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt often helps to disable roll in the tweakable right-click menu for all but one small pair of control surfaces in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T19:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich set do you typically leave active?

It\u0027s more useful for holding pitch but can allow for smoother movements overall and it works particularly well with FAR. Hold Alt and press the control keys to input trim. For example, if my plane keeps diving, I\u0027ll hold Alt while pressing S until the plane can hold its heading. Playing around with this function can greatly increase your flying ability and enjoyment. Also pressing Alt\u002BX will reset all trim adjustments. This can also be used with Caps-lock for really fine control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T00:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E^^^\u003Cp\u003EWhich set do you typically leave active?

Flaps on the wings should only control Pitch and Roll so deselect Yaw for the flaps on wings. Also you may need to strut your plane to ensure it is rigid and you may need to do a few trial take-offs to find the right amount for the \u0022control maximum\u0022 setting on your flaps to find the right balance for smooth flying and take-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps I\u0027m recovering from a heavy night so excuse the poor format etc\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
