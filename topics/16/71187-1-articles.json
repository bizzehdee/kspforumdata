It will certainly be tough to get to from a regular LKO, and the alignment (which will need stationkeeping to maintain since we can\u0027t do sun-synchronous orbits in KSP) is unlikely to be matched by an incoming interplanetary vessel. The only easy-ish transfers would be from the Mun or Minmus at the right time, but hopefully the altitude can be picked for the most expensive transfer, factoring that higher orbits make a cheaper direct transfer but lower orbits a cheaper aerobraking one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile if I make the orbit synchronous, or perhaps a period of say 2 or 3 Kerbin days, I may be able to facilitate an easy launch to a quick rendezvous from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you\u0027re wondering, I want it for a Kerbal prison.

The idea is that in the event of a jailbreak, there is nowhere to escape to. Prisoner gets out of hand? Just blow them out the airlock. The Mass Effect series had the Purgatory prison, which was more of a ship than an actual station, but still the same concept. Star Trek VI explored the idea of a prison on a cold, lifeless moon, of which unruly prisoners were left to die on the inhabitable surface (with no way of escape).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue in real life with an orbital prison is the cost. In addition, the purpose of a prison is to keep people in, not to keep people out. So, in my humble opinion, an orbital prison should be quite easy to access in order to keep the cost of maintaining the station down. If prisoners will only be coming from Kerbin, then you can put the station in whatever inclination you want. I\u0027d probably put it in a 70 km circular orbit at an inclination of 60 degrees. This keeps the access from the ground at a minimal cost while making an intercept from a higher orbit difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d put a de-orbit engine on the thing. If there\u0027s a major jail break, de-orbit the thing and watch \u0027em burn \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go the route of the moon prison, then you want a moon of which has enough gravity that a kerbal cannot escape from with a jetpack.
