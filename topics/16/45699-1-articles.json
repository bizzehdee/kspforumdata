Either they fall off or whatever they\u0027re attached to falls off. I\u0027ve scrapped the project and completely rebuilt it 3 times and whether I attach the wheels to girders, structural panels, directly to the tanks (16kl kethane tanks, orange tanks, w/e) even girders attached to tanks, they stick going up or down the side of the runway and things fall apart. There\u0027s a pic of the current version here (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nCIjqe3.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/nCIjqe3.jpg\u003C/a\u003E), it\u0027s completely stock except for the kethane parts and a couple of decorative bits. I have no idea how to make it work, struts don\u0027t seem to help other than to keep it from driving like a puddle of jello. It needs to be sturdy enough to handle the newly extra-cratered mun surface on potentially long drives, and it\u0027s not even handling the runway on Kerbin with empty tanks. The project is at a standstill because I really don\u0027t like most mod wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, any help/advice is very much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Libra00\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T10:11:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 10:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Libra00\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T07:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo struts linking the wheels together help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother possibility might be to build a large H frame with wheels along the long edges, and hang everything from that? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeyond that i can\u0027t suggest anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Libra00","CreatedById":29336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T10:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, thanks for the quick response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently the wheels aren\u0027t considered attachable surfaces, nothing can attach directly to them except as the destination for struts. As such I\u0027ve had struts linking from tanks, girders, etc to the wheels and that holds them in position better but doesn\u0027t keep them from breaking with what seems like a small amount of force. Mechjeb says the vehicle masses just under 50 tons (empty), and maybe that\u0027s the problem. I\u0027m kind of worried how it will manage when I\u0027ve got 64,000 liters of kethane in there, even just with the Mun\u0027s gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still experimenting with this, and I\u0027ve found something that helps a fair bit but isn\u0027t a complete fix. I switched to using a few quantum struts (I know, I go nuts with the mods) to hold the wheels on and they seem to do a better (but not great) job. Also, I removed almost all the default struts and put a few strategically-placed Q-struts to keep things flexible but not floppy and it works a fair bit better. I can get on and off the runway at 6-8 m/s without any catastrophic failures. It\u0027s a bit jittery, but I vastly prefer jittery to exploded. I think I\u0027ll mark the thread as answered for now barring major changes or revelations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DailyFrankPeter","CreatedById":101850,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T09:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps these can be redesigned so that they don\u0027t come stuck on such a big cantilever (the bending stress is huge this way, and it negates the usefulness of these biggest wheels for the biggest vehicles). I strongly think they should attach underneath the load, axially to the load force. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe someone can mod this and Squad can adopt the model into the core game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
