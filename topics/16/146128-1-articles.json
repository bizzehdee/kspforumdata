I\u0027ve upgraded it to newest parts and mods, removed parts that were dysfunctional in the original, then launched it - and after a good while, I discovered an action group for a very tedious and repetitive operation required is missing - somehow it didn\u0027t carry over from the old version and I failed to check that in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I somehow edit the action groups on a craft that\u0027s already in space?

Plus there were some other changes I wanted to introduce... so I just gave up, launched one with corrections introduced, carrying attachable parachutes (drones with parachutes and docking ports) and I landed the original. Not the most graceful of landings, lost half the gigantors, but otherwise, the whole endeavor costed me some 400,000 instead of a million.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EMEHPIp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EMEHPIp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T22:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, that thing is.... sizeable.

I didn\u0027t refill completely, just some 3500m/s. In orbit I braked to some 1200, then throttled down and never allowed the speed to climb above 1200, so nothing overheated. Then, at some 8km I slowed down to 200, and deployed the chutes. Still above 1km I slowed down to 100 or I\u0027d lose the ISRUs... and then - on 24 parachutes and with nearly empty tanks I was still going some 16m/s... but one short burn just before touchdown killed that off too. All the damage was from it falling over, slowed down by the chutes but unable to prevent hitting the ground pretty hard - one ISRU broke off but I could recover it. Still, the gigantors and the radiator would be smashed under the weight of the hull alone - there was just no way to prevent it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T23:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice job indeed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
