My version is 0.23 and I understand steam version will be 0.235. I read that I could just transfer saves, but will that work with different versions?

My old saves created in 0.23.0 got updated after installing 0.23.5, and they now have the new asteroids and parts. There was a glitch in that immediately after 0.23.5 was released, but the current version on Steam has a hotfix that removed that problem. If you have a pure vanilla (no mod) installation it should \u0022just work\u0022. Any mods you have could make it more complicated depending on their support for 0.23.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I think there\u0027s also a glitch with the mainsail engines and orange tanks in career saves, since they moved which tech tree node they were in. You will have to go and \u0022purchase\u0022 the moved parts if you have a career save where you had already researched that node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"abolaha","CreatedById":108207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T14:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for replies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that everything would be fine if I would have Steam 0.23 installation - I would just copy saves, and upgrade to 0.235.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now I will have 0.235 Steam installation.
