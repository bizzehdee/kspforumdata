I forgot to disable crossfeed on the various docking ports before I made my Jool transfer burn, and as a result I burned off the fuel in my lander\u0027s first stage. The center tank of my transfer stage emptied first and the remaining fuel is in six radially attached tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to transfer fuel to my lander equally from the radial tanks on my transfer stage? In other words, the empty tank on my lander is a Rockomax X200-16; is there a way to fill it with exactly 120 units of fuel and 146.67 units of oxidizer from each radial tank, so that each radial tank is left with the same amount of fuel after the transfer and I avoid an imbalance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T03:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer mod is the easiest way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut otherwise you have to transfer manually, by clicking on each tank and transferring in and out, and that can be a pain not to mention time consuming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T04:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts a pain, it helps to have an small tank like 45 liter or less on an probe to adjust. with as they fill slowly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow another question is if you need to balance all the tanks?
