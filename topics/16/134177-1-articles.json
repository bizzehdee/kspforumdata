In these situations, the only way I understand how to realisticly return to Kerbin is by ~500dV worth of inclination changes (thereby wasting loads of fuel) to get into an equatorial orbit, and going from there. Is this necessary? If not, what\u0027s the procedure for getting back to your celestial main body if in a polar orbit? I don\u0027t seem to know where to put my maneuver node; the closest my periapsis usually gets is ~4 million km away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy other question involves how to rescue a stranded craft on the Mun. Since it\u0027s landed, I don\u0027t see how using the Klaw is possible (won\u0027t matter that it has no docking ports at this point). If I try and get close I\u0027ll surely crash. Can you safely go horizontal at that extremely low altitude? I assume no, so I need a refueling rover type craft, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-14T16:44:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2016 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KocLobster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyverus","CreatedById":140893,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T17:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile not an expert, I\u0027d reason that achieving a kerbin orbit then doing the plane change may be more efficient since you\u0027re farther from the celestial body and thereby more efficient.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you\u0027re not on a modded install, i\u0027d land as close as possible (making sure to have much more dV than necessary) then hover \u00A0to the stranded craft. You could hten theoritcally use a claw either on the bottom or the top and carefully claw for the refuel.
