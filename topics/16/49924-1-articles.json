Jeb gave up and headed back to the lander for a disappointed trip home. I spotted the arc just outside the big crater in which my landing little crater was located and REALLY wanted to go there but as it took like a half hour of driving time just to get half way out of the little crater, alas it was not to be. Turns out the rover tested excellently and was quite stable on Mun, exceeding speeds of 6m/s with no roll-overs! See pics below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, how do you get around on the Mun? Do you fly to the different biomes? Make a grasshopper ship and just flick around to them? Is there some sort of faster more reasonable rover if I get something a bit bigger? Were my land speeds about normal (6m/s for fear of flipping if things got much faster)? I slowed to about 1.6m/s while trying to accelerate out of the crater rim. Looking for some guidance as this was my first attempt at extra-Kerbin land navigation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nwQbSbYh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nwQbSbYh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qrcNALMh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qrcNALMh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CRecIj0h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CRecIj0h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oiWHyfCh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oiWHyfCh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T19:27:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oddible\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Oddible\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake a grasshopper ship and just flick around to them?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much this, and perhaps leave enough fuel to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T19:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t, really.

It is built pretty well and can withstand some good sized jumps but not too big on the mun.
