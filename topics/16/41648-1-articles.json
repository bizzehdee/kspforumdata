Use maybe one of the large fuel tanks for the body of it. Then, once it\u0027s in orbit with solar panels deployed, go back and build your docking module. Launch that, rendezvous and dock with the utility module. Go back to the VAB and build your fuel module. This should be just an engine underneath a fuel tank with a Sr. docking port on top. Then, launch it using your favorite booster, and rendezvous and dock with the station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, build your hab - a capsule and a hitchhiker pod with some fuel, RCS, batteries, etc. Launch and dock with the station.

Both can be either one piece, or made up of modular sections connected via docking ports. Again, Youtube is a great place to start, but let your imagination roam, or, if you really want to, recreate actual space stations. Just today I got Salyut 1 in orbit and docked a craft to it. The only thing with space stations is to have at least one docking port, so that other crafts or expansions can be attached. And for those modules...other than solar panels, there isn\u0027t much need for them except for creativity.
