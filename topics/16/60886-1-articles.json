True, Unity uses a tree like structure with its \u0022Gameobjects\u0022, but what counts are the joints that tell the physics engine what is attached to what. And those do not follow a tree structure. (You can add joints between objects pretty freely in Unity, at least from what little I know about it) The reason why KSP is locked in its tree structure with ship parts is that a lot of other things depend on it too. Fuel flow or the way the VAB and SPH interfaces work for example. At this point it would be extremely hard to change that. We have Struts, they allow us to connect everything with everything if we so desire, its a reasonable compromise I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-24T18:53:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2014 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by the_bT\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T20:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if it was limitation of the game and not Unity that doesn\u0027t mean it would be simple to change. A lot of game implementation and logic may depend on it. For instance, certain aspects of fuel flow depend on whether the part is parent or child in the ship\u0027s structure.
