And I wouldn\u0027t recommend using them right away. There are absolutely great mods out there, but if you immediately download Ferrum Aerospace Research, Ioncross Crew Support, Deadly Reentry and Remotetech the game becomes a bit inaccessible. You\u0027ll have a very bad time trying to reach the Joolian system since the Kerbals will die without oxygen and burn to a crisp without heat shields. You can also use mods to get extra parts, but again, watch out with this. Not every mod has the engines and fuel tanks fairly balanced, so you run the risk of finding a game breaking part that makes everything an exercise in maneuvering and removes the engineering part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yea, mods are in general great, but don\u0027t be too hasty to grab for the mods in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for spacebar causing the wrong parts to separate (this is called Staging). If you look to the left side of your screen you can see your stages. If you press stage the game will activate everything in the next tab (it goes from bottom to top). If you look at Whackjob\u0027s second picture you can see that he has all those engines in his stage 1 and a parachute in his stage 0. If he presses space now he\u0027ll deploy his chutes. If you are unhappy with the order in which your rocket stages you can shuffle things around by dragging them between tabs, or dragging entire tabs around. You can adjust this both while flying the craft and while building it (then it is on the right side instead).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T00:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you build the actual space ship, the right lower side of the screen will show the different stages.

The mun has no atmosphere so it\u0027ll do nothing to slow you down, that\u0027s your job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at your navball you\u0027ll notice there are some markers on it. Specifically a yellow circle with a cross through it and a yellow circle with lines moving out in a triangle formation. If you point in the direction of the former it means you\u0027ll be pointing the spacecraft against your current direction. This is very useful for landing. All you have to do is point your spacecraft towards the circle with a cross in it and keep firing until your relative velocity is very low. Landing is pretty hard so expect a lot of crashes (F5 and F9 are your friend here). If you do it correctly the last few 100s of meters you should have the retrograde marker( circle with cross) aiming straight for the middle of the blue part of the navball. When this happens slowly go down and look for the shadow or the light from your engines, make sure you touch the ground at a reasonable velocity (aim for touching down at less than 1 m/s, else you\u0027ll either break stuff or bounce and end up on your back).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bassna","CreatedById":73320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T16:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4YC0Oi2.png\u0022 alt=\u00224YC0Oi2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWOOOHOOOO!!!

I hit the mun, then minimus, then Duna, then I started modding. I have since founded the \u0022Kerbal Mining Corporation\u0022 on minimus and have plans to build a somewhat functioning city. Until they add in career-mode, and even after, sandbox mode is whatever you want to make it. Be creative is all I can say. Ive seen pictures where people built floating cities more or less on the moon Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If you want a real challenge, try getting to Moho, still unachieved on my part. I always run out of fuel while trying to obtain orbit within Moho\u0027s area of influence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bassna","CreatedById":73320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T17:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks =D. One question im not sure anyone would know cause i guess its prolly just this ship, but i cant get it to stop rolling and stay in place. and the landing gears dont seem to be long enough to touch the ground. So...idk. I crashed once and reloaded quicksave. Is there a way to save once im on the moon, so if something happens, i dont have to re-land?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
