It is assumed here that efficiency = delta-v. The more delta-v you have the farther you can go (unless you are trying to take off/land, in which case you\u0027ll also need a certain minimum thrust otherwise you won\u0027t go anywhere). In car terms delta-v is your range, so for example I can drive 350 miles (560 km) on a single tank of gas, or my spaceship can produce 350 m/s of delta-v with the fuel on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v is calculated from three numbers: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EISP. This is the specific impulse generated for each unit of fuel burned, essentially how much \u0027push\u0027 you get. It is similar in a way to the MPG (L/100km) of your car but ISP does not yet take into account how heavy your ship is.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFuel mass. This is how much fuel you have to burn, more fuel means more impulse adding up. Like with a car if you take your fuel tank size and multiple it by your MPG you\u0027d have an idea of the range of your car.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPayload mass. If you load up your car with lots of weight then your MPG will go down because there is more to push. The same happens for spacecraft - your actual range depends on how much weight is stacked up against your ISP.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual formula looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v = LN(WetMass / DryMass) * ISP * 9.81\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the engines you picked actually have very similar ISP (360s, 370s and 390s) and only differ by weight and thrust (how fast they accelerate). To help illustrate how weight and ISP work I\u0027ve got a little chart here showing how these engines would perform if their ISP values where changed. 300s is very poor, while 800s is very good (same as a nuclear engine). However you can see that even given the poor ISP the very light engine will still get the ship farther. This is because even if the engine is twice as efficient at burning fuel, if you need to carry 3 times the weight it will have less range then the lighter craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=width: 800, class: grid]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Capsule \u0026amp; Fuel Tank[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Fuel[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Engine[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]Total Weight[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]300s ISP[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]390s ISP[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]800s ISP[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1.1 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]9.75 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]12.85 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]497 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]647 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1327 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1.1 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1.25 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]4.35 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1812 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2355 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]4832 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1.1 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]0.5 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[td]3.6 tons[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2386 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]3102 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]6364 m/s[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there is a reason these different engines exist in the game, even though the last one is in theory the most efficient in any situation (it has the highest ISP and the lowest weight). That reason is thrust. Thrust is the amount of force being applied by the engine at once (kN). In a way it is related to how quickly the engine is burning fuel and how fast it is applying the delta-v. If you had two engines with the same ISP but one had twice the thrust of the other then it would burn it\u0027s fuel twice as fast. In car terms thrust would be speed - both cars might have the same range of 300 miles but one has a top speed of 100mph and the other one can only do 50mph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are in orbit speed (thrust) doesn\u0027t matter as much. You aren\u0027t going to fall back to the ground so you have lots of time to get where you want to go which means if the slower car has a longer range you can take it. However when you are trying to get into orbit (or land without crashing) you need a certain amount of thrust because you are fighting gravity. Think of it like trying to drive up a hill - that slow efficient engine might not have enough power and it just falls back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3rd engine you picked, the LV-909, has a thrust of only 50 kN. That is very weak and it means that it can only lift a small amount of weight in Kerbin\u0027s gravity (9.81 m/s). The actual amount can be easily found by dividing: 50 / 9.81 = 5.81 tons. So if your total mass is more then about 5.8 tons your rocket will just sit on the launchpad because the engine can\u0027t get it off the ground. By comparison the largest engine you picked has a thrust of 3200 kN. That means it can lift about 326 tons off Kerbin which is much more useful if you want to build something bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T16:15:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cannon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cannon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epurpose is to get as far as possible\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third design should carry you furthest.
