Whenever I use ASAS during launch for particularly large rockets (using NovaPunch, so \u0022large\u0022 here means the bottom stage might have a 5m tank and a bunch of booters), the system introduces huge oscillations in the rocket; the whole thing tends to bend around the center of mass. Without enough struts, these oscillations can tear the whole thing in half (usually at the decouplers between stages).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...how does one go about dealing with this? It seems obvious to me that the ASAS code is over-correcting, then over-correcting its over-correction, and back and forth it goes. Should I slap a ton of RCS thrusters and tanks on as well to keep things steady? Or...am I just missing something entirely? I\u0027ve kinda been using real-world rockets as a rough guide, like the Saturn V and SLS concepts, but maybe this is just totally wrong-headed for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Gamah","CreatedById":42887,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T01:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the ASAS code needs a factor of smoothing, like what was added to the Gforce meter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I always try to sturdy up my ships with a lot of struts between decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gosnold","CreatedById":46635,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T12:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try and use mechjeb, it has a setting which keeps the rocket on a defined course and works better than ASA IMHO.

For any craft that experiences these significant oscillations caused by ASAS, MechJeb\u0027s ascent autopilot tends to flip the craft on its nose. (This is rather hilarious, but I\u0027m afraid the hilarity of this problem is starting to wear-off on me. It\u0027s probably over-throttling it.) Using Smart A.S.S. with SURF HDG: 90 PIT: 90 holds it on course a \u003Cstrong\u003Elittle\u003C/strong\u003E better, but still ends-up being about as wobbly as ASAS.
