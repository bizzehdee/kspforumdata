For that, I want pitch and yaw. I also want bigger dead zones, because as there\u0027s no self-righting impulse in space, if the stick is offset slightly my spacecraft start to spin. But in flight, I need them to be as small as possible. And while it\u0027s technically possible to fly a plane with rudder and elevators I don\u0027t actually know how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s rendezvous, EVA and m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnwalking, all of which require \u003Cem\u003Edifferent\u003C/em\u003E joystick maps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s possible to change the joystick mapping by quicksaving, quitting, reloading the game, fiddling with the settings, and then quickloading again; but that\u0027s an incredible PITA. Is there any way to change the joystick map on-the-fly? Ideally I like to have several set up and switch between them --- hey, I have buttons on the flight stick to do that! --- but I\u0027ll live with what I can get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ash73","CreatedById":15228,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-12T17:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can do all that using a virtual joystick with PPJoy and GlovePie - see example \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/10978-Joystick-controls-are-screwy?p=248215#post248215\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
