I enter into an orbit at around 620km with around 3600 Units of fuel left. 4 Nerva engines are ready to propel a landing stage into trans-planetary orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- in this example, I\u0027ve parked at a ~614 circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Ejection Angle NEVER occurs at indicated Phase Angle. In both calculations. This makes sense since you can be at any point in the orbit when the right Phase Angle to Moho occurs. But how should I round it off? Burn before Phase Angle occurs at the right ejection angle? Or after? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. When should I start burning? When I burn according to the Protractor mod, at a vessel eject angle of 69, my vessel eject angle continues increasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of my burn, when I\u0027ve compensated the delta speed, I have a ejection angle of 108!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed. My ejection velocity is not accurate enough to bring at Moho\u0027s orbit.

One orbit around Kerbin at 100km will change the angle by at least 0.5 degrees. I\u0027d recommend OP to use MJ\u0027s angles. You use KSP Olex to see the angle and stop time warp about 1-2 degrees before. I see Olex says -251 degrees, so that\u0027s about 109 for MechJeb. Also use a lower parking orbit, you\u0027ll take better use of the Oberth effect as well as be more accurate with the angles. If you didn\u0027t increase the comic draw limit, do so and plan your whole trip with nodes. First thing you do is put a node at the indicated ejection angle and use roughly as much dV as indicated on the website. You then place a second node on or close to the first inclination node you see, this is likely half way to Moho\u0027s orbit. You then fix your inclination with a second node. The closest approach things should show up on screen now. If they are very far from each other, I recommend moving your first node around your Kerbin orbit, this can have a huge impact.

Fiddle with bringing your apoapsis down until you get the \u0022near encounter\u0022 white markers. Then tweak your maneuver node until those turn into an actual encounter.
