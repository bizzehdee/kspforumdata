How to calculate (or even just estimate) the amount of lift generated by wings? I know each aerodynamics part has a fixed lift rating, but how does this relate to lift force? It can\u0027t be newtons or even kN (since, well, 0.9 canards would be useless then), but I have no idea what equation should I use to estimate how much wing area would my plane need... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T02:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lift force generated is dependent upon a lot of things, including airspeed, air density, and Angle of Attack.

The way the game works right now, the only real effect various amounts of lift have for a plane is determining how slow it can fly. The slower it can fly, the less runway it needs both taking off and landing. Thus, the amount of lift required is really a function of the plane\u0027s intended use. If you\u0027re making a spaceplane that will always takeoff and land at KSC\u0027s runway, as long as you can get it off the ground before you run out of runway, you\u0027re fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you\u0027re wanting to land out in the countryside on Kerbin or other planets, being able to take off and land on short fields might be essential to survival. In such cases, keep adding more wing parts until you get the short-field performance you want. And note that it\u0027s perfectly acceptable to make hypersonic biplanes to keep the wingspan short. Pretty much everybody does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy own self, I usually strive to have enough wing that I can land at 30m/s and in fact have to force the plane to quit flying. This allows landings in ridiculous places like near the peak of the small, spike-like island near Airbase Island. Then combine this with a TWR \u0026gt; 1 and you can take off from the bottoms of deep, steep valleys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T13:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELift also affects ascent and re-entry.

The time required to get a spaceplane to orbit is more a function of TWR than lift. All spaceplanes go through 3 stages of ascent: initial climb to ~20km, hold at ~20km to build up speed, then final rocket burn to get out of the atmosphere. The better your TWR, the less time required for each stage. In the initial climb, thrust will get you up to 20km faster than wings will. Then the time required at 20km is a function of acceleration, which is also a function of TWR. The more lift you have at this point, the harder it is to keep from accidentally reaching flameout height before you\u0027re ready. Rockets get to orbit in a couple of minutes compared to 10-20 or more for spaceplanes. Thus, the more your spaceplane flies like a rocket, the faster you get to space. And the faster you get to space, the less time you have to run your engines, so the less fuel you need to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for entering the atmosphere, I\u0027ve never had a problem with this even for planes with the insane amount of lift necessary to fly on Duna.

I\u0027m not talking about the difference between planes that have a lot of lift and planes that have even more lift, but the difference between planes that can barely take off at KSC and the kind of planes that most people prefer to build. The amount of fuel a spaceplane uses depends almost exclusively on the speed it can achieve with air-breathing engines. When you are trying to reach orbit efficiently with a plane that requires a 20 to 30-degree angle of attack for level flight above 20 km, reaching the top air-breathing speed takes a lot of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for entering the atmosphere, I\u0027ve never had a problem with this even for planes with the insane amount of lift necessary to fly on Duna.

(And with 0.23 and tweakables, the balancing no longer takes many hours and many failed re-entry attemps.) With cargo planes, you don\u0027t know in advance where the center of mass in going to be, so you either have to use ballast tanks (leading to a heavier and more complex design), or you can use less wings, which leads to a more forgiving design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T18:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt 30 degrees angle of attack you\u0027re only losing 14% of your horizontal thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift falls faster with air pressure than you can compensate in speed.
