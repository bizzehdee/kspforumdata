I suspect that it will be because some part\u0027s *surface* temperature goes over the threshold -- radiators won\u0027t help you with this.\n\nThe only situation I found where they provide any benefit at all is during long entries when the surface heat creeps into the parts and becomes just plain heat. The radiator has to sit on the leeward side of the part that is getting too hot (preferably no flames at all at the radiator) which can be tricky to assemble, and for all the effort the amount of heat you shed is very small. Pretty much everything else you can do will be more effective than trying to find just the right spot for a radiator.\n\nKeep some fuel handy and do a retro-burn when the heat gets serious. Attach wings and try a gliding entry (in terms of weight, that\u0027s totally affordable... part count can become nasty, though).

They\u0027re intended to keep a ship from overheating due to prolonged exposure to intense, unfiltered sunlight and the slow build-up of heat from the long-term operation of its various systems. That\u0027s what they do in real life. The whole thing about using them to cool rockets when running nuclear engines and during reentry is the result of sheet technical ignorance on the part of a large proportion of the community.\n\nThe story goes like this: In 1.0-1.0.2, nuclear engines suddenly became effectively useless because Squad decided, for no apparent or justifiable reason, to make them blow up if you ran them for very long. This was totally unrealistic because in real life, nuclear engines are cooled by the flow of the fuel, which takes the heat and expands, thereby creating thrust. That\u0027s their entire operating principle so overheating during operation isn\u0027t a problem with them.\n\nHowever, instead of clamoring to fix this basic problem with the game, a lot of technically ignorant folks demanded radiators to deal with the new heat, and even thought this heat was realistic. Some more technically savvy folks, however, clamored to remove the silly unrealistic heat instead. So in 1.0.4, Squad catered to both groups. Nuclear engines now produce a LOT less heat than they did in 1.0.2, AND we have radiators. Because all the ignoramouses who were demanding radiators for their LV-Ns now no longer needed them for that, and thought (based on mods, I guess) that this was the only reason to have them, they think radiators are now useless.\n\nThese folks have obviously never been to Eve or Moho in 1.x. 1.x didn\u0027t just add reentry heat, it added solar heating, and that\u0027s pretty friggin\u0027 intense inwards from Kerbin. So at Eve you can, and at Moho you SHOULD, use radiators for their intended, real-life purpose of keeping your ship from frying while just sitting in orbit. But if you stay at Kerbin, or only go to Duna and Jool, then you don\u0027t really need radiators.\n\nOf course, there are mods that require radiators. Near Future, for example, on its nuclear reactors. But also Atomic Age, which adds a bunch of nuclear engines, some of which produce even more heat than LV-Ns in 1.0.2.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T16:45:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T16:32:19Z","Content":"I understand about why you would want them in real life.
