So, ok, I tried to undock the ship, just rotate it and when I click in the dock mode again to redock, it just dont work. It\u0027s just like if I\u0027m in staging mode. It happens to anyone else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T22:12:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking mode has nothing to do with if the ships actually dock or not, that is all based on distance between the docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, after you undock you have to put a certain distance between your two ports before they can dock again. This is so you actually can undock without being sucked in again by the magnetism.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T22:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m am unsure of the problem, but depending on how far you actually are away from the ship could be an issue. (You also don\u0027t have to be in docking mode to dock you can use IJKLHN for the RCS thrusters in staging mode). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice: thrust away until you are about 10m from the port, fix your alignment, then thrust forwards to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T05:36:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight after you undock, the magnetism which connects the rings is temporarily disabled. This is so they don\u0027t just grab enough other again as you\u0027re trying to move the ships away from each other. Back off a certain distance, which I believe is 10 meters, and the system resets itself and docking will be possible again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T09:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUndock.
