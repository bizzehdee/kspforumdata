Thirdly the camera can\u0027t focus on a different point, it\u0027s fixed to one point in the hangar and can only rotatate and move relative to that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Can\u0027t build parts on their own or at least cant build more modules of a rocket at the same time, se\u00A0can\u0027t move the camera and use the editor when there\u0027s no primary command pod even if there are other unattached comand pods around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, don\u0027t take personally the enraged points, there\u0027s a lot of factors including being behind the PC the whole day,\u00A0however, I would always develop something so these things are avoided and even in such events which in the wild out there will continue to happen, someone\u0027s going to have a bad day and he wants to ride it out, I mean, I tend to play such games only at times when I am not in a mood to do real work and other chores, not always true and in this case it was half-half.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was tolerating a lot of lag once I got over 300 parts or something, basically every 10-20 seconds the whole game freezes for a few moments, this is probably some part of the engine getting clogged up\u00A0not being up to par and it\u0027s unfortunate that it is mucking up things a bit, because the rest of the time the game is still smooth, I mitigated this by taking a break and restarting the application, thisfreeze- lag is present across the whole game, in editor and in main menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll just stop here or else it\u0027ll turn into a wall of text.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thread I was writing before was about label details at the \u0022Intersect 1\u0022 markers, I just couldn\u0027t understand the whole intersect thing because of the inconsistency, the pictures you see above is actually a real bug that was confusing me thinking that there\u0027s a range, the intersect marker I think only appears when the orbits intersect but within 5 kilometer buffer, well, it looks like this buffer is WAY too big and way too off, and I kept looking at the ascending and descending nodes and thinking that is the intersection, it\u0027s just that terminology is field-specific but also context-specific and that was a big confusion, if you look at the horizontal view, the orbits lines do \u0022intersect\u0022, but that is only in 2D illusion when you\u0027re looking from the side like that, so this Rendezvous Intersection is a real one, I thought that the marker was similar to the ones for planets when you have a flyby and closest approach, but I have a more detailed thoughts all about that and right now I don\u0027t want to make this more complex by mixing too much all in one, basically I\u0027d like the labeling and terminology to be more specific rather than vague like \u0022Distance:\u0022 or \u0022Speed\u0022 as well as Periapsis ..etc and other markers\u00A0because these things change when the target changes so it\u0027s a more relative sometimes, it could help if the markers would have a suffix or prefix or some kind of extra indication, color probably should be the same, there could be a small tiny character or a \u0022*\u0022 sign added to them or some kind of other icon, you could have more things displayed, some people could think it\u0027s cluttered but so should\u00A0be optional, cause currently, the same markers that show the current orbit details are moved to the manouvering orbit but they all look the same. Now I don\u0027t have any specific explanation here of how I would have it, this is just a draft of what I\u0027m thinknig about right now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was confused for some time because the detail labels, the \u0022Separation\u0022 value below on the intersect point shows the distance of the target at that time the commanding ship reaches that point,\u00A0I kinda expected that would show me how far the orbits are apart, until I figured out it works in another way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this is just my subjective idea, so I did not want to make it sound like it\u0027s a bug report, just my suggestion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is what I was going to post, without the other obsolete thoughts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhe intersect point is the intersection of the target orbit, right?, so my idea is it\u00A0should display the separation distance between the orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy, because it is logical, you have a label \u0022about something\u0022 and more details \u0022about that something\u0022, \u003Cstrong\u003EIntersect Point \u0026gt; Separation:\u00A0How far is the intersect point away from target orbit\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E, would fit way better, that\u0027s the number I was looking for and because that\u0027s what we\u0027re looking at here, this is more correct detail for this label.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Separation\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0value which is the \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eseparation of the target to the intersect marker\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u00A0shown\u00A0under the \u003Cstrong\u003EIntersect point\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0label should totally fit into the details of \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003ETarget Position At Intersect\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 and 2 marker labels, which currently has no more details, so it should be simply moved there, not removed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, see how it fits, \u003Cstrong\u003ETarget Position At Intersect\u003C/strong\u003E is talking about the position fo the target, okay, now for the details\u00A0\u0022and..\u00A0\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehow far is the target away from the intersect point\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, this and that much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that even if the intersection buffer is still as low as 5 km, this would give extra precision, it would still help having this number in my head to better have the situational awareness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222970509\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157064\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488276843\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140720\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chaos_Klaus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Chaos_Klaus said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe timing of these particular orbits is probably not ideal so that the objects miss each other and never get closer although the orbits are touching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI purposelly created this manouver orbit plot so the imo-bug can be seen in action, there\u0027s some other stuff I thought it was weird and had a lot of confusion with but I didn\u0027t had enough grounds for those, I identified them as my beginner inexperience and other categories, this is the one I think it just doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s intended.
