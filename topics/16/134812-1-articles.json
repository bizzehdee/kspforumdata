Use radial symmetry. To replicate the gif, make once cluster using radial symmetry (R key in SPH, default in VAB), and then duplicate it using another symmetry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T22:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell you can radially attach 8 octo struts and stick the engines to them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing not everyone knows is that you can\u0027t occlude ion engines.
