In particular SCANsat and RT2 added a feeling of progression and StageRecovery (along with RT2 again) are great for adding more engineering concerns and a level of realism.\n\nWhat I am wondering now is what next? I feel like there is not really any point in going to other planets. I have used most of the parts, and done most of the stuff the game has offered by simply visiting the Mun and Minmus.\n\nI looked at The Community Tech Tree, and it was exactly what I was looking for, an extension, but it was just empty branches and for some reason the main page did not even list which potential combinations of mods to use to fill it out. It was not clear if it recommended installing all supported mods, or some were more of an either or situation.\n\nAnd there in Interstellar, which has always looked interesting.\n\nAnyways, what are your suggestions for adding new technologies/things to do (in particular reasons to go to other planets) for someone who has done everything else.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T23:17:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T16:23:24Z","Content":"Why do you feel there is no point in going to the other planets?

But to make use of all the parts you have unlocked now, you can have fun going interplanetary. Building space station around other bodies. There is plenty of contracts that require to go beyond kerbin\u0027s SOI. Moving big asteroids is challenging. So the progression left for you now could be oriented towards contracts, reputation, funds, pushing the limits, working on creativity and optimisation of your ships and so on.\n\nRegarding the late game extension I\u0027 m not there yet and can\u0027t really advise but my plan is to install new solar system or the real solar system once I m really done with the stock one. Kerbal Galaxy looks promising but it s too early for me and for the mod I think.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T18:22:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nookos**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:16:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Because getting off Eve is like getting off the Kerbin or the Mun just with a bigger rocket.

Eve ascent is a special case, it is intended to be that hard, but not others. If you don\u0027t like Eve for now, why not go somewhere else?\n\n2. It\u0027s not as simple as just building big. The first thing is that Kerbin system don\u0027t give you a chance to build a rocket that takes off in an atmospheric setting *after a landing*, unless you land a rocket on Kerbin and then take off again, but I guess you didn\u0027t do that (neither do I). And the fact that surface pressure of Eve is greater than 1atm just makes the design consideration even more important.\n\n3. My 5-crew lander that can return from a Duna/Ike landing trip - needs less than 100 parts. My i3 from a couple of years ago didn\u0027t find any problem with computing its physics even after I spammed science instruments on the lander.\n\n4. You can\u0027t do interplanetary transfer with eyeballing the target above horizon or things like that. Putting maneuver node itself is at least somewhat harder than Mun/Minmus. If you still want a harder challenge - try fly a plane on those planets with atmosphere?\n\n5. Two ways to deal with abundant fund/sci - either set up your own goal (and forget about contracts), or start a career with extremely low rewards"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:28:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well at least no progression.

Now you can actually do complex and interesting engineering challenges ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). \n\nTry building a self-sufficient colony on another world. For this you will need a life support mod (take your pick from many choices), the [USI Kolonization System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-1-0-2-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-30-3%29-2015-05-22), and maybe [Extraplanetary Launchpads](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-0-90-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-0-2) to be self-sufficient in hardware as well. This will tax your imagination and definitely be a challenge.\n\nOr set yourself some smaller but still challenging goal, such as circumnavigating the planet of your choice via a rover (or air vehicle). See how many asteroids you can maneuver into a specific crater on Mun. Go visit all the anomalies."},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:11:35Z","Content":"The beauty of this game, for me, is that I can set my own goals, end-game, whatever you want to call it. I am also very close to finishing the tech tree, but this is just the beginning for me. My ultimate goal is to create a massive ring station in Kerbin orbit. I expect it to cost upwards of 100 million Kash. This means I\u0027ll probably need to land a science lab on every single body and convert the science to Kash in order to fund the thing.\n\nBut yes, I can see the allure of mods to give you that creative spark, help you devise your own goals, or make them harder/easier, whatever you want.

They\u0027re both excellent mods btw.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not sure how either handle resource gathering.\n\nKSPI has its own, fairly versatile ISRU system (not sure if they merged it in any way with the stock one), while NFT has none AFAIK though this may have changed with the 1.0 update.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or if either are extensions to the game or more like complete reworks.\n\nThey\u0027re more like extensions; KSPI is much closer to a rework though. The only modifications to stock are that KSPI requires you to add radiators to long-term missions relying on solar power and modifies the seismometer, whereas NF halves the stock ion engine\u0027s thrust to keep it in line with its own balance and has an optional module switching stock nukes to using its own liquid hydrogen resource rather than stock LF (at least last time I checked). Now on to what they add.\n\nNF is pretty stockalike in its mechanics; the only really new things are the reactors, and those are relatively simple. It basically just expands on the ion engines a lot, with supporting power generation and storage. KSPI is more in depth, adding a much more complicated system of energy production, heat management, and energy usage, along with some complicated engine mechanics, warp drives, and a minor overhaul to the science system. I\u0027d personally go with KSPI, but only if you\u0027re willing to deal with it being really complicated. And keep in mind that KSPI is a whole lot more overpowered, though NF is also fairly overpowered.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Both support community tech tree. I am not sure what their tech tree is like without it? I am not sure if either would include empty branches if I installed it and CTT.\n\nCTT\u0027s gonna have empty branches pretty much no matter what, since there are a few branches intended for specific mods which take a bit of tracking down. I\u0027d install it, since it\u0027s pretty good anyway. Not sure what their tech trees look like without it, but they\u0027re probably serviceable ones.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Neither seem to have decent demo/trailer videos to watch.\n\nNope. The best demo for KSPI I\u0027m aware of is Scott Manley\u0027s video on it, and I know of no good one for NF.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T23:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whovian**"}]}
