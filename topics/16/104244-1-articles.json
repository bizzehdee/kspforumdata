I know we can display ones that are free floating, but im thinking of displaying currently manned craft only, and maybe a crew count and a total seat count.\n\nIs there a simple way to do this, or do I have to hope SQUAD include it in Version 1.0\n\nThanks,\n\nRBS."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T11:43:10Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think this is possible. \n\nTo distinguish manned of unmanned, you can rename ships (from a control pod or probe core). Then you can set the vehicle type (there are maybe 8 types from space station to lander and satelites)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mythos","CreatedById":137308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T11:45:06Z","Content":"Not quite sure what you mean. If you are searching for Jeb or your top engineer/scientist you should have a look in the astronaut complex at the list of kerbals in flight. It also tells you the Name of the vessel, module and seat.\n\nOr did you mean a filter for manned/unmanned craft only?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T11:45:44Z","Content":"No. You can only differentiate between provided types, and \u0022crewed\u0022 or \u0022uncrewed\u0022 are not part of that.\n\nYou can, however, change a type of any vessel to anything else - you can work around this issue by changing the type of your currently uncrewed vessels to \u0022probe\u0022, or something you rarely use, and filtering that. Changing the vessel type each time a kerbal enters/leaves a capsule sounds tedious, though.\n\nNo idea about mods that would do this, sorry."},{"CreatedByName":"rockbloodystar","CreatedById":59828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T15:21:46Z","Content":"So, dear squad please add option to display occupancy of craft on tracking station.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:52:34Z","Content":"In the tracking station, if you click on a vessel (in the list on the left side of the screen) and then look to the right side of the screen - there\u0027s an information and crew icon ... if you click on the crew icon, it will list the crew in that vessel. Is that what you\u0027re looking for?"}]}
