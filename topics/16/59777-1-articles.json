Also you don\u0027t have a lot of tail and what tail you do have is angled, reducing it\u0027s effectiveness. Try angling them straight up to see if it helps.

I found my pitch to be around 30 degrees with the prograde at 5 to 10 degrees. Around 20k (when the RAPIERS start to go asymmetric), you can throttle back and hit ignite the aerospike. Your pitch is already high enough for the aerospike to put you in the right direction, and throttling down allows the RAPIERS to air breath a bit longer. Soon after, switch RAPIER\u0027s mode and go full throttle. Now you just have to play out orbital mechanics as for a rocket.

I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because you have the tail fins, ladder, and parachutes on and your CoM is so far back. Your plane is so neutrally stable that when you burn off fuel, the CoM shifts back and up (behind your CoL but that doesn\u0027t matter in space). When it\u0027s time to ignite the rockets, all that trust makes it buck like a bronco because your CoM is above the Center of Thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XJjHUk5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XJjHUk5.jpg\u0022\u003E 80 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried a few tweaks if you want to give something similar a try. I ditched about 1/4 to 1/3 of the oxidizer the RAPIERS were carrying. I moved the rear landing gear forward and outboard from the engines to wing connector (closer to the CoM), and removed the ones from the wings. I also added a canard to the tail (so it\u0027s actually a horizontal slab) in between the wings, but just in front of the RAPIERs, to move the CoL back a little and give some more flight control authority (which the SAS made full use of.) I also placed it slightly low on the fuselage to offset the weight of the tails but it wasn\u0027t quite enough. If you\u0027re going to add a canard to the back, you might want to put a strut or two in between the sandwich of the wings because the extra force caused them to flex. If you put it inside, I doubt you\u0027ll be able to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the thing still flew with about 20 degrees AoA but took off and climbed out a bit easier. I just parked the pitch at 30 degrees and let it ride till 18km and lit the aerospike. If you adjust pitch AT ALL at this point, it will fall due to lack of speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring orbital insertion, the plane still wanted to pitch up. So if you want all those chutes and ladders (no pun intended), then you\u0027ll have to figure out how you want to shift your CoM down some. You might also want to check your CoM location after you burned off your fuel. Right now it\u0027s neutrally stable but will probably be unstable when you want to reenter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(By the way: Make sure you remove your gear while you play with the CoM.

Notice I\u0027ve added parachutes as for a \u0022resettable\u0022 quick stop if needed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimbout:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I get the nose way up then let it droop, the airplane caught itself and climbed out slowly. If I tried to fight and hold a specific pitch angle, or tried to climb too aggressively, the nose eventually fell and stalled out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if this is what you\u0027re running into, try climbing out very shallow until you can get high enough to get some speed. I found my pitch to be around 30 degrees with the prograde at 5 to 10 degrees. Around 20k (when the RAPIERS start to go asymmetric), you can throttle back and hit ignite the aerospike. Your pitch is already high enough for the aerospike to put you in the right direction, and throttling down allows the RAPIERS to air breath a bit longer. Soon after, switch RAPIER\u0027s mode and go full throttle. Now you just have to play out orbital mechanics as for a rocket. With a big HOWEVER...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital insertion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy airplane wanted very badly to pitch up. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because you have the tail fins, ladder, and parachutes on and your CoM is so far back. Your plane is so neutrally stable that when you burn off fuel, the CoM shifts back and up (behind your CoL but that doesn\u0027t matter in space). When it\u0027s time to ignite the rockets, all that trust makes it buck like a bronco because your CoM is above the Center of Thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried a few tweaks if you want to give something similar a try. I ditched about 1/4 to 1/3 of the oxidizer the RAPIERS were carrying. I moved the rear landing gear forward and outboard from the engines to wing connector (closer to the CoM), and removed the ones from the wings. I also added a canard to the tail (so it\u0027s actually a horizontal slab) in between the wings, but just in front of the RAPIERs, to move the CoL back a little and give some more flight control authority (which the SAS made full use of.) I also placed it slightly low on the fuselage to offset the weight of the tails but it wasn\u0027t quite enough. If you\u0027re going to add a canard to the back, you might want to put a strut or two in between the sandwich of the wings because the extra force caused them to flex. If you put it inside, I doubt you\u0027ll be able to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the thing still flew with about 20 degrees AoA but took off and climbed out a bit easier. I just parked the pitch at 30 degrees and let it ride till 18km and lit the aerospike. If you adjust pitch AT ALL at this point, it will fall due to lack of speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003EGood ideas I am gonna try and play around with it again tonight deffinately! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring orbital insertion, the plane still wanted to pitch up. So if you want all those chutes and ladders (no pun intended), then you\u0027ll have to figure out how you want to shift your CoM down some. You might also want to check your CoM location after you burned off your fuel. Right now it\u0027s neutrally stable but will probably be unstable when you want to reenter the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003EGood point, Ive located the RCS thrusters centered to CoM, but of course I didn\u0027t think of I burned fuel to get up there.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003EThe whole point of the plane is a reusable science plane which I can send back down to a planet or moon and then rendevouz with the orbiting lab.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(By the way: Make sure you remove your gear while you play with the CoM.

It was slow because of how the plane flies. I guess I should have also said I wasn\u0027t using MechJeb to throttle modulate for me.

The plane is already unstable because of the angled wings so I figured I wouldn\u0027t get to 25 km and 1000 m/s. So I first ran a profile with the same craft using straightened wings.

I could give it a little boost with the aerospike, but the speed/altitude bled off. This was with a vertical climb rate of about 10 m/s through 21 km (and lower as I climbed).

The red line is the airflow (represented by the prograde marker). If you look at your forward wings (the \u0022structural wing\u0022 element), it is still at negative AoA. Your forward-top section is angled down to far and is providing a downward lift force, while your lower half is probably getting close to max lift (and will soon start to decrease lift). Essentially your forward angled sections are canceling each others lift out (sort of).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a side effect of using an elevon is that you put a lot more force into your wings, causing them to flex. I went back to my first design and put a single strut inside the wings, on the main delta part. Also, I went and locked out the roll and yaw function of the lower elevon, leaving it for pitch only. This helped minimize pitch losses when rolling and pitching the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, activating your elevon (to pitch up) causes your wing to lose lift, making your heavily laden/low lift design slow down further. That\u0027s why minimal pitch changes (till you\u0027re higher and faster) are important for flying this design. Don\u0027t hesitate to use the aerospike in little bursts if you get too slow in that 8,000 to 14,000 ish altitude range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my (limited) experience, MechJeb has a hard time controlling these kind of characteristics.
