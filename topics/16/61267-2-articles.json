As you pull the prograde marker watch your orbit extend. Eventually a periapsis node will show up at roughly the 12 o\u0027clock position. Continue to pull the prograde marker slowly. As the periapsis and apoapsis heights get close to equal they will start to move, if you pull too long they will actually swap position. You want to stop pulling when they are halfway swapped, with one marker at the 3 o\u0027clock position and the other at 9 o\u0027clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

He may not be able to pilot the ship, or repair the engines/trim the sails by himself. The captain\u0027s job is to oversee everyone whose job it is to do all of that. He\u0027s required to know enough to get his job done, but you can\u0027t just take the captain of the ship and put him on any given task and expect it will work out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, there are distinctions between the \u003Cem\u003Ecommander\u003C/em\u003E of a vessel (traditionally a captain, but also possibly called a skipper or, in unusual circumstances, a coxswain might hold the position,) and the \u003Cem\u003Emaster\u003C/em\u003E. (Also the owner as well, but in this case the owner is irrelevant.) The master of a ship makes the big decisions - the master is the one who says \u0022We\u0027re sailing this boat to Shanghai,\u0022 or \u0022we\u0027re sailing for Portland.\u0022 The captain is the one who organizes it all, and the navigator and pilot are the ones who set the course and apply the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really, really kind of ****e at setting a course on my own, and even worse at applying the throttle except under the most forgiving of conditions, and by that I mean Minmus.
