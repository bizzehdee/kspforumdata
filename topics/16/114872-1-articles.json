Specifically, how worried should I be about my TWR? I can\u0027t decide between the trade-off of delta-v and twr, any help? Never done an interplanetary mission before, so I don\u0027t know what to expect. What kind of burn times am I looking at? What kind of time-frames should I expect between nodes? But first I don\u0027t even know if it\u0027ll move in any sort of useful way so let\u0027s take care of that first.\n\nStats as it would be in LKO now:\n\n.72/2.72 TWR with 4779 DV\n\n2144t\n\nUsed TweakScale by the way to make the dream of building a station capable of carrying out all science! Obviously this is maybe a bit on the \u0022cheap\u0022 side but just trying to have some fun with this mission while I get my planet-traveling feet wet.\n\nIf you guys want screens or something else let me know, playing right now actually so Ill be popping between KSP and the boards.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T16:45:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Glaran K\u0027erman**"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T16:25:09Z","Content":"TWR isn\u0027t quite important once you\u0027re free from the surface.

The only notable consequence will be the burn time for manoeuvres. So do not worry too much about it (still avoid powering a 200t ship with a single ion engine)\n\nWhat you want to look at is the delta-v. Try to get it as high as you can, but do not add too much mass to your ship or it will take you 10 flights to assemble it in orbit. Kerbin escape takes roughly 950 m/s delta-v from LKO and insertion burns from interplanetary space can go up to 3500 m/s (for Moho). You can get detailed delta-v information for interplanetary transfers on [this](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png) map.\n\nFor burn times, it depends on your TWR. For example, with a ship having around 0.20 TWR, I did a 25 mins insertion burn at Moho (3600 m/s). If you\u0027re using ion propulsion, which is the most efficient, expect to have burn times approaching an hour unless you use dozens of ion engines on your ship.\n\nTime frames between node (interplanetary travel times, if I understood well) can range from less than 100 days for Duna or Eve to a few years for Eeloo."},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T16:50:52Z","Content":"Figured this being a post about thrust here is a look at the engines, big Poodles rock.\n\n![YDSAs7H651HVBscQ8vHGPO6jCbV4WaAmY6CfKa7vRrk?size=1024x768\u0026size_mode=2](https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/2/AAC6zErXtXbkkvvyai_Y9Eg7JtJfqFABctpurVGtUaOfLg/12/434521386/png/32x32/1/_/1/2/Engines.png/CKqKmc8BIAEgAiADIAQgBSAGIAcoBw/YDSAs7H651HVBscQ8vHGPO6jCbV4WaAmY6CfKa7vRrk?size=1024x768\u0026size_mode=2)"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T18:40:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E TWR isn\u0027t quite important once you\u0027re free from the surface.

Doing a course-correction to a long burn when you\u0027re 6 months out isn\u0027t. \n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Ace_Warbringer","CreatedById":108767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T19:44:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wont having low thrust on a heavy object in space make it far more difficult to accurately use maneuver nodes?

If your burn is one full minute, begin your burn at 30 seconds before the maneuver.\n\nthis sorta balance\u0027s the error induced by the nodes assumption of a instant burn."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T20:24:30Z","Content":"You\u0027re right, long burns are not accurate to manuver nodes. Manuver nodes are point optimizations of burns. An accurate burn node would require calculus to integrate mass and velocity WRT time.\n\nThere are two camps to interplanetary nodes. Getting enough thrust for a single burn in an acceptable timeframe, or multiple burns for additive work over multiple orbits. Like so many things in orbital manuvers, it\u0027s a tradeoff of speed and efficiency.\n\nIf your stage has a Kerbin relative TWR .33 most interplanetary burns can be done within a quarter orbit. This offers a reasonable accuracy compromise. Even with a TWR that high, you can also make use of Pe kicks for more work efficiency. With enough planning, you can use a sublunar elliptical orbit to give a perfect departure time and angle.\n\nSome people use Minmus as a way station for interplanetary flight. What it losses in efficiency, it makes up for in easy refuel, much more relaxed departure windows, and a down payment on most the dV required to leave Kerbin SoI.\n\nIn-fact, if you can\u0027t work out aerocapture logistics for a minimus mining operation to fuel an interstellar tug operation, it is more fuel efficient overall to perform interplanetary transfer from Minmus orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P. Coltrane","CreatedById":61065,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T20:32:47Z","Content":"Also, be careful with your Pe. If your orbit is too low, you risk entering Kerbin atmosphere because the way your orbit changes when you burn for a long time. The solution is burn less time in each pass of your apoapsis kicks... hence more passes... and it gets tedious pretty fast. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nHow low can you be depends of course, but anything below 100 km is a gamble, so I\u0027d say expend some dV getting to 100."}]}
