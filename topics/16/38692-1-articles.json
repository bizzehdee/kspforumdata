That\u0027s a mouthful...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, seriously. Put a Reaction Wheel on your rover and make sure it\u0027s on when you drive. You can make it the core piece of your design; slap some of the large structural panels on the bottom for impact protection. You can then use modular girder segments to build out the rest of your chassis - a stable rover will have a long wheelbase (distance between the front and back wheels) and a long axle track (you want this to be not quite as long as the wheelbase, but out there a bit). When you\u0027re out driving, lock the steering on the back wheels, turn SAS on and switch over to the docking controls (or remap the controls for rover steering, whichever floats your boat). Should be able to get up to the maximum speed of the wheels on level grade without flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also recommend structural panels or a modular girder adapter on top of your rover. Again, that\u0027s for impact protection; structural panels and modular girder segments have an impact tolerance of 80 m/s, which is beyond the speed you\u0027re going to be able to travel with any set of stock wheels. Makes a skycrane drop a lot safer too. That way if the rover does roll over, it\u0027s still intact - and then the trick becomes righting it again. I usually include two or three 24-77s pointed upwards with toroidal fuel tanks for this purpose. Be careful where you put them, though; they\u0027re no good to you if they\u0027re the first thing that breaks off when your rover flips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know of one guy who added ion engines to his rover design to provide downward force. Actually worked, though that\u0027s got its own can of worms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck; let us know how it turns out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteWeasel","CreatedById":59171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T14:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using these wheels, they have a lot of torque and will flip lighter rovers when turning.

I was using the TR-2L Ruggedized Vehicular Wheel (WhiteWeasel\u0027s picture), since they have a lot of torque and really good traction (they start and stop really well)... BUT that also means no drift at all when turning at higher speeds, so easier to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RoveMax Model 1 on a low and wide vehicle seems to work really well. I added some RCS to mine so I can flip it back over if necessary, put the tanks really low, the power comes from two PB-NUKs on top of a battery that\u0027s also low and center, and a small docking port so I can easily stick it to a lander for delivery. And it carries two Kerbals or drives remotely!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lock the steering on the rear wheels when driving fast, and unlock when I need precision steering (bind \u0022toggle steering\u0022 to an action group). When on a planet(oid) with low gravity, I remove the front wheels from the \u0022Brake\u0022 action group, so less likely to do a front-flip when hitting the parking brake at speed too.
