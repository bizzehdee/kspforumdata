Now you should firstly unlock Electrics for the OX-STAT photovoltaic panels, then Advanced Construction then at the next line, the Specialized Construction for the Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port. Once you get the docking port, you are able to build a space station near Mun, which make it possible for you to land to collect Mun samples and return to earn a lot loads of science points. Remember to make good use of the Mobile Processing Lab you have already owned, which always give you extra science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T10:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to minmus, the DV you spend adjusting your inclination and transferring to its much higher orbit is easily recovered on landing an ascending, in all minmus is the easiest place to farm for science, in fact with a lander with 4km/s of DV and a whole bunch of materials bays and goo canisters you should be able to bounce around the different biomes taking samples and eva reports while running materials bays and goo in each one.
