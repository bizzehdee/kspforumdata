Problem is, all the other Steam games expect it to be F12 and play nice with Steam by not assigning crap to F12. If Squad wanted to do it right, since Steam is the only platform the release on that does that, they should change their own default screenshot key to F12 too. Not a lot of harm in taking screenshots twice, unless you are low on drive space, but really hard drives are cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T23:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, if you\u0027re using F1 to take screenshots, you may want to become friends with F2 as well.
