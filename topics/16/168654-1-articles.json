Does it help to put the nav ball on surface?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I know which way I\u0027m going? I tried putting a node on a previous landing site and then setting that as a target, but when I use the autopilot to set it to target, it tends to pull the rover off it\u0027s wheels. It seemed happiest when I was driving away from the target even though I\u0027d selected target. Mind you it wasn\u0027t 180 degree to the target that I was traveling. It was some other odd angle. I probably should mention I\u0027m at the bottom of Minimus as best I can tell. The south pole. Not the center, but near it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI left my pilot in the rover after breaking off all the solar and running out of electricity and that thing kept picking up speed. It was going about 24 M/sec just before it had some kind of catastrophic problem. This is just on wheel idling power. How do they explain this in a simulator. You\u0027ve got some kind magic force that propels you across an entire planet with no fuel being used.\u00A0I dont think it was going downhill. I don\u0027t believe that any vehicle would handle as bad as a KSP vehicle on one of these planets.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe main question -\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI landed near a previous landing site. I thought I\u0027d visit the pilot and maybe switch with her and see her rover. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to get there. It was only about 5 km. I thought of some complicated, inaccurate ways involving the sun or my current trajectory, but it seems like there should be some simpler way of finding old space wrecks.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rovers behave oddly on the moons. What is the best way to tame this beast?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I mention that the other day I landed a 100 meter tall rocket on Minimus and it slowly fell over but stayed intact? I then detached the rover and moved it out of the way and eventually got back in the huge rocket and took off from a horizontal position on the surface and made it back to Kerbin. I was close enough to walk to the space center in daylight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big rocket scraped along and I ran out of gas and had to start up the next stage which gave me a little bit of angle to the ground. Of course on Minimus with a little speed you\u0027re going to be airborne for a long time so I got a little more perpendicular and gave it more thrust and pretty soon I was on my way home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to build a ball shaped cage rover with me and all the vitals\u00A0on the inside. I\u0027ll put wheels all over the outside so that when it hits it\u0027ll be partly absorbed by the shocks and I won\u0027t have to concern myself with pitch and yaw anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I put more wheels on a rover does it have more horsepower and go faster? Does it have better traction.

You then right-click the standard, \u0022upside-up\u0022 command pod or probecore and hit \u0022control from here\u0022 while flying (much like what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125721-zhetaan/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125721\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125721-zhetaan/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Zhetaan\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0suggested above for your rover; which is an absolute necessity). This will ensure your rocket behaves normally while flying. You then switch the control point when you release your rover or lander. And be careful when you change focus off your ship. When you switch back to it, specify which control-point you want to use again. It can sometimes switch back to a different one while off-focus; which you probably won\u0027t realize until you start burning and see that your going the wrong way again. It can get a bit frustrating at first, but you\u0027ll get used to these things and they won\u0027t harm your mission anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd one last thing about your rover: all excellent advice above. I would just say (in case you don\u0027t already) to always make sure you have a rovemate probecore (right-side up, preferably) horizontally placed somewhere on your rover. Then place the docking port or Klaw on the front or back (or both) as Zhetaan said. I find that, as long as I do this, I don\u0027t have to worry about disabling any reaction wheels.

this isn\u0027t so difficult if you orient yourself to the marker and then use yaw to spin about exactly 180 degrees (you have a heading readout on the navball, so getting that exact isn\u0027t too difficult).\u00A0 By changing only yaw, you don\u0027t need to correct your pitch or roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, instead of trying to find or make an anti-manoeuvre node, you can just plan an anti-manoeuvre.\u00A0 What I mean by this is to take your planned burn (this would work best with uncomplicated purely-prograde or purely-retrograde burns) and note the required delta-V (this is the number above and to the right of the navball when you set up a burn), then cancel that burn and set up one that is the opposite of that but for the same amount of delta-V.\u00A0 For example, let\u0027s say you want to break Minmus orbit and return to Kerbin.\u00A0 That would usually be a prograde burn from Minmus for some mid-100\u0027s value of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E--let\u0027s say you set up the burn and it costs exactly 200 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get a good Kerbin return.\u00A0 Now grab the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eretrograde\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0handle and pull it back until the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readout goes to zero and builds up again to 200 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Set the autopilot to node hold and execute your burn.\u00A0 You may need to switch from node hold to stability assist before the burn; I do not know whether such a node is stable.\u00A0 The plan in map view will look as though you plan to drop straight into Minmus and the required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for the burn will climb to 400 (the correct cut-off will always be double the needed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E), but since your engines are facing the wrong way, you actually break orbit for that good Kerbin return.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll grant you that neither of these help very much with a landing; for that, you\u0027re either going to need to try again or else see whether you can fly-by-luck.\u00A0 Some can--I remember a YouTube video of a Tylo lander that sputtered out of fuel at about ten metres above the surface completely by accident.\u00A0 Minmus is a lot easier because the weak gravity gives you time to arrest your fall, flip your lander, and contact the ground gently enough that you don\u0027t break anything important.\u00A0 But you\u0027ll need to do some fairly fancy piloting to pull it off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-18T15:22:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2017 03:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chik Sneadlov","CreatedById":68474,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-19T02:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich\u00A0way do you mount the centerline of the stabilizer on a rover?
