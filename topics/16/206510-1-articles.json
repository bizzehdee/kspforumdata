I have angled the wings and configured the control surfaces so that it can fly on trim (alt\u002BWASDQE) only with minimal or no inputs. It can fly around the globe 610m/s on almost static altitude on it\u0027s own without any inputs after setting the trims, except for the rolling. I have to constantly press Alt\u002BQ or E, and even in fine mode, I can\u0027t seem to get it to stay level. Everything is symmetrical and snapped to the center, there is no weight imbalance. The fuel drains normally.

In this screenshot is also information of how I\u0027ve configured the control surfaces. I have also disabled reaction wheels completely from the cockpit. The \u0022roll\u0022 value is constantly changing, no matter how small corrections I make to the trim. In this picture it\u0027s rolling slowly to the left 1/10th of a degree per second, and as a result of the bank angle, my heading is changing left as well (northwards).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, look at the input meters,\u00A0 where \u0022ROLL\u0022 is. In this screenshot, the plane is slowly rolling to the left, and I have applied right side trim to counteract it. If I trim it anymore to the right from that position, the plane suddenly starts rolling right (instead of the slow left bank until then) very fast, say 5-10 times as fast than in the previous trim position. In a disproportionate manner, instead of leveling calmly. On another separate flight, with the completely same aircraft and heading, the same issue happened but the rolling problem was to the opposite side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EYesterday with a similar aircraft on 2 separate identical flights, after about 2-5 mins of tedious micromanaging the roll trim I managed to get it perfectly balanced. \u003C/strong\u003EThe needed roll trim was just barely visible on the bottom-left visual meter, unlike in this screenshot where it\u0027s easily seen. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe plane flew straight and level for hours,\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003Ecircumnavigating kerbin several times and after running out it stalled safely into the ocean with the crew cockpit still intact. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the problem now? \u003C/strong\u003EI have tried the same for so much longer today and can\u0027t get it to work.

But it also happens right on first load of a craft. You can tell that this is playing a part when you revert to launch a plane, without making any changes to it, and it displays different degrees of roll tendency every revert, sometimes even in opposite directions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKSP\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (not a role in your case, but still worth mentioning).

Instead of having to correct the roll (on 4x physics warp) every 5-10 seconds, I don\u0027t have to pay attention almost at all. Though adding tip curve to the wings helped, it still didn\u0027t eliminate the problem. The plane will still keep a slight bank to the direction the kraken has chosen, 0,5-2 degrees, and so my heading will still change ever so slowly. For now the heading change is only 1/100th of a degree per second, so it is definitely manageable on KSP\u0027s miniature planet sizes. And, this eliminated the real danger of the roll issue - the plane won\u0027t fall, it will just go slowly off-course.

It makes me wonder, is such a mod possible that enables inputting numerical trim orders? With decimals even?\u00A0 Or is it possible to view the precise amount of torgue (phantom roll force) that is being applied to the plane? If the 2 previously mentioned cases are possible this issue could be completely eliminated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I suppose there is the atmosphere autopilot mod, which looks wonderful and I think it will solve everything.
