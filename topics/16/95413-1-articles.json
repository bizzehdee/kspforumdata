I think it might be the mass, I have to empty most of the tanks just to get it to lift off the runway. Here the front tank is full and the other two are empty, and he just barely manages to pitch up. I tried to make the wings larger to provide more lift but they start to disassemble as they get any bigger. I\u0027ve already had to resort to a lot of reinforcement struts to hold them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mBh6087.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/mBh6087.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/51sqayQ.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/51sqayQ.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something rather obvious? Does it need more thrust, bigger wings, less mass? I\u0027m using the 0.4 lift ailerons, so I don\u0027t think I could make those any better (the 0.6 one has a corresponding increase in weight, so I think it ends up being the same thing). Any tips and tricks form professional aeronauts would be appreciated. My ultimate goal is to get this thing into orbit (hence the big rocket in the center).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T20:58:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T20:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should post a screenshot showing center of mass, center of lift and center of thrust.
