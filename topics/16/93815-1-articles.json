I have played it for well over 500 hours, and many players have done much more.

Even that much will take many game hours as you learn, step by step, various ways to build finer things and fly in finer ways. Not long after I made my first successful mun landing, I found myself reaching the conclusion that it was impossible to build a rocket that could launch from the pad in one piece and reach Duna. This prompted dozens of hours of building refueling stations and leap-frogging my way out to Duna. By the time I had finished building the stations, I had learned enough about fuel-saving trajectories and proper use of the LV-N nuclear engine that I found it was pretty easy to make a trip straight off the pad to Jool, even. Also, I learned that having three stations in Kerbin orbit was really just a waste of fuel, and it cost the least fuel to make the full leap right from low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now well over a year into the game and still learning new things. I have once made a rather elaborate probe trip to Jool, have landed an air-breathing aircraft on Laythe, but have never brought a proper colony ship to Jool. There are always things left to do, learn, and discover. This game can take many hours away from you, but really brighten up your life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, my biggest suggestion to you is to try the demo first. It\u0027s a few versions behind so it lacks a lot of the full version\u0027s parts and polish, but it\u0027s an excellent way for you to figure out if building rockets is your thing or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
