I sent a pod and lander to Minmus for a soil sample. I didn\u0027t fit a data storage module to the lander but it had the sample in it when the Val left it in orbit of Kerbol. After she landed (safely) i sent an unmanned probe with a data module to recover the sample. When i docked it wasn\u0027t there. Was my error in not sending a Kerbal or did it simply delete once Val left?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s for future reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-10T10:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should\u00A0still be there, in orbit, stored in\u00A0the lander.
