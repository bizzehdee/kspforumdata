For stock research labs this would be annoying, as thats 4 labs worth of science transmitted back. I however made a patch to change the science amount to 5000 and the data amount to 7500 (cheaty I know, but there\u0027s nothing I hate more than having to stop timewarp every 5 months because another research lab has finished and I need to transfer the data)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027ve run into a problem with regards to transmitting this data. If anyone has used the labs before you will know that not only is research slow asf, but transmitting also takes ages. Time warp does not seem to help speed up the process as well, and I have to physics warp if I want to speed up transmitting. This is made much, much worse by the amount of science (5000 to be precice \u003Cspan\u003E:P) I\u0027m transmitting back every time. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThis is getting super annoying, because even though I have to sit through less loading screens, the transmission goes up by 0.02% each increment.
