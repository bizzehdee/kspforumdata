I\u0027ve done it separate stages. I have a mining lander on the Mun that has mined some Kethane and filled its tanks. I\u0027ve also landed a heavy converter a few meters away from it. Is there a way to get the fuel from the tanks to the converter, perhaps by landing a Kerbal?

My favourite is the KAS (Kerbal Attachment System), you get a winch with 100m of rope to connect/dock ships and you need to EVA a Kerb and grab the connectors and attach them. Quantum Fuel Transfer allowed transfer through a \u0022magical\u0022 beam between unconnected ships, not sure when that was last updated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T21:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKAS, when you get it attached, you can transfer fuels and such?
