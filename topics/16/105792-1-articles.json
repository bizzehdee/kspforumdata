I tried second time on minmus:\n\nThis time i landed on south pole of minmus and drilling seems to work. Earlier try was (i assume) \u0027great flats\u0027 biome.\n\nFrom first landing spot i got enough ore to make about 1000 units of fuel and oxidizer before drill went idle and overheated. Then I flew a few kilometres and from 2nd spot i managed to mine enough to ore fill fuel tanks, that is about 12000 units (kg?) of fuel and oxidizer. \n\nSo i suppose it\u0027s about biomes.. should learn how those work :-P"},{"CreatedByName":"destia","CreatedById":141674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:01:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E got the same problem on the mun no idea how to cool it down though\n\nFor me ISRU seems to overheat easily IF container is full of ore before i start ISRU, this makes ISRU work at high load and overheat easy.\n\nIf i start drill \u0026 ISRU at same time ISRU works at very light load (1% or so) and doesn\u0027t seem to overheat.

My drilling ship has a return capsule to go back to Kerbin. Now that the drills and ISRU are at 100% overheat, it seems to be eating up the capsule\u0027s ablator. Any ideas anyone? Is this a bug, should I get a mod with radiators or am I just doing something wrong.

After the update just turn off the drill and let it cool down for a bit, then start it back up and it should never overheat again."}]}
