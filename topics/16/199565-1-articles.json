Chemical engines exhaust is mostly water, and the chemicals required to make those fuels can all be produced out of fully renewable resources. they can also be found on other celestial bodies with relative ease. on the other hand, xenon is very rare, i\u0027m not sure how much of a stock we have, and it\u0027s almost impossible to find out there (unless going to a gas giant, but for obvious reasons it\u0027s impractical to mine those).

But keep a healthy amount of excess \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, because you still have to:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd power production. One Dawn engine consumes roughly 8.75 Ec/s. You have two options for the general power architecture, and each of them has three possible variants in terms of part choices.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOption 1: full power delivery. Use this if you\u0027re not sure how long your burns are going to be, or if you simply don\u0027t want to be limited by your power production. As such, you need to provide a solution that produces the required 8.75 Ec/s at all times, even when the engine is off. That means it\u0027s potentially going to be pretty large and heavy, and sitting unused most of the time. But it\u0027s worry-free.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOption 2: buffer with recharge. In this scenario you would provide only a part of the required 8.75 Ec/s in power production, and additional battery buffer to get you through your burns. Because batteries effectively weigh less than power production equipment, this makes the spacecraft lighter, which increases your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and makes the required launcher smaller. And since the power production equipment is going to do work even when the engine is off, to refill the batteries, you\u0027re getting more value out of your investment. However, this places a hard limit on how long you can run your engine at full power. If you produce 4 Ec/s and have 1000 Ec energy storage, then the engine (plus probe core) will be able to run for 200 seconds. Any burn longer than that will require you to throttle down to less than half thrust - and the ion engine already has anemic thrust to begin with.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned, you have two options for \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E you want to produce your power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first option are radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They have a big upside in that they just work everywhere. Daylight, nighttime, at Moho, at Eeloo, you\u0027re going to get exactly the amount of power you designed for, at all times, forever. They also have a big downside in that they are absurdly heavy for each Ec/s you want to produce. A 0.625m sized probe might weigh around 600 kg with the Dawn engine and fuel included; but enough RTGs to actually run the engine at full power would add another 960 kg - increasing the mass of your probe by over 150%. For this reason, RTGs are typically only used with the buffer-and-recharge option. The mass efficiency gap between them and batteries is just so large, it really begs to be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second option are fuel cells. They, too, give you all the power you need, whenever you need it, regardless of location and time. And they are a lot more mass efficient than RTGs. But as a trade-off, they require you to bring liquid fuel and oxidizer along, which they will consume - and once you have consumed it all, you\u0027ll be out of power. Additionally, for some unexplained reason, Squad decided to make the small single fuel cell a huge amount worse in both mass and fuel efficiency than the big fuel cell cluster, to the point where it is practically always better to just make your probe a whole lot larger and run multiple ion engines on the much better cell cluster. Which leads to another downside: you really cannot build something small and light that uses fuel cells well. The tank and cell array are going to completely dominate your design. You\u0027re almost automatically going to end up with a 1.25m form factor, and can easily go larger. Which is fine if you\u0027re trying for some cool crewed space cruiser. But for a quick and efficient science probe, it\u0027s utter overkill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third option are solar panels. They seemingly have all the upsides: small when folded up, attachable anywhere, mass efficient, good power delivery. Ideal in every way. However, if you\u0027re in the shadow of a planet, they\u0027re going to be useless. And the way orbital mechanics works, you\u0027ll \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E be in Kerbin\u0027s shadow for the majority of a burn that\u0027s going to the outer planets (Duna, Dres, Jool, Eeloo). Which means an ion engine spacecraft without sufficient battery buffer is going to struggle to even get on its way. And then there\u0027s that thing called the \u0027inverse square law\u0027. The intensity of sunlight is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the Sun. So as you\u0027re moving away from the Sun, going to the outer planets, your solar panels are going to get weaker and weaker. At Duna, you might still be getting roughly 40%-45% of their rated power; at Jool, you\u0027ll barely be getting 4%. Trying to power the hungry electric engine with that is going to be a real challenge. But, do note that this works in reverse, too. Going closer to the Sun, down to Eve, for example, almost doubles the power output, and at Moho your panels are going to be at over six and a half times rated power. Plus, when performing a burn towards the inner planets from Kerbin orbit, you\u0027ll always be in daylight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn summary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRTGs are always going to be using the buffer-and-recharge strategy. Fuel cells are almost always going to end up doing full power delivery. Solar can go either way, depending on the use case.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re going to the inner planets, always go solar. You can either go for full power delivery here, or deliberately undersize your panels at Kerbin so that they\u0027ll be delivering full power for less mass once you\u0027re closer to the sun. This works especially well if you can get a bit of an initial push from leftover fuel of your launcher\u0027s upper stage.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re going to Duna, solar is still fine. You can go for full power delivery at Kerbin and bring some extra batteries so you can run buffer-and-recharge at Duna, or deliberately bring twice as much solar power so that you\u0027ll still be at full power at Duna. It\u0027ll carry a mass penalty, but it\u0027s not that bad. Most of the time you\u0027re still going to need plenty of batteries anyway, though, because your transfer burn is on Kerbin\u0027s night side.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re going to Dres, full solar power delivery is an exercise in futility. Either go solar buffer-and-recharge, or choose one of the non-solar options.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re going to Jool or Eeloo, pick a non-solar option. Remember: RTGs are going to be really heavy but compact and endless, while fuel cells are much more mass efficient but physically huge and have limited fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-14T15:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223908427\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610571132\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209383\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrWookie2U\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, MrWookie2U said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWandering why they made \u201Cgreen\u201D or electric engines impossible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMainly because KSP is supposed to be at least somewhat realistic, and they are, in fact, basically impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nElectric engines are, of necessity, extremely low thrust.\u00A0 That\u0027s because they get their thrust by using electric power to accelerate the reaction mass, and it takes \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehuge\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E amounts of power to do that.\u00A0 Batteries and solar panels produce teeny, tiny amounts of power compared with what you get from burning rocket fuel.\u00A0 They get very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E values because they can accelerate their exhaust to extremely high speeds, but they can only do that as a tiny trickle, thus the extraordinarily low thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even to get \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E level of efficiency, they have to be in a vacuum, or extremely close to it-- so you\u0027ll never be able to use them to launch from the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunching from the surface of a high-gravity planet (like Earth, or Kerbin) requires \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehigh thrust\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t have that, no matter how efficient your engines are, you\u0027ll never make it to space.\u00A0 And high-thrust engines require expenditures of very large amounts of energy very rapidly, and the technology to do that in an electric fashion simply doesn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-14T15:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223908260\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221610554157\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209383\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrWookie2U\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, MrWookie2U said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnon modded KSP uses parts that have IRL counterparts so I\u2019m trying to make an electric rocket for possibly irl use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know you said \u0022no mods\u0022 but lots of mods have IRL counterparts too, and tend to be quite well balanced.

One Dawn engine consumes roughly 8.75 Ec/s. You have two options for the general power architecture, and each of them has three possible variants in terms of part choices.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOption 1: full power delivery. Use this if you\u0027re not sure how long your burns are going to be, or if you simply don\u0027t want to be limited by your power production. As such, you need to provide a solution that produces the required 8.75 Ec/s at all times, even when the engine is off. That means it\u0027s potentially going to be pretty large and heavy, and sitting unused most of the time. But it\u0027s worry-free.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOption 2: buffer with recharge. In this scenario you would provide only a part of the required 8.75 Ec/s in power production, and additional battery buffer to get you through your burns. Because batteries effectively weigh less than power production equipment, this makes the spacecraft lighter, which increases your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and makes the required launcher smaller. And since the power production equipment is going to do work even when the engine is off, to refill the batteries, you\u0027re getting more value out of your investment. However, this places a hard limit on how long you can run your engine at full power. If you produce 4 Ec/s and have 1000 Ec energy storage, then the engine (plus probe core) will be able to run for 200 seconds. Any burn longer than that will require you to throttle down to less than half thrust - and the ion engine already has anemic thrust to begin with.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third option are solar panels. They seemingly have all the upsides: small when folded up, attachable anywhere, mass efficient, good power delivery. Ideal in every way. However, if you\u0027re in the shadow of a planet, they\u0027re going to be useless. And the way orbital mechanics works, you\u0027ll \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E be in Kerbin\u0027s shadow for the majority of a burn that\u0027s going to the outer planets (Duna, Dres, Jool, Eeloo). Which means an ion engine spacecraft without sufficient battery buffer is going to struggle to even get on its way. And then there\u0027s that thing called the \u0027inverse square law\u0027. The intensity of sunlight is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the Sun. So as you\u0027re moving away from the Sun, going to the outer planets, your solar panels are going to get weaker and weaker. At Duna, you might still be getting roughly 40%-45% of their rated power; at Jool, you\u0027ll barely be getting 4%. Trying to power the hungry electric engine with that is going to be a real challenge.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRTGs are always going to be using the buffer-and-recharge strategy. Fuel cells are almost always going to end up doing full power delivery. Solar can go either way, depending on the use case.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re going to Duna, solar is still fine. You can go for full power delivery at Kerbin and bring some extra batteries so you can run buffer-and-recharge at Duna, or deliberately bring twice as much solar power so that you\u0027ll still be at full power at Duna. It\u0027ll carry a mass penalty, but it\u0027s not that bad. Most of the time you\u0027re still going to need plenty of batteries anyway, though, because your transfer burn is on Kerbin\u0027s night\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot it.
