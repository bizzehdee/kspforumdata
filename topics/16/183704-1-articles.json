My initial thoughts was to fly the whole thing to Jool, once I\u0027m in Jools orbit I would separate the smaller ship and do a couple of flybys on any of the Jool moons. I have been reading a lot though and I understand that Jool needs a lot of Delta V but I\u0027m not sure if you guys think this will be enough, I will not be landing on any of them body mainly fly bys to get some science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- please let me know if you have any concerns regarding the design ? obviously it very simple not to advanced at this point but your input will be highly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If you think I have enough fuel to go and back ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much in advance and I look forward to hearing your comments\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pzy599u.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pzy599u.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YyxNO5y.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/YyxNO5y.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-14T03:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll get the most/best responses to a question seeking gameplay advice if you post it in the \u0022Gameplay Questions and Tutorials\u0022 section.\u00A0 The \u0022Suggestions\u0022 section is more about suggestions of changes people would like to see to the game itself.\u00A0 A mod should be able to help you move this thread to get the right eyeballs on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom looking at the screenshot I\u0027m not really able to tell\u00A0what each of the component segments is tasked with doing what, so in that way it\u0027s a little hard to tell if the ship has what it takes.\u00A0 From your description it sounds like you\u0027re not planning on landing on any of the moons; is that correct?\u00A0 (That said, Pol and Bop are so low-gravity that it\u0027s easy and cheap to land\u00A0on them if you\u0027re going there anyway.).\u00A0 Are you planning to visit all of the moons?\u00A0 \u00A0It might also be helpful if you could post delta-v stats from the various components.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, some general thoughts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Your engine selection looks pretty good - Poodles and Terriers are good for this kind of role, and staging away the side pods with the Terriers is a smart move.
