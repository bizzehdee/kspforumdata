However I think that this provides a stronger link.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 1.0.5 and earlier, it was quite easy to attach multiple docking ports (i.e. one on top or underneath, another at the front). So if you attached the top or bottom one directly in the SPH/VAB (without even needing a corresponding port on the rover), then lined up the front one, the latter would snap to as soon as you loaded/launched the vehicle. From what I\u0027ve read recently, though, this may cause problems in 1.1 (giving major problems in the event of slight misalignment).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMyself, I\u0027d probably just go for a docking port on the front or rear of the rover, attached to the cargo bay bulkhead, with a couple of struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is always if you want to load your rover back up to take it home.

Then save and open up the cargo craft, choose \u0022open\u0022 again and use the \u0022merge\u0022 option to load in the rover. The rover should appear as an unattached assembly next to the cargo plane, with the possibility of attaching on the docking port (and only on the docking port... merge only allows attachment with the root part).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also use shift when selecting an unattached assembly, which will hive off that part, but again only the node that you\u00A0severed in doing that will be attachable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-12T18:12:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2016 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hupf","CreatedById":152424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T18:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possibility in some cases might be to Launch the two vessels separately and drive the rover into the cargo bay (you will have to move the first vessel out of the way slightly or launch the rover from the Launch Pad).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is more difficult to properly secure it for flight this way (correctly aligned docking ports or KAS), but you don\u0027t have to mess around in the SPH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
