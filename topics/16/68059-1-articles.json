I suggest escaping Kerbin first, then setting the asteroid as a target and rendezvousing as you normally would (on a larger scale of course) from there. Or alternatively, you can timewarp ahead until an asteroid enters Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and go from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is just tougher manipulating the maneuver nodes from orbit around Kerbin as there is no sphere of influence to work off of, and as such, instead of a few hundred or thousand kilometers radius of a sphere, you have maybe a hundred meters or less with an asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T18:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the \u0022Set as Target\u0022 function in map view?

If anyone knows the best order of \u0022steps\u0022 for large-scale rendezvous, that would be great to learn.

All I did was launch into the same plane, then added a maneuver node to push my apoapsis towards about halfway between where the asteroid was and its periapsis. I did have to tweak a bunch to get the closeset maneuver to appear and it jumped around a lot, but I ended up with a 350km closest approach. About 900m/s burn for that and then 150 to match velocity. At that point it was just a normal rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T19:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1/ track the asteroid in tracking station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ put your ship on launchpad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/ select the asteroid as target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4/ time warp till the asteroid is on the horizon of your navball\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5/ launch and perform gravity turn towards target prograde/retrograde, whatever is more eastern (results in inclined orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6/ circularize\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7/ draw and execute a maneuver which closely escapes Kerbin SOI and has close encounter to the asteroid at about half its trajectory towards Kerbin intercept (the escape direction is usually towards or slightly \u0022behind\u0022 the asteroid)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8/ after exiting Kerbin SOI perform standard rendezvous procedure\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T19:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor asteroids on an impact course with Kerbin, I\u0027ve found that this is a good method:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Halfway through the way out, create a correction maneuver fiddling with all three axis to get a 100-200 km close encounter (this usually take less than 150 m/s of delta-v)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Perform a number of subsequent correction burns to get as close as possible to the asteroid (5-10 km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Upon encounter, cancelling all your relative velocity will take about 700 m/s - know your TWR to time it precisely, as you will be travelling almost orthogonally to the asteroid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.
