Fire destroys things. The further you are from it, the less impact it will have. So, when you stage, put you engine separate from the decoupler in the staging and wait a bit for it to separate like a real rocket would.... or don\u0027t this is Kerbal Space Program. Unless you are playing with Stage Recovery, it doesn\u0027t really hurt anything to have a spent stage blow up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
