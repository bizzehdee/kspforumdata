Expect, I find that every single time I have an idea that I want to build, I cannot build it because one or more parts simply don\u0027t attach that way, despite every other part coming before it doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, ion thrusters and inline xenon tanks. I have spent the entire game attaching inline tanks to the sides of one another - surrounding a center one by multiple outer ones, for example. But now the game hands me the xenon tank, and it attaches in exactly one way only: at the top or bottom of a prescribed attachment point, green sphere to green sphere. You cannot stick the xenon tank to anything that is not a green sphere and strap it down with struts. It\u0027s not an issue with stability - no, the part remains transparent. It simply refuses to exist unless attached to a green sphere. The ion thruster is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept, well, an ion thruster by itself is fairly pointless. I made a really lightweight probe, just 0.6 tons, and one ion thruster is still excruciatingly weak. I want to attach more ion thrusters. I want to attach five. How can I attach five? I only have one green sphere. I cannot sidestrap xenon tanks to make more attachment points. I\u0027m honestly at a loss.

This one has four PB-Ions, a single big tank in the middle (attached to the octo), and four of the smaller tanks. I could easily add a fifth drive on top of the inline tank if needed, and with some more supports, you could add pretty much as many as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1291.photobucket.com/albums/b559/relincuish/Screenshotfrom2014-01-10211558_zps42c490f4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshotfrom2014-01-10211558_zps42c490f4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T05:36:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay - mind blown. The small girders (octaconal and cubic) were another thing that never really attached the way I wanted them to do, but here they are, doing exactly the thing I need.

Use the tiny cube support and turn on symmetry. That will give you two, four, or eight mounts that you can build from. From there, use a second cube support, line it up with the end of those first supports, and rotate them up using \u0027w\u0027. And voila! You have multiple green attachment points facing upward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe image I showed was a preliminary engine mount I added to a station, but I have an even larger mount with nine PB-Ions (two rings of four and one in the middle). I bet you could make a 13-engine mount with a ring of four, a ring of eight outside it, and one in the middle.
