So I\u0027m going blind until I pass that node and erase it. I would want something better to plan how much delta V I\u0027m going to spend in each node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) In the cases when the planner shows that I\u0027m going to do a fly-by near Duna, the closest approach is around 40 million kilometers. Changing any parameter in the maneuver node loses my target and I have to start over again. Therefore, I can\u0027t correct it using aerobraking (too far from the atmosphere) nor using the gravity to brake (I barely manage to pass close to the planet) To get the most window to do the trip I\u0027m using this calculator \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E . At least the planet phase is correct, the ejection angle is more difficult to adjust but I try to approach the best I can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Also, I\u0027ve tried other forms to save delta V, like planning a gravity boost on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn by passing twice (first time to get a wide orbit around Kerbin, and the second to leave the Kerbin system, and eyeballing the ejection angle) However, it\u0027s not possible to know if I am saving fuel or not because I can\u0027t see the delta V in each node. This maneuver is very restrictive because it gives you a fixed apoapsis, so you can\u0027t place the next node anywhere you want to do a prograde burn to raise it. It must be near the point you are leaving the Kerbin system, so if if the planet is not in the intersection of its orbit and your apoapsis, everything is futile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Sometimes I have to change these maneuvers because they modify greatly my orbital plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS I\u0027m always starting from a 600km circular orbit around Kerbin, so I can use the maximum speed in the time warp to wait until the planets are in the right position. That leaves me a delta V of 1550 m/s aprox for my probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS2 Next time I\u0027ll try to plan an insertion orbit against the direction of Duna to see if that helps to brake.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T00:50:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Arkonor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wilt57","CreatedById":64653,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T17:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, warp on the pad instead of at 600 km. This will allow you to warp at full speed, spend less fuel reaching orbit, and make a more efficient ejection burn due to Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, interplanetary burns are like golfing, if you\u0027ve ever golfed. Sure, we want a hole-in-one, but the chances of that happening are low. Instead, we settle for a drive that covers most of the distance and is straight enough towards the cup. Then we make an approach shot that will hopefully get us onto the green as close to the cup as possible. Lastly, we try to one-put our way to the cup. Like golf, try for a hole-in-one, but realize that you will have to make multiple burns (strokes) to achieve your goal. After the big ejection burn, set up a second maneuver node right after you\u0027ve left Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Either here or at the approaching AN or DN. Here you will try to lower your PE as much as possible while also aligning your inclinations. After you have entered your target\u0027s SoI, make a third burn to put your PE at the desired altitude for either an aerobrake maneuver or direct curcularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when making your ejection burn from Kerbin orbit, remember to start your burn roughly half before the node. Any large, long burn should be split up this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027ve missed your problem, my apologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T18:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWilt57\u0027s got it. Only thing I\u0027ll add is that to get into position for aerobraking, you might need to consider radial burns once you hit Duna\u0027s SOI. The earlier you do them, the less delta-V you\u0027ll have to expend. Yes, I know radial burns are inherently inefficient, but if the choice is between achieving orbit and getting flung back out into interplanetary space...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knas","CreatedById":73907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T18:31:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what you are talking about, I don\u0027t know math \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But I way I use to do it is: First I slingshot of the Mun to get me into a sun orbit. Then I just get an encounter with Duna, an other way is that you place a manuver node in a orbit of Kerbin, and try to get an encounter, if you don\u0027t get an encounter, but is very close to do it. Just do the manuver, once out of Kerbins SOI, you try to get an encounter using the yellow markers on the manuever node or/and the blue circles. You can place it anywhere on you want on your sun orbit to duna, but I usually set it in the middle. Hopefully you understand me, my english is not that good, but I hope you understand and that this helps. And other way is, if you actually get an encounter with duna in orbit of Kerbin, and do the manuever, and still have an encounter, time warp untill you are out of kerbins SOI then change the manuver. Because it would have changed. And if you want to change periapis/apoapis of the encounter, I dont know how they are spelled, you change the manuver just a bit before you are about to get into duna SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T18:44:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arkonor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arkonor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1) Using the in-game maneuver planner you can only see the delta V of the first maneuver.

They have been helpful in several ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight was the first time I have ever delivered something into a stable dunar orbit. Most of the time I was tweaking the orbit so it encountered the planet WITHOUT passing the Duna orbit. It was impossible and it consumed a lot of time. So, in the end I chose to escape from Kerbin SoI with a single push (the double m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar boost consumed more delta V, and a single m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar boost didn\u0027t give me a decent trajectory because it intersected Kerbin\u0027s orbit) In interplanetary space, the only maneuver I could do to lower my periapsis at Duna was to burn retrograde shortly before entering Duna\u0027s SoI, it went from 22m KM to 8 more or less (and 22 was my best attempt maneuvering over Kerbin, the worse, 40m or so) Meanwhile, I learned how to use the alarm clock to pause the game and kill the warp, it was a very productive time to test things, think, and pray for a non-destructive nor very far encounter with Duna. Once inside the planet\u0027s SoI, and seeing the weird polar fly-by over Duna, my kerbals in the control room calculated several ways to reduce more over the periapsis and to attempt a succesful aerocapture. After several minutes testing things in the simulator and moving the hands a lot in front of their faces to rehearse the complex maneuver, they came up with a solution. Instead of the classic \u0022pedal-to-the-metal\u0022 retrograde burning they love so much, the radial burning proved to be a much more resourceful idea. Since Duna\u0027s air is so thin and low, as much as the remaining fuel in my probe\u0027s tanks, the maneuver took place at 10km over the north pole surface. Fortunately, physics are not so reallistic to make my ship burn like a match, though the visual effects were impressive. Those were my truly 7 minutes of terror (in fact it was much less, but high speed and terror are capable of bending the fabric of space-time), the ship started to brake a lot, the apoapsis was in free fall and also the periapsis, just a tad slower. Later I would recall that my probe was fitted with a parachute (for unknown reasons, the safety department usually attach these things whenever they had the chance to sneak into the hangar) The thin vapors of fuel, less than a liter, were incredibly efficent because they allowed me to raise my periapsis from 8000m up to 52km, and lowering the apoapsis up to 450km when the engine died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETomorrow I\u0027ll post pictures if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
