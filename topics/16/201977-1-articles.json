I think the only thing that matters is signal strength as reduced signal means less science from your transmissions, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually true or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-25T07:02:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2021 07:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
