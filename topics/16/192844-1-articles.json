KSP is a game with fairly realistic physics and that means that spaceflight does not work the TV and Movies have taught you. To stay in space you need to be in orbit, which means flying around in space at a speed that is sufficiently high enough to prevent you from falling back to the planet. \u0022Coordinates\u0022 are useless at that point, since everything is in a constantly changing position. To meet up with another vessel you will need to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Be in the same orbit (basically the altitude and inclination, but there\u0027s more to it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Be in the same position at the same orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing that is called a \u0022rendez vous\u0022 and it can be tricky to do at first, although once you get the hang of it, it\u0027s fairly easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour first goal should be to get your rocket into orbit. For that, you can steer in any direction you want, but a 90\u00B0 is usually recommended for what\u0027s called an \u0022equatorial orbit.\u0022 Progress in the game is all about little steps; in the beginning making it into orbit is hard enough! Focus on that first, and then you can start working on a rendez-vous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"civillian1","CreatedById":203713,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-01T18:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhey kerbart,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for your answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlet me clarify a little bit. i\u0027m not far enough in the game yet to do stuff in orbit lol. i just need to go to a specific point on the planet and do some temperature or pressure readings. but i often find myself a little bit in the wrong direction because there is no clear way to steer in the right direction except using a little educated guess. and once my rocket is out of fuel i can\u0027t adjust my trajectory anymore\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-01T19:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223764627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022192844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221585757127\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022203713\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022civillian1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, civillian1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey guys i\u0027m rather new with this game, so i might ask something that will answer itself soon... but at the moment i\u0027m pretty stuck with this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen i launch a rocket it\u0027s very hard to determine how to go to certain locations for missions. is there something i can do to make this easier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027m talking both about the necessary amount of fuel so i don\u0027t overshoot my target but also (and especially) about general directions. it would be easy if a mission came with coordinates so i at least can rotate my rocket at the right direction before taking off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very start, your main goals are altitude-based, meaning that so long as you can find\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E, you can find the correct direction.\u00A0 It very quickly moves to reaching space, and after that goes to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estaying\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in space, for which there are numerous tutorials (including in-game ones) to help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re talking about missions to conduct studies at specific places and altitudes for science, then I should warn you that most people find them easier to complete with aeroplanes rather than rockets--not that aeroplanes are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eeasy\u003C/em\u003E, of course--and requires a completely different set of skills.\u00A0 Trying to do it with a ballistic rocket is an exercise in frustration; it\u0027s solvable (with the same techniques used by launch planners during the Cold War, in fact) but you may stop having fun before you figure it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf, on the other hand, you are attempting to reach\u00A0specific locations \u003Cem\u003Eon the surface\u003C/em\u003E, then it is still difficult\u00A0but I think I can help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may find it easier to launch to a polar orbit and then try for a precision landing.\u00A0 Polar orbit is good for that because over the course of an in-game day, you will pass over most or all of Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u00A0 That makes it possible to land anywhere on the planet, so provided that you have a rocket capable of getting to polar orbit, that rocket can land anywhere on Kerbin.\u00A0 Thus, you no longer need to design different rockets with different amounts of fuel for different ranges; a single model goes anywhere on the planet.\u00A0 Since it\u0027s roughly the same distance to the surface from any point at low orbit altitude (approximately 75 - 80 km, and your surface altitude runs from sea level\u00A0to about ten percent of that), the key to precise landings is repetition.\u00A0 Use the same type of rocket and learn a standard ascent profile so that you can reach a consistent orbit with a consistent amount of fuel.\u00A0 Then always deorbit the same way:\u00A0\u00A0use the same amount of fuel and thrust, and always decouple your engine and fuel tank at the same time.\u00A0 Always open your parachutes at the same time (you can adjust the settings so that they open at a predetermined altitude and pressure after you arm them).\u00A0 Pick a target on the surface and try to land on it.\u00A0 If you miss, then you can gauge and correct the error and try again.\u00A0 Quicksaves and quickloads are a tremendous help with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDetermining the correct direction for a rocket launch generally divides into three possibilities:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou\u0027re launching to what we may call a \u0027standard\u0027 equatorial orbit, which requires you to pitch east after launch.\u00A0 This is the 90-degree direction on the navball (learning to read a three-dimensional compass is a new skill in itself).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou\u0027re launching to a polar orbit, which requires you to pitch either north or south (it doesn\u0027t usually matter which) and, after you get some experience, slightly west in order to refine the orbit.\u00A0 This is either the 0-degree or the 180-degree direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou\u0027re launching to a retrograde orbit (this is normally\u00A0only required for satellite orbit contracts where the target orbit is retrograde) and requires you to launch west, which is the 270-degree direction on the navball.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other cases that will arise under special circumstances and as you advance in skill, but these are usually for very specific purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that a coordinate system is useless without a basis of reference (the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E isn\u0027t necessarily at 0\u00B0N, 0\u00B0E), and even one with a basis becomes useless once you leave the sphere of influence (Kerbin-centric coordinates make no sense at Minmus and even less sense at Jool).\u00A0 That doesn\u0027t touch the problem of things being in orbit also being in motion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"civillian1","CreatedById":203713,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-01T20:57:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nallright!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027ll try to figure this out tomorrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njezus this game is complicated! but a hell of a lot fun lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chequers","CreatedById":202186,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-03T07:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Civillian1, welcome aboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re getting a lot of great advice about navigating\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ein space\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0- but it doesn\u0027t sound like you\u0027re out of the atmosphere yet.
