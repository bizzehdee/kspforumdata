It seems at first glance that if I do some Science and transmit back the results, and then subsequently repeat the same Science but bring the craft back intact, that I will NOT get as many points as if I did the experiment just once and brought the craft back intact. Am I right there? Obviously I would hope that I am not, but it seems that I get so many less points the second time round that this might not be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scenario I\u0027m obviously thinking about is: do I send a one-way unmanned probe somewhere first, or do I wait until I can send a return mission to get the full benefit from the science. Is anyone able to confirm?

Each time you repeat an experiment in identical circumstances you get diminished returns. Transmitting reports always give you a penalty as well. Only the crew reports will give you 100% return for transmissions. Otherwise its always best to bring the rocket back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think the career system as is favors manned missions above unmanned but I haven\u0027t played far enough to test that out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jmt","CreatedById":88960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T20:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like there\u0027s another thread already that answers this - I had searched for \u0022science\u0022 but not \u0022radio transmissions\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53170-Science-Question-When-How-do-diminished-returns-kick-in-with-radio-transmissions/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53170-Science-Question-When-How-do-diminished-returns-kick-in-with-radio-transmissions/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
