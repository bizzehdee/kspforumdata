For example, the main fuel stage doesn\u0027t get any fuel here, nor does the final stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a pic: I must be doing something wrong, but its a pretty simple rocket, so I\u0027m not sure what.

Try pushing f3 during the flight to see if it reports any breakages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can dial back the power of the SRBs during the building stage by right clicking on them and selecting a lower thrust level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake unlocking the \u0022EAS-4 strut connector\u0022 a priority as well.

Your Nav Ball will show if that is the case or not. SRBs fire regardless of the state of the throttle setting. Otherwise, nothing wrong with your design other then you could replace the LV-30 on the upper stage with an LV-909 once you have it. The design can reach Mun or Minmus and return easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zUCLXGU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zUCLXGU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cfd0Euk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cfd0Euk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GcfUKaj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GcfUKaj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
