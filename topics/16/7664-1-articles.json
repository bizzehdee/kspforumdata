I havent actually tried any of this yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you will need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMS excel or at least a calculator;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP orbit calculator, or the ability to manually calculate orbital velocities and apo-/periapses for all kinds of orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget is in a circular orbit (oh hey, you can use it for Mun landings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet in some circular orbit on the same plane around the same body, preferably with altitude difference under 10 times (so if your target is at 100km, you should be between 1000km and 10 km). And of course your altitude shouldnt match the target\\\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow Grab your calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrite down the orbital periods of your target\\\u0027s orbit, and the duration of a Hohmann transfer between the orbits. A Hohmann transfer takes exactly half of an orbital period, so your objective is to time it in such way that you finish it right when your target happens to be at the same place as yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s say you are orbiting Kerbin at 200km, and the target is at 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour orbital period: 39,88 min. Your target\\\u0027s orbital period: 32,64 min, transfer time: 18,1 min.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18,1/32,64 = 0,554. This means that when you start your first burn, the target should have 55,4% of its full orbital period remaining until it reaches the rendezvous point. You, on the other hand, will be at 50% (as hohmann transfer takes half a period, and the point where the transfer is over IS the rendezvous point). The difference is 5,4% of a full orbital period, or 19,63\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow go use some program to draw a circle with a 19,63\u00C2\u00B0 angle in it for visual aid. Wait for when the target is 19,63\u00C2\u00B0 behind you, start the hohmann transfer. By the time you finish the transfer, the target should be somewhere nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the target is on a higher orbit, you make the same calculations, but the target should be ahead of you, not behind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtip: If your orbit is 5,35 times higher than your target\\\u0027s orbit (or lower if you wanna go from lower to higher), the required orbit difference will be at 90\u00C2\u00B0. Use it if you are bad at measuring angular difference by eye and have loads of spare fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe target is on elliptic orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is a little more fun. Also dont forget that a circular orbit is a special case of an elliptic orbit, so all of the following is applicable for circular orbits as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need to get in an elliptic orbit around the same body on the same plane as your target, in such way, that the location of your periapsis matches the target\\\u0027s periapsis. Now all you really need to do is to make sure that you reach that periapsis at the same time as your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst you need to calculate when the target is going to be there. To find that out, you need to catch the moment it reaches the periapsis or apoapsis, you then check its orbital cycle with KSP calculator, and with these you can easily tell the times the target will be going through periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, once you reach the periapsis, adjust your orbit in such way, that by the time you make a full orbital cycle (or a bunch of them), the target also passes the periapsis. As result, you and your target will pass the periapsis at the same time, and all you will need to do is to quickly adjust your orbit to match the target\\\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KiT","CreatedById":3630,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-05T19:50:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and here are some EXTREMELY UGLY \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E(and not entirely accurate)\u003C/span\u003E pictures for those who just cant stomach the walls of text. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/845/kspmeetup.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img845.imageshack.us/img845/8458/kspmeetup.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kspmeetup.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klopchuck","CreatedById":13421,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-05T20:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat post - putting it to work right now rescuing some stranded kerbonauts.

Correct as you get closer. No math, and just a few more burns than necessary. I like it because you have to burn away from your target to get closer. Squeeeee orbital mechanics!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
