I had played that save for a long time b/fore it was corrupted, and one of the things I did was move an asteroid from the Mun\u0027s orbit, and used a giant 3-layer structural plate satellite that took 8 pieces to put together. I eventually pushed the asteroid enough of out orbit to where it was safe to add more things on the ship. I detached the giant sattelite from the ship, and came back with another ship that had a ton more engines. I moved that asteroid w/ the 3 layer satellite thing from the Mun all the way to Jool. The satellite structure held up nicely, though it did break in a few places, and I\u0027m sure if we pushed that asteroid any further in Jool\u0027s gravity pull, it would rip off my ship.
