For 320 you could skip the separator and just burn it off. Would the drag savings be worth it or even noticeable?\n\nHow much of a difference would it make for the flight profile? I can\u0027t imagine it making too much of a difference, but if significantly reduces the thrust needed for breaking the sound barrier that would be worthwhile."},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T23:36:13Z","Content":"Unless you have rockets pointing the wrong way, capping the nozzles shouldn\u0027t do much, and if anything will be detrimental as you\u0027ll be carrying pointless weight."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T00:49:01Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know that the aero modelling cares about vortex drag like that.\n\nIf you wanted to know for sure, make some simple test vehicles to compare with and without. Grab a fuel tank with nosecones front and back and some radial-mount engines, set it at full thrust, point it straight up and launch. See how far it gets. Take the rear nosecone off, add something of the same weight into the stack that isn\u0027t going to alter the aerodynamics, do the same flight profile, and see what difference it makes."},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:29:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E SSTO...stage away\n\nI had to point out that once you drop parts during ascent it\u0027s no longer SSTO.\n\nHowever this could be easily tested with MechJeb and a dV calculator I imagine."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T02:06:27Z","Content":"I made a quick little test rig like the one Mic\\_n described ([craft](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/ksp/1.0/Tailcone%20Tester.craft)), two test rockets identical except for one having a tail cone and decoupler (focus stays on the tailconed variant in the pics):\n\n![screenshot70.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot70.png)\n\nInitially, the heavier tailconed design falls behind due to lower TWR and drag being a small factor at low speed:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot72.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot72.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot75.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot75.png)\n\nApproaching the transonic range the tailconed rocket catches and passes the lighter rocket due to reduced drag:\n\n\u003E ![screenshot76.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot76.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot77.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot77.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot80.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot80.png)\n\nOnce the atmosphere thins enough that drag becomes less significant, the lighter rocket overtakes again due to superior TWR (it would have been wise to decouple the tailcone before then to negate the TWR penalty and keep the altitude and speed advantage):\n\n\u003E ![screenshot82.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot82.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot84%20%282%29.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot84%20%282%29.png)\n\nIt looks like tailcones do reduce drag significantly, enough to overcome the mass penalty at supersonic speeds until out of the thick atmosphere, but they should be jettisoned once the atmosphere thins (or the rocket engine is needed). Not sure if the extra cost of the tailcone and decoupler is saved in fuel savings or extra payload, that will vary by design, I think, but it would seem to be a useful technique for planes that stay in the atmosphere at high supersonic speeds.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T02:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:24:53Z","Content":"Nicely done.
