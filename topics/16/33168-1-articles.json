It might screw up your staging after you undock, but when you take control of the new craft, it will be sitting with the bottom (or only) stage not-yet-activated, with the stage light flashing green (rather than solid green). It\u0027s basically the same as when you\u0027re on the launchpad before launching. This gives you a chance to re-order the staging before activating anything(It works just like in the VAB), and it will activate the bottom stage first (just like at launch).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ASnogarD","CreatedById":70903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T09:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried manually undocking ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight Clicking on the docking port to undock (after EVA transferring crew).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont think the staging was intended for performing all the needed manoeuvres in space and some manual intervention is needed at some stages, I would also think of using action groups to facilitate undocking to separate the dock/undock procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T11:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you or do you not have MechJeb installed?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink this is the reason, the old mechjeb only used the accent autopilot from liftoff until orbit but the new version keep settings like overheat and auto stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esolution is to turn off autostage all time you don\u0027t need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OUScooby","CreatedById":66208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T17:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes MechJeb is installed and on the ships, but not activated at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is everyone talking about when they say undock manually?
