Flew first saved game mission and first thing I noticed was the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E plume affect. I just don\u0027t like it at all. Plumes shooting out twice distance of the ship essentially whiting out everything around it. Just looks plain weird to me. I sure hope there is fix or workaround for this to get it back to the way it was. This is a deal breaker for me personally as I just can\u0027t get used to it. Kind of destroys the cool effect of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters the way they were before. Edit: Found this was happening on FASA parts, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and Engines. FASA is one of my favorite mods, I hope they update it to 1.4.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-09T10:23:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2018 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MikeO89\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
