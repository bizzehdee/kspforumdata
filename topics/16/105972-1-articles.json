If you pop open the resources box when flying this way, you\u0027ll notice that you don\u0027t have any \u0022ablator\u0022 resource on your ship. \n\nHowever, the mk1 is pretty light, has a reasonably large heat capacity, and a fairly high (2400 deg) heat tolerance, so it tolerates a decent amount of abuse. Here\u0027s a reentry like you describe with a mk1 and normal difficulty:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The 1.25m Service Bay will protect Science well and the extra weight is within the limits of a single chute, whether for landing or splashdown. Until you get batteries, you have to be extremely careful, because you burn electric charge to maintain attitude The Service Bay expects items to be mounted on top of the heatshield and the bottom of the capsules\n\nThe latest Kerbal Engineer Redux is working.
