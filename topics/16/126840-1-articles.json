However, it does not need a control surface, it can just be a plain wing section, and\u00A0you can do all your pitch control from the canards if you wish. \u00A0The main thing is however, that it will maintain lift after the angled wing has stalled and help to push the nose down. \u00A0 Downside - this surface represents dead\u00A0\u00A0weight when flying exactly on the prograde.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother problem with solution 2) \u00A0is that pitch control surfaces are a major source of drag already, this will make the situation worse. \u00A0 My designs already have minimal fuselage drag, open nodes, radially attached junk, low intake drag (pre-coolers), and very low lift induced drag, due to having plenty of wing area , mostly flying under 5 degrees angle of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pitch control surfaces however, have to work much harder , often pitched at 10 degrees or so just holding the nose up in level flight. \u00A0 \u00A0Space planes typically have a very large fuel fraction, and it\u0027s often dissimilar types of fuel being burned at different phases of the flight (jet fuel, then rocket fuel), furthermore there is a payload fraction, that is going to be offloaded in orbit. \u00A0 \u00A0As a result centre of gravity shifts around a lot, and i often find myself playing it safe and keeping CoL well aft. \u00A0 This means a lof of canard lift is required to hold the nose up. \u00A0 \u00A0 Fitting oversized canards will reduce the induced drag from these surfaces running at high angle of attack , but makes it easy to overcontrol. \u00A0A space plane is not supposed to be aerobatic, it is supposed to be stable and cruise to orbit. \u00A0 \u00A0The best stock solution seems to be to use the Advanced canard, which only moves 10 degrees compared with 30 on most surfaces. \u00A0However it is tiny, so you need to mount lots of them, probably clipped inside one another, which isn\u0027t the most aesthetic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T04:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027ll be the only one who goes against the grain, but I actually recommend putting your landing gear as far back to your aircraft as possible and as far forwards. \u00A0This makes striking your tail and destroying your engine impossible while taking off and will make landing your aircraft far easier, since your\u0027ll have a far easier time having the landing gear touch the ground and begin braking. \u00A0Also, it makes the aircraft very stable both on the runway and on rough terrain, ensuring the aircraft\u0027s parts wont strike the terrain.\u00A0 There are cons to putting the landing gear in the back though, the speed necessary to take-off will be dramatically increased, and if your aircraft doesn\u0027t have a lot if pitch authority, it might not even be able to take off, put that is the price of safety. \u00A0It\u0027s also recommended that you use two landing gear in the front, as opposed to just one as you see in most real aircraft, for some reason, just having one in the front causing instability and allows wobbling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c9QJGNk6.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/c9QJGNk6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-23T04:28:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2015 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T12:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222324725\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126840\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450254773\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141736\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Old Foxboy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 16-12-2015 at 9:32 AM, Old Foxboy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL, never flew a real taildragger, did you?
