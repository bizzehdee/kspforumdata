This might seem a silly stupid question to some but how did you learn and at what stages and how to remember what goes where?. I have watched many youtube video etc but still can not seem to get pass the 1st tutorial bit with out exploding my ship. I can do a basic ship that is it then I fail. Command Module, Parachute, Decoupler under the command module and add fule or just that rocket like in the tutorial. Other then that when I try and do anything else it don\u0027t seem to work. I no its me and not the programme so how did you all learn and never mind making bases and rovers. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epic DaVinci","CreatedById":58581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T08:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust by experimenting, that\u0027s the beauty of the game its open to whatever you want to do.
