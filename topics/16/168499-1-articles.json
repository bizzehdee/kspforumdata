Got those things running pretty nice. My rocket is moving much more smoothly, higher speeds, lower, faster orbits. I\u0027ve circularized orbits within a couple hundred kilometers, got my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 working pretty well. I even matched my orbit somewhat to Eve\u0027s orbit and at no point did Eve\u0027s orbit cross my orbit. I had to tip my orbit pretty radically to be able to touch Eve\u0027s. Then I tried to get it even closer but I\u0027m working from such a tiny circle compared with the distance and I\u0027m just lining things up by eye with the sun in my eyes. This is from Kerbin orbit. Is it possible to go from Kerbin orbit to Eve orbit? Or is it required to hit all the objects in between? The orbital lines don\u0027t reach. I always get stuck orbiting the sun if I can\u0027t get an orbit with a node, but it seems like it should\u00A0 be possible with enough fuel to go from sun orbit to orbit another planet or at least make a tighter sun orbit. I\u0027ve got quite a bit of Xenon fuel and 26 gigantor solar units for my 26 xenon engines. They can run for a very long time without running out of electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did manage to get a descending or ascending node with Eve.

I might even have to take things apart and put them back together again in space but that sounds like quite a formidable but attractive\u00A0task.

Lately I\u0027ve enjoyed Maneuver Node Evolved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick is, get your ejection maneuver node to just tell you you got an encounter, or barring that just get the encounter markers for your ship and the planet to be as close as you can. Then do that burn, warp out of the Kerbin system, and in Sun orbit set up another maneuver and tweak it until you get a periapsis really close to the planet. For Eve, I\u0027d go 150km, maybe 200. For Duna, I\u0027d do 100km. Then do that burn, and warp to the planet. Then at periapsis, burn retrograde until you\u0027re in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-12T21:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223242761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168499\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513114233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268474\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chik Sneadlov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Chik Sneadlov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might have problems lifting off from bigger bodies like Eve\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is nearly impossible to take off from.\u00A0 I\u0027ve only seen very advanced players manage it.\u00A0 If you plan on landing on Eve (which can be tricky as well), anticipate Eve to be your landing craft\u0027s new home.\u00A0 Do a google image search for \u0022Eve Lander\u0022 and you can see how ridiculous they can be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73725-5thhorseman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002273725\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/73725-5thhorseman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@5thHorseman\u003C/a\u003E said, go for Duna.\u00A0 Easy to land on and take off from while still having an atmosphere to deal with.\u00A0 Just bring lots of parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T10:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223242761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168499\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513114233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268474\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chik Sneadlov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Chik Sneadlov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I even matched my orbit somewhat to Eve\u0027s orbit and at no point did Eve\u0027s orbit cross my orbit.

As far as solar, I thought I\u0027d be able to make some kind of folding structure that I could mount lots of gigantors to, but I haven\u0027t seen how I can do that. Things that fold in Kerbal don\u0027t allow other things to be attached.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Duna I didn\u0027t like all the mystery objects in the way. I thought their gravity might affect my flight and I couldn\u0027t make an orbital loop with Duna any more than I can with Eve or Eeloo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was setting a course when I got an encounter. Didn\u0027t realize it was with Jool, but it only took a tiny burn so now I\u0027m heading for Jool and you\u0027re right. Solar power is poor out here. I thought it might be a quarter the strength it is near Kerbin but seems like its more like 1% of the power near Kerbin. Its taking forever to recharge the batteries so I think I\u0027m going to escape Jool\u0027s\u00A0 gravity and get stuck around the sun again. I\u0027m really starting to dislike Xenon and these engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust went back to the spacecenter and worked on the current rocket. Set my SRBs to 87.5. Put on some huge fins, the plane tail fins actually and the flight seemed smoother. There was still some wandering towards the end so maybe take off another 10% power. This time I\u0027m heading for Dres. Still have the Xenon. Added 9 more tanks asparagus. Kind of pointless because I think that\u0027s enough to take me to another galaxy and I\u0027m not going to be leaving Dres with these engines, but that\u0027s what I\u0027m doing now. Every now and then my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t seem to work at all. I don\u0027t know if it was that I hadn\u0027t brought up the navigation ball or what, but it happens when I need to do things fast.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-14T06:42:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2017 06:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Chik Sneadlov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecurrent flight\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T06:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223243956\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168499\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513228766\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002268474\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chik Sneadlov\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Chik Sneadlov said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m really starting to dislike Xenon and these engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are by far not the only one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chik Sneadlov","CreatedById":68474,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T06:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I build a huge frame and put 200 of those electric engines on there with 200 solar panels and some xenon, will I be able to rise into orbit around Kerbin?

I got a nice view of it as I hurtled past. Not enough fuel to slow down and be captured by it\u0027s gravity. I decided to try a planet with atmosphere to slow me down, so I went to Duna since I did have an inflatable heat shield. I\u0027ve charted some nice close passes to Duna but matching the actual trajectory to the chart is harder. I came within sight of Duna I think, but I had problems with asparagus staging and normal staging and fuel flow. I gave the tanks number for fuel flow, but they weren\u0027t in fives or tens. I separated them by 1 and the computer ignored the numbers and burned them all. Then it wouldn\u0027t let them go or start the last engine so I had to do it all manually and by then I was not going to get my encounter. The nodes are giving me problems. Just when I need it most they don\u0027t tell my how long the burn is going to be. Whenever I\u0027m a galaxy away it always tells me to the second how long to burn, but when it counts and I\u0027ve spent two hours getting this close it refuses to calculate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should have tried Dres with fewer SRBs. Too\u00A0 much speed and no way to slow except burn tons of fuel which I didn\u0027t have. I love the way Kerbal doesn\u0027t have some idiotic magic device that slows a ship like a car pulling up to a stop sign or even a huge tanker full of oil trying to dock, although that\u0027s pretty close to what its like. I\u0027d like to put way too much delta V on a huge oil tanker and send it in to port.

On my feet! Didn\u0027t use the heat shield. I slowed with the atmosphere and then with rockets. I added another stage in the middle with the huge tanks of liquid fuel and a big engine since my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E was very high. It slowed my ascent through the atmosphere of Kerbal which was nice. Smoother, lower orbit. Then I had a lot of fuel to get to Duna. I still had fuel in the second stage when I landed. Its too bad they don\u0027t let you move the nav ball when you\u0027re trying to land. I crashed a few times. The chute opened fine even with the heat shield above it, which seems wrong, but you have to slow yourself with the rockets. The chute alone isn\u0027t enough on Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst thing is that the capsule is blocked by either a light or part of another parachute so I\u0027m trapped in the capsule. I would buy detachable, ejectable lights,\u00A0everything ejectable. The inflatable heat shield might be used to right a fallen rocket if it can be stuck to another inflatable heat shield. At least it could get the engines pointing at the ground at an angle so you can retry a landing.\u00A0 I landed one time and closed all but one landing leg. The module was up on a hill with this one leg sticking up and I thought if these were real astronauts they\u0027d find a stick and attach it to that one leg and then hang on to the end and try to leverage that ship back up onto it\u0027s feet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe approach was interesting with Ike being right there. I thought I was going to hit it but the planets are all smaller than they look in the map. Still Ike looked to be about as big as Duna and its gravity affected me.

A drill, a small cutting tool, some Gorilla Glue and small explosive charges that should have been attached to the lights and parachute. I might be able to cut my way out of here, detach the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system and arrange them to all blow in one direction.
