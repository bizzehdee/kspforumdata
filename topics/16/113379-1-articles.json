I personally prefer the KER UI, which includes fully transparent, togglable HUDs.\n\nKER has the capability to display certain calculated fields, like time to suicide burn, suicide burn altitude, etc.; I don\u0027t know if MJ has equivalent displays.\n\nMJ has a built-in interplanetary transfer planner (wth pork-chop plot) that KER certainly does not have.\n\nMJ is integrated into the tech tree in career mode, with more advanced functions requiring higher nodes to be unlocked. These modules must be added to your ships in order to use their functionality.\n\nKER has no tech tree integration, but requires either an engineer Kerbal, a small part, or the tier-3 tracking center to function in career. It is fully partless in sandbox.\n\nAs a result, KER can provide information for EVA Kerbals, which I don\u0027t think MJ can.\n\nKER doesn\u0027t consume any resources, such as EC, while my understanding is that (at least some) MJ modules do.\n\nMJ\u0027s autopilot functions include Smart A.S.S, which is a (much better, I believe) version of stock SAS, with more options and better algorithms; interplanetary transfer assistance, automatic precision landing, and automatic rendezvous and docking.\n\nI personally prefer KER, because I think its UI is cleaner, and because I don\u0027t need the autopilot functions (I prefer to fly myself, and I don\u0027t often start projects that require the same thing to be done over and over again). Also because I discovered it before I knew about MJ and it\u0027s what I\u0027m used to.\n\nThere is a good argument for MJ as a teaching tool (watch MJ do something and then try to duplicate it), and if you\u0027re trying to build a massive station that requires 10 or 20 launches, I can imagine it would be invaluable."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T02:02:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I guess I should be asking, what are the pros and cons. Sounds like people don\u0027t use both at the same time?\n\nBoth KER and MJ do the same things in terms of showing you dV and TWR at different planets while you\u0027re buiding your ship. These days, MJ is pretty much identical to KER, and I get the impression they use a lot of the same code there.\n\nBut MJ has a lot of features KER lacks. These features allow you to learn how to do things for yourself, or allow you to automate many repetitive (how many tiomes have you already circularized an orbit?) or very boring (10-minute burns, for example) tasks while you go get another beer. And many other things besides.\n\nSome folks say MJ is a \u0022cheat\u0022, but it\u0027s just realistic. Except in dire emergencies, real rockets don\u0027t fly on manual control, and the days of having a room full of guys with slide rules doing the calculations are ancient history.

It lacks the EVA infos, as stated above.\n\nMJ, on the other hand, was my first teacher and he is now my petty officer. \n\nThere are things that are more boring than others that he can handle perfectly. (Yarr you cursed pegleg freebooter get my ship circularized now! And get me some good grog.)\n\nJust do not trust him too much: he is just a D grade pilot (sometimes I suspect he is driving under the influence too), he does not know how to handle several kind of designs without a proper setup and there are maneuvers his famed fancy autopilot will never be able to do. \n\nAnd be careful for what you ask him, he is pretty dumb and he does not know anything about Kerbol system apart from its math.
