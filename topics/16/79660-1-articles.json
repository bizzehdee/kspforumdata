The mass for these was 0.6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree medium landing legs would semi break on impact under about 16m/s. They would be FULLY recoverable for all funds but no longer compress or extend. Their mass was 0.05 so 0.15 in total.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a whole bunch of wings made it possible to sometimes land the craft on the runway for a full 100% recovery. 2 delta wings, 2 small control surfaces, 4 AV-R8 wingless and 2 swept wings were used for a mass of 0.34. 3 Landing gear were used but they are mass-less in flight. The craft was quite hard to fly and not all tests were landed safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalving the fuel in the Sepratrons allowed me to reduce their mass to 0.0425 per sep. This amount of fuel meant it was difficult to time their firing correctly to not cut out before landing. At any speeds above 14 m/s it was very difficult to time the firings right even with full fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best 100% recoverable lander used one large parachute or two radials with 3 medium landing legs. This was 0.45 tons total landing gear for 13.12 tons of lander, meaning landing gear was 3.4% of the mass of the lander. Somewhere between 22 and 43 tons this setup no longer guarantied a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lightest lander was using wings but the craft was not very easy to control of land. It did however let me land on the runway (sometimes) for a full refund.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith an automatic Sepratron firing mechanism and 50-25% fuel in each it might be possible to build a lander with a reduced mass than this. Due to human error I couldn\u0027t get this to be mass effective in any test even when repeated multiple times. The Sepratron uses 2.44 fuel a second. If an automated device could be designed to fire at one second from the ground then each Sepratron could be reduced to 2.4 fuel from 8 and its mass reduced to 0.0305. At this mass 4 could be used for less mass than a radial parachute (0.0305 x 4 = 0.122). Correct use of low number of parachutes with a heavy lander and Sepratons for the last second before landing could result in a low mass but is very difficult in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T08:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork_werewolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kragon","CreatedById":113597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T09:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1:I\u0027m not using landing legs there generally just excess weight and they aren\u0027t that much stronger than an engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2:I\u0027ve normally got a whole family of them so normally anything from 5 tons to 30 tons when empty (the ones worth recovering at least)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: usually 2 radials or a mk16 just enough to give it a constant decent speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4:I can normally land and lose about 1-2% of the value and wings generally look correct and fly like a brick, or look silly and fly well.
