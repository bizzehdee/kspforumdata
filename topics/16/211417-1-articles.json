Launch from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E into ~0\u00B0 orbit, and do a transfer to Minmus, timing things so that I meet up with it at an ascending or descending node. I know that Minmus has to be near the \u0022top\u0022 or \u0022bottom\u0022 of its orbit for this to work, and can fiddle around equations to work out ~how many degrees away from the nodes it has to be, but would like a way to get launch times in UT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Launching into a 6\u00B0 orbit. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E crosses the nodes of Minmus\u0027 orbit twice each day, so I can launch on a 96\u00B0 or 84\u00B0 (ish) heading but I\u0027d like a way that\u0027s not eyeballing things in map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Launching east from Dessert. Dessert launch site is ~6.5\u00B0 south, so once a day, a launch just before crossing the ascending node should be very close to Minmus\u0027 plane. But this has the same timing problem as 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... how? Can MechJeb or Kerbal Alarm Clock give me these times?
