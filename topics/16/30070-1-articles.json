But now I found something to which I can\u0027t find or figure out an answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have scanned through the first 20 pages in the General section and the How To... section\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was sending a Mun base that needed refueling up in a 3000km orbit around Kerbin. At the time the unit came in orbit it had a total weight of 90t, with the Mk2 lander-can as command pod and 3 SAS units spread acros the height of the craft (1 at the top of the lander, one at the bottom of the lander (so in this case it\u0027s in the middle) and one at the bottom of the transit rocket). This unit doesn\u0027t use any RCS to \u0022steer\u0022 it prograde/retrograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then I send my refuel unit up after it. This is just a unmanned fueltank with some RCS and uses the same base rocket as the MunBase. It is just a bunch of small fuel tanks (2160 liquid cap.) with a small engine for emergency\u0027s, RCS for docking, 4 SAS units (two at the bottom and two at the top), 1 ASAS unit and the Probodobodyne OKTO command pod. And this unit doesn\u0027t move at all with RCS turned off. And this unit only has a weight of around 35t when docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now the funny part starts. The only difference that I could think of is that one is manned and the other is unmanned, the manned and unmanned command pod have the same torque value, the refueler should have more torque (if more SAS units mean more torque) and the refueler is a lot lighter. So I put a manned command pod on the refuel unit. And all of a sudden it can also turn without RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m trying to figure out how SAS works and how it affects the craft. I cannot find satisfactory answers on the internet or here on the forum. I did learn how gyroscopes can be used to orient stuff in space. And how tilting them creates torque that turns stuff when in space. But the way I read it that is what the ASAS unit does, but the fact that the SAS unit has a torque value suggests that the SAS unit does that, even though they say that SAS is used to stop spinning and nothing more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be forever gratefull if anybody could explain how to use SAS/ASAS and why the torque factor seems to be working very well with a clumsy 90t object and doesn\u0027t work at all on a more streamlined 35t object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe units have a Mechjeb 2.0.7 unit and a Romfarer Lazor unit. When testing the manoeuvrability of the craft I used both mods (only 1 at a time of course) and also hand steering and the original ASAS lock position button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OUScooby","CreatedById":66208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T23:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve notice this too. My unmanned space craft seem to react completely differently to my manned one. Even with the RCS on they are so slow to rotate around in orbit and so slow to react when trying to stop it moving. I often overshoot my target and waste RCS fuel trying to slow it and get it back pointed at the target. It\u0027s frustrating because I\u0027m trying to construct a large ship in orbit by sending up its pieces as unmanned probes, but docking them is so difficult because they are so slow to react when trying to maneuver it. If I put a manned capsule on any of these ships suddenly with out changing anything else, I\u0027m able to move it around just fine even without using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T23:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS only stops rotation when it\u0027s active, ASAS locks the craft onto the current heading/bearing as best it can.

When SAS is engaged it\u0027s controller will dampen rotation using P and D and the onboard reaction wheel. Back then in the staging list each SAS will actually show up with a \u0022torque\u0022 bar underneath to show how much force each SAS\u0027s reaction wheel is exerting at any moment, like wise the manned pods also have a torque bar. When you steer you can see all of those torque bars fill to maximum as all the wheels engage. When ASAS is engaged on a ship the ASAS\u0027s PID controller overrides any SAS \u002B command pod PD controller and issues commands to all the reaction wheels to keep the ship\u0027s heading. When it does this you can see the torque bar fluctuate as ASAS issues turning commands this way and that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFast forward to 0.18 and Squad decided to decoupler the SAS reaction wheel control from manual control.

If I were to guess I reckon Squad thinks that SAS and its powerful (relative to real life) reaction wheel makes it too easy to steer automated crafts if you could just slap some on and use it for manual steering. Since in real life most altitude control are done via RCS systems they wanted us to follow suit and mimic that. The comprise is that for the larger manned crafts one would assume there\u0027s enough room to install big reaction wheels (ala ISS) so they didn\u0027t touch command pod\u0027s reaction wheel and still allow players to steer using those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind almost all spacecraft every flown in real life used RCS system for altitude control.
