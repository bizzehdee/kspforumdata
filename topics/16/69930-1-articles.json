(This will set your burn timer and give you a more accurate dV based on a now slightly less circular orbit) I\u0027m mildly curious how you\u0027re getting 900m/s any way since the lowest I\u0027ve ever seen is a little over 1k.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T12:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any mods installed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blue marker will sometimes jump around a bit.
