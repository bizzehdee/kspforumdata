Some parts transmit fuel to the tanks and some do not. The ones that do say \u0022fuel crossfeed\u0022 on them. Put crossfeed parts between the tanks and engines, or you can use the little fuel conduit thingy to link a tank to an engine, but placing the conduits can be a little tricky sometimes because they don\u0027t always stick right where you want them to. Oh, or you might not be turning the engines on. You have to tap the spacebar once to turn them on at the start of the flight, and then they respond to the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-11T17:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2012 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"air805ronin","CreatedById":40948,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T05:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just discovered the game two nights ago.
