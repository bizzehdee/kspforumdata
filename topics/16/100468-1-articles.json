VERY hard but possible, spaceplanes are difficult at best and heavy-lift spaceplanes with an awkward payload particularly so.\n\nIf you mean using the \u0027stock\u0027 spaceplanes (Squad ships supplied in an install) then, no - they\u0027re just awful."},{"CreatedByName":"RandomName101","CreatedById":138529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:24:31Z","Content":"I meant the former.
