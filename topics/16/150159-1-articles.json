It\u0027s supposed to do a comprehensive survey of both Mun \u0026amp; Minmus. There are two slight problems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nwhenever I switch to the vessel, I have to do a \u0022Control from here\u0022 on any command pod, or I will fly in the wrong direction. It was not always thus, only after the first docking. Please note that it\u0027s not enough to do it once. Every time I do a scene change to this vessel, it will again be oriented backwards. Never had that before.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nalso since the first docking, it will insist on drawing fuel from the lander tanks, and only the lander tanks. That\u0027s the two 400unit thingies close to the engine. If those are dry, the engine is out of fuel. The big tank on top of the lab ought to have a very direct connection all the way to the engine, and the docking ports in between allow crossfeed, yet that doesn\u0027t matter: if the small radial engines are empty or locked, the engine will be fuel deprived.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone happens to know a workaround for either issue, of how I can avoid it on future vessels, I\u0027d be all ears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
