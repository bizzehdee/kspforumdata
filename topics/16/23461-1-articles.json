It\u0027s easy to do once you get used to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you want the ship in the higher orbit to be a bit ahead of the ship in the lower orbit when you start your transfer burn.

First make sure your station is in a circular orbit, make the apoapsis and periapsis as close as possible to equal, it makes it much easier later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith your new ship, get up into a stable orbit first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick on the station and set as target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing is to adjust your inclination. Find the ascending or descending node and use the maneuver tool to set up a burn that will set your inclination to 0 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext do a burn that puts your periapsis to the same altitude as the station. There are usually two of them. This shows you the location of your orbit that is closest to the target orbit and the position of the target ship as the same colored marker, but upside down. On the intercept node, add a maneuver. Adjust the green handles until the target position matches up with the target node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the maneuver burn and then after one more entire orbit, you and the target will be very close(I\u0027ve gotten within 100 meters on a first pass) It depends on how accurate you are with your manuever. More accuracy with them equals less fuel and time wasted closing the gap once you are ready to chase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, if the navball doesn\u0027t say \u0022Target\u0022, know you can click where it says \u0022Orbit: 2145m/s\u0022 and it will change to Target and show a relative velocity. Now your prograde and retrograde icons in the nav ball will be used. Keep an eye on your distance to the target. If the number is increasing, burn retrograde until your relative velocity is zero, then burn towards the target. You will probably get close then fly past it. So be ready with your rocket pointed at retrograde and burn until your velocity is zero again. You can repeat this until you are within a few hundred meters and use RCS thrusters to close the last bit of distance safer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T06:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince smaller orbits are faster than larger ones, you want to be on a lower orbit if the target is in front of you, and a higher one if it\u0027s behind you. Make sure you don\u0027t go too low; I have managed to deorbit a space tug by mistake because I was watching the rendezvous markers, not my periapsis....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcbmaestro","CreatedById":59577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T06:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EManeuver node helps a lot yeah, it alone is able to easily get you to within 1-2km of any target, from there you can go in visually.
