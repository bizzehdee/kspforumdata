It doesn\u0027t.\n\nBasically, this thing climbs incredibly fast, until the moment it reaches 15,000. At that point, whatever is at the front (in my latest flight, it were the canard wings. Before that the ram air intakes, and without either, the cockpit) heats really fast - it goes from some 300\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C to over 1,000 in seconds and it blows.\n\nAlso, how is the flaps thing supposed to work?\n\nAnd why is it that the outer control surfaces seem to counteract the inner ones? If I set all three pairs to control pitch, the inner ones bend upwards when I press \u0022S\u0022 to take off while the other two bend downwards, and the planes ends up rolling to one side. If I deactivate pitch control to outer control surfaces, the inner ones and the canards put the aircraft into the air.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/qdIjw)\n\nReally its all about the profile. You want to eject at around a 30 degree angle going like 1200-1400m/s before u switch from rapiers to ions/nukes/whatever space engines you want to use (heck even a krakendrive would prolly cut it). Actually, IM SO TESTING DAT! If krakendrives still work ive got my solution to long range flight, rapier\u002Bion\u002Bkdrive\u002BIRSU, pretty much go anywhere, refuel, land anywhere, refuel, take off, and get anywhere using kdrive.\n\nAnyways, krakendrives aside, the trick to SSTO anything is the ascent, you want to be just on the edge of burning up on ascent, but you dont actually want to do the burn up part. Without any ions and with rocket fuel drained, i can get this thing to a 150km AP on pure rapier with the right ascent."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:03:53Z","Content":"I made [a little plane](https://flic.kr/p/rpDv28)to test the jets out.

But that doesn\u0027t seem right.\n\nFlaps are to get a little bit of lift for take off and landing. They lower the minimum safe speed a plane can fly at the cost of more drag, which is good for landing, not as good for takeoff. Unfortunately Squad decided to implement the most basic of flaps systems that can almost not even be called that. Most flaps have 4 settings that deploy them at varying degrees for take off, climb, level flight, and landing... we get 2, unless you use FAR. \n\nThey probably aren\u0027t suitable for a delta wing plane like yours there where you are using elevons instead of ailerons and elevators. Never the less, to set them up add the control surfaces near the center of mass. Right click one of them and set the State to deployed. Then go to an action group and assign the toggle option to it. Invert as needed so they go down.\n\n That\u0027s it. Turn them on to stay in the air at slower speeds (for landing on that ridiculously bumpy runway) or to pick up off the runway a little quicker. If done correctly they can help your plane lift even when the wheels are significantly behind the center of mass, avoiding the awful tail strike.\n\nAs far as control being backward. Pick up the control surface and re-place it. That can happen if you move the wing sometimes in symmetry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T06:31:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:28:46Z","Content":"Actually, if you could upload a .craft file so I can look at those flight control problems, I would appreciate it.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T12:05:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, if you could upload a .craft file so I can look at those flight control problems, I would appreciate it.\n\u003E Cheers,\n\u003E \n\u003E ~Claw\n\nHere it goes\n\n[http://www./download/62v4m2l3abuqkq8/Prueba_Avion_1.craft](http://www./download/62v4m2l3abuqkq8/Prueba_Avion_1.craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:16:53Z","Content":"Sorry but this is great, I played around in the stock new aero system for an hour lastnight and built a functional SSTO first go.

Your main gear, or your rear most gear should be no further back than your CoL, this is called the point of rotation for an aircraft. The swerving issue is because your front gear are set at a steep angle for caster. In other words they are tilted forwards. You may want to put a larger gear on the front and use the offset tool to shift it up into the body so it be inline or just below your main gear. Ideally you would like your plane to be level when sitting on the ground or with the nose slightly pointed up."},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:28:31Z","Content":"What Cinocal and Hodo said.
