Jet fuel tanks are numbered and rocket fuel tanks are lettered. Fuel lines go 1-2, 4-2, 5-2, 3-B, 3-C, B-A, and C-D.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore takeoff I shut off flow from tank 1 (as a reserve and counterweight against CoM shift); the intended flow is that tanks 4\u0026amp;5 get drained first, then tank 2, and then a bit of tank 3 before orbit insertion. The aerospikes should drain tanks B\u0026amp;C first, then A\u0026amp;D. After re-entry (on dry rocket tanks, preferably) it should run on tank 3 until nearly dry, then I can open up tank 1 if necessary to bring the bird home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that tanks 4\u0026amp;5 end up feeding the centre turbojet alright, but the port and starboard turbojets feed off of tanks B and C respectively unless I shut off fuel feed to B and C. If I do shut off B \u0026amp; C fuel flow runs as intended during jet flight... but that leaves me with only half my rocket fuel available during orbital insertion unless I risk asymmetric fuel loading in-flight and switch the tank flow on during the burn. (Not to mention that the aerospikes first drain from tank 3... but I can solve that problem by switching 3 off during rocket-powered ascent.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to fix this and get the fuel to flow as planned?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eedited to add:\u003C/em\u003E The solution turns out to be putting in-line separators on both ends of tanks B and C, then re-running the fuel lines 3-B and 3-C so they directly feed the turbojets. Adds a bit of weight, but not enough to hamper the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-20T02:53:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2013 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Anton P.
