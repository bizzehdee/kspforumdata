If the part isn\u0027t causing problems, it\u0027s best to leave it in place. If it is causing problems and is surface mounted, you can insert a small part in its place (like a strut.) Here, unfortunately, it looks like you have several parts that you want to get rid of (a symmetry 4 group.)

At present there\u0027s only Mechjeb, the Muon Detector, Mapsat and then HydroJeb on a few station parts, which as mentioned is the one love to take off to reduce the choking hazard. Using small probes to bash them off is impossible as they\u0027re the docking parts in Hydrojeb (I was testing it before I worked out how to use Mechjeb\u0027s Smart ASS), and thus near the ports and hidden deep inside the craft\u0027s joints now.
