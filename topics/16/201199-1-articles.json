Picking it up with a grabber might be the most challenging part of the mission. Minmus is forgiving due to very low gravity, but still make sure to include enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or reaction wheels to help with targeting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume you are playing with default heat settings and no mods that make reentry more dangerous. Even so, the random mystery part you pick up might have low heat tolerance, so I suggest saving your game before committing to reentry. If the part burns up, reload, keep the part in Kerbin orbit, and send a cargo bay with internal grabber to get the part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T02:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeat problems: \u00A0Most parts can survive a careful re-entry from Minmus. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you end up with a part that has trouble surviving re-entry, just bring more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E (fuel). \u00A0If you keep the speed low enough, the heat is less severe. \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoing a deep-dive into the atmosphere from Minmus will generate a lot of heat, your velocity will be roughly 3,000m/s. \u00A0 The slower you can enter the atmosphere, the better- heat will be reduced. \u00A0Some parts are more tolerant than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T14:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at those numbers, I\u2019d guess that your target is probably a Making History KV-1 pod meaning you can throw it into the atmosphere without worrying \u003Ci\u003Etoo\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Emuch about it overheating.
