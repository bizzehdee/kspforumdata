I tested probably 50 designs on Kerbin for anti-roll, etc. The best resolution is controlling which wheels are powered, steering etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is of course the gravity being so low that the rover wants to slide to the side or just lose it\u0027s heading often. I have figured out using ASAS and locking my heading helps, but I have to toggle it on and off every time I change either horizontal or vertical heading, hills etc. It seems that using physical time warp helps, since I assume it\u0027s spacing out inputs over time so they are less twitchy. It still seems to have some other effect and gravity works better, which makes no sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have other tips for Mun roving and helping the vehicle stay planted better and not slide, flip, or other catastrophic and kerbin eliminating events?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had already placed a 3T rover and it was similar but worse. I redesigned and did all that testing and it still only helps so much. This vehicle is 7T, stock, no clipping or anything strange.

Switching to Docking Mode controls or remapping your rover controls to the translation keys (IJKL) might help here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sorcie","CreatedById":61164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T21:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah it has a probe body on it for non command pod control and I forgot to control it from there, that might help some for sure. The center of gravity was of course a concern, but it handles great, when not practically floating away, which really seems to be my issue. Perhaps I need an even heavier rover with a super low center of gravity hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, I\u0027ll try the docking mode as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MickG","CreatedById":62651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used the new wheels on my modular Munbase and it kept flipping over even going just 2m/s. I put the other wheels on it and it was much better. My guess is the new wheels don\u0027t do well with low gravity. They worked just fine when I tested the design on Kerbin.

Otherwise I\u0027d wonder what the fuel tanks are for. My first rover was pretty fun, hit 90 m/s before it hit the edge of the crater and when rocketing off into a barrel roll. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few tips I\u0027d give you is control your center of gravity, keep it low to the ground, you can drop your center of gravity by adding I-beams to the lower parts of your rover. Second, my most successful rover so far, Wade 02, is very wide, the more area your rover covers the less chance of a flip. Compare an H1, a vehicle that needs explosives to flip it over, to an H3 something I\u0027ve seen do a barrel roll when rear-ended by a midsized sedan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry recreating just the rover portion of your craft and use KSP\u0027s tools to see where your center of gravity is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atanar","CreatedById":59913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T23:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWidening your weelbase and track helps always.

In fact the rover in the Pic is fairly brilliant. My visual assessment, from the thrusters fuel cells and parachute I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s return flight capable, using the rover base as a launch platform. This is great, but also lends to the problem your having, the vehicle is award and is slow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESad reality, weight efficient rovers are slow and delicate, typically created from tissue paper and plastic straws.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T08:12:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs others have mentioned. You cannot overestimate the benefit of wide track, wide base and low CoG. Even then the most dangerous situation is one where you bounce off the ground at an angle. That will lead to landing on one wheel at high speed and you can kiss it good bye then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can still steer the rover as if it were a plane/heli, this way you can sometimes recover and land on all wheels. If you feel adventurous you could add 4 orange radial engines (and balance them) so if you get badly airborne, burn for altitude, level the rover, kill horizontal velocity and descend. Like i said, adventurous. But great for skipping around Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my rovers were crap, only two are used regularly and one is a heavy tanker.
