(Obviously I have not unlocked resource transfer yet.)\n\nIs there any way I can prevent this from happening in the VAB?\n\nOnce in flight I know I can disable cross-feed on the docking ports and that does the job, but I have to remember to do that at the start of *every single flight*. I cannot find a corresponding option when right-clicking the docking port in the VAB (unless I just happened to right-click the wrong port, as I now know only one in the pair has this option...)\n\nBy any chance does this have something to do with the \u0022Routing\u0022 facility in the VAB? I tried to play around with that but could make no sense of it.
