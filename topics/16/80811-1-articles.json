I got the thing into orbit around kerbin, stupidly quicksaved, and then as I was prepping for my maneuver to the Mun, I noticed both my Ap and Pe altitudes were dropping quick, Pe got all the way back into the negatives. I was on a crash course. I attempted a trajectory correction, which got my altitudes back up to normal (they were around 120k and 70k) but then as soon as I stopped the burn the altitudes started dropping again. It was past bedtime at this point so I just quit and I haven\u0027t had a chance to mess with it since. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas why I wasn\u0027t able to maintain altitude? I\u0027ve put rockets into Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus orbit many times, and as far as I could tell, I wasn\u0027t doing anything wrong. This vessel was a bit larger than most of my other ships, do I need to get my Ap even higher than 70k for larger vessels? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I spent over 100k on this launch. I only get a few hours of play time per week, I don\u0027t have time to go through contracts to earn back the money to try again. Is there a way to cheat and give me some money for a do-over? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T16:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Space\u0027 start at 70km above Kerbin but to be on the safe side you should have a periapsis \u0026gt;=75km. Even if you were dipping into the atmosphere at ~69km though the atmospheric drag should be so little (thin air) and for such a short time (climbing back to apoapsis) that your orbit shouldn\u0027t degrade very quickly. Size of the vessel shouldn\u0027t matter at all. Are you using any mods?
