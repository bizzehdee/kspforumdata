I also have the cupola, and the medium sized docking port. I\u0027m hoping to send up a really nice station hub that I can use throughout the game, and do it in such a way that advancing tech doesn\u0027t make it obsolete.\n\nIs it just a matter of plenty of attachment options, or are there some things coming up that you just can\u0027t plan for? What do I need to think about in advance?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T19:32:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:18:50Z","Content":"Other than getting the large docking ports at the end of the tech tree, there\u0027s not much that would make the actual hub of the station obsolete. As long as you keep things modular it\u0027ll be easy to upgrade, like switching out a 1x6 solar panel array for a gigantor panel array, switching to larger fuel tanks, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T19:32:15Z","Content":"Good.

Even the big docking ports won\u0027t create a \u0022module\u0022 feeling. You\u0027ll end with a big cylinder in space. I tried many combination in beta 0.9 and ended with the medium docking ports.\n\nBig docking ports can be useful to increase a specific module (adding 2 more crew quarter), but that not quite often.\n\nEDIT : and for flying a space station to Jool, why not assembling it over there. I assembled a 13 part space station (400T total) around Laythe to explore all the moons (several times). I brought back 41000 science points.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T07:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T07:44:28Z","Content":"Stay low on the part count. When you reach 500 parts even with a good computer you will start feeling the lag even more so when you want to meet with your station using a 300 part ssto it will kill your computer. Use the biggest parts you can find. You want a refueling station up there? Use the biggest fuel tank you can get. If you don\u0027t have it you can just get rid of old tanks when you have bigger fuel tanks. Make the utility module separate from the parts that you are never going to change so that when you want to use the bigger models of solar panels or be it reaction wheels or maybe batteries you can just discard the obsolete module and put the new one in."}]}
