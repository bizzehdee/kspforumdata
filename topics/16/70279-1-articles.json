However, camber only produces lift at subsonic speeds; it is entirely dependent on the airflow at the trailing edge of the wing being able to affect the airflow at the leading edge of the wing. Once in supersonic flow the only way changes in lift can be achieved is through increases in the angle of attack of the wing; camber will only increase drag. This would be the result of any roll controls feeling sluggish at high speeds, since they\u0027re less effective at Mach \u0026gt; 1 than at Mach \u0026lt; 1.
