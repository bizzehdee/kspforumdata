Most everything I make go kaboom, I am usually myself to blame (and can figure out why) - but I\u0027m having an issue with heating.\n\nI\u0027ve looked through a number of pages to see if I could find anything matching, but only close ones comes up.\n\nThe thing that\u0027s heating up is my rovers (all of them so far, and only them)... More specifically the ones on Mun and Minimus (I went for actual rovers because it seemed more \u0022right\u0022 in my head).\n\nNow, when I drive them, they get warm - ok I can accept that, makes some sense actually.\n\nWhen standing parked, at night, with or without radiators they don\u0027t cool down (they may even be heating a bit) - which is where my mind starts having issues.\n\nImage linked below is of the Mun one, which have 5 small deployable radiators and a few of the smaller fixed ones as well. Temperature overlay is evenly orange, so it looks like heat is evening out among all parts - but not leaving the vehicle?\n\nThermometer on the rover says around 600, with the base in the background being below 300.\n\nMost things I can find online revolves around batteries and science things inside equipment bays having issues - but I can\u0027t wrap my head around why it only affects the rovers? All my bases and stations so far have everything in equipment bays in the exact same manner as the rover - most of them have the bay even more crammed than the rovers to boot.\n\nIs there any obvious solution that I\u0027m missing? Short of going back to the drawing board for my rover concept? I really liked my light, but wide, girder structure with open seats and stuff ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nFirst career game is rather stock by choice. Only have Kerbal Alarm Clock, NavBallDockingAlignmentIndicator and Mechjeb (too lazy for constant manual dV calculations) installed for ease of play.\n\n[Screenshot](http://henrik-hansen.com/ksp/rover.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T12:48:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HenrikH**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T21:48:10Z","Content":"The heat system has a few issues where some parts start to pick up phantom heat.

So unless it\u0027s big, five is right out.\n\nYeah, it is way overboard - on purpose.\n\nI first found that my radiator-less rovers had things overheating and exploding - so I decided to make a second Mun rover where I purposefully added way too many, simply to make sure it could darn well radiate some heat energy off. Apparently though, radiators seems to radiate not much heat off at all...\n\nI also checked the heat-map, although I didn\u0027t screenshot that. But it\u0027s perfectly even coloured orange - so the heat is perfectly dissipating throughout the vehicle, just not leaving.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there an ISRU/mining drill anywhere on the Mun/within physics distance?\n\nNada, what you see in the screenshot is pretty much what\u0027s there - there is also a tank lying a bit away which had some fuel left (now empty with an engine on it). I land my tank that I used to get there, since I always make fuel plans to account for me mucking up a bit. Later I used that to fill up the lander/return module of the base, so it\u0027s 200 % guaranteed to be able to make the final Evac back.\n\nFirst rover that went boom even did it on a drive on Mun, some 15 km away from *anything* except Mun rock...."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T15:15:23Z","Content":"Have you checked to make sure that your Physics.cfg file is correct?

The Mun base in the background has the following two noticeable temperatures for all parts:\n\ntemp = 287.874472836298\n\ntempExt = 287.962322704184\n\nThey vary, but we\u0027re talking variations in the first decimal of the degree (I\u0027m, guessing they\u0027ve been sensible and done temperatures in Kelvin?).\n\nFor the rover, standing a scant few meters away, they\u0027re instead all around:\n\ntemp = 584.080281974798\n\ntempExt = 576.861176453913\n\nAssmuing that tempExt is the temperature of space around the rover, it is actually likely cooling a bit, but somehow the external temperature has ended up being twice what it should be according to the base itself.\n\nSo, I\u0027m going to skip on trying to adjust the radiator-variable in the physics, and adjust the tempExt down to the correct value for the rovers and see if that solves it.\n\nEDIT: Since I seem to have to wait for mods to approve my post.... Success was short lived. After dropping some 20 degrees, it started going up again... Darnit.\n\nEDIT2: Even reducing the actual temperature along with the external one it starts going up again. It seems to be the external temperature going up though, and driving the actual temperature after it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T16:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HenrikH**"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T16:04:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So unless it\u0027s big, five is right out.\n\nYou made me choke on my sloths and breakfast cereals."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:58:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You made me choke on my sloths and breakfast cereals.\n\nOne... two... five!\n\nThree, sir.\n\nThree!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyrt Malthorn","CreatedById":149101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T21:11:21Z","Content":"This seems to be what I\u0027m experiencing. I was incredibly distraught when, while testing my first rover in career mode (and only my 2nd or 3rd rover design ever) it was showing me heat guages on the launchpad and exploding within seconds. I found from the flight log that a couple cubic octagonal struts in the center frame of the rover were overheating first. Yeah, some metal beams in the middle of my rover away from all the science, batteries, and anything remotely volatile, exploded. Which made no sense.\n\nI re-built the thing one piece at a time, testing each time to make sure it wasn\u0027t causing a repeat issue. It seems to be BETTER now, even though I\u0027ve done nothing different except place those struts and parts near them manually instead of symmetrically.\n\nNow it only blows up at low time warp. 5x or greater is fine, it explodes at 2-4x normal speed. Which sucks because I\u0027d really like to time warp roving around the Mun. So off I go to rebuild it, again. I hope a better solution comes along."}]}
