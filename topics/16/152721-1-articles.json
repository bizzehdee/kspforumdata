Kind of how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for different bodies can be calculated or how spaceplanes should have one rapier per 15 tons (I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s still the proper ratio for that, though), so I can plan ahead while building rovers for specific places\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T06:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe data isn\u0027t exposed in UI, I\u0027m afraid, but if you go to wheels\u0027 .cfg files, you can get the info and calculate from there. The data you need includes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModuleWheelBase-\u0026gt;radius - this is your wheel radius, let\u0027s call it r\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModuleWheelMotor-\u0026gt;torqueCurve, first key, second value - this is your stationary wheel torque, let\u0027s call it T\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nT/r gives the force applied at the contact point of your wheel and ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a hill, gravity has a component m*g*sin(theta) down the hill, where theta is the slope. You need your nT/r \u0026gt; m*g*sin(theta) in order to climb from stationary (obviously, n is the number of wheels running full motor, and g is local gravity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote however, torque isn\u0027t maximized at stationary. So you could climb with some initial speed while couldn\u0027t climb from standing still. I\u0027m using stationary torque above just so that the rover doesn\u0027t need to find a flat place to do initial acceleration to climb. Feel free to use other values if those apply to your design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-29T12:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- increase friction.
