It\u0027s horribly buggy, and has been so since forever.\n\nEven worse: once it triggers a problem, it horks the game in a way that re-loading a save doesn\u0027t help: for example, \u0022oh gosh my ship is accelerating... load a save... go to another ship that doesn\u0027t even have a grabber on it...\u0022 will still be bugged. The only way to un-hork the game is to exit KSP completely and re-start.\n\nThe claw is *so* buggy that I\u0027ve just given up on it completely; I love the idea, but the implementation is so broken that it\u0027s just not worth the misery.
