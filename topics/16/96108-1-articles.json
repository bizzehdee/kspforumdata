I got it to undock once but i can\u0027t seem to get it to do it again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q5GTJt9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q5GTJt9.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wepWOpt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wepWOpt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there something I\u0027m missing or is it just like the bug where the undock button doesnt work, except it\u0027s not showing up at all?\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/q4qvub5vaw3wvdl/uno_lander_master\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/q4qvub5vaw3wvdl/uno_lander_master\u003C/a\u003E is the file to the ship for anyone who\u0027d like to check it out and help me.
