I have tried to get it from the research facility, but it still tells me that I need to purchase it from the research area. I have been running with a lot of mods and add-ons including mechjeb and I was wondering if that was the issue. I tried coping my game files and striping out all the modes and it is still giving me the same error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way that I can just re download the vanilla version, I got mine through steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this question has already been addressed, sorry for the repeat, and just point me into the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
