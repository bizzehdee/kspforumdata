I\u0027ve noted a lot of severe rocking motion and inability to keep things stable. For instance, Cupola, large RCS, Medium grey tank. This guy was going bananas when I had the SAS on. I attributed it to the fuel decreasing and changing the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m interested in ships designed for routine space station construction and maintenance, and am planning on doing lots of docking and undocking.
