I copied the design from Steam workshop (much thanks to QF9E for sharing his creation): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1903428747\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1903428747\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a screenshot of the vessel in my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/OemqXxu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/OemqXxu\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to use asparagus staging employing the fuel flow priority tool, rather than using external fuel ducts. So I want the tanks with the inline stabilizers to drain first, then move to the next pair of tanks in a clockwise fashion, then the next pair of tanks, then to the central core tanks.\u00A0 My understanding is that the higher the number tanks drain first, so I set fuel flow priority with the highest number tanks being the ones with the inline stabilizers, then lower numbers for the next pair of tanks, etc,\u00A0 to the central tanks having the lowest number of all. I think I\u0027ve properly enabled crossfeed through all the decouplers. But when I launch the vessel,\u00A0 all pairs of the external tanks are draining at the same rate, and not draining sequentially as I had planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t determine what the problem is - and for the life of me I can\u0027t figure out how to correct it. I am running multiple mods and have never had any problems with asparagus staging using external ducts, but I\u0027d prefer not to use them on an ascent from the surface of Eve in attempt to generate as little drag as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor mods, I\u0027m using the Clickthrough Blocker, Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack, Chatterer, Distant Object, Docking Port Alignment Indicator, Engine Light, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, For Science, Gravity Turn, Manuever Mode Evolved, Planer Shine, RCSBuildAid, TacFuelBalancer, Transfer Window Planner, Kerbal Alarm Clock, and Kerbal Engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks in advance for any solutions, and my apologies if I\u0027ve erred in posting the issue or the image links.
