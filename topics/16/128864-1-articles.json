you drop from a dead stop at 20 km, you\u0027ll gain about 240 m/s during the fall.\u00A0 However, if you drop from\u00A02 km you\u0027ll gain only about 80 m/s.\u00A0 The lower you make your

the amount of slope you can land on is set by the steepness of the slope a Kerbal can stand on without going toboggining for miles with possibly fatal results.\u00A0 On this and slightly less-steep slopes, the lander itself might be slowly, ever-so slowly, sliding downhill the whole time you\u0027re on the ground, but it only moves a few meters in the time it takes to grab the science and plant a flag so no harm done.\u00A0 But if the Kerbal slides away, that will take up a lot of time, first for the slide and then, if the Kerbal survives, getting back to the lander\u00A0 And when the Kerbal gets back, the lander might have slid to its doom.\u00A0 So it\u0027s best to land where Kerbals can still walk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, the efficient landing trajectories come down in arcs.\u00A0 This means than if you use an efficient landing trajectory, your lander\u0027s slope tolerance only applies to reverse slopes (on the far side of the terrain crest as you come down).\u00A0 Foward slopes (on the near side of the crest) mean that there\u0027s a hill sticking up between you and your intended\u00A0landing spot, which means you\u0027ll encounter the ground at a

on forward slopes in untrustworthy terrain, I decided it just wasn\u0027t worth the risk to attempt to land efficiently.\u00A0 So these days in such\u00A0circumstances \u00A0I used the horribly inefficient but MUCH safer \u0022stop and drop\u0022 method.\u00A0 That is, I get in the lowest possible orbit that will still clear the mountaintops.\u00A0 Then I wait until a good spot to land on comes by, kill all my horizontal velocity, and drop down vertically on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The
