You could try making sure none of the parts are clipping in the editor, the brakes are off and that the rover has electric charge because from your images I don\u0027t see any batteries or RTG/Solar Panels. It seems your problem is power now that I look at it because rover wheels require ElectricCharge to operate. Try adding batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T00:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think iStickyDuck is right about batteries. I\u0027m making it a practice to put them into every craft I make (just not into jettisoned stages). Another good thing to do is install solar panels. If you can afford the mass, nuclear is also an option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T01:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI encounter this before.
