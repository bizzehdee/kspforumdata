Then, you could keep them in orbit, and land them as necessary. Instead of docking the landers i would recommend the mod Kerbal Attachment System (KAS), so you can connect the base to the ship while on EVA. You can also make a crane to move the new base modules closer. It\u0027s not a cheaty mod at all, it just adds more EVA activities, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T02:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t used KAS in a while since they changed it, but that\u0027s the one you need. It has a part that can be detached by a kerbal and placed on a vessel. Pipes can then be connected to it that allow you to transfer resources into that vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T03:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds interesting, I will certainly have to check it out, Thank you both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
