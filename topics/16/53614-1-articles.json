During active flight, most engines generate charging current when running, so they will charge the batteries, but when they are off, the rest of your systems suck the power down. Even when you don\u0027t need those systems to do anything. Since there can be many different systems using power, and you aren\u0027t always sure what is using power, the easiest approach to conserving battery is to turn the battery off when you are not needing it for maneuvers or communication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly in career mode, before I unlocked solar panels, I would pack a lot of battery, and once I had it fully charged, I would turn it all off so that I could keep parasitic losses from idling equipment from eating my power up. My first 4 attemps to go to minimus, I ran out of power during my final maneuver to prepare for an orbital burn. It didn\u0027t matter how much battery I had, I would be fully charged once I completed my transfer burn, I would warp to my point for my orbital capture, start to turn into the burn, and run out of power. The first flight I had two batteries, the second time I had 4, the 3rd flight I had like 10, and each time I ran out of power at the exact same moment. My 4th flight I turned everything in the ship off before the warp, and I STILL ran out of power. But what worked was to have multiple sets of battery, and turn those off when holding a charge, and only turn them on one or two at a time. If I was doing something critical, I would turn on a couple. And always, when doing a burn, turn on your cells that are not full, to capture the generator power from the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo turn a battery off, left click on it, and then click the green arrow in the lower right. It will turn into a circle with a slash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you master conserving power, you will probably do enough science fairly quickly and get some solar panels, and some larger batteries. Eventually you can get some radio isotope cells to combine with battery. Think of the battery as the quick source of electric power, and your solar panels, engines, and isotope generators as battery chargers. If your battery charging rate exceeds your parasitic losses, then a battery that can handle the demands of maneuvers and other bursts of power requirements (like radio transmissions) should be all you need. But if your charging is not keeping up with parasitic losses, then you pretty much need to turn the batteries off like I suggest to have any power left when you come out of a warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you forget to conserve power, then the first thing you need to do when coming out of warp is to fire up your engines, because it seems that a warp will tend to drain 99.9% of your power, leaving you .1% to make the right first move. Turning on a generator is the only good first move. If you maneuver first, you won\u0027t have enough battery to light the engines... you probably won\u0027t even finish the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an engineer, and this behavior isn\u0027t a perfect example of reality, but being forced to make hard choices and conserve resources is still a very realistic concept. I found it interesting that adding more and more battery didn\u0027t solve the problem, the solution came from finding a different approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game is addictive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T11:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only time I have had an unresponsive rocket despite full electric charge is when a link somewhere between the control module and the rest of the rocket has broken.
