My quick question is, do you need to place a separator before placing the new fairing on a payload, as the new fairings don\u0027t seem to have a built in separator? (which I find a bit odd)\n\nMany Thanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T11:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Russty**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:02:22Z","Content":"Yes, the fairing base is a fixed part that stays attached to whatever you attach it to. You need some means of separating the payload from it.\n\n(note: the fairing top isn\u0027t - you can close it around any circular part, and it will \u0022fall away\u0022 just fine, so only the big ring part is your concern. I usually place it on the transfer stage under the separator that frees the payload.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T11:20:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 11:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Russty","CreatedById":138568,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:06:15Z","Content":"Ty :-)"}]}
