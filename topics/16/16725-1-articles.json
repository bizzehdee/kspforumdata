Mine normally go right first. Quick bursts to the rudder is normally enough to keep them on the runway though. The easiest way to stabalise a wing itself is with struts. Run the strut from the wing up to the top of your rudder with symetry on. If you have a double or triple tail, you\u0027ll need to brace your rudders together (struts show through tail fins, so its easy to get them in the right spot). This will help keep your wings from flexing, which can cause them to impact during landings, as well as reduce your lift and ability to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilNando","CreatedById":38606,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T01:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no clues how to take off lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RINyN.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/RINyN.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SNapple","CreatedById":38677,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T09:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell there\u0027s your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour trying to create a spaceplane, not only the size of the SPH, but that uses the rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry going for the mk 2 cockpit, and just start with much smaller spaceplanes. Oh, and use the TurboJet engines. They are *EXTREMELY* efficient when you are in the atmosphere. If you go too high, though, the engines choke out, and will produce no thrust, but consume fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and tail fins. There is a wing designed just for that. Also, if you have problems controlling the plane, try pointed your wings slightly upwards. That helps with stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
