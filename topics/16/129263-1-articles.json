If you catch up with it, you get pulled around and thrown backwards - thus subtracting its orbital speed from your own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in KSP it hardly ever works exactly like that because with few exceptions (Eve, Jool), moons and planets are not massive enough to make such a huge change in your trajectory if you are travelling at interplanetary speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what you want to do is benefit from the most useful part of that phenomenon to help you out. No moon is heavy enough to spin you right round, but many of them are heavy enough to give you a quarter turn or so. So you cut in front of the moon at an angle so that it accelerates you backwards, or you cut behind it so that it accelerates you forwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd because of the way they form, solar systems are naturally set up to help you out. When you transfer up from Kerbin to Duna, and assuming that you have made the absolute minimum transfer to get an intercept, Duna will be going faster than you and will therefore catch you and throw you forwards after you pass behind it. The opposite should happen for Eve : you catch up with Eve just at the edge of its SOI, so you pass in front of the planet and are thrown back at a slower speed along its orbital path when you return to Kerbol SOI. And the same is true of the moons - when Jool is catching up with you at your Ap from a Kerbin-to-Jool transfer, the closest moons to you should be the ones on the inner edge of the Jool system, and their speed relative to you should therefore be slower than the Jool system as a whole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaytheDragon","CreatedById":149656,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T23:33:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222351002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129263\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452103544\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146403\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GarrisonChisholm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, GarrisonChisholm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/http://imgur.com/a/p8wp3/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGarbage- and can\u0027t delete it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, well, I had pictures but I can\u0027t take the time at work to figure out what-the-heck I need to do to post them.\u00A0 However!
