While on a mission you can right click a solar panel and it will tell you how good the line of sight to the sun is and how much electricity it is generating. These numbers are quite small so it\u0027s easy to sum them in your head. Don\u0027t forget to fit batteries for when you are on the night side of the celestial body you are orbiting and eclipses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you move further from the sun than Kerbin you will generate less electricity, if you move closer you will generate more - I don\u0027t know how much effect this has because I\u0027ve not left Kerbin SOI yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts that use electricity tell you how much they use in their part info in the VAB. Bear in mind they only use electricity when they are doing something so an antenna only uses electricity when transmitting. During a mission you can see your current total electricity use in the Resources window at the top right of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-07T12:59:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2014 12:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by irongut\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T12:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can try the Fusebox plugin.
