To see this, stay parked on the launchpad and switch to orbital velocity, it will read something around ~160m/s. Because of this its better to let the game automatically switch to orbital velocity, rather then switching it while (presumably) still in the lower atmosphere. From my experience you want to start the turn based on altitude, not speed. Generally I start the turn around 8000m up, and if I do it right, when the navball switches to orbital velocity the prograde marker is within a couple of degrees of 45. From there I try to keep the prograde marker at 45 until my apoapsis is around 75km or so. Then I just coast within half a minute of the apoapsis and make the burn to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FyunchClick","CreatedById":143109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T08:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith v1.004, I usually start a 5 or 10 degrees turn to the East right off the Launchpad, then turn SAS to prograde hold in with the nav ball in surface mode, that way the drag from the atmosphere is straight back and you don\u0027t have stability issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If needed, I\u0027ll nudge it a bit so I hit about half of 45 degrees at 2.5 km altitude, 45 degrees at 10. Then when my apoapsis hits 50/60 km, I\u0027ll throttle to get apoapsis about 45 seconds in front of me, and I\u0027ll let it drop down further the closer I get to my intended orbit height. This will usually get me in a neat 70/80 km orbit. I only bother gunning straight for the horizon at around 35/40 km altitude if the craft has such a poor TWR that I\u0027m afraid I may not be able to hold the apoapsis at 30/45 seconds ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t bother switching the nav ball to orbit mode, it\u0027ll do so by itself when you leave the atmosphere, and the stability that prograde flight in surface mode offers, up until about 35 kms or so, greatly helps getting even iffy designs up without too much problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe starting angle right of the Launchpad kinda depends on whether it\u0027s top-heavy and how fast the acceleration is; if it accelerates fast or is very stable, you\u0027ll need a bit more angle to start with, if it\u0027s slow or top heavy, a bit less is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more efficient ways, but this works for me and it\u0027s pretty easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T09:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 09:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FyunchClick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emisc spelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gloom Demon","CreatedById":151055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T09:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Highguard","CreatedById":150696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T16:50:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gloom Demon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gloom Demon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...And after that I fail to see any big improvement in height reached when compared with a strictly vertical flight.\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I am missing something here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no improvement in height using a gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is the point :- height is easy, height is not the issue, horizontal velocity to get into orbit and \u003Cem\u003Estay\u003C/em\u003E in space is the issue.
