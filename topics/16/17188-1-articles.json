They had been forced to use a lightweight (read: modded) satellite engine instead of a full-sized rocket propulsion unit, whether due to budget cuts or weight restraints is a source of lively debate (though most think that someone said \u0027oh... new and shiny\u0027 and strapped it on). This engine proved insufficient to slow the probe during simulated descents, and the landing had to be canceled anyway. The team was disappointed that they were unable to actually touch down on Mun, as the probe\u0027s mission of analyzing the Munar soil and measuring radiation at the surface will not be completed. They take solace, however, in the fact that they can still photograph the surface and use the probe to select a future landing site and also take radiation readings at altitude and hopefully use them to extrapolate surface data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus Mun Beacon 1 will remain in a roughly 220,000 meter orbit (\u002B/- 20k meters), inclined at roughly 45* to the orbital plane. Her rocket booster is still attached and has roughly 20% of its fuel supply, so it has not been separated. This is intended as an \u0027anti-pollution\u0027 measure; it will limit the amount of debris with which future missions must contend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hubbazoot","CreatedById":21881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T18:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the right click trick doesn\u0027t work, you can cycle your landing gear a couple times really quickly (press G as fast as you can).
