Then when i get there suddenly the probe will not connect to my relays. i checked to make sure they were in the proper position and sure enough they were. FYI i have\u003Cstrong\u003E 6\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EHG-5 high gain antennas\u003C/strong\u003E on my probe i sent to the Mun. And on the relay, i also have 6 and 2 extra \u003Cstrong\u003Ecommunotron 16\u0027s\u003C/strong\u003E. I\u0027m not sure whats going on here but its quite annoying considering my probe is connected to the relay 100% before i reach the Mun, but when i enter the Muns sphere of influence it just disconnects. I am not in a Mun orbit, just a fly-by. Thank you in advance if you can answer my concerns!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-05T09:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have electric charge on your spacecraft?

Right-click on the antennas and you should see an option to \u0022Deploy\u0022. The reason you can connect before you get to the Mun is because the capsules and probe bodies have simple antennas built into them but they aren\u0027t powerful enough to transmit long distances and they can\u0027t send science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the Communotrons can not function as relays, but the HG-5s can. Be aware that the HG-5 is still pretty low power for a relay since it\u0027s the first one you have access to, so you will need to keep the HG-5 relays in orbit of the Mun to connect to a probe on the Mun\u0027s surface. It\u0027s your large ground stations on Kerbin that will do the work to resolve such weak signals from the relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-06T03:45:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2017 03:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-06T05:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several settings that you could have changed that would change all this behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Difficulty setting of your game changes the range of all the antennas -- or you might have reduced the ranges manually.
