I\u0027m not approaching it wringing my hands and begging someone to help me feel better about myself....I get that docking is one of the most difficult procedures to grasp at first. Instead I\u0027m trying to pull the tutorial apart so I understand what\u0027s actually going on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Getting to a coplanar orbit: Gene says target the stranded vehicle (no questions there) then set up a maneuver node on the ascending or descending node pulling the magenta handles to project a coplanar orbit for me (Val in the rescue vehicle.)\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\na. Why does the rate of change in degrees vary so much?\u003Cbr\u003E\nb. Why is it often impossible to zero out the degrees without moving the maneuver node?\u003Cbr\u003E\nc. Why does the zeroed out coplanar orbit often change after the maneuver is complete and I remove the node?\u003Cbr\u003E\nd. What level of accuracy do I need to achieve, plus or minus 0.1 degrees, or dead on?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Achieving intersecting orbit within 5 kms: set a maneuver node that gets me within 5 kms of the stranded vehicle by accelerating prograde;\u003Cbr\u003E\na. What do the two color intersect markers actually indicate and why are there two of them? Is it where the two vehicles actually meet in orbit?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nb. What is the relationship of their movement to the position of the node and why do the figures and positions jump round so much? Note that I often feel like even using some sort of hyper-acurate measuring device my margin of error is often between 4,6 kms, and 2043 kms. Am I also racing the actual change in the positions of the two craft in the time it takes to position the node and change the prograde vector? When a tiny change of position causes one of the two dotted lines to jump to the other side of the orbit or disappear altogether....what has just happened?\u003Cbr\u003E\nc. Why does moving the node or the prograde vector seem to take separation in one direction...then suddenly the other with no apparent rhyme or reason, and why is the rate of change in either direction not even close to constant?\u003Cbr\u003E\nd. When conducting maneuver nodes in docking, do I use the pink target mode Icon or the blue maneuver node icon?\u00A0 Is it both?\u00A0 If so when do you use them?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is as far as I\u0027ve gotten in the tutorial. Conducting the actual docking should be no worse than maneuvering a Kerbal back to the airlock after a spacewalk compared to making sense out of setting myself into position with maneuver nodes. I\u0027ve done that from being out of visible sight of the ship...it\u0027s all a matter of flying towards the positional reference on the screen and not panicking before I get there. Or is there something I don\u0027t know yet...?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Space Program General Discussions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T06:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Crystal_Mace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELeft out an imporant quuestion.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T06:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. You don\u0027t have to zero it out. If you don\u0027t get it exactly on the AN/DN crossover, it will make less of a difference to the angle, but may make it easier to get AN/DN to occur where you are going to meet the other ship, which is the most crucial thing in fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, one thing that is new-ish in 1.1 is that if you are not in warp, subtle changes to maneuvre nodes can make significant changes since the \u0022in physics\u0022 part of the code calculates your orbit constantly. If you have enough time, in-game, do all your precise node changes on the lowest warp setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say new-ish because the same thing happened before, but it wasn\u0027t anywhere near as noticeable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for it changing after doing the burn - because burns can never be 100% precise. And because you have probably now passed onto a new orbit for the calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the intersect and AN/DN figures are given as the result of your set maneuvre node. If there is any difference between what was planned and what you actually did, it will appear as soon as you delete the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The two chevrons indicate: Firstly, where your ship is when the paths cross at the closest point. Secondly, where the other ship will be when you are at that location. If your orbit crosses the other one twice, then the first one will be orange, and the second purple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETip: If you have difficulty seeing where you\u0027ll be later, just drop another node a little later, leave it at 0 m/s, and go back to the \u0022real\u0022 node you are trying to set. This way, you will only see the intersects which occur \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E that second node. This probably won\u0027t help for the tutorial though...\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 2b) - see the second paragraph above, unfortunately...\u00A0 [edit: actually not necessarily - you could be just grazing the other orbit at one point, and the slightest change causes that \u0022graze\u0022 to travel all the way around the orbit. Imagine an extremely long pair of scissors: the slightest movement will make the point of contact race along the blade. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EIncidentally, some have tried to use that analogy to suggest a way of passing information at infinite speeds... which couldn\u0027t happen but it does at least illustrate how a minor variation can radically change the intersect point\u003C/span\u003E]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 2c) - when you get a close approach, the game can decide that actually another point on the orbit is closer. Again, this is probably due to the same thing as 2b...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 2d) - not quite sure what you mean. Once you are very close, maneuvre nodes are pointless because \u0022pushing the marble\u0022 (pushing the target\u0027s yellow retrograde marker over the pink anti-target cross, by pointing on the other side of the yellow and gently firing the engines) does exactly what you would be trying to set up as a maneuvre node. The trouble is that you can\u0027t do this at a distance because your rate of approach and direction of approach will move as you move around the orbit. And once you are very very close you turn around and use RCS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I can suggest anything - learn to use HN IJKL for RCS translation. It helps to train the right hand to do this while the left continues to use WASD for rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I haven\u0027t had time to look at the tutorials yet, so I hope nothing above has \u003Cem\u003Eadded\u003C/em\u003E any confusion...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T07:06:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T06:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportant point for accuracy of burn. \u00A0If the set burn time is 30 seconds, you want to start the burn at -15 seconds to yhe maneuver node. \u00A0You want the burn time \u0022centered\u0022 on the node. \u00A0If you wait until zero, your result will be off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, there will be some inaccuracies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T09:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222538001\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461563321\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149414\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crystal_Mace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Crystal_Mace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

Two curves crossing each other will have two points of intersection, hence two pairs of intercept markers. They move around so much because when you burn in a straight line by a constant amount, the resulting changes in the intersection of the two curves will chang\u00A0in a non-linear way.

Do not expect to see a linear relationship between changes in the nodes and the effect on the intercept - you won\u0027t. Small changes and tweaks and using the Mk1 eyeball is the way to go.
