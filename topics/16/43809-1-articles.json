It is still possible to use MechJeb for docking. With Q and E you can control the rotation during docking, so that both couplers dock. If only one of them connects, just decouple it, reverse a couple of meters and restart the docking autopilot. Always manipulate the rotaion manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i254/groom06/screenshot0_zpscfec4ce0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot0_zpscfec4ce0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T21:34:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis will help with alignment during docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/dock-align-indicator/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/dock-align-indicator/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T21:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking alignment is actually pretty easy once you\u0027re docked. Undock the vessel/module/whatever, back off a few meters, rotate to align, thrust forwards to docking port again. There\u0027s also a mod named Docking Washers (or something like that) that provides for washers to put under docking ports, so you can rotate a module while it is docked. Personally I find that a bit too much. Also, what Apollo13 said, the Docking Alignment Indicator mod also includes a rotational indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
