It can make orbit with between 800 and 300 m/s of delta V. On takeoff it\u0027s fairly well balanced--no huge problems. However, landings? Not so much. I have the fuel to make a safe powered landing on the turbojets, but I\u0027m struggling with unpowered gliding-landings/controlled crashes into the ocean (if necessary \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E) because the thing becomes extremely rear-heavy when it runs out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s882.photobucket.com/user/TalkingHat/media/Youregointospaceson.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac29/TalkingHat/Youregointospaceson.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Youregointospaceson.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s882.photobucket.com/user/TalkingHat/media/adsdadsda.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac29/TalkingHat/adsdadsda.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022adsdadsda.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cal\u0026#039;Mihe","CreatedById":65567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T22:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThough it would disturb the clean lines of your fuselage, you could move the rocket fuel tank to between the cockpit and the engines.

It\u0027s a problem with most of the Delta-wing designs when the COG drifts to the back of the craft. While a craft that is not properly balanced is always at least a bit tricky to fly, if you lack control authority too you are not going to live most of the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr in other words, if you have enough control authority you can land anything \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe further a control surface is from COG the more control authority it will provide. Two things can be done then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fit control surfaces to the front, which is often easy to do but will not do stability any good. (Though new-ASAS will probably cure that problem)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Move control surfaces to the back, behind COG. This is often hard to do in SSTO\u0027s though.
