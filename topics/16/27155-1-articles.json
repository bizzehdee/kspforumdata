That\u0027s what I did with this plane: she\u0027s Kerbin SSTO capable if I don\u0027t use the staging, so she she put herself in orbit and then refueled. (I also used a tug for the transfer and the return trip.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Regarding the efficiency question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock, lifting off from Kerbin, a rocket powered fixed wing SSTO can make orbit for almost exactly the same total delta-v as a vertically launched rocket. My best numbers for both types are in the neighborhood of 4.2km/s. However, a fixed wing rocket will have more mass for the same total delta-v, due to the need to carry the wings to orbit, so if mass is your primary criterion you are better off with a vertical launch. I don\u0027t know if the situation is similar on Eve, because I don\u0027t have a successful stock spaceplane design yet. I\u0027m working on modifying the FAR design, but I\u0027ll need to add another 4k delta-v to have a shot at making it back from sea level, and that means almost double the fuel load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn FAR, I have noticed a little bit of delta-v savings during winged ascent, but I don\u0027t have any fixed numbers yet. One thing I\u0027m playing with is trying to find the minimum mass aerospike-powered vertical SSTO design (using a 1-man cockpit), and seeing if I can beat that mass with a winged design. I think that\u0027d actually make an interesting challenge thread, but there don\u0027t seem to be enough people using FAR to get a good contest going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final thing: I\u0027ve worked out a bit of the math behind winged ascent profiles. During the thick part of the atmosphere, the goal is to find the ascent angle which maximizes your vertical velocity. Assuming drag is proportional only to the square of the velocity and that you have enough wing surface that your angle of attack is near zero, your fastest climb rate is when your angle of ascent is equal to the Arcsin of two thirds your TWR. For a TWR of .8, this is about 30 degrees, rising to ~40 degrees at TWR of 1. For high TWRs, the optimum angle quickly shoots up from about 60 degrees around 1.4 TWR to vertical at a TWR of 1.5, meaning that beyond TWR of 1.5 wings are an absolute detriment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I haven\u0027t worked through the math on, though, is dependence of TWR on fuel burn rate, and therefore the optimum thrust for winged ascent which maximizes altitude per unit fuel used (this is a much harder problem than solving for constant TWR).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T02:43:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"birrhan","CreatedById":62148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T03:00:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDude, I\u0027m in the exact same boat.

I\u0027m sure this has to have been worked out before; it\u0027s too easy of a calculation otherwise (which is why I\u0027m a little concerned I\u0027ve made a mistake somewhere, or that I\u0027ve oversimplified things too much).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: another interesting fact about this computation is that efficiency (defined as altitude gained per fractional mass burned) scales as ~m^(1/2), assuming that drag is independent of mass (which is true for cylindrical spacecraft where you add mass just by making it taller) or as ~m^(1/6) if drag scales as m^(2/3) (which it would for simple scaling of the ship without changing the density). Thus, larger craft are more efficient than smaller craft (although they will tend to be less structurally sound).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T13:14:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stochasty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T14:49:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no longer a rocket scientist, but I\u0027ll happily bet your equations.

The hard part about this is how to test it, since all the calculations were assuming equilibrium velocity (so thrust = drag \u002B gravity) at constant air pressure.

Thus you\u0027ve got mediocre lift/thrust and no realistic way to use something like an LV-N for any significant fraction of the vehicle\u0027s ascent, because they\u0027re just too heavy to carry and waste vast quantities of fuel for most of the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing from 0m to 4000m (or 6000m, which is where the smallest ascent vehicles were launching from) involves burning upward at a velocity of 50-70m/s - call it 60 m/s average.

Eve\u0027s surface gravity is 16.7 m/s2, and on an ideal ascent, the acceleration from drag will match that, so you\u0027re looking at 3.4 km/s of delta-v to get from sea level to the top of the mountain from which they were ascending (2.2km/s to the high plateaus that are a much easier landing target.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleven","CreatedById":60502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T00:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on something to take off from Eve...it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
