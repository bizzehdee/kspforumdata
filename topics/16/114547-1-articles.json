The gravitational constant (g) for Kerbin is 9.81 according to the wiki.\n\nSo let\u0027s use the Skipper as an example. It has 568.75 kN of thrust at 1 atm, or sea level. Let\u0027s assume we want a TWR of 1.3.\n\n(568.75/9.81) / 1.3 = 44.597 \n\nSo, for a TWR of 1.3 on the Launchpad, your skipper powered rocket must be less than approximately 44.6 tons."},{"CreatedByName":"MoonMan22","CreatedById":78400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T16:06:37Z","Content":"There is no easy way of calculating that. You do have a couple of options.\n\n1. You can make dummy payloads of different weights and then use Kerbal Engineer to check the dv/TWR numbers it generates. \n\n2. You can use this [Rocket Calculator](http://garycourt.github.io/korc/) to see the payload capabilities of different rocket designs.\n\n3. You can calculate it yourslef using the [Tsiolkovsky rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) to figure it out.

That\u0027s why we use something like Kerbal Engineer Redux to do the calculations for us.\n\nYou need to worry about two things:\n\n1.) Do you have enough thrust to lift your payload off the ground and acellerate fast enough. For that you need to look at your Thrust-to-Weight ratio. And that is really just your Thrust devided by your weight, which is your vehicles mass times g. TWR = T/(mg) You propably want your TWR above 1.5 at least. So that puts a boundary on your max payload mass. You can counteract this somewhat with adding more boosters. Many real rockets come in different configurations for different payloads.\n\n2.) Do you have enough delta v to get to orbit. If you look at the Rocket equation, you will see that delta v is dependent on your dry mass. Payload is dry mass and when you bring more of it, your delta v decreases. That means you can get into a higher orbit with a lighter payload. On the other hand, a very heavy payload might give you not even enough delta v to reach orbit.\n\nNow to actually calculate the payload mass for a given delta v requirement, you have to rearrange that equation to solve for the part of your upper stage drymass that is your payload mass. Then iterate this through all your stages. This is not hard, but takes time to do on paper. I\u0027d just slap on a fuel tank as a dummy payload and adjust the fuel level to simulate different payload masses. Make sure there is no fuel crossfeed though."}]}
