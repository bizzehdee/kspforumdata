While a bunch of LVT-30s are better in pretty much all ways, they also require a ton more parts. When you combine that with stitching struts and asparagus staging, you\u0027re looking at a pretty complex rocket. It is also entirely possible to use mainsails and stick within the optimal launch speed graph that was earlier posted, you just have to have the right combination of engines/fuel/payload. In fact, I did one last night that was pretty close; brought 95 tons to orbit, think I started with a TWR around 1.4, maybe 1.3, hit 200-something m/s around 8km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all honesty, though, you really only need to worry about terminal velocity losses until you hit around 12km. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever got flames on my launches, even when launching satellites at a TWR \u0026gt; 2. For heavy launching with Mainsails aim for a TWR around 1.2 ~ 1.4 with a decent early delta-V (1500m/s or better), you should be just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
