If so, then easy to land next to them and have them walk over to the new ship.\n\nFailing that, the [Klaw](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Advanced_Grabbing_Unit) may bail you out. Tricky job, but you could design a ship that would drop down on top of their wreckage and pick up their capsule to return home. Might have to be careful about re-entry however, if the capsule is damaged and lacks a heat shield..."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T08:57:37Z","Content":"Well, you could just land a rescue craft next to it (this can be a lot harder than it sounds, basically set the crashed vessel as your target and deorbit. Keep your retrograde Marker on the retro target marker and keep trying ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) and use EVA to transfer your kerbals manually. In case you don\u0027t know EVA is Extra Vehicular Activity (or sth along the lines of that) so basically let them get out and walk over to the rescue craft. However this will require the corresponding upgrade (I think it\u0027s the astronaut complex, let me check).\n\nEdit: to EVA you will have to upgrade your astronaut complex to level two, which only costs 70k funds.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T09:01:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phafor","CreatedById":98756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:07:10Z","Content":"I have landed a craft next to it already, but then I realised I couldn\u0027t EVA them.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI have already saved the pilots in the craft (Jeb and Val) but I couldn\u0027t transfer my tourists to the craft.
