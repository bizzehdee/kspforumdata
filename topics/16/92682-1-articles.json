The effect is that your engine thrust is pushing the nose down, because then engines are higher up on the plane than the CoM - the same as if you put one engine on a wingtip the plane would try to turn in circles instead of going straight forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EmGpe5k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EmGpe5k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your engines are up high like this, that\u0027s your problem. To fix, you\u0027ll need to work out a way to shift your CoM up, or your CoT down, or angle the nacelles so that they point towards the CoM - note this last will make your plane fly on a permanent upward pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-13T18:13:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2014 06:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYo12234","CreatedById":130916,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T00:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI finally was able to make my a-10 fly although I had to give up and just put the engines on the side like what Hodo did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vQU0zRI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vQU0zRI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-14T01:19:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2014 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DYo12234\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T06:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess the RL A10 gets around this problem by balancing the CoT between CoM and CoL.
