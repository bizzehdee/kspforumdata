They all seem to work fine... all but translate forward, that is. For some reason that doesn\u0027t seem to work. When I press \u0027Left Shift\u0027 or \u0027H\u0027, the gauge indicates that I should be moving, but I see no puffs from the ship, and... the monopropellant usage reads \u00270.00\u0027 (for all other translate operations, this usage varies between 0.33 and... 0.83, I think it is). I get the same result whether I\u0027m in \u0027LIN\u0027 or \u0027ROT\u0027.\n\n![Orbiting%20101%20problem%202of2%20-%20Translate%20forward%20Docking%20-%20LIN%20using%20NO%20monpropellant_zps6902wkys.jpg](http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Orbiting%20101%20problem%202of2%20-%20Translate%20forward%20Docking%20-%20LIN%20using%20NO%20monpropellant_zps6902wkys.jpg)\n\n![Orbiting%20101%20problem%201of2%20-%20Translate%20forward%20Docking%20-%20ROT%20using%20NO%20monopropellant_zps9pivr3cf.jpg](http://i167.photobucket.com/albums/u128/snafubucket/games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Orbiting%20101%20problem%201of2%20-%20Translate%20forward%20Docking%20-%20ROT%20using%20NO%20monopropellant_zps9pivr3cf.jpg)\n\nDoes the ship in this tutorial have a busted thruster? \n\n... or is there a bug in the software?\n\n... or is it just me?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T16:14:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pendant**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T10:59:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m not at home right now so I cannot check the tutorial craft atm, but judging from the images I think you only have RCS thrusters pointing to the sides, none to front or back.

Is this just how a bog-standard capsule/ service module combination works?

But I knew that Orbiting 101 would put me straight into space so I could experiment with the controls (you know, without all that tedious stuff beforehand mucking about building rockets and launching them\\*). And I think what this kernoob might do, others might, too. Surely it would be kinder to add back-facing thrusters so folk like me could translate forward, and not get confused?\n\n\\* Incidentally, I did go back to Flight Basics to see if the capsule/ service module on top of that launch assembly was any different -- and I found it is. No thrusters at all on that one!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T14:33:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pendant**\n  \nminor typo"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:49:11Z","Content":"Frankly, as far as tutorials go the KSP ones are pretty mediocre...

I should perhaps have mentioned that I did finally manage to get them docked. Of course I should have taken a breather there, but, instead, all excited at having succeeded, I ploughed on... patted myself on the back when I figured out that I didn\u0027t have to squeeze them all into the one capsule because -- there was a lifeboat pod! Plotted an orbit back home... and, just as we were, all six, approaching atmosphere, I suddenly thought \u0022Oh, bugger -- is there a heatshield on this lifeboat thing?\u0022 In retrospect, the answer to that must have been \u0027yes\u0027, but with Kerbin looming large in the window, I decided that saving three would be better than possibly losing six, so I (shades of the opening scene of [Pitch Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134847/)) -- hit the space bar and ditched the lifeboat ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\nObject lesson, learnt: know your vehicle ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E Honestly, my first reaction is that all of the tutorial descriptions are pretty clear cut in what they cover - from those alone I\u0027d have a fair idea of what is and is not in scope for each, and would figure out pretty quickly if I\u0027m trying to do something that the current tutorial doesn\u0027t want me messing with yet.
