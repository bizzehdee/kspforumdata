The SOI boundary is a fuzzy region, parts of the game recognize it at slightly different place than other parts of the game and while you\u0027re inside that region your orbit is displayed in a very weird way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wait a while till your ship exits that region, things get to normal.
