Because I don\u0027t want to loose everything I did in 0.90.

So far, I have not heard any indications that 1.0 will break 0.90 saves, but that doesn\u0027t mean that it can\u0027t happen. \n\nI\u0027m sorry, but no better answer is possible until the changes between the versions have been finalized."},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T00:50:51Z","Content":"Bear in mind that we\u0027re expecting a lot of tweaks to part parameters between 0.90 and 1.0.
