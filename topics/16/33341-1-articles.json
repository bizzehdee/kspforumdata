The kind you see in movies and games where all the spaceships look and behave like atmospheric planes... But in SPACE. This craft would have to change direction depending on which it was facing (so you couldn\u0027t fly it side on to the imaginary \u0027space air\u0027) and be able to slow down without having to turn around. I\u0027m guessing you\u0027d have to use clever usage of RCS, engines and action groups (and maybe even rebinding some keys) to achieve the desired handling. I can\u0027t think of any particular uses for such a craft, except maybe strapping some \u0027torpedoes\u0027 to it, blowing up a space station, dodging through the debris cloud and, then doing victor roll as you fly towards the Kerbin sunrise!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Well I meant to put this in General Discussion, but sure, How To will do... :/\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-16T21:32:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2013 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CosmicX1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T21:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this is possible, as the only games to have starfighters with decent physics that I remember are Frontier and I-War.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn neither game did the fighters really handle like they do in the movies, they make use of some pretty potent retro engines to help them manoeuvre though, and another game where you had \u0022realistic\u0022 craft was Nexus, where ships clearly had engines on the front so they could slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying sideways shouldn\u0027t be a problem, several games let you do that such as Tachyon and others (the Wing Commander games maybe?), the biggest issue is the constantly on engines, you wouldn\u0027t want to do that in KSP (or real life) as you\u0027d very easily overshoot your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d probably manage something more like a hovercraft, that slides about a lot, rather than a space fighter plane like in Star Wars, though there\u0027s nothing to stop you making something that \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E like a starfighter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T22:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI imagine something along the lines of what sal_vager was saying with the retro-rockets to slow down.
