I only had 3 days of life support (TAC), but there\u0027s plenty of supplies on the station, so all I had to do was dock before running out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy shuttle is WAY ahead of the station, practically on the other side of the planet, but on a nearly identical inclination. With the help of Kerbal Alarm Clock, I discovered that I could make rendezvous in under 3 days, but only if my orbit was an average 65 km higher than the station. This is a much more aggressive profile than I\u0027ve ever tried before, and I\u0027m having some trouble knowing when to lower my periapse to get the best close approach possible. Ideally, I\u0027d like to get closest approach half an orbit later and lower my apoapse down, thereby zeroing my relative velocity at closest approach. This is all correct right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what rules of thumb can I use to tell when to lower PE for this kind of approach? Really any advice on how to do a fast, efficient rendezvous would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T09:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.)

Because you first matched orbits, that means that your periapsis after the burn remains touching the station\u0027s orbit. All that is left to do then is to delay your time to periapsis to such a degree that the station has time to arrive at the same spot. And that\u0027s what raising your apoapsis does. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will have a hard braking burn during your encounter, because you will be going significantly faster at periapsis than the station. But that\u0027s not a problem if your closest encounter is under 2km. At that point, you can simply set your navball to target mode and burn at the retrograde marker untill your relative velocity is zero. Then just point your nose at the station and fly towards it. At this close distance, the difference in orbits is no longer large enough to disrupt your approach in any meaningful way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 1: while this is the fastest way, it\u0027s also the most dV costly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 2: This approach works even when your inclination isn\u0027t matched, as long as you perform your AP raising burn at the ascending or descending node. You will then have a chance at AP (which will correspond to the opposing node to where you burned) to match inclination cheaply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote 3: For high orbits, you can achieve the same result by lowering your periapsis instead of raising your apoapsis, and this is even faster. But I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re in LKO, where dropping your periapsis far enough for this to work is not an option because atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T09:56:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 09:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ead 1) to be more delta-V conservative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Instead of burning outright, set up two maneuver nodes: one at the periapsis, another a little bit after it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaise the apoapsis using the first node *a bit*, something like 20%. 100-200km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave the second node \u0022null\u0022/\u0022no-op\u0022 (0 dV).

I\u0027d never bother to wait days (!) in LKO for a rendezvous, using a at least 75km separation in LKO (75km/150km). Changes to orbital altitude of these magnitudes only take about 100m/s dV and usually mean docking within a few hours rather than days. Look at it this way - in less than three days you could do a flyby of Mun and more or less pick where on the station\u0027s orbit you want to rendezvous rather than just waiting for \u0027the\u0027 right time. On the other hand, of course, that\u0027s closer to 1km/s dV so I don\u0027t recommend it (although this would make sense if you needed to do a big plane-change at the same time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhen\u003C/em\u003E to burn, it all depends on the phase angle between the vehicles (just like optimal interplanetary transfers).
