The enclosure is subdivided into panels, which can break off individually or in groups, which means we can have full control over how the fairing will come apart once it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s jettisoned. During construction, you can place a fairing and build it up immediately after placement, or you can use Tweakable actions to edit it later. There are actions to delete, re-build and edit fairings at any time in the editor.\n\u003E Next up is implementing the actual jettisoning behavior for the panels, and also writing in the enclosure detection, which is already being handled by the cargo bay module. There is quite a bit of work still left to be done, but I dare say what we have is looking pretty good already. .\n\u003E \n\u003E The fairings are very customizable via the part.cfg, so we can determine the number of panels, the amount (if any) of edge smoothing between panels of different angles, as well as a number of other parameters, on a per part basis. And yes, we are planning on a number of different sizes of fairing parts (at least covering 1.25m through 3.5m profiles)."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:36:02Z","Content":"We know fairings are in, but (AFAICS) heat shields are undetermined."},{"CreatedByName":"Uml\u00FCx","CreatedById":69703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T07:17:10Z","Content":"what good is reentry heat if you have no heat shields? cept\u0027 they only make the capsules \u0027heatproof\u0027 of course.\n\nwelp.. so, direct jool returns are no valid option anymore in the future.... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T07:48:48Z","Content":"They could add shielding as a tweakable, so you could \u0027dial-a-heat-shield\u0027. This would be (IMHO) the only sensible way to do shielding for space planes and shuttles, which would find it very hard to attach independent heat shields. Obviously this could cost funds and mass, and maybe not be available on all parts.\n\nAlternatively, they could add integral heat shields to the capsules, as DRE does with the Mk 1, and adjust the mass appropriately. This would only apply to certain parts, and not to others (for example the lander cans).\n\nAlternatively again, they could implement independent shields that could be attached as any other part. This would allow them to be detached (either with a built-in decoupler or a regular one) allowing for a great variety of designs, but OTOH would add to part count.\n\nI haven\u0027t seen anything from SQUAD to indicate which method (or combination of methods) they prefer. I\u0027m pretty sure that they do plan to implement *some* kind of shielding, though, otherwise adding aerodynamic heating would be pretty pointless, as you say."},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T09:20:25Z","Content":"I\u0027m imagining that heatshields aren\u0027t posible for spaceplanes - we\u0027re just going to have to be careful about re-entering slowly."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T09:50:08Z","Content":"That would be ... harsh.\n\nI would expect they\u0027ll go with, \u0022It\u0027s got heat-resistant tiling,\u0022 either fixed or tweakable. \n\nOTOH, they do love explosions ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T10:46:21Z","Content":"Perhaps it will be necessary to do re-entry burns with a periapsis on the order of 30-35km to maximise the time spent in the upper atmosphere, avoiding the worst heating."},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:09:30Z","Content":"They have confirmed fairings will be in 1.0 its in the link on the 2nd post."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:31:08Z","Content":"Fairings are confirmed, and confirmed to be procedural.
