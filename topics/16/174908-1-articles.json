So far managed to get around all obstacles via searching/reading online, but currently i\u0027m having a problem i cannot figure out.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve started working on a prototype for an eve lander (and possibly return vehicle). I\u0027m trying to land a multistage design as seen in the attached image.\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nStarted off with just the one heatshield on the buttom, which would obviously cause the craft to tip over during reentry. Hence i added 4 more heat shieldss higher upp to raise the center of drag over the centre of mass.\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nOn reentry tests on kerbin, this works great - the craft is naturally aligned retrograde and the heat shields do their job.\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nHowever: For some reason the craft starts to spin around the prograde/retrograde axis, in a runaway manner, eventually causing the craft to spin so fast that it explodes. This does not make any sense to me, the craft should be completely symmetric. Even wierder is that during the first parts of the reentry, the spin is somewhat controllable with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. Then at about 400 m/s, the spin becomes weaker and i can stop it. Then, going down towards the 200\u0027s m/s there is some kind of a feedback loop, causing the craft to rapidly start spinning clockwise until the centrifugal forces rips it apart.\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nAm i missing something obvious, did i find a bug in the game or is there some aspect to this type of design i have\u0027nt considered?\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGrateful for any help,\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\nDenniss\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/6kQWbut\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlbum 6kQWbut will appear when post is submitted\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-13T20:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre your parachutes open at that point?
