Just burn so your apoapsis reaches the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, but keep the apoapsis inside the Mun\u0027s orbit of Kerbin instead of going around the far side of the Mun. Once you enter the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, you need to burn prograde to set up an orbit around the Mun. You will end up orbiting the Mun clockwise whereas you (assumably) launched from Kerbin counter-clockwise, and you will have yourself a figure 8. I believe it\u0027s actually slightly more efficient too because you have to cancel less excess velocity when setting up your Munar orbit than if you went around the far side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T04:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to push the maneuver node a little later than you normally would.
