Many monitors ship to the customer at 100% brightness, which can be anywhere between 2 to 4 times the recommended luminance - especially when you play at night and/or your room is not well lit. For example, I have mine set to 30%. Which setting is ideal for you depends on your individual monitor, room, and personal preference. Experiment and see what you like best - usually it takes about half a day or so to get used to a different brightness setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
