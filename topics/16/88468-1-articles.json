From my own experiences with the Subassembly tab, I know that whole craft cannot be saved as subassemblies - and since you built the lander as a seperate entity in the VAB, the game is treating it as a whole craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion on how to work around this is to start with a \u0022dummy\u0022 craft - say a probe core with a fuel tank and a docking port facing down, doesn\u0027t have to be useable - which the game will then treat as a root. \u003Cem\u003EThen\u003C/em\u003E build your lander onto that. Unfortunately it will mean having to rebuild your lander from scratch. Once your lander is complete, detach it from the dummy craft and save it as a subassembly. Then delete the dummy craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA variant of the above is to start with designing your larger craft - presumably the command-service module if you\u0027re going for an Apollo style mission - and build your lander on that as though it was going into the final rocket. Once again you can save the lander as a subassembly when finished, but with the bonus of being able to save the CSM as a craft afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T15:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndrewBCrisp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndrewBCrisp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi.

The only requirement for s subassembly is the root part must have an open attach node.
