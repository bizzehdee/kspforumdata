I am a bit surprised because the processing rate doesn\u0027t seem to go up much. I bring up another 3 Level Scientists and can then confirm that they have had no effect on the science processing rate, which has maxed out at 3.375 science a day.\n\nAt first I think it\u0027s a fault in recognizing what does and does not constitute a part of the station, that it is only counting the 15 scientists in the pods that were directly connected to the lab in the same stack, rather than the 10 in another part that is docked to it. But I moved Bob Kerman from one part of the station to another and this did not affect the processing rate at all.\n\nI did the math based on the data provided in the wiki, and 500 data and 0.0675% per day per level 1 scientist with an output of 3.375 per day matches the output of 10 scientists.\n\nSo are the number of scientists who can work a single lab capped at 10? I can\u0027t see any variables in the largeCrewedLab.cfg file that would indicate that is the case, and it isn\u0027t mentioned in the wikis...\n\n?"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T06:17:14Z","Content":"I think it should be capped at 2... try testing by starting from no scientist kerbals, then add one at a time, check the % each time. \n\nAccording to the [v1.0.3 patch note](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/346-KSP-1-0-3-now-Available%21):\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Fixed potential exploits with sci lab."},{"CreatedByName":"Duke Leto","CreatedById":142852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T06:44:31Z","Content":"Have not run the incremental kerbalziation test yet because (to be frank) shuffling 25 kerbals off of and onto a station is a bit tedious.

Just wondered if there was any more detailed knowledge.\n\nIt makes sense though. 50 Level 5 scientists would have a throughput of 14.175% of the stored data per day, which would take 500 points of data down to nothing in about 50 days. That does feel a bit exploity.\n\n10 seems like a good compromise number. It\u0027d feel more natural, truer to the economics of multi-person teams, if the addition of each kerbal caused less and less of a throughput increase, until it peters out entirely.\n\nOn the brighter side, it means I can run my little 30 3 star Kerbal scheme on three labs simultaneously, which amounts to the same thing as 1 with 30.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T07:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 07:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Duke Leto**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T07:38:08Z","Content":"Well only if those scientists are philosophers who can sit in their living quarters and come up with new results.

So, it comes to reason that three shifts of two scientists each will utilize the workstations to maximum, allowing time for proper rest, recreation and work that can be done outside the workstation (planning, analysis, brainstorming, reading materials on the subject). Additional one assistant per shift will further improve the efficiency, and one \u0022backup\u0022 for when a scientist is sick, or otherwise occupied, or just for filing reports and bookkeeping, fills the 10-kerbal quota."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:07:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E superkerbals who can work 24/7.\n\nWait what does 24/7 mean on Kerbin?"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke Leto","CreatedById":142852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T02:57:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait what does 24/7 mean on Kerbin?\n\n6/1.58333 Then.\n\nOr (probably more likely on a world where the short munar orbit makes a week a rather pointless concept...)\n\n6/6"}]}
