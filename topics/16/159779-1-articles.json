I\u0027ll throw my hands up in shame and admit that if I feel like a bit of KSP but not want to take it too seriously, I load up the Demo version and away I go!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a time I simply went straight to Sandbox but then I tried the career mode, and it\u0027s actually not a bad wee game. \u00A0It\u0027s not the full KSP, but it\u0027s not a disaster either. \u00A0But the one thing I can\u0027t figure out is how many contracts you can take on before Mission Control is closed? \u00A0I used to think it was a fixed number, but it isn\u0027t; in some games you might get six or seven, in others only four. \u00A0I then thought maybe no more contracts would be available once a certain amount of money was in the account, but nope it\u0027s not that either. \u00A0I\u0027ve been bordering on 700k at times before MC was closed, while in others I scarcely make 500k. \u00A0So maybe it\u0027s one specific contract that is the catalyst for closing the building. \u00A0I grew suspicious about Orbit Kerbin, but I can now definitely rule that one out, the last time I tried the Demo I didn\u0027t even get accepting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draalo","CreatedById":158993,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-26T08:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHrm, its abot 2 years ago i played the demo...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf i remember right, mission conrol is closed after reaching orbit first time - so go suborbital, do as many contracts as possible to gain founds and science.
