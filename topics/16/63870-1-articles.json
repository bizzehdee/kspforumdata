I use a modified stock heavy lander, and put the docking port on the bottom, so when mated to my booster, and the whole thing is in line. Seemed a clever idea. However, everything on the nav ball reversed, retrograde became pro etc. So in essence I had to fly backward.

It sounds like your navball is centered on the docking port (which, if I understood your description, is facing backwards). This is very useful for docking, and not at all useful for other flight modes. Just right click on your command pod (or whatever is supposed to be flying your rocket) and choose \u0022control from here\u0022, and that should fix things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T17:51:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you were able to fly backward, then awesome job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor background info: KSP allows you to control craft from many different locations including capsules, probe cores, and docking ports. The \u0022control from here\u0022 option (as pointed out above) sets your nav ball orientation based on the orientation of the part. So for example, if you have a probe core on sideways, the nav ball will be sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s helpful if you have rovers, landers, space planes, etc that dock in odd directions other than off the front or back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T18:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the control from here option is the way to go.
