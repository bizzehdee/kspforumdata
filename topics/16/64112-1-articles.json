What are the engines with thrusts below 100 kN even good for anyway? I can hardly even get a light payload up to 3000 m/s with my first stage, let alone push it into orbit with a TWR of .26. Also, getting a rocket to have 12000 m/s of delta-V, barely enough to reach orbit, requires something the size of Saturn V at the moment.

I am not expert but the engines with thrust below 100kn are good for orbital maneuvers as they are generally more efficient. Also, are you using the suggested Real Fuels mod? That might help with getting more bang for your buck. you might also try KIDS (Kerbal Isp Difficulty Scaler) which will change the values of stock parts to better fit with RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluechance","CreatedById":78198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T22:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea, I\u0027m using FAR and Real Fuels. Also on a side note, is there anyway to help reduce G forces for capsules on suborbital flights?

If you\u0027re just starting out, send it up with a small amount of RCS for maneuvering and maybe 300 m/s of dV for final orbit adjustments and deorbiting. This payload shouldn\u0027t be more than 15 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen build an upper stage. Find a hydrolox engine designed for orbit (either a J-2, J-2x or a cluster of RL-10s) and set that stage up with 2.5 - 3.5 km/s of dV. It\u0027s initial TWR needs to be ~0.6 to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen build your core stage. Find either a higher thrust hydrolox engine (RS-68A is good for thrust, RS-25D is a little lower but better efficiency) or a good kerolox engine (if you have Bobcat\u0027s Soviet Engines a few NK-33s or one of the RD-171s is good for this). Set it up with enough dV to give you a total of ~9.5 km/s; your TWR will end up below 1, but this is fine, since we\u0027re going to add boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, slap a pair of radial decouplers on and attach StretchySRBs to that. Set them up with decent Isp and a burn time of about 1 - 2 minutes. Increase the size until you get a TWR of 1.6 - 1.7 vacuum (or 1.4 - 1.5 SL). Attach nosecones and sep motors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet up the staging and try that; you should have lots of margin. You don\u0027t need 12 km/s to reach a 300 km orbit unless you\u0027re spending a lot of time burning off prograde. Even then, you can reach a 500 km orbit, doing a 30 degree inclination change in the middle of the orbit with only 10.5 km/s.

But if you\u0027re working with probes, they\u0027re great; that mission above had a final stage that only made 14.3 kN of thrust, but it gave the stage \u002B payload a TWR of 0.3 (initially). The stage before that was a vacuum SRB that made 198 kN and that gave me a TWR of 2.5. You\u0027re probably just building payloads that are too large.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluechance","CreatedById":78198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T23:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem I have with the stretchable SRB\u0027s and super-stretchy tanks is that they\u0027re stuck at a ridiculously low width for some reason and they won\u0027t widen out any.
