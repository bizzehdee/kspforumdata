This is also an easy thing to miss as you glance up at the warp bar you see the two arrows very close together and think it\u0027s one, and in doing so miss the message telling you you are at 5x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T14:26:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility is that if you mouse over the stageing list on the left side of the screen all the controls become inoperative.
