I don\u0027t often post on the forums but now I\u0027ve run into a problem that my google-fu cannot resolve, so I\u0027m hoping one of you can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having major issues trying to dock two ships (or a space station and a ship) side to side. With both docking ports on the side of their respective ships, I have a damn hard time getting a proper alignment. When I control from the docking port, set the target to the opposing docking port and all three dots are aligned on the navball (pro-grade marker, centre of the navall, and target marker), the game still insists on trying to dock the front of the ship to the opposing docking port at an angle. I just realised while typing this post that this is probably because the \u003Cem\u003Eheading\u003C/em\u003E (centre dot on the navball)is always directed by the in-line axis of the ship and therefore should \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E be aligned with the target marker if the docking ports aren\u0027t attached in-line with the ship. Well damn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t solve my problem though: right now when I\u0027m docking side-to-side, I use the navball to get myself to within about 100m. After that I\u0027m forced to eyeball it -which is damn hard-. So do you guys know a way to fully use the navball to dock side to side rather than having to almost purely eyeball it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECirocco\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-07T09:23:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2014 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEDIT: Answered :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T21:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you\u0027re controlling from the appropriate point on the active ship.

I\u0027ve even done it with the ships about 10m apart and stationary in relation to one another to see exactly what happens and what happens when I line up according to the navball when controlling from docking port (and having the appropriate port set as target) is that if I get all three points lined up, the tip of the craft is level with the docking port of the space station, rather than both docking ports being level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ONLY happens when I\u0027m doing docking with the docking port of the ship mounted radially on the side though.
