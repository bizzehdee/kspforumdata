The atmospheric density there limits your terminal velocity to the point where doing the gravity turn early is inefficient and wastes a lot of delta V fighting the air resistance (or more accurately, having to fight gravity more than you should because your airspeed is limited and you can\u0027t get enough upward momentum while also flying at an angle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou simply can\u0027t go faster than a couple hundred m/s in the lower atmosphere, so there\u0027s no point in trying to build up lateral velocity so soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get above 10K, the air gets really thin really fast, so by turning there you can start building up to orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving FAR installed changes the atmosphere of Kerbin to more closely resemble Earth\u0027s atmosphere but at a smaller scale. With that mod, the atmosphere is thinner earlier, but with less of a sudden falloff as you get higher. Starting your gravity turn right off the pad does make a lot of sense in that case and that\u0027s how many people launch rockets with FAR. Note that FAR\u0027s change to the atmosphere makes achieving orbit require less effective deltaV for rockets, essentially making the game easier. If that\u0027s not what you want, there is an ISP adjuster mod you can install to compensate, or you can do what some of us do and add more challenge mods (Deadly Reentry, RemoteTech, etc) to add the difficulty in other places instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Or of course, you can stick with stock, armed with the knowledge of Kerbin\u0027s unique atmosphere and what the most efficient ascent path is for it.

Without throttle control, you need to get out of the lower atmosphere as soon as possible before dynamic pressure builds too much. Larger rockets, especially longer ones that don\u0027t use asparagus staging, are simply more susceptible to transverse aerodynamic stress. Having too large an AoA (Angle of Attack, which is sometimes confused with attitude) when dynamic pressure is high can easily force my rocket into an uncontrollable downward pitch, or even worse shear it apart. Keeping an almost zero angle of attack while turning would solve this by starting the gravity turn very soon after launch before velocity builds, but I usually want to get out of the lower atmosphere ASAP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith large Saturn V-like launch vehicles, I basically start my pitchover maneuver when dynamic pressure (represented by Q in the FAR flight info) drops below a certain threshhold, rather than by a specific altitude. Depending on the rocket, this can vary from 4000m to 16,000m. This allows me to risk a non-zero AoA before my velocity vector lines up with my pitch without tearing apart my rocket. Usually I wait for Q to be under 8000. In real life, large rockets usually wait to break through Q-max before pitching over and beginning their downrange acceleration, which is one reason they don\u0027t begin the gravity turn immediately.

Blackstar, if you haven\u0027t tried out the engine igniter mod or Real Fuels, I highly recommend them if you want to change up how you do your launches. The Real Fuels mod changes engines to have limited throttling, with lower stage engines often only able to burn at 100% power. And the igniter mod limits the amount of ignitions you can do. So you are forced to use pitch as the only real means of speed control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/hijack]\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-20T03:19:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2014 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sternface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul G","CreatedById":101883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T11:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was the booster dropping whilst still going straight up that made me start to question this.

You have gravity losses until the point you get your orbit and only getting lateral speed reduces the gravity losses, so you want to start the gravity turn as early as possible. But when you fly in dense air and have high airspeed you get huge drag, so you want to climb as fast as possible while going really slow. To balance that the optimal solution is keeping just below your terminal velocity, but it is increasing exponentially with you gaining altitude. So the moment to start the gravity turn is when with you flying straight up at current terminal velocity, the terminal velocity starts growing faster than you can accelerate. At this point you don\u0027t need to gain more vertical speed (just ensure it doesn\u0027t drop too fast) and you can afford to start gaining the lateral velocity without losing too much energy to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for going couple degrees off right from the start, that\u0027s done in real life to avoid what happened during the second launch of N1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Runboy","CreatedById":62496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T13:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EIll try to keep this as simple as possible.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk,so in KSP the lower atmosphere is much thicker than Earths,and thus if you start your gravity turn earlier than 10km you will waste Delta V by spending more time trying to push through the thicker lower atmosphere.On the other hand,if you start your gravity turn early on Earth,you will not waste as much DeltaV because the lower atmosphere on Earth is thinner than on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T15:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe goal of optimal ascent is to spend the least amount of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rule-of-thumb for Kerbin is that an efficient ascent to orbit takes about 4500m/s delta-v.
