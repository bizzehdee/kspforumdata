Your original version is gone forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour saved ships live \u0022outside of time\u0022-- they\u0027re not saved with the \u0022state of the world\u0022 file that gets persisted with quicksaves. For example, if you do this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do a quicksave\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Create a new ship in the VAB and save it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

If you want to do some \u0022what if\u0022 experimentation, load up the original and then immediately re-save it with a different name, like \u0022Test\u0022. Now you can tinker to your heart\u0027s content without worrying about farbling your original.

However, I expect you\u0027d need to do a certain amount of tinkering to get it from \u0022instance of a ship\u0022 format to \u0022ship design\u0022 format, not sure if that would end up being more trouble than it\u0027s worth (and may be involved enough that you\u0027d need some sort of script to do it). So the verdict on that is \u0022likely technically possible, but no idea how hard it would be in practice.\u0022 My guess is that it would be easiest just to take your munged version and try to edit it back to something usable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T21:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe very careful not to overwrite your quicksave.
