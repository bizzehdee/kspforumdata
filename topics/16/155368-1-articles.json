When you launch a rocket, it has to be controlled, of course. So it needs a kerbal in a pod, or a probe core. Once you are in orbit, you decouple the stuff that\u0027s meant to go into the station. As said above, a spacetug can push the station parts into place, so they don\u0027t explicitly need to have a probe core and an engine.
