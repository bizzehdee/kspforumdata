With one exception: when you have a \u0022grazing\u0022 encounter with Mun on your way out to somewhere else, the ship path will bounce back and forth between \u0022encounter\u0022 and \u0022no encounter\u0022 and the resultant orbits will bounce accordingly. (Also happens when you leave the SOI of any planet/moon but with JUST enought delta-V to escape - you keep getting recaptured and escaping.) Usually clears up as you move along.

The problem there is mostly due to the apparent fact that for orbit prediction, KSP does not use the current position and velocity of the center of mass of your craft. It uses the data from the part that is controlling the ship. So while you rotate or your ship or if it suffers from internal oscillations, those values vary, leading to different predictions. \u003Cp\u003EOnly remedy: be content with planning only a rough intercept from far away, do correction burns as go get closer.

Recently when doing a Duna encounter when I was already out of kerbins SOI it was bouncing between around 390,000 and 480,000km periapsis around Duna.

I have had it bounce around. Looks like it is most likely be a floating point problem. Where the end value is just right inbetween the tic and the toc. I do agree it does not happen often.
