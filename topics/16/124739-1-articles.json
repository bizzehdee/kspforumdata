That way, you\u0027ll have lower reentry speed, meaning also less heat for your tug. Also, when landing it, make sure to aim for about 30km periapsis at your first pass to let the atmosphere do most of the braking for you. Drogue parachutes help as well, as long as you have one available. Class A is pretty small, so you won\u0027t have match trouble imo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T22:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAttach many parachutes (you can use a claw with a small RCS tank, SAS, 4 thrusters and a bunch of chutes to attach huge amounts) and split them into as many action groups as possible to reduce then instantaneous force.
