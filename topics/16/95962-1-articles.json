After lots of modifications to my own planes and different ascendance tactics I found out that the control loss happens only when engine intake air gets below 100%. In the many tutorials I read this problem doesnt get mentioned at all and people fly their planes up to regions of 30% intake air availability.

Somewhere between 26-28km the plane gets unstable: it drifts left/right or tries to roll. I see control options trying to counteract this, but even with counter steering from myself it quickly becomes impossible to hold the plane and I get into a stall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor giggles a screenshot from two flight attempts when my plane is starting to lose control.

Dropping your overall throttle causes both engines to consume less and brings them back in balance. Any jet which has 2 engines or more will have this problem even when very closely stacked. The only solution is to throttle back, or use one engine. You can delay this from happening until higher altitudes by using more air intakes, but only ram intakes and shock cones are very effective at above about 25K meters. Personally, I find this choking mechanism a good reason to justify only ever using one turbojet. The single turbojet will slowly drop off on its own without throwing you into the spin because the thrust isn\u0027t imbalanced. However, to max performance of a single turbojet you can still start cutting back on the throttle after around 30k feet to keep it from flaming out and prolong its ability to burn, just at a lower rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther solutions are to use a mix of jets and rockets and once the jets start chocking turn off all but the centerline jet until your last remaining engine cuts out and then kick in the rockets to punch you out of atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T03:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs above: it\u0027s asymmetric thrust due to one jet flaming out before the other.
