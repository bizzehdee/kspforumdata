This means I have to wait until I get to my perigee and burn retrograde, but when I do that the perigee decreases as well, on and on until by the time I\\\u0027ve got a satisfying orbit I\\\u0027ve used up more than double the fuel it would take if I got it circularized on the first try. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what am I doing wrong? Mechjeb and the like make circularization look so much easier than it is, and even when I mimic it perfectly this happens. Can anyone give me some tips on how to circularize more effectively? I\\\u0027m trying to break out of my habit of using Mechjeb for everything; I can get to the Mun, land and get back without it, but this simple orbit has me puzzled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T21:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to the map view and bring up the navball there so you can control the ship from the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen during launch, do your gravity turn normally but watch your apoapsis on the map view; cut your engine when apoapsis reaches the altitude you want.

Make sure you are in the map view. If it starts to move away, angle either up or down in the same plane as your orbit until it is right on top of you. Keep burning and turning until the orbit is nice and circular. You never need to cut the engines or even reduce the throttle if you are careful enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
