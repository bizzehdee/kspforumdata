In my stockish install there is a mod that provides easy access to the SAS feedback mechanism via contect menu on any command module. I don\u0027t know which mod brough that feature, but it\u0027s priceless: using SmartASS to give the directions and the tweaked SAS to do it, I can control planes quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ve gotten myself RSS\u002BRO which also comes with FAR, but without said mod. I\u0027m still struggling with keeping a plane in the air for more than a few minutes. The plane itself is rather kind, as long as I want to go straight it will fly well enough without any assistance. However, with WASD controls it\u0027s quite tedious and only a question of time until I mess up. Getting a flight stick is out of the question. Using SmartASS works in a fashion, but there\u0027s constant flutter that never quite settles down and sooner or later escalates without any apparent reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some FAR modules for mechjeb, but I don\u0027t notice any improvement -- if anything, it\u0027s become worse.
