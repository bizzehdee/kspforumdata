It started innocently enough with me trying to figure out a feat I was having difficulty with in KSP but had done fairly easily in Orbiter (by modding config files), which is launching a shuttle on a normal rocket stack. They tended to flip and destabilize somewhere around 5K up on ascent. So, I started the Nastybird project to develop a shuttle that could do so and land on the runway, sort of like a medium-scale replica of NASA\u0027s own shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of tweaking later I had something fun that I was happy with. It could either transport 4 Kerbals (plus pilot and copilot) or a medium-sized satellite/probe to LKO and either rendezvous with a space station or launch its probe. The real problem was making a launcher that worked aerodynamically with the shuttle, that that pretty much meant making it like a badminton shuttlecock - ridiculous drag on the back end. Of course, you had to compensate with high TWR and loads of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen figuring out the launcher I tried many things, but yesterday I tried something different, and gave the shuttle two liquid boosters, one dorsal and one ventral (are those terms appropriate for planes?). I have to say that this method of launching is much more aerodynamically stable in the lower atmosphere than most of my other attempts at boosters. (also have to add that I\u0027m playing stock aero so... keep that in mind)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EaZh9nw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EaZh9nw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat novel methods have you guys come up with?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T18:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I don\u0027t have a picture of it, but I made a shuttle once by making a Mk1 FAR rocket plane, imported it to the VAB (it was in 0.25 or 0.24), and put radial onion boosters around it in three-way symmetry (the ventral booster was centered so that the dorsal ones were left and right of the vertical stabilizer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt only needed one extra stage to reach orbit and flew rather well on re-entry (CoM and DCoM were basically on top of each other).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was my most recent \u0022stack shuttle\u0022 launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O0oDcNe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022O0oDcNe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DCvsMid.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DCvsMid.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fly-back booster performed the departure burn and then looped back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5r8TE4K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225r8TE4K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3U93tFh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223U93tFh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload fell down a hole... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4PAYe4W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224PAYe4W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vjn7p0O.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Vjn7p0O.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T21:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI launched my shuttle like a shuttle.
