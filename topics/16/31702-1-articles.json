You\u0027ll probably want to start simple, with a hitchhiker pod and some fuel tanks, adding rovers and more \u0027buildings\u0027 as you see fit. You can either try to make a big connected structure through docking, or simply try landing your buildings all in the same area. That can be challenging, so be sure to quicksave your flight before you try to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d suggest is that you go into the space plane hanger and make the buildings for your base as you\u0027d want it to look on the ground, and then think about how you\u0027d get it up into space and then back down onto the Mun safely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t sure how to make a heavy lifter, then you\u0027ll probably want to figure out asparagus staging. For heavy loads, you\u0027ll want to use mainsail engines, possibly using the skipper engine for circularizing. Lifters are extensively covered in various tutorials, and once you understand what\u0027s going on, you\u0027ll be pushing the wildest designs into space. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking is another big topic that has been well-covered by others, but I\u0027ll try to give a quick summary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, get something into orbit, and try to get the periapsis and apoapsis at about the same distance to make your orbit as circular as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest a 160Km orbit, so you don\u0027t have to render Kerbin\u0027s surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, get your second ship into orbit, select the thing you want to dock with, and try to get your periapsis aligned in both altitude and location (by burning at the periapsis of the first craft\u0027s orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen get your ascending/descending nodes as close to zero as you can (by burning at the nodes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, since your apoapsis should be slightly higher or lower than that of the other craft, each time the two craft make a complete orbit, they\u0027ll get closer or further away from each other, like the hands on a clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re within ~10km (closer is better, but make sure you don\u0027t crash!), your navball should be set on \u0027target\u0027, which gives you the prograde and retrograde (green circle with a dot, green circle with an x) markers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is burn retrograde when you\u0027re close, to slow the ships down relative to each other. When you\u0027ve gotten that to near 0, you then look for the pink circle with a dot in it and burn towards that dot. That\u0027ll move you closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternate burning retrograde with burning towards the ship you wish to dock with, and switch to RCS once you\u0027re within 150 meters. Make sure you drift on in as slow as you can! You\u0027ll need to line up the docking ports, and that can be very tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to what rovers need: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey need wheels, a control module/probe/seat, batteries, and some way of getting more power, either solar panels or reactors. You can add on other bits as well, sensors and such, but for now, just play around on Kerbin to see what works! Use struts to make sure everything is on nice and steady.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S\u1D04\u026A\u0274\u1D1B\u026A\u029F\u029F\u1D00\u1D1B\u1D0F\u0280","CreatedById":69027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T21:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EConsider downloading the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-h-o-m-e-start-kit/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EH.O.M.E mod \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003E and the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/23979-Kethane-Pack-0-4-4-Compatible-with-0-20-2-plus-balancing-changes%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EKethane mod\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003E, they make base construction a little more worthwhile.
