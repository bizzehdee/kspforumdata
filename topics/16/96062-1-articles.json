Sorry if this has already been posted and answered a million times, but I\u0027d like to know how to stop it from happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy game has crashed a few times during gameplay (building, crashing stuff, etc.) and when I launch it, it won\u0027t let me click the \u0027load\u0027 button until I fix it. If I just move the file that got corrupted (the one I was playing when the game crashed) to a separate folder, it solves the problem however this means I lose my builds. While I haven\u0027t lost anything I\u0027m really attached to yet I\u0027m pretty terrified that\u0027s eventually going to happen. Is there any way to stop this or fix corrupted saves?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T00:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using any mods, as they can often be the source of problems?
