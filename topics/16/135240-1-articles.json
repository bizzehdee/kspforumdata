How do you get away with having engines mounted high above the center of mass without having much torque from the engine?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T02:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look closely at a drawing of an A10, the actual thrust vector from the engines isn\u0027t actually that high off the centreline of the aircraft. The intakes are higher (mainly for survival purposes: it\u0027s very hard to hit the intakes from the ground because they are just above the highly-armoured wing, above and behind if the A10 in question happens to be coming to say hello to you and your tanks) but the jet exhaust is significantly lower and directed straight back, not down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, the A10\u0027s arrangement is not the most efficient, and it probably relies on the significant lift of its wings to help stability under high thrust, but the A10 as a whole was made for survival and extreme maneuverability at low speeds, and the elevators being positioned just under the jet exhaust probably multiplies that maneuverability and control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikewise with big jets: the engines and the central fuel tank are the heaviest bits of the plane, and so they are not that far at all from the centre of mass. I would assume that at maximum thrust this will tend to push the nose up, but that also seems to be pretty much desirable behaviour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T02:52:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 02:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork","CreatedById":160881,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T04:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had first hand experience wih A-10s, and I\u0027ve wondered blut the placement of the engines as well, but looking at pictures of it, the engines are actually very close to being in line with he (presumed) center of mass. If you\u0027re using pylons, I\u0027d put them closer to\u00A0the middle of the fuselage (very slightly off above) and at a very slight angle upward. The tops of the engines of the real A-10 are only very slightly above the top of the fuselge. I hope that description made sense!
