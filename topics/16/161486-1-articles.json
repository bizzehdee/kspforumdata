your flight path has you pointing a few degrees east and then forcibly turning your rocket to forty-five degrees at ten kilometres altitude, then you can get some more efficiency out of it by taking a smoother ascent. \u00A0If possible, you can help yourself a lot by letting the rocket turn slightly but constantly so that you start a few degrees east (as you do) and then sweep through the angle so that you happen to be pointing at forty-five degrees at about ten kilometres altitude. \u00A0By the time you reach thirty kilometres, you should be pointing almost horizontally. \u00A0Those points are just rough thumb rules, though, so don\u0027t feel the need to go crazy over them, and a lot will depend on the rocket itself. \u00A0If you design it correctly, the rocket can actually fly itself to orbit with nothing more than a little nudge at the beginning (to point it the first few degrees east) and a bit of throttle control (to keep your apoapsis the right distance\u00A0ahead of you). \u00A0That\u0027s a true gravity turn, and there are a few example craft scattered about the spacecraft exchange and tutorials to show you how to make a rocket that can do this--though you\u0027re honestly fairly\u00A0close with what you have.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the Scott Manley videos also mentions switching to map view occasionally and keeping your apoapsis roughly a minute ahead of you until you\u0027re almost circularised. \u00A0This advice is still good and can help you see what you want the trajectory to do. \u00A0Having it widen is a good thing because it means that you\u0027re raising your periapsis and making an orbit rather than a dive-bomb. \u00A0One of the things to remember about orbits is that the key is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehorizontal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0velocity, not vertical velocity. \u00A0The thing that keeps you in the sky is not going\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0but rather, in the words of XKCD, \u0027going sideways really fast\u0027. \u00A0When you start off you need to go up a little because you have to get off the ground, get out of the atmosphere, and fight gravity for long enough that you can build up enough horizontal velocity that you don\u0027t need to fight gravity any more, but in order to save fuel and effort, you also need to start tapering off the vertical\u00A0component in favour of the horizontal one right away--which is what you do when you nudge it a few degrees east and sweep through the turn. \u00A0When you get to landing on and returning from Mun and Minmus you\u0027ll find that you can take off and then turn nearly horizontally almost as soon as you leave the ground, so you\u0027re actually learning the more difficult ascent first,
