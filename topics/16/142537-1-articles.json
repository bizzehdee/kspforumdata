I checked the astronaut complex and Sidnie Kerman was killed in action but it doesn\u0027t say when or how. Is there a way to find out what vessel he was on and where it was? I know: I\u0027ll search old save files for his name. It really ought to tell me when this happens though IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Okay, I\u0027ve found him on a collision course with Ike. I really think KSP should warn people of unfavourable encounters such as this. You would\u0027ve thought Sidnie might call home and ask for guidance. Frankly he doesn\u0027t deserve it but I\u0027m going to try to bring him back by copying and pasting his vessel into my current save and see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2: I\u0027ve brought the ship back and changed Sidnie from Dead to Assigned. I used Hyperedit to put him in some orbit around Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-26T18:58:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2016 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
