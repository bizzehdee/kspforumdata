Valentina and Bill managed to bail out of the cockpit at around 500m, then soften the impact with their jetpacks. Both of them survived.\n\nThey\u0027d been separated a bit during the crash, but they were close enough together to shift control between them with the bracket keys. So, I switched to Bill, planted a flag to commemorate the crash, and recovered him. Then I went back to the tracking station: no Valentina. I switch to the flag: again, no Valentina anywhere nearby.\n\nGoing to the Astronaut Complex, Valentina is listed under the lost Kerbals tab. But whereas the previously memorialized Kerbals are all described as \u0022killed in action\u0022, Valentina is \u0022missing in action\u0022.\n\nAnyone run into this before? Gameplay mechanic or bug?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T06:50:23Z","Content":"Missing in action appears when you have the difficulty option \u0022missing Crew respawn\u0022 on.
