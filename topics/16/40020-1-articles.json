It seems that rockets seem to be more likely to randomly break up during, or sometimes even before, launch, even if the decouplers are reinforced. One some other occesion radially mounted boosters (using the TT-70 decoupler) just randomly came off on launchpad, requiring far more stuts than in 0.20 to remain fixed. As one can imagine, all these random catastrophic mission failures are getting rather annoying (What are rockets good for if you cannot get a simple jumbo fuel tank into LKO?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T06:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved this to the gameplay questions forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klingon Admiral","CreatedById":69090,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T06:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThen there shall be picture(s):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0O094bn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0O094bnl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220O094bnl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission record of this launcher so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 1: Sucess\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 2: Structural failure at decoupler designated \u00221\u0022 during early ascent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 3: Structural failure at decoupler \u00221\u0022 after gravity turn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 4: Structural failure at decoupler \u00222\u0022 during early ascent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 5: Structural failure at decoupler \u00221\u0022 during early ascent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 6: Sucess\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunches 1-4 were in my KSP main installation with mods, launches 5 and 6 in a vanilla installation.

The big grating under the rocket has issues. It\u0027s flexible and areas of it have clipping problems, allowing parts to sink partway through it. Neither effect is very consistent in either happening at all or in amount when it does, but both happen fairly often. I believe the inconsistency is due to rockets not spawning in exactly the same spot each launch, so they touch different parts of the grating, just a few pixels this way or that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, your rocket spawns, then physics kicks in and it does a \u0022drop test\u0022 onto the grating. It could be that the flexibility of the grating is intended to cushion this blow, but it doesn\u0027t bend uniformly. So, depending on luck of the draw with where the launch supports and/or rocket itself touch the grating, different parts of the rocket experience different amounts of cushioning during the \u0022drop test\u0022. Also, some parts might actually sink through the grating a bit, amplifying the oscillations caused by the \u0022drop test\u0022 or at least changing the direction of the net force of physics start experienced by the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember, physics start applies what is in effect an impact load. Parts that can withstand a given force if gradually applied can fail if that force is applied all at once. Depending on how the forces angle and oscillate from the dodgy Launchpad, you might get no damage, or certain parts (usually those in expected weak areas like separators, docking ports, and body diameter changes) could fail. Sometimes it\u0027s something vital and the whole rocket collapses on the pad. Sometimes it\u0027s just a strut or 2 that fails and you only find out when you try to do the gravity turn. And sometimes either nothing breaks at all or you have enough structural redundancy there that it doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if your rocket is breaking a lot and you don\u0027t think it should because it\u0027s essentially the same rocket you\u0027ve launched 1000 times before no problem, try moving the launch supports around, so they don\u0027t touch the grating in the same place. Either move them to different parts of the rocket or change their angle of contact with the rocket. It could be that one of them is frequently touching one of the bad spots on the grating so moving it might give it a better footing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T15:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have similar adventures but they were also present in 0.20 so I don\u0027t see them as new.\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I blame most of them on the Launchpad itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t say what you describe is a not issue.
