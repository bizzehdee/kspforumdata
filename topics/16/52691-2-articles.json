When you are in orbit, the force of friction isn\u0027t acting on your vessel. The rotation of the planet isn\u0027t acting on your vessel. Therefore there is no extra force to cancel. Thus, there is no additional fuel consumed to land from orbit. When you are taking off from a planet, you inherit the planets rotational speed because you are on the surface. As soon as you leave that surface, that surface no longer is causing any force that is acting on you, but you are still moving at the surface speed in the horizontal direction, but you don\u0027t notice it because both you and the surface are moving at the same speed. When you launch from a planet you are already going at the speed of the rotation. This means that your horizontal velocity while stationary on the surface of Kerban is equal to it\u0027s rotational speed of 174 m/s.
