Not a piloted rover though. I\u0027ve never been to a planet yet but want to use a rover to explore the deserty awesomeness of Duna! The problem is, I just have no clue how to get a rover into orbit. I can make a rover, and it can drive good, just can\u0027t get it off the ground. Any tips would be appreciated, especially download links to a rover INCLUDING the launch parts and stages.
