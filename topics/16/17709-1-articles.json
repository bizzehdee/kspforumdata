The whole idea of a real spaceplane (as I understand it) is to use air-breathing engines and wing generated lift to save a lot of rocket fuel on the way to where rockets are required, so that\u0027s how I want to do it. Even if that works in the game, it feels like cheating to me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturestar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venturestar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Venturestar was an proposed SSTO craft that was undergoing research until a couple of years ago.

On the subject of technical matters, it sounds like aerospikes are effective in vacuum? I\u0027ve read about them a little, but that part isn\u0027t clear to me. If they use the air flow around the engine to form something similar to an engine bell, wouldn\u0027t they expend force in useless directions in vacuum? And in the game, does greater wing area increase the altitude the plane can attain, or just its lifting capacity?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
