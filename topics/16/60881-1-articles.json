I have 120 science ready to go but when I move my Bob from the lander to the orbiter I see the science is still in the landing can. I do not see an obvious way to transfer it to the orbiter vessel which is designed for re-entry. The lander is designed to just burn up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to move stored science from one ship to another while docked?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not I guess will have to park it in orbit and make some kind of landing apparatus to dock with it and bring it down safely to Kerban...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-24T00:37:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2014 12:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by dellcom1800\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T23:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, while in EVA, you should bee able to right click on your lander pod (as well as any instruments or experiments you have attached) and store the data with your kerbal.
