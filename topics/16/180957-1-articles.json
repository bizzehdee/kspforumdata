It\u0027s not exactly the same button mapping as on the console. And you need to use a\u00A0USB cord on the controller I think -- I don\u0027t think there\u0027s an easy way to make the controller\u0027s bluetooth work on PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne caveat though -- for some nutty reason, many older versions of Windows (Win7) do not have any drivers available that will recognize and run a new xbox controller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you have an xbox controller plugged into a usb port and you load the game through steam, there is something called the Steam Controller driver that gets loaded. The Steam Controller can use an xbox controller or a PS4 controller as a substitute. It\u0027s a little tricky to activate, though. There\u0027s a little icon on the Steam Client that looks like a controller. Click that and you get into the controller setup. You have to activate it there, and it should show you all the game controllers that are hooked to your PC for you to select one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve done all that, there should be a couple button mapping presets available. One should act a lot like the Cursor Preset on the console. The other one should have pretty much every single function in the PC version mapped to somewhere on the controller. The mappings can\u0027t be exact, because there is only one \u0022modifier\u0022 button available (instead of 2 on the xbox) and no radial menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne nice thing is that using the Steam Controller setup, you can completely customize your button mappings to suit yourself, and save it as a new configuration. Each button that you press\u00A0gets converted into a keyboard keystroke -- so it\u0027s not possible to use the controller to do anything you can\u0027t do with the keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-29T02:46:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2018 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-29T03:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play this way exclusively with an xbox one controller and have been since version\u00A0 .24 or something like that.
