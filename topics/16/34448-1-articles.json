I end up turning off angle snap, carefully inching my way pixel by pixel to try to get proper placement, then cursing in frustrating as the girder I\u0027m trying to place flips to some arbitrary angle. I\u0027ve tried placing where I can, then disconnecting, rotating, and reconnecting, but that\u0027s a bunch of trial and error for what should be trivial. It should not be hard to place girders at right angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T16:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAngle snap usually snaps to either the ends or the middle, anything inbetween and it won\u0027t work too well. If you want a right angle at two ends then anglesnap them end to end then rotate with WASD. If you want to connect to somewhere between the end and middle, anglesnap onto the side and then rotate 5 degrees at a time until it\u0027s at a right angle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
