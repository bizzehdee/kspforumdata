Okay, so I wasn\u0027t just seeing things before. Now I just need to determine what mod is hiding/masking that feature. FAR was adding info to the right-click that I then disabled. At the very least I know it\u0027s a usable feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikely a combination of FAR and spaceplane parts, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[uPDATE] Some minor testing seems to indicate FAR completely. Right clicking a control surface only shows the stall % with it installed.
