It works at the highest point of your orbit to have the maximum effect on your periapsis. This is because you are going sideways relative to the planet and therefore not being effected by gravity. Basically, you are just adding or removing velocity, without having to fight gravity. You\u0027ll also notice this if, when in orbit, you go into your pod and look at the vertical speedometer. It will read 0. This is because you are only moving sideways relative to the source of gravity, and are not really being \u0022pulled\u0022 by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The apoapsis and periapsis are the most efficient places to burn because, like above, you are not fighting against gravity. Burning at the periapsis is best for raising your orbit, while apoapsis burning is good for lowering your orbit. Anything before or after and you are fighting against gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this was at all confusing, please let me know and I\u0027d be happy to try and explain it differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T08:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) apollo was retrograde, for some reason it would make landings easier however I have no idea how.

This is because a small change in kinetic energy yields a larger change in velocity, ergo more for less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) At apoapsis you are moving slower and therefore don\u0027t need to lose as much velocity to lower periapsis. Try setting up a situation where you have a 100km by 1000km orbit, and then try lowering the opposite node to 50km.

If you pass around the far side of the Moon in a prograde direction, the gravity assist would reduce your eccentricity, raising your perigee (Earth Pe) away from the Earth. By passing the far side retrograde (although you are still technically moving prograde in regards to the Earth at apogee, simply more slowly than the Moon is moving prograde), the Moon\u0027s gravity increases your eccentricity, dropping your perigee back down into the Earth\u0027s atmosphere... unless you make a burn at pericynthion (Moon Pe) to enter lunar orbit.

When you apply force to an object, the force doesn\u0027t alter the object\u0027s starting point, it merely changes where the object is going. If you could throw a ball hard enough that its high point (the apoapsis) would be on the opposite side of the planet (we\u0027ll pretend there is no air to slow it down), the ball would circle around and come right back to you. Throw it harder, and the Ap just keeps getting higher and higher, while the Pe (where you are standing) stays the same.
