I\u0027m very much a beginner, and sort of screwed up. Got a space station into place, had Jeb all set for his return trip in a capsule, when I realize I had an engine with no fuel. I realized this AFTER I had separated the capsule from the space station to return to Kerbin. Long story short, I did a space walk with Jeb over to the space station, but now I can\u0027t get him into the lander module where I was going to have him wait for rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s currently hovering outside the space station with 11% jetpack fuel left, about 20km from the module. Is it possible to enter a lander can while in flight? Or should I try to get him back to the command module?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods installed are Mechjeb (training wheels) and the Kethane mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T21:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe meticulous.
