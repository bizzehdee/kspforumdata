It\u0027s actually a ship, a science space station and a science rover, all on the same rocket. The issue I have is that there are not enough custom action groups (CAGs) to cover all the things i need to do on all three craft. I had a few ideas for workarounds but was wondering if anyone could save me some time and maybe explain how things work behind the scenes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d considered that building the science station and science rover as separate craft, configuring the CAGs and then merging them with the main rocket might store the CAG configuration for later when they separated and became independent spacecraft again, but I don\u0027t know if KSP is that sophisticated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also unsure of the exact behavior of the preset action groups (PAGs). I know that the game automatically adds things like toggles for landing gear and lights to the appropriate groups, but even when there is nothing visible in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E action group, it toggles all relevant devices on/off. Does it only do this when nothing is explicitly added to that group or will it always do that in addition to the actions added to it. Do any other action groups act that way, as well, such as Stage? I just don\u0027t want to find out mid-mission that activating the Stage action group will blow off a stage in addition to whatever other actions I configured in that action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any insight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-04T06:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe preset action groups perform default actions\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ein addition to\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0any that you assign.

You saved me a lot of testing, which is a huge pain on console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy only remaining concern is what would happen if I were to assign the toggle for both the landing struts of the main rocket and the small landing gear for the rover to the same action group. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s been patched, but I heard about a bug where doing such a thing procs both actions even after the two craft are separated. I assume if it\u0027s still an issue it would only do it if they are within physics distance of each other. Or even worse, the sub-vessel doesn\u0027t inherit the action groups of the parent vessel, minus the devices it\u0027s no longer attached to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy actual use of this (on craft with science experiments..which is almost everything) is to use CAG 1 for running every experiment on the vessel. If I were to test this on my current rocket, I\u0027d have to do that for both the science station and the science rover and hope it only runs the experiments attached to the currently controlled vessel. Although if this bug is still present I\u0027m sure this \u0022spooky action at a distance\u0022 could be exploited somehow. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0026amp;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 title=\u0022\u0026amp;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-04T11:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, even on console (at least with the proper preset) you have fairly quick access to 10 custom action groups. So that really should be enough for most things. And you shouldn\u0027t need to assign the landing legs to the \u0022gear\u0022 group -- that should happen automatically, I think. That bug has never existed on the PC version that I know of ... so if it ever happened on consoles, then it\u0027s exclusive to consoles and the rest of us would never know about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
