The six radials are asparagus staged and work perfectly fine, I tested them and the fuel flows correctly. Now here is where things go wrong; I added six SRBs on the outside of the radials and on top of those I added fuel tanks, the idea being to feed fuel from these into the radials before the SRBs putter out. I tried asapargus-ing the fuel from the SRB-mounted tanks, but when I do this it mucks up the fuel flow completely with tanks from the inner radials draining when they shouldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GoeeeKO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GoeeeKO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BmnJ6Vp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BmnJ6Vp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1OkNvAG.png\u0022 alt=\u00221OkNvAG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies for the crude drawing, but you can see where I\u0027m going with this.

But I think it\u0027s because when the engine asks for fuel, only the parts connected by stacking and fuel lines can answer. When it finds a fuel tank, then that tank starts asking around for fuel (in a stack and fuel lines) with the previous part in a chain (here engine) excluded. Then the next found fuel tanks asks again and the cycle repeats until there is no more fuel tanks available. It\u0027s a fail safe process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem occurs when we introduce parts that aren\u0027t fuel tanks or fuel lines, but can create a stacking connection with the previous parts. Now at this point the system starts searching for any fuel tank, not only through fuel line and next in a stack part but also radially. This can start only on a part that doesn\u0027t have (relevant) fuel on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there is also another problem of creating a loop. That is the radial connections and fuel lines must create a loop, and for standard designs it rarely happens since fuel lines and radial decouplers are usually connected to the same parts, creating only a \u0022double flow\u0022 system and not an actual loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL DR\u003C/strong\u003E: for a bug to occur, there needs to be a part without fuel but connected in a stack with a fuel tank, AND radial decouplers need to be connected to different parts than fuel lines creating an actual loops and not just double flow systems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laughing Man","CreatedById":67907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T07:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere is a post from a year ago i made on the problem: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42578-0-21-1-Fuel-flow-not-symmetrical?p=547501\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post547501\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E - there is a picture describing the fuel flow.

I moved the outer fuel lines from the liquid fuel tanks to the SRBs. To my utter bewilderment and disbelief the outer tanks drained exactly as they should, one after another just as the asparagus staging was designed for it to do. Unfortunately the old problem cropped up again and the top 2 tanks of the last 2 asparagus stages started draining slowly.
