I built a nice little test space plane. But until functionality is added to turn off rocket engines, just like air engines, I need to decouple my main engine when I re-enter the planet. But here\\\u0027s the problem. I assumed fuel transferred through the decoupler, like the tri-decoupler. But when I got high enough that my air engines cut out and tried to turn on my main engine, I got nothing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Rocket engine sputtered once then wouldn\\\u0027t turn on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy space plane is very small. So I need to find a minimalistic way to get fuel to my engine. I assume I should run some fuel lines to it, but.. so far I can\\\u0027t figure it out. I tried running fuel lines directly to the decoupler, didn\\\u0027t work. Tried running it directly to the rocket engine, but I\\\u0027m unsure that\\\u0027s allowed.
