And what had happened?\n\n-\u003E We started actually from low Kerbin orbit, without going to Minmus first. Why?\n\n1. Using Mechjeb to plan the trip, both Hohmann and porkchop selection does not work in Minmus SOI (transfer calculation needs both bodies having the same \u0022parent\u0022 body). Bummer.\n\n2. Flying to Minmus, topping off fuel, then dropping to highly elliptical Kerbin orbit for interplanetary burn takes a long time (2days from Minmus back to PE at Kerbin) -\u003E does not seem practical\n\n3. Flying to Minmus, topping off fuel, then burn to get Kerbin escape trajectory, then calculate transfer via porkchop or Hohmann -\u003E possible, but sounds risky (would you board a craft when the mission plan says \u0022just burn to Sun orbit, then we\u0027ll see what we can do...\u0022 ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)???)\n\nSo,how can I make my beloved Minmus fuel stop useful?\n\nThanks for all suggestions!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T17:33:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheDog**\n  \nanswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T16:40:13Z","Content":"I would use tankers to bring the fuel for refueling your interplanetary stuff down to LKO from the station.

Has the advantage that you don\u0027t need 1000m/s dV to escape Kerbin.

Flying to Minmus, topping off fuel, then dropping to highly elliptical Kerbin orbit for interplanetary burn takes a long time (2days from Minmus back to PE at Kerbin) -\u003E does not seem practical\n\nThe only trick is that you need to time your exit burn from Minmus so that your Kerbin Pe is in the right location for your exit burn. This strategy can save you ~ 750 m/s dV for escape burns. Not all that necessary for Trans-Duna or Trans-Eve injections, but for destinations more distant it can be useful.\n\nAlso, lower orbits for refueling stations may be more useful. 80 km is pretty high."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T17:27:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I see... so the consensus seems to be towards shipping fuel down to LKO.\n\u003E My only grip with that is, that it takes about 2 kerbin days for the tanker to arrive there and rendezvous...\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t be doing this less than about two weeks prior to transfer.
