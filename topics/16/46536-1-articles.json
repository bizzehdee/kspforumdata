And I do not want to manually put it back on the rocket because sometimes you get a new rotation that sends struts to places that will crash the rocket once on the launch pad. Like a \u0022new\u0022 strut with an angle that now hooks to the red launch stabilizers, which ends up in a pretty failure at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the developers, I would like to see things changed in the VAB:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) That lime green color that parts turn when you hover over it, please change that to the dark blue you get when you select something in the action group mode. I think that will be easier to see what section is really selected. (old eyes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sometimes when selecting load/save/launch while the rocket is zoomed in (in your face mode) and the rocket is actually behind the buttons, you\u0027ll grab the rocket instead of hitting the button resulting in the problem that this thread describes. Sometimes this happens behind the parts menu too. Those areas need to be XOR\u0027d out or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) There needs to be an absolute easy way to overcome the problem I first brought up in this thread. I swear I have seen videos on Youtube where they were doing what I want. Oops! I didn\u0027t want to take that off. And whatever they do, in an instant the part is back where it came from. They are not waiting on the \u0022undo cycle\u0022.
