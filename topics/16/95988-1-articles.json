If not, and you also don\u0027t want it to remain part of the launching ship, then you should use the blue stack decouplers instead of separators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you want the decoupler to be part of the missile, you have to make sure it\u0027s pointed in the correct direction. All separators have a red triangle on them. When activated, they separate on the side with the point of the triangle and stick to whatever\u0027s attached on the side with the base of the triangle. This means that if your missile is on top of the launcher, you want to flip the separator upside down so the tip of the triangle points at the launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the easiest way to make a TR-2V missile battery is to turn the TR-2V upside down and attach 2 Sepratrons to it horizontally, pointing in the same direction. Make sure the TR-2V and the Sepratrons are in the same stage. When that stage is fired, the TR-2V comes loose and the Sepratrons push it off horizontally at high speed, which is the missile. It\u0027s a disc instead of a long, pointy thing, but it works very well. Then you can copy and paste as many such 3-part assemblies on top of each other as desired and arrange the staging so they activate from the top of the stack to the bottom. Voila, a multi-shot missile battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do all sorts of fun stuff this way. For example, if you put the Sepratrons on facing opposite directions, and angle them up very slightly, you can making pretty fireworks. Now the thing will rise vertically fairly slowly while the Sepratrons spin it rapidly, as shown here (all the little flying pinwheels between the big stuff):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnxxnQ2myKI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make a pointy missile, a good way is to use the \u0022Pocket Edition\u0022 I-beam. Put as many Sepratrons on it as desired all parallel to the I-beam, and attach the I-beam to a blue stack separator. Again, the Septratrons and the separator are on the same stage. However, pointy missiles don\u0027t work that great. A better option is to use the short, wide I-beam horizontally with a Sepratron on each end, so it\u0027s like a flying razor blade.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jman508","CreatedById":122550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T20:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei know your problem your sepratrons aren\u0027t in the same stage as the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen an object without capsule or robot core is disconnected form one with one of those things it becomes static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas in it will still have physics (within the 2.5 km range) but you can\u0027t can\u0027t control them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso in a nut shell your missile thrusters have to be in the same stage as your decoupler, if its that type of missle\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
