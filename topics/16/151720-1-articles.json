I have managed to do this at Mach 1 so far on Kerbin, but want to try it on a lower-gravity place. The main issue I am having is that physics only enables on the ramp when I get very close to it, which on Kerbin gravity didn\u0027t do a whole lot but in\u00A0lower gravity the traditional \u0027hop\u0027 of physics turning on is much more pronounced. My ramp ends up being a meter off the ground at the critical time, completely unable to be driven up,\u00A0and the only solution would be to alter when physics begins to apply to the ramp or go way slower (not acceptable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked in the files and found Physics.CFG, with code like this at the end..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nVesselRanges\n{\n\tprelaunch\n\t{\n\t\tload = 2250\n\t\tunload = 2500\n\t\tpack = 350\n\t\tunpack = 200\n\t}\n\tlanded\n\t{\n\t\tload = 2250\n\t\tunload = 2500\n\t\tpack = 350\n\t\tunpack = 200\n\t}\n...\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really thought I was onto the winner here, but\u00A0editing this to greater ranges had no effect at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how to enable physics on craft from greater distances?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T21:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have it correct. It\u0027s the \u0022landed\u0022 pack and unpack distances that you really want to increase -- that\u0027s the distance where physics turns on. You need to note how much time it takes the ramp to settle back down after the physics load bounce -- then figure how far your other vehicle will move in that amount of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBumping the load and unload distances up by 10km or so seems to also work great on my system. There used to be problems in prior versions with bugs appearing if you used large values for the physics bubble size, but as far as I can tell they are gone. The devs exposed these values so that we could all test large physics bubble sizes and see if they still do or do not cause additional bugs in the new version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicole","CreatedById":102302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T23:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Thanks for your reply. I turned the pack and unpack variables for the landed state up as follows; 2000 for unpack, and 2100 for pack.

No, it sounds like you are doing everything just right. I\u0027ll have to do some testing and look at it myself -- but if that\u00A0isn\u0027t working for you then I\u0027m afraid your stunt may be hopeless for now. Something may be hardcoded into the game that\u0027s causing the silly jumpy bounce -- it may not be the physics bubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-09T02:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102302-nicole/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022102302\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102302-nicole/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nicole\u003C/a\u003E: Now that I think about it, there are some parts that bounce more than others. Arsonide put in some very clever code to try to make sure that landing legs don\u0027t bounce (much). Is your current ramp craft sitting on landing legs? If not, you may want to try them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
