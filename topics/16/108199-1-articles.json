If I design a rocket in VAB and put some LV-909 into the craft the TWR says it\u0027s 0.35 at LKO (in vacuum). Now, when I change the reference body to Mun or Minmus, for example, it shows something like 10-20. That\u0027s understandable also. What I do not understand is how my engines magically increase their TWR at the SOI change. 1 second before the SOI change their TWR was 0.3 and 1 second after it miraculously became 10. Should I believe these figures and shrug it off to game engine faults or these figures are pure gibberish and I shouldn\u0027t even look at them?\n\nWhat I also noticed is that real acceleration dynamics does not change all that much when I change SOI. \n\nMy feeling is that I should not base my burn duration estimations on these readouts or am I wrong about that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T13:19:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 01:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ljas","CreatedById":115676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T12:53:05Z","Content":"\u0022Weight\u0022 implies mass multiplied by local gravitational force.

If you go into options, I believe you can change which one you display (or both). The \u0027current\u0027 TWR should change more gradually between SOI, but honestly isn\u0027t very useful. Surface TWR lets you know what kind of launch/landing profile to use. I usually display the surface TWR and acceleration (m/s^2), since acceleration is much more interesting in orbit than TWR."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:18:01Z","Content":"I see now, what I was doing wrong.
