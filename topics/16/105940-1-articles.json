I haven\u0027t unlocked the 2nd tier research building and mission control suggest to go to Pol next.\n\nWhat?!? Shouldn\u0027t Minmus come next?\n\nWell now I get besides the standart test/ferry contracts always flyby/putflag/orbit/land Pol.\n\nI really havn\u0027t got the rescourses for Pol.\n\nIs there a way to reset the Mission Control or do you have any ideas what I should do?\n\nPlease help ... !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T12:07:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 12:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blspblackdeath**"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:14:39Z","Content":"Ignore it. The reason it pops up is because there is a Flag Pole biome and it\u0027s not recognizing that it exists.

Which unfortunately seems to be calculated by your tech level and doesn\u0027t factor in the tier of your buildings.\n\nYou don\u0027t however have to accept the Pol mission. Keep doing other contracts in Kerbin\u0027s SOI and sooner or later something will appear around Minmus. It may not be \u0027explore Minmus\u0027, it may be a satellite or a temperature measurement or something else of the ilk.\n\nIf you\u0027re at the end of your tether with it - hit alt-f12, and add some exploration contracts until you get one for Minmus."},{"CreatedByName":"blspblackdeath","CreatedById":20067,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:06:50Z","Content":"Well thank you, I will try that."}]}
