I can refuel it if I need to (preferably LKO since that\u0027s the on,y place I\u0027ve ever docked. I have the mobile processing lab and plenty of scientists pilots and engineers. So here\u0027s the question I could add a engine area to it and make it mobile or just keep it in the kerbin system(it\u0027s my only station so if it goes I don\u0027t have a secondary station) so should I add a engine drive an go interplanetary or just keep it in the kerbin system?(I\u0027m in science mode right now so money means nothing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T15:28:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aidan likes minmus**"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:52:31Z","Content":"SO, let me make sure I\u0027m understanding this correctly...\n\nYou have the following on orbit already:\n\n-A science lab station\n\n-Two Hitchhiker cans (presumably a part of the science station)\n\n-A 2.5m lander cockpit (or several, doesn\u0027t matter)\n\nHonest advice? If you\u0027re doing this as JUST science, without funds being a concern...\n\nI\u0027d build a station specifically for the mission you\u0027re describing. Add some docking ports to it so that you can change stuff out if needed. Engines, fuel tanks, etc.\n\nExample (from top to bottom):\n\nClamp-o-tron\n\nMk2 Lander can at the top of the stack\n\nScience Lab\n\nHitchhiker module with 8 Z-100 batteries (4 pairs) and 6 OX-4L 1x6 panels\n\nOne of the two Rockomax 2.5m-1.25m adapters\n\nHubMax node with a mix of docking ports (I tend to run a spacer or standoff of some sort here to give the docking spacecraft some space between them and their neighbors)\n\nIf you have unlocked the 2.5m Clamp-o-tron Sr., I\u0027d put another Rockomax adapter in and put the big port at the bottom, then a quartet of struts between the adapters to stengthen the hub section. At the back, you can now dock a variety of different engines and fuel tanks. If you get some exotic drive later on, you can simply fly back to Kerbin, undock the older drive module, and launch your new module to take you further out into the system.\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"Aidan likes minmus","CreatedById":146284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:05:52Z","Content":"Yes I have a science station but should I make it go interplanetary or stay in the kerbin system for refueling ot whatever I use it for in the kerbin system"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:32:56Z","Content":"If you have it saved, I\u0027d launch another one for the next mission.

If you\u0027re going for long term missions, all you really need is to pack in enough Delta-V.

And yeah, they are low thrust... but most efficient engines trade raw thrust for the higher efficiency. Just watch the heat generation...

Eve\u0027s \\*technically\\* closer (takes less dV to transfer to Eve), but it\u0027s harder to get back. Duna is all-around more forgiving and you may be able to include a lander.\n\nHowever, Gilly (Eve\u0027s moon) is SUPER easy to play with, land on etc. I still think I\u0027d recommend Duna first if you\u0027re just starting out though."},{"CreatedByName":"Aidan likes minmus","CreatedById":146284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T23:33:43Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never got to a different planet.

(seriously, I recently upgraded my Thrust Plate launch stage to Mammoth and the largest Kerbodyne tank, and while I looked away for a while with my new craft being lifted to the orbit, I found it on escape trajectory and the orbit reaching Duna, and not even 2/3 of the way through the last of the thrust plate stage fuel."}]}
