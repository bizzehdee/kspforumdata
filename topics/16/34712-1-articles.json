Subassembly Loader worked amazing, but the .20 fix has been taken down so I cant use it, and payloader just won\u0027t work on my mac, even after running the terminal command. What are some alternatives? Alternatively, it would be great if someone could tell me how to make payloader work, the Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub command just leaves the app \u0022Damaged and can\u0027t be opened\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T18:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find a text editor to be the best subassembly loader, bar none, but I don\u0027t think they come in plugin form.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T18:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your PMs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yuming","CreatedById":57851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T18:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank You!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T22:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan I get a PM too?
