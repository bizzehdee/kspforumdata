In any case, Duna is THE most challenging place to fly because there\u0027s just barely enough atmosphere to make it possible. Everywhere else is a doddle in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-Flying-Duna-AGAIN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-Flying-Duna-AGAIN\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if I understand your problem correctly, you\u0027ve got instability in yaw. The cause of this is the complete absence of a vertical fin and rudder. Such surfaces are pretty much required on Duna due to the thin air. On Kerbin, you can get by without them because the air\u0027s thick enough that you can get yaw stability from the side of the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Duna, you need at least 2 vertical fins to get enough yaw stability for SAS to keep the plane flying straight. You also need rudders, which I recommend NOT putting on the vertical fins but on the wing trailing edges so as to minimize the amount of roll they induce. Flying wings do work on Duna but I\u0027ve gotten better results from conventional designs with a tail structure on the fuselage behind the wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that one of the major challenges of flying on Duna is landing. First off, the bulk of Duna\u0027s surface is 2000-3000m above sea level, which corresponds to about 15000-20000m on Kerbin. If you don\u0027t have an extremely low wing loading (as in huge wing for little weight), you can\u0027t fly slow enough at such altitudes to land safely. In my experience, landing at any speed greater than about 60m/s is a guaranteed crash. This is due to several factors. First, there\u0027s no such thing as level ground on Duna; it\u0027s all sand dunes, so if you\u0027re going any faster than this, you\u0027ll definitely have problems with the terrain. But because the air\u0027s so thin, you need LOTS of airbrakes acting for a LONG time to slow you down significantly, even if you have enough wing to fly that slowly. And then when you touch down, the wheel brakes have reduced effectiveness due to both the low gravity and your huge wing not wanting to quit flying, so you again start having terrain issues. Anyway, I\u0027m thinking you might need more wing on your plane, too, besides vertical surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend that you do your Duna testing with HyperEdit in a separate save game, which is the simulator. This way, you can teleport the plane into Duna orbit and test everything about its flying from deorbit to landing and then trying to take off again. Once you\u0027ve got something that can do all this on Duna, the next challenge is getting it off the ground on Kerbin. Anything that has enough wing to fly successfully on Duna will pose significant aerodynamic problems during launch on Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently have a functional plane on Duna taking 2 Kerbals on a tour of all the anomalies. It works but it\u0027s a pretty clunky. Maybe you can do better. The thread below shows what it\u0027s doing and also the long design process it took to make it happen. I went from the sleek flying wing jet in the 1st post to something that looks like a WW1 bomber by the end, all because I didn\u0027t know how hard flying Duna really is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43871-The-Kethane-Travelling-Circus-EPISODE-15-The-D-OH-Continued\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43871-The-Kethane-Travelling-Circus-EPISODE-15-The-D-OH-Continued\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UH60guy","CreatedById":77959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T17:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JiWint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JiWint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll try vtol when I\u0027ll land on laythe ^^ thanks for advice\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to hijack the thread, just wanted to point JiWint over to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50611-Sea-planes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanother thread\u003C/a\u003E I had put out for questions on how to build sea planes.

Above that it barely has any influence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing your plane just can\u0027t keep control when it encounters the stresses involved in atmospheric entry. There\u0027s a few things you can try. The first thing sounds crazy, but it often works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes planes like to fly backwards when aerobraking at extremely high speed. If you try and enter the atmosphere forwards, the drag will try and pull it round so it\u0027s going backwards. Eventually the drag wins, and that starts a spin. The solution is to enter the atmosphere backwards, and then turn the plane around when you\u0027re down to a sensible speed. I\u0027m not sure this will work on Duna though, because you\u0027ve only really got about 10km of usable atmosphere it\u0027s hard to turn around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work, the plane needs redesigning. You don\u0027t really have sufficient control surfaces. You need a tail with a vertically mounted control surface for proper yaw control, and you need another set of control surfaces along the length of the plane. Either a tail section, or nose canards will give way more control. Just having the single set of flaps means that the moment your nose gets lifted by atmospheric pressure, you\u0027ll start to flip because there\u0027s nothing to put downforce on the nose. If you had canards there, they\u0027d put downforce on the nose if it tries to pitch up and prevent your spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a plane pitches up or down it pivots on a single point, and if you only have a single control area, it\u0027s going to be really difficult to stop that pitching. Having 2 means you can control it much better. It might fly ok on kerbin in the thick atmosphere, but Duna is much less forgiving as the control surfaces don\u0027t provide as much influence with the thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T07:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E -snips -\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moar Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow fast are you going when you hit 8000m? \u003Cp\u003E-snips- /QUOTE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys for answers.Thanks to kerbals who saved the progress before landing.
