However, it is oriented vertically, so when I man the rover, the Navball is not oriented correctly. How can I fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I built the rover first, then added a lander module on top of it. The idea is that this lander module will be used to get Jeb back home after the mission, so first it drops the rover from very low altitude, then it lands next to it. However, the lander can (i.e. the rower) is where the kerbals are placed by default. Won\u0027t this mean that I will control the rover and not the lander when I separate them in low altitude? That won\u0027t be good as I have to fly the lander, how can I fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My entire rocket is way too expensive, it costs nearly 200 k! It is way overpowered, but on my first try to get a rover to the Mun I ran out of fuel so low that the rover landed ok and the lander fell over because I ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone suggest a much cheeper design that gives me a rover plus support that can bring the rover to the mun and the kerbal back home again?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T18:33:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 06:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by helgeras\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DannySwish","CreatedById":57623,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T10:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

I mean, roving any distance on Mun is an exercise in futility and frustration. It\u0027s just not a very practical way of traveling any more than a few clicks due to the craters. Craters eat rovers. You can try to avoid them but this will entail long hours of your real life time making extensive detours, and eventually you\u0027ll fall into one anyway and wreck far from your ship. Mun is littered with thousands of big, fancy rovers that their designers sent there with high hopes and much fanfare, only to abandon and/or wreck them after quickly realizing their uselessness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo abandon dreams of going to multiple biomes overland. Move the lander instead. If you just want 1 Kerbal to be able to move around some within 2-3km of the lander, like say to visit an arch on a nearby hill, then just fly him there with his jetpack. If you want to move multiple Kerbals at the same time over the same distance, then a very small, simple rover suffices. For instance, you can take one of the 2m square panels, put one of the smallest wheels on each corner, give it a small probe core, a headlight, and 2 RTGs, and then slap on as many lawn chairs as you want. MUCH lighter and cheaper than the big rover you\u0027ve got here, and just as useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T13:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helgeras\u0022 data-cite=\u0022helgeras\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the answers.

Use only one decoupler as the joint between the solid and liquid stages; reinforce with struts to compensate for the weak connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace the boosters out with girders [1] so that they don\u0027t overheat, and then strut the whole thing to hell and back. The tall solid boosters are best for this, but you can do it with a few stages worth of trashcans if you have to. Tweak the thrust limiter in order to keep the TWR below two (make sure all boosters are at the same setting so they all run out of fuel simultaneously), and aim to have the solids run out just before your apoapsis hits 70km. Circularise with a high-efficiency liquid engine, and use the same engine for Munar insertion and capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid engines and decouplers are expensive. Solid boosters, struts and girders are cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[1] As in, start with one booster, then attach a girder oriented radially about halfway up. Attach another booster to that. Then take off the girder and reattach it and the attached booster to the first booster, but this time with four or six times symmetry turned on. Clone the girder/booster and repeat, building rings outwards until you\u0027ve got the power you want when you fire \u0027em all at once. Run struts from the top of each booster to the bottom of its neighbours, building a collection of X-shaped reinforcements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T13:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice galaxies, BTW. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T15:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helgeras\u0022 data-cite=\u0022helgeras\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy entire rocket is way too expensive, it costs nearly 200 k!

Really cheap. They really are \u0022trash bins full of boom\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at how much different solid rockets and liquid fuel tanks and engines cost in the VAB. You can use tweakables to remove the fuel from fuel tanks and solid rockets to see how much they are worth when empty. Most of the cost of a liquid fuelled rocket comes from the tanks and engines, not the fuel. This gives players a good incentive to build re-useable vehicles that recover the engines and empty tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K2AgyGY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K2AgyGY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ABLkSIh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ABLkSIh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid rockets are worth a pittance once empty.
