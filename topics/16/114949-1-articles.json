If I\u0027m going to take the time and energy to do that, I may as well send a full science package. But what altitude is the divider between low and high space over the Sun? And, what kind of heat management will I need?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T15:12:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Barefoot Friar**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T14:34:01Z","Content":"IIRC, low solar orbit is anything less than 1 million. Heat management, yeah, you need it for some parts. Check out the [Solar Limbo Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124522-Solar-Limbo-How-Low-can-you-Go) thread for the experiences of others there so far. And if you\u0027re going there, might as well participate in the challenge."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T15:02:38Z","Content":"To get the science you only have to get down to that altitude, you don\u0027t have to circularise your orbit down there (as they do in the limbo challenge). If your orbit is eccentric enough and just dips below the line at periapsis then you should get away with a lot less cooling."},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T15:13:08Z","Content":"Thanks for the info. And yeah, I\u0027ve been looking at the challenge... I\u0027ll play around with it and see what I can do. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"}]}
