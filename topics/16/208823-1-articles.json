This allows for lift to be generated while keeping the main body of the plane as close to prograde as possible, which minimizes body drag. Conversely it may allow smaller wing area to maintain the same lift, which would also lower total drag. both of those tend to translate to more fuel efficient flight, combined with the more common optimizations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224151616\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208823\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221656972141\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219053\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boriz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, boriz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n400 units of fuel and one Whiplash is more than enough to circumnavigate Kerbin along its equator and land back at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with fuel to spare.
