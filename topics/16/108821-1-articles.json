I wonder if a programmer got the number of stars confused with skill level? i.e. a two-star engineer like Bill is level 3, but when he tries to fix the wheel it thinks \u0022he has two stars, he must be level two.\u0022 I\u0027ll give him another star in a backup save later on and see if that works... if not I will edit the main save to fix the wheels.
