Normally this could be solved by activating the SAS but as is manned can not do and can not always be solved a problem like this. Nor I possess RCS control due to the design and not think much help. The problem is that the center of mass and propulsion can not make the indicators do not stay together well how to do this. If anyone has some tips or something they are grateful because none of my rockets are controllable, I\u0027m failing at something and it\u0027s not.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/6azvDhskKOY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/6azvDhskKOY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T02:11:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 02:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HECHICERO100\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T16:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo your rockets have fins?

The crafts I was making were so ludicrous and had so many kickback engines on the first stage that it almost looked like a flower when viewed from the bottom. But really the craft that got me onto mun only had 4 SRB\u0027s and some twin boar engines\u002B some reliant boosters to help it get into orbit. Because Even though you produce more thrust you need to have control of your craft in atmosphere in order to get a stable orbit. For inspiration look at the stock craft kerbal X. I\u0027ve heard that with some proper usage of gravity assists that craft can get to eve(but not back.)
