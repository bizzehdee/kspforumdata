I suggest either throttling down during the beginning of flight, or just removing the SRBs altogether; the Mainsail has more than enough power to lift the stack. I personally felt like the ship didn\u0027t quite have enough delta-v to comfortably make it to orbit (but you can blame that on the above-mentioned still getting used to 1.0 aero), so I lengthened that core stack, as well as the side asparagus boosters. \u0027Overbuilt\u0027 is practically my middle name, so feel free to disregard this design if you feel comfortable with your flying skills. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s the rocket,\n\n![ScTZTu4.png](http://i.imgur.com/ScTZTu4.png)\n\nA rule of thumb for flying, try to keep the g-meter inside the green area.

This will then expose any asymmetry in the craft. It\u0060s hard to tell for sure, but it looks to me like some of your struts might twist the lower part of the ship during launch. If you\u0060re too fast then the twisting will strain the joints further up and the entire thing will take on a life of its own. The closest I\u0060ve come to this was when I once used 16 boosters to get something heavy up and it just shot right up to 10k without even responding when I tried keeling over toward my orbit. Then when I tried doing it higher the bottom of my ship looked like someone swinging a club in a giant circle and then the top came off and I crashed. All I did to fix that was to sequence the boosters in two sets of eight and fire the last eight when I dumped the first ones. And then the ascent went perfectly because half my booster thrust went off above 10k where there\u0060s less resistance so you keep more of your speed. In general there shouldn\u0060t bee any thermal effects when you\u0060re going up. Even though you lose speed to that as well, sonic effects are fine. if you don\u0060t get those you\u0060re too slow. But if there are thermal effects you\u0060re going too fast and much of that speed is eaten away by air resistance. It would be more efficient to cut boosters really. If there are thermals you should moderate the thrust of your launch stage asap.\n\nAnyway, what I meant to say was that it\u0060s definitely just a small thing somewhere. Try lowering the thrust of the bottom first and see how that works. And if it\u0060s not that, try going over your struts carefully. It matters whether it\u0060s placed centrally on a fuel tank or on the sides. If it\u0060s attached to the sides it will cause some twisting. A little twisting or a lot of it at slow speed isn\u0060t a problem. But with enough of it and you could get trouble while launching, and especially at high speed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T00:48:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laughing Man","CreatedById":67907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T11:14:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Best guess is you have to much thrust going through the lower part of the atmosphere.
