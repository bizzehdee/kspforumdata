In previous KSP versions you could squeeze a few extra m/s out of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane by closing them. But currently, at the altitude intakes no longer serve a purpose on an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane, actually closing them does not make much difference.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMuch easier to leave them open so you won\u0027t scratch your head why your engines won\u0027t light on the return trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-24T02:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust tried (in 1.3).
