The reason is to make it a slow gradual turn and to keep the angle of attack small. (The angle of attack is represented by the angular distance between the level indicator and the prograde indicator on the Navball.) This is more efficient than making sudden sharp turns. Consider the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/pics/turn_dv.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022turn_dv.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn figure A a right-angle turn is made using a single sharp 90-degree turn.

The \u0022Turn at 10k\u0022 ascent path is a terrible thing that is there just to help new players get something into orbit, but really even with the stock aerodynamics this isn\u0027t very efficient. Yeah, you can get to orbit with all kinds of ascent paths, but the earlier you start turning the more efficient. Of course, I don\u0027t mean 45 degrees at launch. It should just be a very gradual turn that reaches 45 degrees somewhere around 15-20k (I haven\u0027t played stock since 0.22 at least so I don\u0027t really know that well, but it\u0027s somewhere there).
