Is there a special tool or something that\u0027s needed to take a sample? I\u0027ve landed kerbals on Minmus and found a green rock but I can\u0027t figure out how to interact with it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-21T20:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor small surface features, like a Mun Rock, standing next to it adds an option to the right click menu for kerbals. For larger surface features, like an Olivine Formation on Minmus, you need a scanning arm. Scanning arms come in three sizes, with larger arms giving more science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-22T05:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, I think I must\u0027ve found one of the larger ones then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-25T13:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother issue is that for some of the small features the right click menu option only shows up if the Kerbal is at a \u0022correct\u0022 position relative to that feature. So if it doesn\u0027t show up then walk around and over that thingy until the option to pick it up shows up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
