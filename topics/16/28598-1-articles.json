So far...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off: Flags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot what you might think, I know how to make \u0027em, plant \u0027em and the works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have two mayor missions in orbit waiting for their respective windows... And only have the default flag on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to change that without starting over? Maybe start a rendevous vessel that delivers a \u0022new\u0022 flag? Or an edit in the persistence file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a pitty... to go all the way to Duna and not having my own flag with me. Not that the default one is bad....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question: Where the hell is Bill? And Willie? I remember even a Charlie Kerman somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut WHERE?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked in the persistence file... the names are there, but it doesn\u0027t say where those guys are. I can even find the ships in there... But not the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even switched through my active ships... Found Bob and Jebediah, but not Willie and Charlie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how to rename them (pretty easy, actually), but I\u0027d rather not do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there an \u0022easy\u0022 way to find them? Or do I have to check each and every vessel, each and every hitchhikers capsule?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to anyone who read that far...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
