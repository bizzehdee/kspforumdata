But once you make big things, you can\u0027t reliably keep everything behind a heat shield for the entire dip in the atmosphere, specially because the ship will turn. In a smaller probe, say a short 1.25m probe, you can put a 2.5m and you\u0027ll surely be covered by it - the risk is having the shield\u0027s skin overheat faster than ablator gets burnt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T02:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK since there\u0027s some interest in aerocapture, it\u0027s time to reveal some of my design tricks to keep heat shield front (and I\u0027d be glad to hear if anyone has some more!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes totally agree that the main challenge is to prevent it turn during the most dense part of the atmosphere. But it is solvable. The below list comes with priority based on my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make sure CoM is near the heat shield. Place heavy parts like fuel tanks as near as possible. Move all your fuel there as close as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - there\u0027s even a small trick about choosing the tanks. If the same stage is doing transfer burn as well, then even if a single tank is sufficient, you would want to split to two tanks. Explanation: suppose heat shield is at bottom, and I have a fuel tank on top of it with half fuel. Using one fuel tank - CoM is at 1/2 tank height (ignoring shield mass); if we use two identical tanks, and move fuel down upon entry, then CoM is at 1/4 tank height, much closer to the shield! Small trick like that actually makes a huge difference from my testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Spam SAS. You really need them. My last resort would be plenty of RCS at the tail but so far SAS is enough for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use rocket-size cargo bay (modded parts) or fairing (this is stock) to give a larger margin of attack of angle. As long as most of the area is covered by heat shield, fairing can handle a small radius increase without problem, giving you some flexibility of designing payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the biggest thing I sent there was a ~40t base (2.5m-sized mostly, with legs, panels etc.) covered by 3.5m heat shield placed at the bottom.
