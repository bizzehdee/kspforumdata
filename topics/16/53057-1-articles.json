You might need to slide it along the orbit a bit or add a touch of radial or normal burn, but for Kerbin--\u0026gt;Duna you ought to be able to get away with prograde only. The total delta-v should be reasonably close to the value given by the guide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make your burn.

For your first visit, I\u0027d recommend a probe, myself. It simplifies so many things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a probe, you don\u0027t need a very big rocket. In fact, one of the tiny Rockomax 48-7s engines, and a fl-t400 fuel tank, should be more than sufficient for the probe itself. Make sure you\u0027ve got enough power, too--more than once I\u0027ve got a probe on approach to another planet, only to discover it\u0027s batteries were dead. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce there, the simplest (though not the most efficient) way to do it is to just get your probe into orbit around the sun. To do so, just get in a low Kerbin orbit, and burn prograde until your orbit escapes Kerbin\u0027s SOI. For our purposes, it is best to do this when you are \u0022behind\u0022 kerbin relative to it\u0027s own path around the sun--in other words, you\u0027ll want to burn when the sun is behind you. This way, you can use Kerbin\u0027s own orbital momentum to push you into a higher orbit (closer to Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve escaped Kerbin\u0027s SOI, set Duna as your target, and use the maneuver nodes to experiment with a trajectory to Duna. Pick a spot own your orbit and pull the prograde marker until the orbit reaches Duna\u0027s. Slide the maneuver node around your orbit until you get an intercept (or reasonably close). You may need to make a full orbit around the sun before you find a good intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, it\u0027s very much like visiting Minmus from Kerbin. You follow your maneuver node to change your orbit to intercept, and then make any necessary course corrections mid-flight to get the best intercept you can. And once you\u0027re in Duna\u0027s SOI, you should be in familiar (technical) territory again--adjust your periapsis, circularize your orbit, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna\u0027s a great place to visit!

As far as transfer stages go, anything with more than 3 nuclear engines is overkill and a waste of fuel. You can easily get craft of over 150 tons out to Jool, with just 3 nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my personal favorite ship design to use at the moment. It has an apollo style design. So the lander on top can undock and transfer one kerbal to the surface and then return to orbit. It has enough fuel to go to Moho and return, it also comes with my Leviathan MK - I super max payload lifter. Easily gets anything up to and over 200 tons into orbit. Or if you would like to try out my Duna Command Center, you can fly it out to Duna and land it on the surface as a permanent base.
