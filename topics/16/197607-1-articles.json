For example, one strut each from the tip of the booster nosecones to the upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, use a four- or sixpack of smaller boosters, which do not tax their attachment points as much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the best solution is a single-core design with no boosters at all. Got the Twin Boar unlocked, by any chance? You\u0027ll be surprised how much that thing pushes to orbit in a single-stick 2.5m form factor. I mean, this specific payload is really begging for 3.75m, if only for the fairing base, but I suppose you would be using that if you had it, and therefore you don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobbly Av8r","CreatedById":206697,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-21T20:23:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a guess here, but in general, whenever the payload diameter is larger than the base of the rocket (and I don\u0027t have a ruler on me, but I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s the case here...) the aerodynamic forces tend to want to turn the rocket @ss-over-tea kettle in the atmosphere. I\u0027m also guessing you have enough reaction wheels, fins and/or gimbal of the engines to counteract the destabilization caused by the aerodynamics, and the result you\u0027re seeing is the battle between those forces! And since you say it doesn\u0027t go out of control, I say \u0022Well done, sir!\u0022 \u0027cuz when push comes to shove, that\u0027s the only real measurement of success in KSP!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-21T20:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry adding some fins to the bottom of the first stage and if necessary the SRBs too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat rocket looks overpowered for your payload, and I see no reason for the big monopropellant tank on the second stage as there\u2019s no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on it.

A Twin Boar with a couple of Rockomax-64 tanks will be more than enough to get into orbit with that payload and if you put a few parachutes on it, it\u2019s recoverable too.
