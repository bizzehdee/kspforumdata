And a harsh world it can be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my suggestion. Try to build your modules using the same component. So lets say I make the Hitchhicker Storgae Container my base part, and lets say I turn it horizontal and add some wheels. I would also add some LT-2 landing struts in exactly the same place of each module, same with the docking ports. So that no matter what else (or how long) you tack onto the module, the landing struts will help position both modules along the same axis. Wheels \u0022sink\u0022 or \u0022raise\u0022 on their suspension depending upon the weight, landing struts don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, Dortmunder is right, finding the right spot to get the modules to dock is very important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KAS mod can help, but only in some circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try RCS assited alignment, but this has never worked for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T11:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModule base building guide, as promised:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/48876-The-art-of-modular-base-building\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T11:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty is that unlike in orbit, on the ground the docking magnets are not strong enough to force the alignment into proper orientation. In orbit a tiny amount of force has a big effect. On the ground where it has to fight gravity and fight friction, it doesn\u0027t. If your rover isn\u0027t lined up just right, the magnets won\u0027t slide the wheels sideways to force alignment - the wheel friction is too strong. So you have to line up just right on your own. Also if the height isn\u0027t exactly the same, the magnets won\u0027t pull the lower piece up to meet the higher piece because gravity is stronger than the docking magnet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking requires absolute precision and in orbit it\u0027s easy to think it doesn\u0027t because the magnets help do the alignment for you - as long as you get it close the magnets can finish the job. But until the magnets do make the alignment perfect, docking doesn\u0027t happen. On the ground where they can\u0027t force the craft to move, they can\u0027t correct alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELateral alignment is easy to deal with yourself. It\u0027s just a matter of driving very slowly and precisely. But vertical alignment is hard. Even if you test your modules on Kerbin to make sure they line up you\u0027ll find that the height still isn\u0027t the same once you get to the Mun. The height depends on where the suspension of the springy wheels or struts naturally rests at, and where the suspension comes to rest at ends up slightly different depending on surface gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne cheezy method I\u0027ve used to adjust height is to put a teeny tiny amount of fuel and one of those little orange side nozzle rockets on rovers. Then you can fire the engine and give it just a little bit of thrust to adjust height by taking a bit of the weight off the suspension (or putting a bit more weight on the suspension if the rocket is mounted upside down, or better yet have one of each and pick which to activate depending on what you need.) If your rover or component is light enough and you\u0027re doing it somewhere where gravity is weak enough you might be able to do it with just RCS thrusters instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackfire83","CreatedById":80356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T13:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Steven implied, weight of the craft can make a difference, so even if you get two craft to match perfectly on Kerbin, factors such as emptying fuel tanks, stages being discarded, etc can cause the docking ports to not line up. It\u0027s a giant pain in the rear.
