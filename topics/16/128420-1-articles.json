Some are older and are, therefore, bigger. They have been built in career mode, so they are made up of a mix of attached blocks through docking ports, on the surface. One of them, my minmus fuel factory, has grown in size quite a bit, the latest addition was a nice landing pad, placed quite far from the main building, via a long pipe which was assembled, in place, in 3 sections. What happens is that, since terrain is not level and there is yet to be done a mod that allows for buldozzers or terrain levelling, the landing pad, when I warp time, clips the terrain mesh a little.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis is enough, however, to make parts of the landing pad exploding and jumping into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe reason why I adopted the \u0022no legs\u0022 building process is that it is easier to standardize equipment, since, independently of local gravity the port height for each block remains the same, unlike when we use legs. Besides... It looks better... Knowing if port height matches is, as you can see, of paramount importance before sending base components to be assembled millions of miles away, and if I have to design this for each scenario, instead of using default design for all, it\u0027s a pain in the ass...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut.... The no\u00A0legs approach is giving me this problem... What do you suggest? Using legs will prevent this on larger ground bases? Is it worth the pain? Anyone knows when bulldozer mod will be available? Maybe making smaller bases (in terms of area)? How have you overcome this problem, if you ever encountered it? I can think on a number of alternatives, Imwould be interested in knowing thenless painfull ones \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0eheh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-22T10:51:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2015 10:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jaeleth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T11:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can still achieve level docking port with legs if you lock the leg\u0027s suspension before final deployment, or at least that\u0027s what I\u0027m been told.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPaging \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/52690-rune/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002252690\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/52690-rune/\u0022\u003E@Rune\u003C/a\u003E, he would be the expert at this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T12:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, so, locking suspension before landing?\u00A0Maybe, not as easy as legless but... it makes sense.

Anyhow, yeah, locking the legs is a good way to control the sag of landed structures, but you can\u0027t really get 100% rid of the slight jumps when you load stuff, especially when it loads as you come in with \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E ship.

By raising a select number of legs, you can tilt whole bases so their docking ports are higher or lower, and it always helps to have some method of raising the docking element. For example, my base assembly rover has a pretty powerful monoprop VTOL system: I built it so it has the right height with the wheels completely unloaded, so if I am coming a bit low because the module I am carrying is a heavy one, I can turn on the engines and raise the suspension a bit so I can still dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving connecting corridors that can take a bit of the misalignment out helps immensely, too, like these:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HOurgbl.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HOurgbl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
