Sorta like the ship they had in the movie \u0022Martian\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnywho I have already designed the ship but is in no way capable of escaping kerbals atmosphere at least without an extensive launching system that would probably melt my computer if I tried. So I\u0027ve decided to build the craft in space so I downloaded the global construction mod to acomplish that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried launching the container kit but I think it is still just too big so I was thinking about cutting the ship in half with docking ports to put the to halves together once they are in space. However, In my experience, trying to fly docked ships through space never ends well. They just start wiggling around so much until the dock points seperate and usually colide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in total what is the best way to get an extra large container kit into space.... Or how do I keep docked ships from falling appart during manuvers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-11T19:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have flown some rather large assemblages to various planets and I find that if you maneuver and accelerate slowly they do not have a problem. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansAcker","CreatedById":195534,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T05:06:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStruts (EVA construction), Autostruts and disabling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or reaction weels on docked spacecraft.
