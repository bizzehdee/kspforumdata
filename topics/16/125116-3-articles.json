This way, players can ditch the super-boring grind contracts that only require you to shove tourists around or test parts you\u0027ve already used a million times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Conversely, declining high importance contracts (like the first \u0022Orbit Kerbin!\u0022) would mean the reputation penalty is doubled or even tripled. This would make the player think twice about declining three-star contracts, even if they may not seem particularly challenging at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Contracts that require a goal that the player has already accomplished (e.g. reaching first orbit, or testing a part that is already unlocked) would expire immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Additionally, each agency or contract category should have its own, local, reputation which would indicate the desirability of that agency to offer a new contract to the player. For example, if you reject all contracts from StrutCo, it would not impact the contracts offered by all other agencies, and if you decline \u0022Test Part\u0022 or \u0022Ferry Tourist\u0022 objective, it would affect those categories, but not any other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The probability of a contract of category X and agency Y being offered is ultimately determined by a sum of (Global Reputation * Agency Reputation * Category Reputation), which will reach an equilibrium if the player keeps rejecting contracts they don\u0027t want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the long run, that means that contracts the player does not want will stop showing up, and the contracts the player *does* want get accepted and completed, which means more and more of those contracts will keep showing up, offering more challenge for the player and a more interesting game without having to slot-machine the contract system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T11:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wouldn\u0027t be so concerned if only the default limit wasn\u0027t 10 blasted contracts.

I could cancel 250 contracts now if I wanted too; and only be 0 out. The higher your reputation gets you gain a nerf to your gains, there was no real reason to have 900 points. Reputation isn\u0027t that important right now. So instead of theory crafting how terrible this decision was, actually play the game and realize it hardly affects you. Go ahead and decline away! most gains for reputation are way more for completing a contract that you won\u0027t have a problem having high reputation. And finally if it still matters, remember that strategy place that was never used? Well you can now buy reputation or trade science for it if your really worried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks KSP for the design decision. I now only take contracts I really want, cancel the insane, and spend more time focusing on what I want to do.
