If so, does that also change the design of flags already planted?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T04:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177584-npreadr/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022177584\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177584-npreadr/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Npreadr\u003C/a\u003E, and welcome aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, you can change the flag after you\u0027ve started a game. If you want to change it for a specific ship, then when you\u0027re building look next to the name bar. You should see the current flag there. Click on it, and you should be presented with the full list of flags.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also change the save\u0027s flag. When looking at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, before entering a building, click on the flagpole near the HQ. Again, you should see the same list of flags as when you started the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
