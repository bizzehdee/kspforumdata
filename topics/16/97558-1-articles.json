That was just exacerbating the problem with the minor imperfections. Somehow, the gizmo\u0027d Modular Girder segment being gizmo\u0027d through both a fuselage and a wing was causing some kind of screwy result. My guess is this is some sort of clipping bug causing the wings to act weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbatross 3: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jm76bxdab2ve2ly/Albatross%203.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jm76bxdab2ve2ly/Albatross%203.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file I\u0027ve left here for reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you pull the modular girder segments out of the wing, and adjust the front wheel appropriately (Albatross 9 is a 3 with these adjustments) you don\u0027t get a liftoff \u0027lock\u0027 of the front wheel.
