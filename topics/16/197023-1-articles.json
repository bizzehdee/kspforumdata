I sent a lander and orbiter to mun, i joined them for the first time in mun orbit, got the achievement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen i launched the same ship to minmus, landed the lander, did an EVA, started back, rejoined the lander and orbiter. but this time i got no space station achievement. i figured, since they were already joined in the past, the game would consider them still parts of the same ship. so i sent another cheap ship from kerbin to get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen i set up to explore all the outer planets, and to save money i set to use the same ship for all. again, a lander and orbiter, this time the orbiter is bigger and it has a nuclear engine, because all those interplanetary transfers are expensive. and i figured i would send other ships to get one docking in every orbit. sometimes cheap small probes just for the achievement, sometimes refueling missions (of course i have no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E available, as that would require unlocking the level 3 lab, which i can\u0027t afford in this challenge).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell, i joined the lander and orbiter in duna orbit, got the achievement all right. then i went to ike, grabbed a refueling mission, got the achievement. then i went to dres, and i arrived there a few months before the other ship (this time a small probe, as reaching dres is expensive). in the meanwhile i landed the lander, i got back to orbit, reunited with the orbiter... and to my surprise, i got the station achievement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso i wonder why i got in in dres and not in minmus\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0now that i think of it, on minmus i was on a suborbital trajectory, as the lander was missing 20 m/s to get back to orbit and i had to rescue it with the orbiter. i seem to remember i got the docking and rendez-vous achievement anyway, but i\u0027m not sure. or, in the minmus case i just remained on the ground long enough to run the science and plant a flag, while in dres i decided to land near the canyon, make a long jetpack trip to the canyon, accidentally fall down into the canyon, tumble down a 2 km ravine, then come back with barely any fuel left. and i reloaded a few times in the process. so maybe this made the game \u0022forget\u0022 that the lander and orbiter had been the same ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyone knows the reason?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IronMaiden","CreatedById":193062,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-20T19:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vessels need to be from two different launches.
