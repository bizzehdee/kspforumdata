Eve\u0027s atmosphere is thicker than Kerbin\u0027s, requiring upwards of 12,000 delta-v to escape. With parachutes a 1-way landing could be facilitated easily, but you cannot reasonably expect to return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, let\u0027s go over the basics of interplanetary rocket building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket will probably need to orbit Kerbin before leaving for another celestial body. Because of this, most experienced rocketeers use lifters to get their rockets in orbit before departing for Kerbol orbit and beyond. You can build a lifter to have one or several stages, depending on how heavy your craft is. When you have acquired a stable orbit, drop the lifter and let your actual rocket do the work from here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving between planets requires a good amount of fuel, and since getting fuel in to space is not easy, the best way to do so is to use rockets with higher efficiency (ISP). The most efficient rockets in the game are jet engines, but since they don\u0027t work outside of Kerbin and Laythe, they\u0027ll do you no good getting to Eve. The best rocket engines you can use are actually the Ion engines, which are incredibly efficient. The downfall of ion engines is that they use quite a bit of electricity and have virtually no power. Unless you are using a very small probe or are incredibly patient, ion engines won\u0027t work either. The best engines for moving around in space are arguably the nuclear engines. While they don\u0027t have a lot of thrust, their ISP is very high in space, making them perfect for inter-planetary travel. Remember that they do not work so well in the atmosphere though, their ISP is less than half! If you have empty tanks on your ship, remember that you can bring up fuel from other ships, dock and refuel your main ship before departing, potentially increasing your range by vast amounts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027ve gotten this far, and you have an encounter with Eve, you will need to get as close to Eve as possible. To be captured in Eve\u0027s orbit you will need to slow down quite a bit. Unfortunately, slowing down uses quite a bit of fuel, so instead of using fuel, you need to get your periapsis over Eve as small as possible. When your periapsis is lower than ~96,700m, you will enter Eve\u0027s atmosphere. This sounds scary, but not to worry! You will use the gasses inside of the atmosphere and the drag of your ship to slow yourself down to orbit without expending any fuel at all! The recommended periapsis to be captured in Eve\u0027s orbit is 72,500m (KSP Wiki). Try not to go any lower; if you go too low, you will simply crash in to Eve! Once you are captured in Eve\u0027s orbit, use a little fuel at your apoapsis to increase your periapsis over Eve\u0027s atmosphere (96,700m) so you won\u0027t slow down any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this gives you the basic idea of how to get to Eve efficiently. While it doesn\u0027t come close to covering everything, it should cut your fuel usage down by quite a bit.

For most interplanetary jobs, you want the nuke engines. For Eve, you\u0027ll need to plan for roughly 9250 m/s of delta-V (that\u0027s got a fudge-up factor added in) assuming you\u0027re just doing a there and back again mission; you want to plan for 13,000 if you want to make a side trip and landing on Gilly. Assuming a twenty tonne payload, 5 X-32 tanks will do the trick (assuming five LV-Ns for your interplanetary stage). That\u0027s going to be a pretty hefty load to boost into Kerbin orbit; I\u0027d suggest assembling such a craft in orbit with docking maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you know how to pilot into Eve\u0027s SOI, try to get your periapsis down to at least 70,000 m on the approach. That should be low enough to affect an aerocapture without pulling your ship in for landing. Quicksave before you make the attempt. You definitely don\u0027t want to wait for periapsis like you would for the Mun; if you can\u0027t get the periap that low while transiting to Eve, do it as soon as you enter its SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot a guy orbiting Eve at the moment; had to send a resupply mission because I shot for Gilly and missed. Quick note about resupply missions: be sure that they enter orbit going roughly the same direction as the first mission...I sent enough fuel to make it out to some of the moons of Jool and have burned up half of it just trying to get the orbits aligned...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T14:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re landing: if you\u0027ve got a lander with any weight on it, you\u0027ll need a decent amount of thrust to slow your descent enough that your parachute won\u0027t rip off when it deploys.
