Every time I tried up till now it vanished before taking a shot. It has eluded me now for months since they started to slip and turn them off a few seconds after I went into IVA mode to watch them and I initially noticed it... And they slowly got sloppier and sloppier about it until I finally could get proof!!! \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is what they have been doing in the cockpits while were not able to fully see.

Is it fuzzy because they just turned cut the feed? Or can they make out some weird TV feed or whatnot in all that fuzz.....? And what are they watching that entertains them so!?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nApparently kerbals have very high tech. Those are some pretty interesting floating displays. I wonder what method they use to produce it...? Is this what we will be like when we finally obtain such technology?\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T21:26:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T21:38:59Z","Content":"\nFor those not in the know: those things are actually the cameras that generate the portrait views you see at the bottom right while in regular flight mode... in fact, you can think of them as the very windows you \u0022look through\u0022 at them from the outside.

Not entirely sure how it\u0026#39;s done from a programatical point of view, but if I remember correctly from reading the devnotes and the like, the KIA screen is the default portrait, and if the kerbal is alive, the head is rendered over it. The portrait is actually \u0022filmed\u0022 with a \u0022camera\u0022 in the cockpit, so therefore each passenger needs to have a KIA screen associated with him/her.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFeeble attempt at being funny:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey\u0026#39;re watching the tube when they\u0026#39;re supposed to be working, hence why it disappears when you look at them.
