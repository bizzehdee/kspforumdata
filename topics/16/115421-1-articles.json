I\u0027m using this because \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC is provided (as [Standard Gravitational Parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter)) on the KSP Wiki entry for [Kerbin](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin). Kerbin\u0027s radius (600km) is also provided there.\n\nFor Kerbin:\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC = 3,531,600,000,000 m3/s2\n\nr = 600,000m \u002B 80,000m = 680,000m\n\nsqrt(7,063,200,000,000 / 680,000) = 3222.89m/s or **Vesc = 3.22 km/s**\n\n-------\n\nThen we find \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, or the total change in m/s required at periapsis to achieve the desired final velocity\n\nusing:\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = sqrt(Vf^2 \u002B Vesc^2) - sqrt(Vh^2 \u002B Vesc^2)\n\nwhere:\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = amount of burn at periapsis\n\nVf = final velocity target [1920 m/s (Jool Intercept) \u002B 2280m/s (your current velocity) = 4,200m/s]\n\nVh = initial velocity before burn = 2,280 m/s [orbital speed at 80km]\n\nand Vesc = 3,223 m/s\n\n[check on my assumptions: Yasmy\u0027s orbital calculations came up with \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = 4224 - 2246 = 1978 m/s. Mine came up with 4200 - 2280 = 1920. These numbers seem to more or less agree.]\n\nSo we simplify and find:\n\nsqrt(17640000 \u002B 10387020) - sqrt(5198400 \u002B 10387020)\n\n5294 - 3948 = \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv 1346 m/s\n\nSo, to the best of my ability, I think to get the desired increase of 1,920 m/s, it actually costs us only 1,346 m/s because of the Oberth Effect. \n\n**A savings of 574 m/s** over burning with a solar velocity of 0.\n\n---------------\n\nThis (if I\u0027ve done my math correctly, which is seriously in doubt) answers the question \u0022how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv do I effectively get \u0027for free\u0027 when burning from LKO to Jool intercept\u0022.

The combination of which is just less than 3727.\n\nGiving an answer of something close to **1740 m/s saved.** due to the Oberth Effect.\n\nWhich answer is correct, and why?\n\n--Update-- trying to answer my own question.\n\nWhat happens if I try to explicitly use velocity in the solar frame, rather than the Kerbin frame?

That\u0027s not closer to Yasmy\u0027s answer!\n\n----\n\nSomething above can\u0027t be correct. I know I need more than 530 m/s change to reach Jool from LKO. Obviously I\u0027ve done something wrong.\n\nWhat if I just force the difference between Vf and Vh to be 1920 m/s? That would mean if Vh is 12,010 m/s, Vh must be 10,090 m/s\n\nsimplifying: sqrt(144240100 \u002B 10387729) - sqrt(101808100 \u002B 10387729)\n\n12053 - 10592 = \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = 1461 m/s.\n\nMeaning we\u0027d only need to expend 1461 m/s at periapsis to achieve the desired 1920 m/s change.\n\nA savings of 459 m/s because of the Oberth Effect.\n\nGrrr, now I have no idea where I\u0027ve gone wrong, and none of my answers are any closer to agreeing with Yasmy\u0027s.\n\n---- Another Update ----\n\nI just realized I\u0027m still using Vesc for Kerbin, not Kerbol. Maybe that\u0027s where I\u0027ve gone wrong yet again?\n\nRecalculate Vesc:\n\nVesc = sqrt((2 \\* G \\* M) / r)\n\nwhere:\n\nG = gravitational constant (of the Kerbal universe)\n\nM = mass you\u0027re orbiting\n\nr = radius of your orbit\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC = G\\*M.\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BC = 1.1723328\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^18 m^3/s^2\n\nr = 261\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0600\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0000 (Kerbol\u0027s radius) \u002B 13\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0599\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0840\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0256 (Kerbin\u0027s orbital distance) = 13,861,440,256 m\n\nSimplifying: sqrt(2,344,665,600,000,001,165 / 261,600,000) = sqrt(8962788991) = Vesc = 94,672\n\nWhich we then plug in:\n\nsqrt(144240100 \u002B 8962787584) - sqrt(101808100 \u002B 8962787584)\n\n95431 - 95208 = 151 m/s\n\nTelling us that we need only expend 151 m/s to achieve the desired 1920 m/s change. **A savings of 1769 m/s**\n\nWell, at least that\u0027s closer to Yasmy\u0027s answer. Can anyone tell me if I\u0027ve finally solved it, or simply plugged in enough random numbers to get lucky? Spoiler -- it was the second thing.\n\nAlso (and finally), I know from experience that it takes considerably more than 151 m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to transit from LKO to Jool encounter. Why is that?\n\n**---FINAL UPDATE TO OP---** Snark pointed out the error of my ways in post #2.

You can verify this by using [http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz) to find the burn needed to go from Kerbin to Jool from an initial parking orbit of 80 km. It says \u00221911 m/s\u0022, which is close enough to the 1920 number. I\u0027ve used this tool for lots of interplanetary transfers, so there\u0027s plenty of experimental verification that what it\u0027s doing is correct.\n\n1920 m/s is the burn you need to do to get from Kerbin to Jool, taking maximum advantage of Oberth effect. So if you want to know \u0022how much benefit do I get from Oberth\u0022, you\u0027d need to work out \u0022how much more than that would I need if I didn\u0027t use Oberth effect\u0022. That\u0027s what Yasmy\u0027s doing, and I believe he\u0027s doing it correctly.\n\nLet\u0027s consider what that 1920 m/s burn buys you:\n\n- It buys you escape from Kerbin\u0027s gravity well.\n\n- It does so with enough energy left over to kick your solar apoapsis up to Jool\u0027s orbit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First we calculate Vesc using:\n\u003E Vesc = sqrt((2 \\* G \\* M) / r)\n\u003E \n\u003E *[...math...]*\n\u003E \n\u003E **Vesc = 3.22 km/s**\n\nYes, your math looks about right, but bear in mind that you have to be careful about actually *using* that number for anything. Escape velocity is to escape to \u0022infinity\u0022 in real physics, which doesn\u0027t apply in KSP because of patched conics. Kerbin\u0027s gravity totally ceases at the boundary of its SoI, so really what you should be calculating is \u0022how much energy do I need to be able to get to the boundary of the SoI\u0022. However, the Vesc will be pretty close to that, so it\u0027s good enough as a first-level approximation.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Then we find \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, or the total change in m/s required at periapsis to achieve the desired final velocity\n\nI\u0027m confused. Why would you do any calculation here? The answer is 1920 m/s. \u0022How much dV do I need to get 1920 m/s dV\u0022 is a question that has already answered itself. Bear in mind that 1920 isn\u0027t any kind of \u0022desired final velocity\u0022 (for example, it\u0027s not the velocity you exit Kerbin\u0027s SoI with). It\u0027s simply the extra velocity above-and-beyond LKO orbital velocity that is needed to get to Jool. It has nothing to do with the Kerbin-relative velocity that you have when you pass the SoI boundary.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E using:\n\u003E \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = sqrt(Vf^2 \u002B Vesc^2) - sqrt(Vh^2 \u002B Vesc^2)\n\u003E \n\u003E where:\n\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = amount of burn at periapsis\n\u003E \n\u003E Vf = final velocity target [1920 m/s (Jool Intercept) \u002B 2280m/s (your current velocity) = 4,200m/s]\n\u003E \n\u003E Vh = initial velocity before burn = 2,280 m/s [orbital speed at 80km]\n\nI\u0027m not sure where you\u0027re getting the equation that I highlighted in red, above. The \u0022\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u0022 in \u0022\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u0022 simply means \u0022amount of change.\u0022\n\nThe correct equation there doesn\u0027t involve any square roots or whatever, it\u0027s just\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = Vf - Vh\n\n...i.e. 1920 m/s.\n\nAlso not sure why you\u0027re adding in Vesc to your equations above.\n\nSo the bottom line: Yasmy\u0027s correct, due to explanation there. I can tell that you\u0027re making a mistaken assumption somewhere (because you get radically different numbers) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ... but it\u0027s hard to pinpoint exactly what the mistaken assumption is, because you present the highlighted equation without any additional information-- if you could describe what you\u0027re trying to calculate and why (i.e. where you get that equation from, or how you derived it), that would be helpful.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSo here\u0027s how to set up the math:\n\nR0 = radius of Kerbin LKO, i.e. 680,000 m\n\nR1 = radius of Kerbin SoI, i.e. 84,159,286 m\n\nRk = radius of Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun, i.e. 13,599,840,256 m\n\nRj = radius of Jool\u0027s orbit around the sun, i.e. 68,773,560,320 m (I\u0027m using semi-major axis as an approximation, since Jool\u0027s orbit is slightly elliptical)\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BCk = G\\*M for Kerbin, i.e. 3.5316000\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^12^ m^3^/s^2^\n\n\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BCs = G\\*M for sun, i.e. 1.1723328\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D10^18^ m^3^/s^2^\n\nSo with that in mind, here\u0027s how you would set up the math:\n\n1. Imagine that Kerbin doesn\u0027t exist. You\u0027re orbiting the sun at Rk, and you want to boost your solar apoapsis up to Rj. How much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv do you need? Call this Vt (for \u0022transfer). You calculate this as follows:\n\n- work out solar orbital velocity for circular solar orbit at Rs\n\n- work out the periapsis velocity for an elliptical orbit with periapsis at Rs and apoapsis at Rj\n\n- Vt = the difference between these two\n\n2. This Vt is how much velocity you need to exit Kerbin\u0027s SoI with.\n\n3. For the non-Oberth (i.e. wasteful, foolish) way to get to Jool: Work out how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv you need to get from LKO to the boundary of Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Call this Vesc. It\u0027s the difference between \u0022orbital velocity at R0\u0022 and \u0022periapsis velocity for elliptical orbit with periapsis at R0 and apoapsis at R1\u0022. This will be pretty close to the theoretical Vesc that ignores patched conics. Add Vt \u002B Vesc, this gives you \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv needed for a \u0022non-Oberth\u0022 transfer.\n\n4. Now let\u0027s try bringing in Oberth. \u0022I\u0027m traveling at V1 at R0, and I want to be going Vt at R1, how much faster than V1 do I need to go?\u0022 This is the number that will work out to about 1920 m/s if you have correctly calculated Vt.\n\n5. Compare Vt \u002B Vesc (calculated in step 3) with the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv calculated in step 4. This tells you how much you saved from Oberth effect."},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T21:29:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What is the proper way to calculate the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv gained because of the [Oberth Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect)?\n\nYou want to calculate the gain of the oberth effect between two flight paths.\n\nIn your second calculation you compate the two flight paths\n\n- Burn in LKO directly to a Jool-intercept\n\n- Burn to get out of Kerbins SOI and burn to Jool after leaving Kerbins SOI\n\nAnd the numbers match [my experience](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80857-A-Delta-V-Map-for-simple-flightpaths).\n\nIn the description of your first calculation I can not see which two flight paths you do compare and also have problems understanding the reasoning for this equation:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = sqrt(Vf^2 \u002B Vesc^2) - sqrt(Vh^2 \u002B Vesc^2)\n\nPerhaps the following helps you to see the connection to the escape velocity:\n\nYou can calculate the dv needed for a LKO-Burn to Jool via Escape velocities in the following way (which was also used in this thread to [calculate ideal refueling orbits](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75542?p=1072850\u0026viewfull=1#post1072850))\n\nTo do this calculation, the first step is to calculate the speed Ve you need at the SOI change.\n\nFor this use the [Vis-Viva equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation) for an orbit around Kerbol with Periapsis @ Kerbin and Apoapsis @ Jool to calculate the speed at Periapsis.\n\nSubtract from that number the velocity that Kerbin has around Kerbol and you get the velocity Ve =2760m/s.\n\nNext step is to calculate the [semi-major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis) a=-468623 of the orbit of an object around Kerbin that has a velocity Ve at Kerbins SOI.

It was the most approachable math I found (including examples) that claimed to address the problem I thought I was trying to solve (how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv am I saving).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T03:34:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 03:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anglave**\n  \nadded link to Yasmy\u0027s work"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T21:52:23Z","Content":"Seems like Anglave\u0027s equation, \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = sqrt(Vf^2 \u002B Vesc^2) - sqrt(Vh^2 \u002B Vesc^2) comes from [http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/mission.php](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/mission.php).\n\nIt is really not clear at all what the equation is for. It appears to describe a situation where you are already on a zero energy (KE = -PE) escape to infinity trajectory headed towards the sun at some far remove from periapsis, say at radius R. It then describes the velocity increase at radius R on the other side of periapsis after performing a burn at periapsis. It compares that to making an immediate burn at your current location. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s entirely correct. I get something slightly different. (Conserve energy before the burn as you go from R to periapsis. Burn. Conserve energy after the burn as you go from periapsis back to R. Find the periapsis burn needed to equal a local burn.)\n\nA little further down on the same page is the more appropriate equation to use: \n\ndeltavee = \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1(v\\_inf^2 \u002B v\\_esc^2) - v\\_cir\n\nv\\_inf = velocity just before exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI = 2.8 km/s\n\nv\\_esc = Kerbin escape velocity = 3.2 km/s\n\nv\\_cir = 2.2 km/s\n\ndeltavee = sqrt(2.8^2 \u002B 3.2^2) - 2.2 = 2.0 km/s\n\nThe savings would be v\\_inf \u002B (v\\_esc - v\\_cir) - deltavee = 2.8 \u002B (3.2-2.2) - 2.0 = 1.8 km/s\n\nThis deltavee is close to the 1920 m/s figure we were using, and the saving are close to the 1.7 km/s I calculated before.\n\nNote though that Snark is correct in pointing out that things are slightly different in the patched conic system KSP uses.\n\nThe equations from the linked article will be wrong where you cross SOI boundaries. They are fine for operating inside an SOI.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T22:01:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yasmy**"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:03:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv = sqrt(Vf^2 \u002B Vesc^2) - sqrt(Vh^2 \u002B Vesc^2)\n\nI believe this equation is used in the case that (inaccuracies caused by KSP\u0027s patched conics)\n\n- you enter Kerbins SOI with a speed of Vh\n\n- want to exit its SOI with a speed of Vf\n\n- want to calculate the dV needed to make this happen by a single burn at periapsis\n\nSo this formula does not fit to the situation you want to calculate."},{"CreatedByName":"Anglave","CreatedById":62706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:14:51Z","Content":"Thank you all for your informative and illuminating answers.
