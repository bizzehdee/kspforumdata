This SHOULD get you just enough to pull off teh contract, although i dont use basic jets much myself so i can really tell how effective thisll be."},{"CreatedByName":"Poofer","CreatedById":110117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:07:55Z","Content":"not very effective, i tried this earlier yesterday with 5 engines.

Seems they loss enough thrust around 12.5-13k that my planes started losing speed even at full throttle. I am not sure how well the aero is modeled and not sure if the wings start losing lift as your plane ascends. They diffently are not as effient at higher speeds.\n\nI acepted a contract requiring me to reach 16.5 k at the lowest and 18.5 k at the highest. I currently only have the first jet engines. My first attempt failed which was doing what I normal would in previous releases which was build up enough speed to reach those altitudes and coast up to them. I only tried twice and the highest I reached was around 15.5k.\n\nI decided to try to design a realiable aircraft that can reach those altitudes every time powered the whole way. My first attempt is going to be adding more engines to make up for the loss of thrust. My first attempt seems promising but has a limited range since I was trying to save weight. I think with some tweaking I could get it up to around 15k, but the range is limited enough that completeing contracts with it would require some careful planing or just completing 1/2 the areas I am required to get temp readings and not have enough fuel to return to the KSC.\n\nI may go with rocket assited plane. I\u0027ll use jets to get to 13k and rockets to go the rest of the way. I actually think this would be the easiest way, but I waant to see how far I can keep a plane flying under it\u0027s own power and stable with the early jets."}]}
