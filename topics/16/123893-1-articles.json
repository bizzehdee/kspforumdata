I\u0027m using 4 wheesley\u0027s to give power, a lot of wing surface to provide lifting of heavy body. And (right now) a swivel engine in the middle to do the \u0022final\u0022 stage. This middle engine is to be updated once I\u0027ve unlocked the mainsail/skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eall 4(! I also tried with just 2) vertical control surfaces are positioned far from center. This is done on purpose and I wish to keep that, it\u0027s so I can add a payload on top of this aircraft. (Think about the Antanov 225).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the problem I\u0027m experiences first is that I can\u0027t seem to stay in a stable linear line with this aircraft. It first of all has a constant tendency to go to the left, more than sas can fix so I always end op trying to fix this. Then around 70-90m/s I experience a very slight turn and it suddenly goes out of control: quickly turning off the runway and crashing. This happens either to the left if I don\u0027t fix the turning manually, or to the right if I do fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust after the turn:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2bXrm9l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222bXrm9l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing: in the few cases I did manage to lift off I notice I can\u0027t seem to go above a speed of 400 m/s, or an altitude of 8 km (well I can, but 8km seems the altitude ceiling for a level cruise flight, at about 250 m/s). Should I just put such a design out of my head until I unlock a better engine?

Been there, got the T-shirt, as they say... I wish I had learned this a lot sooner than I did, but in 1989, I spent several months building a tractor canard, of all things for my senior project. The thing that proved fatal for it was lack of design work on the landing gear. Since I can\u0027t see your LG in the pics, I\u0027ll have to make a couple assumptions, but they\u0027re probably pretty spot on... The yellow arrows on your rudders show the torque that they are applying to try to correct the unwanted yaw, which looks correct for an aircraft in that situation. Your vertical surfaces will not affect this as long as you have enough and they are not rotated about the yaw axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - I\u0027m guessing your nose gear is way far forward of the CG, expecting that to improve your command authority over the unwanted torque. Move it back. I would put it just forward of the aft end of the forward FL-T800 tank. If it\u0027s already there, then leave it - the mains are the real problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - oh wait, I do see your mains now. I was going to guess they were just inside the outside pair of engines at nearly the same station as CL. You would think (as I did in 1989) that this would give you lots of stability, and it\u0027s fine for sitting on the runway. However, when moving, any unbalanced force hitting one of those wheels produces a lot more torque about your yaw axis because of the distance. You have to find a balance. I would have the wheels hitting the ground no further out than the outside edge of the inner pair of engines. Should still be plenty stable on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext thing you need to do is check the limits of your CG. In the SPH, use the right-click menu to drop the fuel and ox level down to 0 (hopefully you already have ox at 0 in all tanks, since you are only running air breathing engines. Then slowly drain the next tank back until the CG stops going back and begins coming forward again. If you get to 0 before the CG stops moving, then continue to remove all fuel forward of the CG until the CG stops moving aft. This will show you the aft limit of the CG. If it is aft of the CL, then you need to move some wings aft or the aircraft will flip at that point in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you\u0027ve done that, you can worry about the engine. Someone already mentioned the Wheesley not being the greatest jet around, but you should check it\u0027s right-click menu during flight. It will show you how much thrust it is producing and when it flames out and why. I think you might improve your altitude with more intakes, but I would be surprised if you got much increase on the speed unless you switch to ramjets or rapiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnusualAttitude","CreatedById":129962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T13:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022paul23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell I just installed KCT - so reusability is a pre nowadays ;P\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding a lo-tech spaceplane with a useful payload around just Wheesleys is probably not possible.

Separate your payload, switch to it and circularize, then switch back to the launcher to re-enter and fly back to KSC for full recovery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be more trouble than it\u0027s worth in a normal career game.
