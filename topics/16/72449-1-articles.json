After returning 2 goos or bays you will have maxed it. Also, you can now remove science from your sensors and store it in your command pod. As a result, they had to make it inoperable after removal or transmitting to balance the game. The purpose of the mpl is to clean out your experiments so they can be used again. You can put an mpl in orbit around the mun with a fuel tank, then run back and forth with your lander, refueling the lander and cleaning the experiments. It allows you to get half the biomes in a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T16:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lab is indeed a bit iffy. It can work out lighter to just pack multiple Goo and Materials bays. However, it does make viable an approach of run experiment, transmit, clean, run again, store. That gives you science now rather than having to wait for the mission return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest benefit though IMHO is that it can store multiple runs of the same experiment in the same setting, which you need for most to max out the science. Pods can\u0027t store such repeat experiments, unless you take multiple, but then you start to get heavier than the lab. Just be careful on landing, the lab\u0027s fragile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try it on a Kerballed one-way mission, but for most places the weight is probably better used to do an ultralight return mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T18:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kulebron\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kulebron\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI did not touch science since 0.22, so now things really changed, and I have questions.\u003Cp\u003E1.

And in addition to these parts becoming inoperable after transmitting, for most experiment types you can only get a max of 40% of the total points via transmission. The idea behind all this was to force you to return experiments for full analysis on Kerbin. The mobile lab is there to make this a bit more feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2.
