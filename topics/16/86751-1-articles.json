(Let\u0027s say \u0022playable\u0022 means something like \u0022possible to complete tech tree, before kerbals or self die of old age or get taken off to the loony bin.\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m asking because when I fired up 0.25 for the first time, I started a career with all General Options set to off, and all sliders set to the most extreme settings (10% rewards, 1,000% penalties, 0 starting funds and science, -1,000 starting reputation). I\u0027ve completed 9 contracts so far (some with two- or even one-figure payouts in funds), and got Jeb into space, but am not sure I\u0027ll be able to get much farther, with a current fund balance of 6,904 and few contracts available that will so much as pay for the parts--or even the fuel!--expended to complete them. And of course from the start I\u0027ve only ever been one failure away from the program shutting down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Reputation\u0027s already all the way up to -915 though.
