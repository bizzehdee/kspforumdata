The mainsail is not very fuel efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can judge rocket engine fuel efficiency by looking at the value named I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E (meaning specific impulse). It is a measure of how \u0022hard\u0022 the engine throws its reaction mass out the back, and thus, how much forward momentum you gain from it doing so. Engines with a high specific impulse can get you more total acceleration (and thus a higher final speed) out of the same amount of fuel than those with low specific impulse ratings. Therefore, I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E is functionally identical to a car\u0027s \u0022gas mileage\u0022 spec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo not confuse this with thrust, however. Total acceleration is one thing, but thrust describes how \u003Cem\u003Equickly\u003C/em\u003E you get it. Engines with high I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E (like the LV-N) tend to have low thrust, and engines with high thrust (like the mainsail) tend to have low I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E. In your case, you benefit from switching to smaller, higher I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E engines because you apparently did not need all the thrust the mainsail provided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust and I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E are interrelated when determining actual fuel consumption. You pay X amount of fuel per second for every kN of thrust, and the X is determined by I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E. If you have two engines with exactly the same I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, and one generates 200 kN of thrust while another does 400 kN, then the second one will consume exactly twice as much fuel per second as the first. But if the second one had a lower I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, as high thrust engines usually do, then it would have to spend more than twice the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, rocket engines have two I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E values: \u0022ASL\u0022 (atmospheric sea level) describes what you get on the launchpad, and \u0022Vac\u0022 (vacuum) describes what you get outside the atmosphere. The second value is always larger because the presence of an atmosphere causes backpressure on the rocket engine\u0027s exhaust which lowers its efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T11:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to put the small fuel tanks between the main tank and the engines, just so that I can have fuel crossfeed without any major headaches (plus I feel they look nicer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6BQ9HLK.png\u0022 alt=\u00226BQ9HLK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T12:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat requires enabling part clipping via the dev menu though, doesn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T14:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd yes, the stock quad adaptor has flow issues going in reverse.

With the 2x adaptor, you get the same as above, flameout about 30km at 0 IntakeAir. If you use the 3x or 4x adaptors, however, things are different. The Resource tab shows the huge amount of IntakeAir you\u0027d expect from all these intakes. HOWEVER, the engine will only use 1 of the intakes. Thus, the engine will flame out at 23km even though the Resource tab still shows like 2.5 IntakeAir remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T19:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, suppose you put the intakes on adaptors.

Only the 2x adaptor works correctly with intakes.\u003Cp\u003EConsider the RAPIER engine with automatic switching and not using adaptors. If you have 1 intake per engine, it will flame out about 23km. If you have 2 intakes per engine, it won\u0027t flame out until 30km or so.

Different results for different users, just like in real life. So like I can\u0027t get the Kraken drives to work for me even when I download ships that I\u0027ve seen work perfectly in videos and I do the same maneuvers with them, now you can\u0027t reproduce my results.
