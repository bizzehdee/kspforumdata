There is no net acceleration happening anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe debris in your game stays in orbit because there is no atmosphere acting on it. You may think: but it goes through the atmosphere! And that is correct. But there is still no atmosphere acting on it, because the piece of debris isn\u0027t being actively simulated. When you left the piece behind, it was set \u0022on rails\u0022: its orbital parameters were saved, and it continues to use them until the next time it starts being actively simulated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly objects within ~2.5 km of the player are actively simulated. All other objects remain \u0022on rails\u0022 and completely ignore physics, with the sole exception of collisions with celestial bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in order for the atmosphere to slow the piece of debris, you need to go to the tracking station, select the debris, and press \u0022fly\u0022. You will then load the debris piece in space. You will of course not be able to do anything with it, but simply because you are looking at it, it will be subject to physics again. Now timewarp until you encounter the atmosphere, and watch it get slowed properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this takes time, so I use a different method... I simply delete all debris pieces with a periapsis inside the atmosphere instead of riding every single one of them down to the ground everytime I launched something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T13:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust another note, any unattended object in Kerbin orbit with periapis below 30 (35)? kilometres will be deleted (simulating deorbit because of atmosphere braking).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T15:10:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought that\u0027s much lower, more like below 20 km or so...?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-03T15:12:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2015 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T15:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it\u0027s at least 25 because that is what I deorbit debris at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T15:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it not be cool if we could lower that value to 10m or so - set something into a 1000m PE to orbit above KSC - watch it enter the physics bubble and burn up? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T15:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they expanded or at least made the physics bubble variable depending on situations, in one of the last few updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
