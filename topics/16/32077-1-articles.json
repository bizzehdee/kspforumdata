Yeah I said minmus, but I\u0027m sure the design can be retro fitted with LV-Ns\u0027 instead of a poodle and 909\u0027s for places like duna and eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the top part of it that makes it into orbit. The side mounted ditch tanks are usually used up to circularize \u002B inclination burn. Leaving a mostly full poodle afterwards. Which is used up to get to minmus and about a 6th of the lander fuel to get there. You should still have at least at half fuel on said landing, \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E more than enough to get back to kerbin. So it could double as a refueler/tanker. The top part is the CM which has the initial crew held. Once a safe orbit has been established they will transfer to the LM. Afterwards the CM jettisons with a probe core and the two small fuel tanks, (little grey and round orange) which has enough to deorbit it self. Once the crew starts the inclination and transfer burn in which the ditch tanks jettison (or you could keep them if you want to use it as a tanker!) then the poodle is used up and is undocked when empty.
