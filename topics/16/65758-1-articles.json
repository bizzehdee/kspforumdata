The design would consist of a habitation module to provide accommodation for at least 10 kerbals, connected to two XL girders, with a clampotron on the end. then a single \u0022balance\u0022 module, and a single orange fuel tank attached at the opposite side, this one also has two XL girders and a clampotron. this balance tank attaches to the opposite side of the hub from the habitation module, the central hub then has two utility booms attached to the top bottom, which would each consist of two girders and with a whole crapload of batteries, and solar panels on each one, although they would be identical in order to keep balance. Then on the back of the hub I would have a fuel store consisting of 3 orange tanks with a central clampotron, and on the opposite side from the fuel store I would have a long XL girder boom with a single clampotron on the end. The idea is that when the habitation module, balance module and utility booms are attached the whole thing begins to rotate, at which point I balance the whole station by dumping fuel from the balance tank until the center of mass and indeed the center of rotation is in the exact middle of the Hub at this point the I increase the speed of the rotation until I achieve 1G for my kerbinauts. This then allows me to attach the fuel tanks and any radially symmetrical vessels while the station is still in rotation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few questions, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirstly - the game would freeze the rotation of the vessel as soon as I timewarp how can I prevent that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly - are clampotrons strong enough to achieve my goals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally - would I need to match to rotational speed of the station when I dock with it, or would it allow me a little tolerance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E or would it simply be safer to stop the rotation?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-14T09:33:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2014 09:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FREEFALL1984\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T09:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tend to build stations fairly similar to that, about the only bit of advice I\u0027d give would be consider moving as much mass as your practically can to the central hub.

The background might make you a little dizzy, but if you just focus on the station it\u0027s just like normal docking.
