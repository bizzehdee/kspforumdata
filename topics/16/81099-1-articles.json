A very eccentric, elliptical one, with its periapsis deep under the surface. In map view, if you zoom out sufficiently, you can often even see that ellipse. And you are near its apoapsis. The best thing you can do at that spot is raise your periapsis, that means getting into circular orbit with Pe/Ap at these few meters above ground where you are just at the moment.
