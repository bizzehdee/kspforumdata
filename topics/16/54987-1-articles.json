Let us assume you already have a ship that can get into LKO. From there, all you need is about 900-1000 more m/s to get into a free-return trajectory to Mun and back into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. This might not even require a modification to your existing orbiter design if it\u0027s already somewhat over-engineered. Anyway, such a flyby, glomming up all the science in both high (just inside the SOI) and low Munar orbits (near Pe) will get you enough points to make a lander next time. Do the same for Minmus. Then land on Minmus before Mun because Minmus requires much less of a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T16:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETier 3...are you referring to General Rocketry/Stability/Survivability, or are you beyond that?
