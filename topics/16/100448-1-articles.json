That means a rocket stage needs less mass of engines, and that means more delta-V.\n\nThe Isp is good enough. It\u0027s not so bad as to undo the benefits of the high TWR.\n\nIt\u0027s small. That means it can be used on all sorts of craft, unlike say the KR-2L that\u0027s only any good on really big stuff.\n\nIn career mode it\u0027s the cheapest engine available, and you also unlock it early."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T21:17:22Z","Content":"The high TWR is significant because it actually translates into dV.\n\nAll other engines have less TWR, and thus add more dry mass to the vessel. That means that in many situations, even engines with a higher Isp actually give you *less* dV than the 48-7S, especially if you carry only small amounts of fuel. Even the LV-909, which has 40 Isp more in vacuum, doesn\u0027t reach dV parity until the tanks get larger than most typical LV-909 missions require."},{"CreatedByName":"Wabbit","CreatedById":110502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T21:25:49Z","Content":"This thing puts the LV-1 out of business.

The LFB has a higher TWR than the 48-7S, the KR-2L has a higher TWR and a higher vacuum Isp, and the KS-25x4 has a higher TWR and a higher Isp.
