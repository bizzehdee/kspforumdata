A rover can sometimes look fine in the SPH, but grounds out when you try and take it for a spin. I\u0027ve found an angled girder segment between the Rover body and wheel can help. It might also be worth using the subassemblies screen so you can get the same set up front and back (assuming you\u0027re using mirror symmetry)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
