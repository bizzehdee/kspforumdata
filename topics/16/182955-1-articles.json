Physwarp only goes up to 4x time, and it is dangerous. It exists for people who are desperately impatient to waste their time playing a game,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eefficiently.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0The reason it is dangerous is because large craft can become physically unstable and explode. Alternately, craft can sink into the ground and explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo mine, your craft has to be at a standstill. So timewarp always works for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are getting very little output from mining, it might be because you have no engineer on your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoatRider","CreatedById":103681,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T02:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference between time warp and physics warp is that time warp only simulates the position of your entire craft, and only checks for gravity and intersection with planets. It\u0027s very simple to compute, which is why it goes up to 100,000x.\u00A0Physics warp simulates everything, including intersection with every part with the surface, battery charge, thrust, fuel levels, etc. So it\u0027s much more processor intensive, which is why it only goes up to 4x. Even then, it takes shortcuts that can make mistakes and cause things to blow up that wouldn\u0027t at 1x.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s one exception to time warp- mining operations. IF you go on time warp more than 6 hours, it calculates mining. I think it takes some shortcuts on that, but if you stop timewarp before 6 hours, it resets and you don\u0027t get any mining results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elroy Jetson","CreatedById":195588,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T03:56:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys, that makes sense now. \u00A0I did eventually find some info in the wiki, I searched on physwarp and it doesn\u0027t find anything, but I think if you spell out the word physics it does find the entry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand I think part of my problem was indeed with my crew member. \u00A0I had a scientist AND an engineer on Mimnus but during one session I did have the engineer running the drill and most recently he was not, hence the low production.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for the help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
