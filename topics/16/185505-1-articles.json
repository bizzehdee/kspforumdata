Why is that so? I\u0027m guessing its something to do with the heatshield having higher drag than the top of the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-15T10:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you asking why it doesn\u0027t slow down enough with the pointy end first, or why it flips?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-15T11:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt flips and it doesn\u0027t slow down as fast --\u00A0because aerodynamics depends on shape.
