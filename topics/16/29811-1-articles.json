If you have more drag behind your CoM than in front of it, your craft will naturally \u0022weather-vane\u0022 and keep the pointy end out front. This is positive stability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the majority of your drag is in front of the CoM, the craft will actively try to spin around backwards. This is negative stability, and is pretty much never desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the drag is perfectly centered on the CoM, your craft has no preferred orientation in respect to the airflow. A neutrally stable craft is extremely maneuverable and even harder to keep pointed in the direction you want to go, which is great for fighters and aerobatics, but not so good if you are trying to go space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you put the CoM too far out in front of the center of drag, the craft can become so positively stable that it becomes difficult to make it turn.
