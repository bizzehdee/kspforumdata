So as I was working my way through my first game of .90 I unlocked my first probe core and received a contract for a historic satellite launch. I tried and tried to fly the thing to orbit with out an SAS system. Man it was hard. I mean really hard. I finally just gave up. \n\nAre there any hints out there as to how to fly a mission like this? I\u0027m stumped. What can you really do with this core?\n\nSo I kind of like the idea of it not having it\u0027s own gyro. I did have one on this attempt by the way. I can\u0027t imagine what it would have been like with out that. The total lack of an SAS just killed me. As an alternative let me make a suggestion. What if the SAS on the Stayputnik core could not communicate with a gyro, but it could operate the controls on the engine and the aerodynamic surfaces. I mean even the V-2 could point it self along a trajectory and hold a heading with the engine running or with wind over the fins. The Sputnik may not have had reaction wheels but I don\u0027t think they could have ever launched it with out any form of guidance. \n\nAm I missing any tricks or is any one else frustrated with this?\n\nLee"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T20:57:13Z","Content":"The issue you are having is not uncommon, however, might I suggest that you add more control authority? also, instead of doing your normal pitch over at 10km (assuming stock aero) pitch over just a little and let gravity do the rest.it\u0027s more inefficient, but you will get to orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T22:07:47Z","Content":"Using the caps lock key for finer/lighter control can help. It\u0027s not easy, but I managed to complete a satellite contract with a Stayputnik.\n\nOf course, given the choice, I\u0027ll take an Octo2 and a small reaction wheel any day! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T01:04:15Z","Content":"The Stayputnik has no automatic controlling authority in Beta 0.90.

You won\u0027t be able to manouvre much (so get pitched over a bit in the right direction before too much spin builds up), but you can hold direction easily.\n\nEither give it some torque and mash the Q or E key the whole way up, or add some tailfins with a bit of angle to them (like the feathers on a dart or arrow).\n\nTry it, it works; it\u0027s what they did with early real-world rockets, and it\u0027s how rifle bullets work."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T02:59:22Z","Content":"Also note that holding prograde is easy while you\u0027re running with boosters on the tail second, due to their higher drag coefficient. Of course, if you have parachutes near the nose, the instant you lose those boosters you\u0027re going to have a fair bit of trouble since they\u0027re ALSO higher-drag parts (though not to the same extent)."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T03:31:29Z","Content":"It has its uses, but sofar ive found the thing to be more pain then bother. Personally i wouldnt have made it have no SAS, since it has now become a probe core that i never even bother using for anything at all besides space mines (little things that shoot decouplers in all directions, dont need sas for those after they are deployed from a carrier). Even in career, when i did my 1st sat contract early game, i used a manned thing to get teh satelite up there, then deorbited kerbal for extra science/xp"},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T09:23:41Z","Content":"Some of this has been good advice and I thank you but I\u0027m still having trouble. The spin thing does help particularly during the initial boost through the atmosphere. Along with fins it keeps me on the prograde vector so if I get it tilted over just right, more luck then I would like, I can do a gravity turn during the initial launch. I can\u0027t seem to get it to work for the orbital burn. With out the atmosphere I still can\u0027t keep it on a direction. I may just not be getting it in a stable enough spin Or maybe the physics model doesn\u0027t allow for this but eventually it tumbles as I try to do that insertion. \n\nI think the changes to this part have just been a failure.\n\nLee"}]}
