Mainsails will rip apart unstruted rockets easily but just because you strut up a few tanks it doesn\u0027t mean the rocket is safe. That energy is transfered further up to the next weak connection so you can still have some wobble/breakage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good base for a fuel depot would be an actual center core of the lifting rocket with docking ports to add more stuff later.
