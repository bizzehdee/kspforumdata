Does the physics model go in to this level of detail, ot is the strength the same in both directions? It would seem intuitive that they should be stronger in tension.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T05:58:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 05:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norcalplanner**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T00:59:52Z","Content":"It\u0027s counterintuitive, but once I noticed that struts can act as sticks or girders, I started to regularly use them as such and never noticed any difference. Which doesn\u0027t mean there is none, of course. But it\u0027s certainly not obvious; and knowing a thing or two about programming, I\u0027m inclined to believe that it really doesn\u0027t matter if you push or pull."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:50:30Z","Content":"I think they don\u0027t care about direction at all. Which implies they\u0027re just in strong in shear as well.\n\nWhich, as a structural engineer, twists my head around the wrong way every time I have to deal with it."},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T02:08:44Z","Content":"They just add stiffness and increase the breaking limit of whatever part(s) they are attached to. I don\u0027t think KSP goes that deep into compression / elasticity / shear on those things.\n\nThe Firespitter biplane cables and the wood wing struts do exactly the same thing, just look different and have different mass."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T02:57:43Z","Content":"Well, they don\u0027t exactly change the strengths of the part they are attached to in terms of that part\u0027s breaking force and totorque. They add joints for the physics engine to distribute forces to. So yes, the increase the overall strength, but they don\u0027t change the values for an individual part.\n\nThere are only two breaking forces specified. Breaking Force, and Breaking Torque. Based on the physics engine, I don\u0027t think there is a difference in tension vs. compression, but there is a torque value.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T05:57:20Z","Content":"Thanks for the info, everyone.
