My capsule made it, but i\u0027m sure it was mere millikelvins away from catastroflaming to pieces itself.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u0027s perfectly possible to enter without a heatshield. I\u0027ve done it on kerbin multiple times (on purpose!) when i had a tight part counr budget. Just make sure you spend a lot of time high up. Burning retro around 40000m also helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T14:26:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:31:26Z","Content":"Your angle of re-entry will affect how much of the ablator is used. It will take practice to figure out how much you really need and if you consistently land your own craft with 50% ablator remaining, then you could certainly remove some to save on mass. I\u0027m inclined to be conservative though and keep it all on just in case something bad happens. Also, you may have a situation where you need to use the shield more than once (aerobrake to gain orbit, and then re-entry to land)."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:07:46Z","Content":"Took a heat shield down a couple of notches last night - by which I mean I had 198 out of 200 left at the end.

So heating causing it to deteriorate for 2 points is something you don\u0027t need a heatshield for. Generally flat reentries supported by chutes don\u0027t need heat shields, they are for more aggressive angles."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:27:59Z","Content":"Cranked up the heating to maximum (120%) and still nothing or only few units lost.
