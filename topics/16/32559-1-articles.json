I can\u0027t tell you much about your capacity given your supplied fuel stats, but I can tell you that you need less than 1000 or so delta v of fuel to reach gilly, and almost no thrust to weight ratio to land. Furthermore from gilly, it takes less than 500 delta v to return to kerbin using an eve gravity assist, so in theory, it will take only a tiny bit more fuel (between 400 and 700dv worth) to land on and return from gilly en-route to kerbin than it will take to go to kerbin directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the method: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) wait until gilly is in the right position around eve for a hohmann intercept from your current orbit. This will require a lot of guesswork and maneuver node experimentation. Set gilly as a target and pop maneuver nodes to prograde to get an orbital intercept and look to see where gilly will be when you get there... and if it\u0027s too far behind in orbit, wait another revolution around eve and try again. If you\u0027re close, fine-tune it by tinkering with your prograde and radial burns to bring your arc out and get an intercept with the right timing. expect around 800dv if you do it close to the middle of gilly\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) fine tune your approach because gilly has a very small SOI, so you want to come in real close, but avoid hitting any mountains. Don\u0027t worry too much about inclination until this point. Inclination burns cost fuel, though you can adjust it almost for free on capture if you do it right as soon as you enter gilly\u0027s SOI. It doesn\u0027t need to be perfect, but the closer you can get it to 0 inclination around gilly, the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) circularizing burn. Here\u0027s where you need some TWR since you have a very small burn window and will shoot past fast. I couldn\u0027t do it with my ion powered mapsat, but you can with your LVN most likely. it takes less than 200 dv IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) landing and takeoff is straightforward. gilly has almost no gravity. Make sure your landing craft has a wide enough base to not float off the surface and tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) return is the hard part... because of gilly\u0027s eccentric orbit, you\u0027ll need to find a kerbin return window that is compatible with your position in gilly\u0027s orbit. You want to do it when gilly is near it\u0027s apoapsis and eve is near opposite from kerbol while kerbin is at the right phase angle all at the same time. You might need to skip a window or two waiting for this to happen. When it does, burn to gilly\u0027s retrograde to drop down to an eve orbit with a periapsis just above eve\u0027s atmosphere (~250dv). Hopefully you get lucky with inclination (might want to quicksave first). Then wait until you reach the periapsis before doing your ejection burn from eve to maximize the oberth effect and put you on an intercept with kerbin (~150dv) and the rest is just nailing your kerbin approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T13:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...if I\u0027m doing the math right, assuming I don\u0027t use \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E RCS fuel, I\u0027ve got about 6400 m/s of delta-V remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s assuming one unit of liquid fuel plus one unit of oxidizer has a mass of 1/200 of a tonne and one unit of monoprop has a mass of 1/250 of a tonne, and 800 Isp from the LV-Ns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Thus I\u0027m carrying 55.205 tonnes of fuel for the thrusters and 11.664 tonnes of RCS fuel - yes, I know I\u0027ve got waaaaaay to much RCS, but it\u0027s saved my bacon more times than I can count)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in Eve orbit. 1650 delta-V to get to Gilly, 210 to orbit, 35 to land, 35 to launch, 210 to get back to orbit, another 1650 to get back to Eve, 1310 to orbit Eve, and then 1030 to get back to Kerbin. 6130 total.

That said if you have anywhere near that much delta v you can very easily do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do NOT need to expend more than 250 delta v to get back to eve, and you are not circularizing at eve but rather just using it as a gravity assist to reach kerbin, thus dropping your *total required delta v* to reach kerbin from the surface of gilly to less than 400. It really is *that low*, so give or take a little on fudge factor you should be perfectly fine doing it that way. Furthermore reaching gilly shouldn\u0027t take that much delta v either unless you\u0027re intercepting at the absolute worst point in its orbit (and if that\u0027s an option, then intercepting at the absolute best point also is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother poster mentioned just burning to escape from gilly prograde, and then doing a hohmann transfer from kerbol orbit. If you have as much fuel as you say you do, you can do that too. I mentioned using the slingshot maneuver because it dramatically reduces the fuel necessary to bring your kerbol apoapsis up to kerbin intercept, so the difference in required fuel between landing on gilly and not landing on gilly is minimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause you\u0027re in a polar orbit (and gilly is highly eccentric), the phase angle calculators do not apply, and it won\u0027t be a proper hohmann transfer. What you need to do is guesstimate when gilly and your ship will cross planes. Set it as a target, and you\u0027ll want to intercept at the ascending or descending node. Timing is critical because you\u0027re not in the same plane as your target. To time it, create a maneuver node opposite from the planned point of intercept to burn to prograde and bring your apoapsis up until it intersects with gilly\u0027s orbital line, and the intercept markers appear on the map. There will be a marker for your ship and a marker for gilly. If they\u0027re far apart (gilly\u0027s marker is still way back behind your intercept on its orbital path) you\u0027ll need to cancel the node and rotate around eve some more to let gilly get closer to your intercept point to try again. If the markers are close together, but you don\u0027t get capture, try adding some radial thrust from eve into the burn. This will push your orbital line out away from eve, thereby adding a tad more time before your intercept and allowing gilly to catch up. You just have to adjust your node\u0027s prograde/retrograde to keep your orbits intersecting so you can tinker with the burn until your intersect markers get close enough to get an encounter. Once you have an encounter, just do your burn at the node, and then set up a second node to fine-tune your approach and make sure you\u0027re still on target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I take back what I said about inclination change in my previous post. Because you\u0027re entering gilly SOI perpendicular to its plane, it is not possible to improve your inclination on capture. Instead, to minimize delta v of the inclination change before your ejection burn, try to land near gilly\u0027s equator and then takeoff into a 0 inclination orbit to the east.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-12T18:44:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2013 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Colonel_Panic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T18:56:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, at Gilly\u0027s orbital altitude he could do an inclination change pretty cheap while he\u0027s circularizing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T19:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022foamyesque\u0022 data-cite=\u0022foamyesque\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEh, at Gilly\u0027s orbital altitude he could do an inclination change pretty cheap while he\u0027s circularizing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat has nothing to do with gilly\u0027s orbital altitude but rather gilly\u0027s low gravity.
