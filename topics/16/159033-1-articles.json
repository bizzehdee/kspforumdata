You\u0027re pretty much out of the atmosphere at this point, so drag losses aren\u0027t a problem. Unless you\u0027re having attitude control (steering) issues at a higher throttle setting, there\u0027s really no reason to not \u0022stand on the gas\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running an older version of the game at the moment, back when the atmosphere of Kerbin had a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0more drag to it. And even in that environment, I have almost always pitched all the way over to 90 degrees by about 30 - 35 km. In this picture you\u0027re at 55 km and still only pitched over to about 45 degrees. For the purposes of getting to orbit, your rocket\u0027s velocity can be neatly split into two components-- horizontal and vertical. Any energy you spend in the vertical direction is only temporary. . .Kerbin\u0027s gravity will eventually \u0022eat\u0022 it. The only velocity you get to keep is your horizontal velocity. The only reason rockets launch vertically is because of atmospheric drag. If Kerbin did not have an atmosphere, and there were no mountains in your way, you could launch a rocket horizontally right off the pad. In this picture, your rocket is more or less halfway\u00A0between horizontal and vertical, which means fully half of your energy is going to vertical velocity. And you don\u0027t get to keep that, so in effect you\u0027re wasting half of your delta-v at this point in your flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to your navball, your rocket\u0027s heading in this picture is currently 63 degrees. Unless you\u0027re trying to reach an inclined (non-equatorial) orbit, you should try to stay as close to 90 degrees (due east) as possible. The reason for this is that your rocket is not sitting still on the pad. . .it already has an eastward velocity due to Kerbin\u0027s rotation.

Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, so it\u0027s going to want to fly forwards. \u00A0Like I say, good for going up, not so good for re-entry if the heat shield is on the back. \u00A0 \u00A0 The best solution is steerable fins, \u00A0but I\u0027m guessing you don\u0027t have those because they\u0027re in the Aviation tech node and you\u0027re into building rockets, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne workaround is to put fins on the re-entry stage to make \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E in front of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0 This makes it fly backwards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zjXtlRO.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022

to space today. \u00A0 So, reattach stages one at a time and add fins to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E where it should be for forward flight. \u00A0 Starting with the upper stage, 6 way fins keep \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E going where it should -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

stage, four way fins are needed to bring \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E down far enough -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sEEEXNX.jpg\u0022

all the way to orbit, and another 8 leave the pad. \u00A0Still , at 37kg each the weight isn\u0027t too bad. \u00A0 \u00A0The fact your rocket is so tall makes this approach harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCopy of the \u0022finspam\u0022 version here\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvm9tzkzvkcjtl1/basic3.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external

takes off. \u00A0For this you need an inline crew pod. \u00A0 Since you\u0027re rocket centric i\u0027m assuming you are more likely to have the mk1 lander can, so built something around this. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The Lander can and Crew cabin are at the bottom/back \u00A0of the re-entry stage. \u00A0 Ahead of them is the heat shield. \u00A0 In front of the heat shield is a science jnr. then an aero nose cone. \u00A0 On re-entry, the science jr. explodes, detaching the nose cone and exposing the heat shield. \u00A0The vessel becomes high drag and slows down fast. \u00A0 \u00A0If you think exploding science jnr.s are too chancey, \u00A0then perhaps a decoupler to remove the nose cone from the heat shield before re-entry is the way to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stripped a bit too much fuel and boosters out of this. \u00A0It took me a few attempts to get to orbit (gravity turn), but i eventually made it with 300dv to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg
