Any trip through the atmosphere will eventually see you back in the same place re-entering the atmosphere in the next orbit (unless you are already traveling fast enough to leave orbit, but I\u0027m assuming that isn\u0027t the question).

It\u0027s premised around a 20 something(I think) who works at NASA \u0022IASA\u0022(I = International) and was doing a project to use the earths atmosphere to escape into deep space. It revolves around his friends theory(DK?!), who also works at IASA, which has something to do with the idea that if you correctly dive into an atmosphere you could pull back off and get enough energy to go into deep space or out into the solar system with virtually no fuel. In one of the episodes they finally do it on the ship \u0022Moya\u0022 and it works. I was curious if it\u0027s realistic or worked in this game. It\u0027s not aerobraking. It\u0027s the opposite.\n\nI was trying to find the clip of Moya diving past the command carrier and going into the atmosphere to escape. But I couldn\u0027t find it.

If they were portraying younger people, well they did a good job appearing 10 years younger.\n\nRegardless, I was always suspicious of that maneuver as it sounds impossible. Hitting the atmosphere would bleed energy. Gravity would indeed pull you but you can\u0027t create energy. You have a force decreasing your velocity (atmospheric buffeting) you aren\u0027t using thrust from your engine (or else it isn\u0027t a fuel less maneuver). All you have is gravity pulling you, but not at a direct vector toward the center so some of that energy is lost in altering your vector (unless you used some fuel to keep the vector relatively straight). If you keep a straight vector, your lose energy pulling you due to the distance squared rule. Luckily the show only used it as a ploy to get John to where he needed to be for the story arc. They used it only that one time to get him there and once with Moya and then dropped the whole idea as it served its purpose.\n\nYou don\u0027t get anything for free.\n\nHowever, if you try it and end up in a wormhole and meet a good looking valkyrie, good on ya and enjoy the adventures.
