in beta, the souposphere dictated that the most efficient TWR was 2.0 at all times. \u00A0This made many people unhappy and was widely regarded as a bad move (on the other hand, it *really* helped that early progression and landings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 1.1, the \u0022most efficient\u0022 TWR seems to be \u0022how fast can you go without exploding\u0022? \u00A0Or at least \u0022how fast can you go while remotely able to make a pitchover\u0022 (launching at an angle becomes a real possibility with 1.1. \u00A0It was a remarkably effective strategy in 1.0 for smaller rockets such as unmanned satellites, but just might make its own in 1.1). \u00A0I\u0027ve heard that Squad changed the fuel usage wrt to throttle position, but expected that to mean that lower TWRs would be more effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith 1.0, players suggested a takeoff TWRs that wildly varied between 1.3-1.8. \u00A0I noticed that if you rocket as built in the VAR had a TWR\u0026gt;2.0, that limiting the TWR to 2.0 tended to balance aero and gravity losses best. \u00A0On the other hand, a \u0022proper gravity turn\u0022 was essentially impossible. \u00A0You had to do everything you could just to try to control the rocket before hitting trans- and hyper-sonic travel, and after that just let it ride out of the atmosphere (which wouldn\u0027t take long at those speeds). \u00A0IMPORTANT: just because reducing a rocket with a TWR\u0026gt;2.0 to 1.6 (or something) makes the craft less efficient (assuming you can wrangle it into orbit without huge cosine losses) doesn\u0027t mean that you can\u0027t make a rocket with TWR of 1.6 more efficient than the 2.0 TWR rocket. \u00A0More thrust requires more engines, and the more powerful engines almost always weigh more than the lighter ones, giving you more dry weight. \u00A0High TWR rockets are typically that way due to using SRBs for the first stage. \u00A0If your are limited by weight on the launchpad, they are unlikely an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch of my 1.0 testing started with \u0022sounding rockets\u0022 (fire a rocket straight up and find out what\u00A0apoapsis the rocket reaches). \u00A0That data was then used for a more useful \u0022launch into orbit\u0022 (when it became obvious that control was an issue and that mechjeb (of the time, haven\u0027t tried since) was hopeless at launching high TWR rockets). \u00A0With 1.1 I don\u0027t yet have Kerbal Engineer (is it ready? \u00A0I had a notice for KAS but not KE) so I really didn\u0027t bother with exact TWR and simply fired my sounding rockets. \u00A0However, my known \u0022higher than 2.0\u0022 rocket used for simple launches into orbit worked best with full thrust (~2.1) and decreased after that (and had a ap of ~70km). \u00A0I then built a presumably higher TWR with a kickback and had the same results. \u00A0Trying with liquid rockets (and replacing the capsule with a probe body) showed that TWR should be increased to just below the point of explosion (and to also expect that fairings are more important than in 1.0, but possibly only if you take advantage of use of extra thrust. \u00A0This test rocket simply hoped that a nosecone would sufficiently occlude the rest of the rocket (with a gap between the octoprobe and the next fuel tank), but that seemed to get hotter than the nosecone).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put it bluntly, I was unable to find any TWR that could be reduced to achieve a higher ap. \u00A0Presumably the \u0022ideal\u0022 TWR (when going straight up) is right below that which causing a heating explosion. \u00A0Any launch sideways (to orbit) can be expected to have even greater heating, so I would expect the point of lowering thrust for aero losses would remain much higher than lowering thrust to avoid explosions. \u00A0Control issues are expected to get even worse than 1.0 (especially if using TWR\u0026gt;2.0) and I expect to run a bunch of tests launching kickback-based satellites (at least once I have KE and can easily determine TWR).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T16:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022

Are gravity turns even being considered here?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing about going as fast as you can without burning up (Which Im taking here to indicate as exploding, not just generating reentry effects) is that it leaves you with a highly inefficient method of establishing orbit unless your rocket can handle the extreme stresses you\u0027ll be putting on it in order to get a proper ascent profile. IE, putting you back in the Kerbal stone ages where you burn to 10k, go straight to 45*, keep burning till you get your desired apo, cut engines and coast until you\u0027re ready to circularize. Except now you\u0027re just burning until you get your apo up and then you have to either cut your engines or start burning radial in order to keep a fixed apo. When you cut your engines, you\u0027ve got too much in your early stages and you\u0027re losing all the altitude you gained as you coast\u00A0(its not much, but its still not efficient), and when you start burning radial you lose a lot of efficiency because you\u0027re flying upwards on your side, putting a lot of drag on your rocket that you\u0027re fighting against.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaintaining a low TWR through ascent, on the other\u00A0hand, gives you room to maneuver your rocket properly through the atmosphere, and with a proper turn for your rocket you\u0027re effectively minimizing all the losses you\u0027d incur with any other sort of launch method. TL;DR, Duh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven on Kerbin, going vertical is cheap, but required. Its the horizontal that costs (but isn\u0027t necessarily required on ascent, its only absolutely necessary to establish orbit. After all, the idea of burning straight up to get into space can work, though its horribly inefficient), and going as fast as you can without burning up isn\u0027t the answer to efficiently gaining the horizontal velocity you need for orbit. In short, to me it seems as if the fuel costs are being focused on too hard here where its not really necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can minimize fuel costs very easily if you get the trajectory correct with your combination of engines, as then each stage can be tweaked to be just right for whats needed during that stages portion of the flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy rockets are designed that way, and each stage has a loose min and max TWR\u00A0that determines when they get staged, and typically you want these to coincide with your dV for each stage. Using a Saturn V style booster (which most of my rockets are based around)\u00A0as an example, you have a third stage with the payload mounted thats meant for upper atmosphere/vacuum flight, and its TWR will start at ~1.1-1.3. As this stage, max TWR is ignored because in vacuum high TWR is desirable. Engines and fuel amounts are chosen and tweaked to meet the desired starting TWR and the \u00A0required dV for the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond stage, typically for middle atmospheric flight and potentially vacuum flight as well. TWR again starts at ~1.1\u00A0and maxes at 1.6-1.7.\u00A0For cleanup purposes, dV for the stage \u002B that of the first stage is adjusted to be just under the required minimum for LKO, so that the second stage does not become space junk. The starting TWR is fairly strict as this stage typically ignites right around Max Q and what I call the flame barrier (where Kerbin unrealistically starts rendering reentry effects on everything going past Mach 3), and I want the TWR to be low enough so as to not induce too much heat damage to the rocket as I fly into the upper atmosphere as well as to provide better control over the rocket, as at Max Q my rockets typically require a very light touch in order to be flown without breaking up. Too high of a TWR at this stage, and I\u0027ll either have stuff exploding (or getting near enough to it), or I\u0027ll have\u00A0any attempt to maneuver the rocket past \u0022ever so slightly\u0022 result\u00A0in a break up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst stage, deep atmosphere flight. Essentially to get the rest of the rocket up and moving, and in a position where the following stage\u00A0can work at its\u00A0most efficient. Min TWR starts from 1.1-1.4 (depending on the payload. Lighter payloads need lower start TWR, heavier, higher) and caps at ~1.7-1.8. The fuel amounts for 1st and 2nd stage are chosen to split the required dV at a 0.9:1.1 ratio, respectively. All stages are packed with extra fuel not only as ballast to help in achieving the TWR ranges, but also as a contingency in case I mess up the ascent or decide on a higher orbit. (Which I admittedly do quite often)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the stages designed like this, so long as I fly the rocket properly I\u0027m wasting the relatively minuscule amounts I keep on the rockets extra. If I bothered to crunch the numbers, I could probably get near 100% efficiency as I wouldn\u0027t need the ballast fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T19:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222579806\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139609\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463167124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298595\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0027th\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, G\u0027th said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre we presuming that we\u0027re all operating the same ascent profiles?
