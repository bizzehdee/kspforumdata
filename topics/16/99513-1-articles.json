One event per body, that\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could look at it this way. Getting to orbit of the Mun gives you experience. When you land and plant a flag, that is a higher scoring event, so the getting orbit experience is removed and the plant a flag experience is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets break that down. You enter the Mun\u0027s spehere of influence \u002B1 point. You establish orbit -1 point \u002B2 points. You land -2 points \u002B 5 points. Plant a flag is the same as landing in this case, so it would be -5 points \u002B5 points, but that is just for the Mun.
