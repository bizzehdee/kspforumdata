This is especially annoying if want to build a ship or lander with 4x radially attached tanks where i\u0027d like to stick RCS pods to. If i build it symmetrical so i can put ladders in between the two tanks, the RCS pods have to fire in 2 directions. This is an issue since this reduces efficiency and wastes RCS fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IdjMgrM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022IdjMgrM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The arrows are RCS build helper showing which direction the RCS thrusters will fire if i\u0027d want to go \u0022up\u0022 for example) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short: Can i rotate how up/down for the mk1-2 is defined?

With 0.90 it\u0027s super easy to resolve this by using the rotate gizmo on your thrusters. Here\u0027s how I do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I avoid ever rotating the command pod (or probe core) inside the VAB -- I find it helpful to always have it properly aligned as it is when you first drop the part. Assume it is fixed and only move it up or down, but don\u0027t rotate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Sometimes if you have stuff sticking out all over in different directions or different angles, it can help to make a simple throw-away reference frame. I made one out of girders and placed it below the command pod. You can use this to help align things when making rotations. When you\u0027re done, you can just remove it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Use the CoM indicator to place your thrusters, and then use your reference frame to rotate them the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/iAN38\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

His issue is the hatch is not aligned to an obvious, easy orientation relative to the pod axes (Hacki, you said \u0022not at 22.5 degrees,\u0022 but I\u0027m not sure how 22.5 degrees is desirable either - that corresponds to 1/16 snap points. Did you mean 45 degrees for 1/8 snap points, halfway between the 4x points?). It looks to be about 30 degrees to me (would be 1/12 snap). What he wants is to put a ladder aligned with the hatch, and have it be halfway between the pods on that corner.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T07:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy usual ladder placement on those things is 30 degrees, and it\u0027s pretty much right. The interval on the \u0022snap to\u0022 is every 15 degrees, so just having the radial tanks one \u0022tick\u0022 over to the left should have the spacing correct, then just align your RCS thrusters to the axes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hacki","CreatedById":106794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T21:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you mean 45 degrees for 1/8 snap points, halfway between the 4x points?).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, i meant 45 degrees.

Sometimes i make silly mistakes like that. Might be because it was late, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, as it turns out, this is probably more of a problem with RCS build aid. I only became aware of the whole hatch / control axis offset after starting to use RCS build aid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately RCS build aid ignores the selected root part as basis for its calculations at the moment, so sticking a clampotron or a probe core on the craft and making that the root part doesnt help inside the VAB at the moment, only after the vehicle is launched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee here for reference: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-90-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-5-5?p=1705155\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1705155\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-90-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-5-5?p=1705155\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1705155\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
