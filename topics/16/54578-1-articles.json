Is it possible to get to any planet at anytime as by either luck or extreme coincidence I have gotten a Eve encounter and a Duna encounter and I did and I am pretty sure that both were done between proper encounter windows. I will admit that I got the Eve encounter while outside of Kerbin\u0027s SoI but it was a the same distance from the Sun as Kerbin. Any answers help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T08:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is sure possible to launch towards any planet anytime. But then it depends on what approach you choose, you may use trajectories which don\u0027t take long but eat huge delta-v, or you may take your time, wait for optimum moment and save delta-v. If you don\u0027t want to wait for launch window, you can always eject from Kerbin SOI and then plan your maneuver from there. It will be slightly less efficient than waiting till Kerbin gets there, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T09:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have enough \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV, you can always get an encounter.
