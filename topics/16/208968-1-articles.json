Each engine was placed upon a 4-sym fuel tank. But since two engines (and rotors) need to revolve in the opposite direction, I was trying to place the engines in 2-sym pairs. I couldn\u0027t get it to work. I eventually just placed them in 4-sym, then removed them all from symmetry and set the directions individually.
