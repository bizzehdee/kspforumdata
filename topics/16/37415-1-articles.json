By aerobraking and leaving your periapsis a bit further than Gilly\u0027s orbit, your capture burn is virtually costless. you can simply raise your periapsis above Eve\u0027s atmosphere and wait for the right window do do a Hohmann transfer to Gilly.

And well to have an intercept with Gilly without stabilizing your orbit first, you\u0027d have to be insanely precise, I don\u0027t think it would be easy to do. It\u0027s hard to predict how you would come in to Eve ans where Gilly would be at that time. There\u0027s also the fact that Gilly\u0027s SOI is ridiculously small. It\u0027s better to get an orbit around Eve first. That\u0027s why I proposed the aerobrake maneuver. It\u0027s not hard really, just setting your periapsis at the right height and enjoying the light show. But you know, you don\u0027t need to raise the orbit to Gilly if you don\u0027t lower it under it\u0027s orbit first. Then you just need to wait for the right phase angle and transfer then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the delta V to come back will mostly be affected by the fact you will probably simply want to come right back to land on Kerbin. For example the transfer burn to the Mun is ~800m/s, but then coming back is only roughly ~250m/s because you\u0027re not circularizing around Kerbin You can Backtrack but you have to take the same exact paths as on the map to come back, and it\u0027s not always the most efficient way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-17T10:13:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2013 10:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T11:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jackissimus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jackissimus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet\u0027s not consider aerobraking for now.

You\u0027re in an elliptic orbit with periapsis at Eve\u0027s orbit and Apoapsis at Kerbins orbit. This means that you\u0027re going faster than Eve when you encounter it. If you dip into the atmosphere for a moment to bleed off your velocity you can get into an elliptical orbit around Eve. At that point it\u0027s just a matter of waiting for Gilly to get close. So you only need a few dV (to raise periapsis out of the atmosphere after your capture) to get from Kerbol orbit to Gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf for whatever reason you don\u0027t want to aerocapture it is certainly possible to go straight from Kerbol orbit to Gilly orbit. But you\u0027ll need a lot of dV and you need to be lucky on Gilly\u0027s position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s drag out some equations shall we.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to assume our spacecraft starts out in a 100km Kerbin orbit. First order of business is to get into an elliptical orbit around Kerbol. Such an orbit would have a velocity at apoapsis of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(ap) = sqrt((1-e)GM(sun)/((1\u002Be)*a)) = 8530 m/s relative to the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin itself already has an orbital velocity of 9284 m/s, so we only need to escape Kerbin\u0027s SoI with a relative velocity of 754 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(exit)^2 = (V(burn)\u002BV(init))^2 - V(esc)^2, the V(esc) for a 100km orbit on kerbin is about 3177 m/s. Our initial circular orbit at 100km has an orbital velocity of 2246 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(burn) = sqrt(V(exit)^2 \u002B V(esc)^2) - V(init) = 1019 m/s to get an Eve encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVelocity at periapsis for an elliptical orbit with r(per)=r(eve) and r(ap)=r(kerbin) is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(per) = sqrt((1\u002Be)GM(sun)/((1-e)*a)) (formula for orbital velocity at periapsis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I plug in the relevant numbers from the wiki I conclude your spacecraft will be going 11681 m/s relative to the sun. This is assuming an optimal orbit where Eve is located at its apoapsis when you encounter her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve moves at 10811 m/s relative to the sun at that point. So your velocity relative to eve is 870 m/s before entering the SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen falling into eve\u0027s SoI we gain a bit of velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(ini)^2 = V(max)^2-V(esc)^2. (formula for hyperbolic excess velocity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(max) = sqrt (V(ini)^2 \u002B V(esc)^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV(esc) = sqrt(2GM/r) where r is Gilly\u0027s apoapsis (this would be the optimal scenario)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlugging in the numbers we come to the conclusion that our spacecraft will be moving at 1045 m/s relative to Eve at Gilly Apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say we\u0027re lucky and Gilly happens to be in that exact position when we show up. Gilly moves 274 m/s relative to eve at apoapsis. So our velocity relative to Gilly is 771 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if everything lines up perfectly you need a braking burn of at least 771 m/s if we ignore the trivial amount for Gilly orbit. In practice it\u0027ll almost always be much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in total we need 1790 m/s to get from a 100km Kerbin orbit to a Gilly orbit in the absolute best case scenario. If you were to use aerobraking you could almost completely negate the 771 m/s braking burn at Eve, saving almost half your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to bother calculating the dV for the trip back. But you can just use the same maths I just used. If correct it should be slightly less due to the Oberth effect.

Yes. is it practical for a noob (or any KSP player outside of the few who work at JPL) to be doing that? Not unless you want to put a crater in Gilly after several dozen quickloads. What your talking about is basically hitting a moon form LKO that may be on the other side of Kerbol with what, for all intents and purposes, is a bullet. True, you can control your craft by using somewhat inaccurate maneuver nodes. But the thing is, if your off by just a few hundredths of a m/s, you\u0027ll miss. That means expending dv to change your trajectory to intercept Gilly once your in it\u0027s SOI. And, as said above, you will be moving at a very high velocity. Gilly may have low gravity (so low that some players find it necessary to burn straight down towards it,) but Kerbol doesn\u0027t. You will be screaming in with your hair on fire doing a direct injection burn form LKO. That means that even if your trajectory lands on Gilly, you will still need to bleed off copious amounts of velocity to avoid winding up as a smoking crater in the surface. Even then, you may not have enough time if your engines are not powerful enough. My suggestion, like everyone else, would be to go into LEO (low Eve orbit) and then transfer to Gilly. Its easier and allows you to leave your transfer stage in Eve orbit with a much higher velocity making a trans-Kerbin injection all the easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
