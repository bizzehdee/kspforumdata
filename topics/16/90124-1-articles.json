The first is a T/W \u0027hole\u0027, where the vehicle doesn\u0027t have sufficient performance to accelerate against the existing drag when the solids burn out and vehicle actually slows down until it reaches the equilibrium point. The second is terminal velocity, where you have enough acceleration to exceed maximum velocity for a given altitude - but since that\u0027s physically impossible, the thrust of any liquid engines is thus wasted until the vehicle either slows down (due to the \u0027hole\u0027) or reaches an altitude where terminal velocity is above the current velocity.

This is heavier than the \u0027pure\u0027 T30 design though and recovery value is so much less that per-launch costs are 246 funds more. In other words, it\u0027s only cheaper if you\u0027re throwing it all away anyway, not if you are aiming to recover it.

A small number of SRBs (usually 2, sometimes 4) can be used very efficiently (in terms of drag, cost, and complexity) to increase TWR off the pad to get an initial boost of speed, which a central sustainer stage that has a lower TWR by itself pushes the upper stage to orbit. The SRBs are usually ditched early, but are still there in the thick lower part of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, asparagus staging almost always use 4 or more radial cores (I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d call only 2 cores cross feeding the center Falcon Heavy-style as \u0022asparagus staging\u0022, but definitions may vary), and typically 6 cores, and the cores tend to be around longer than SRBs.

More, unlike RL, where you can somewhat control the thrust per time profile of a SRB by fuel shaping, it is completely impossible to have a varying thrust SRB in game, that makes that a SRB solution will always be quite short of perfect in low atmosphere ( and , due to their specs in game, somewhat useless out of it ) ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T20:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso being fairly new to the forum I\u0027d got the impression that asparagus had fallen slightly out of favour since the introduction of career mode, however there are methods/mods to allow you to recover stages that parachute back down hence making it a lot more cost effective\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAsparagus is the second most mass-efficient staging method and the most mass-efficient commonly used method (the more efficient twisted candle staging is trickier to set up well). \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to look that up, wow, it\u0027s a thing of beauty. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55615-0-22-0-23-0-Payload-Fraction-Challenge?p=968265\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post968265\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55615-0-22-0-23-0-Payload-Fraction-Challenge?p=968265\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post968265\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T20:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, we could say that the devs made sure that asparagus would not be cost efficient, and TBH they used some very crass methods to do so, like making decouplers costing the same as a ICBM capable rocket or a individual fuel line costing more than some rocket engines.

There are 2 main reasons for such heavy payloads. Either the people way over-build the payload, or they\u0027re just afraid of docking several smaller payloads together. You can do the entire tech tree never having more than about 15 tons of payload and you can create massive sandbox empires never lifting more than about 30 tons at once (at least if you\u0027re not afraid of docking). Of course, some people just like to see what sort of monster they can get off the ground, and that\u0027s perfectly fine. Whatever makes them happy.

My point was about the inadvisability of relying on an SRB lift stage - for additional short-lived, disposable, launch thrust they are certainly unequalled - but for anything more they really aren\u0027t worth it. On the other hand, in FAR you don\u0027t want more than about 1.2 TWR at launch, do you? If your core isn\u0027t supplying that on its own what do you do after ditching the SRBs? (Genuine question, I have too many memory problems to create another one with FAR so haven\u0027t tried it much)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy LFO core lifting stages are often just sustainer stages, with relatively low TWR, at least for most of the ascent. In fact, I usually thrust limit the SRBs to give the lift stage a TWR of just \u003Cem\u003Ebelow\u003C/em\u003E 1 when the main engine isn\u0027t lit, so I still control TWR during the ascent with the main throttle. The LFO core then just maintains the initial boost speed until higher up out of the atmosphere, where I get a much better TWR since most of the fuel is burnt up and I\u0027m losing less energy to atmospheric drag. The SRBs just give me the extra speed and dV I need to get the AP up to ~ 70km, where I want to spend my dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason I don\u0027t prefer asparagus is that I usually launch very small payloads, at least compared to what I see a lot of other people launching. I\u0027d rather reduce the upper stage/payload as far as possible, instead of building up the lifting stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll agree that it\u0027s not very effective to use solid rocket-only lifters/stages. My biggest issue with them is a lack of control. A BACC booster \u002B 3 AV-R8 winglets costs as much and and lifts less than an LVT-45 \u002B T800.
