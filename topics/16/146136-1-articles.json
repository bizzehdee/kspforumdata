Those fins you have are certainly overkill. Generally speaking, 4x smallest aileron thingies will probably do the job. Cutting down on the fins will reduce some of the main problems on re-entry (like, for example, the fact that the controls are reversed and will tend to amplify the slightest deviation from retrograde), and make it easier to put draggy throwaway surfaces near the top of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-19T11:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had exactly the same problem.
