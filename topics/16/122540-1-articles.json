The octo probe core uses 1.2 electricity per minute, or 0.02 electricity/second. At full conversion rate the fuel cell would output 1.5 charge/second. This means, with only the probe core using electricity, the fuel cell would run at a fraction of 1/75. Now, again at full conversion rate, the fuel cell would use 6.08 units liquid fuel per hour, or 1.689e-3 liquid fuel per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo only supply the octo, 1/75th of this is required, yielding 2.252e-5 units of liquid fuel per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo supply the octo for the full trip it would therefore need nearly 550 units of liquid fuel (and the corresponding amount of oxidizer).
