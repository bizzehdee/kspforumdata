So I looked around a bit after getting frustrated, and found that this tactic when you don\u0027t have the clamps unlocked yet supposedly work. Problem is that it doesn\u0027t for me. Both Kerbin and Landed conditions are met. I fire up the Fuel Engine, let it burn all the way through with the conditions still met, and yet, nothing. No contract completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is honestly quite frustrating, can someone tell me what I\u0027m doing wrong? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Here are things I\u0027ve tried:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Right click \u0022run test\u0022 (there\u0027s no run test options)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Attaching just the engine and activating that through stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Attaching clamps to the shuttle and firing the engine without disengaging the clamps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding empty stages before or after the engine stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adding different engine at different stages before or after the test engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Having only the engine with no fuel source directly attached to the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Making the entire shuttle upside down and firing it from stage there so it stayed stationary on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Quitting the career and resuming it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Quitting the game and restarting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone have worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the game, but this is game breaking my career, and honestly incredibly frustrating. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I\u0027d love if anyone had a fix, or if this is a bug maybe that will be fixed in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Seems I solved my issue.
