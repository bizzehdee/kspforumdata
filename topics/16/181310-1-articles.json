These satellite are often encased in fairings in relation to real life rockets while the other available stock KSP engines are actual lifting engines which would be used in the default interstage shrouds/fairings. Because of that I think the ant engines has no use for a shroud. However, this game is a building block game and should allow full user independent creativity, for that reason the option should be allowed to cover the ant engine with a shroud IMO. I hope that in future updates such functionality would be added to the Ant engine, especially as Squad promised to focus on part revamps I wouldn\u0027t want the ant engine to be left out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
