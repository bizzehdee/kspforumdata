Both times I\u0027ve attempted this, near the top of the arc, I lose control of my capsule, I can\u0027t command Crew Reports, No Mystery Goo Reports, No Science experiments. The game still steems responsive, I can click on capsule components and get status reading which appear normal, my pilot seems happy, I can select parachute deployment, but I have to get to a lower altitude before things start working normally. What am I missing?

At first I thought this was a game bug, but stuff started working again coming back down through about 600K meters. Is there anything else that could cause this non-responsiveness when up high, just to see it come back later at lower altitudes? Can stuff freeze up?"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:38:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just had two batteries.

It\u0027s possible in the previous attempt, either it was a glitch or likely I was on accelerated time when trying to perform my science experiment. What makes me wonder about accelerated time is that this happened to me twice in two successive flights. Yeah, it\u0027s possible operator error/accelerated time was the culprit!
