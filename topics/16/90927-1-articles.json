Even easier if you add in KAS and use the new EPL survey stakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epretty sure you can use kethane or karbinite to mine ore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit, yes you would probably want to use karbonite instead of kethane with MKS. But for the most part they do the same sorts of things so you could use karbonite instead of kethane, or do some mm configs to make kethane parts fill in the MKS pieces you would need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-22T03:04:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2014 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpsp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
