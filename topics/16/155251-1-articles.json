While in reality warhead fragments projected all around and the shockwave bring enough energy, KSP doesn\u0027t transmit any from explosions to another vessel. KSP however works fine with physical forces, therefore transmission of kinetic energy: impacting another vessel makes an impulsive force F = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E/dT * m, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E/dT is the change in speed with time, m the mass of the impacter. If said force produces a displacement on the impacted part larger than what the physics engine allows, the impacted part detaches from the target (which is generally reason to start an explosion in KSP). So, you have to maximize kinetic energy with the impacter, meaning using a part with a large mass and moving at high relative speed towards target. And the mass of the impacted part is also relevant, if large that part will be able to absorb the kinetic energy without exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuidance: aiming directly at a target position works best with a stationary or slow target. It still can be successful if chasing a high speed target (weapon fired from the target rear). With moving targets at wide aspect angle, kinematic makes for increasing change in angles the lower the distance gets, and invariably the missile won\u0027t be able to maneuver fast enough (change its speed vector to keep following target). Which is still acceptable if said missile can explode its warhead when close enough to damage target, but can\u0027t work in KSP. Instead, you need to use a guidance system using proportional navigation. Which means, the missile is directed at the predicted target position, movements ratios (missile/target speed components) in each coordinate are the same (proportional), angles don\u0027t change. Actually, when a change in aiming angle is detected, the guidance system uses that to further change its own speed vector, until the change in aiming angle with time becomes zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know about any add-on for KSP that implements proportional navigation guidance. However, the principle is easy enough so could be programmed in a autopilot using kOS. However please know one thing: the PID based autopilots (used in stock KSP and all add-ons I know about) work fine when goal is to reach and keep a specific orientation, but aren\u0027t able to keep pace with a changing value. To make an adaptive guidance system able to compensate movements of a moving target you need a closed-loop feedback system of at least 2nd order (acceleration) (real missiles guidance systems include also 3rd or even 4th order derivatives), on both pitch and yaw axes. Feedback systems require precise calibration to be fast while avoiding overcompensation, their response is tied to timing (or phase) of the error signal used as input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T16:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is really awesome info, thank you!\u00A0 I don\u0027t really know kOS at all, but it sounds like that\u0027s the only way to go with guidance.\u00A0 The fact that I can hit the target with manual orientation makes me think it really shouldn\u0027t be difficult to program.\u00A0 I\u0027m firing at \u0022stationary\u0022 targets, but because everything is in orbit, I get between a 4 and 5 m/s drift when I\u0027m at a kilometer or more in range.\u00A0 All I need the autopilot to do is put the prograde vector on the target marker, just like docking, only at really high speeds.\u00A0 Any thoughts on using a docking autopilot to not care about approach speed and just point me in the right direction?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T22:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny autopilot able to be given a simple instruction of the kind of \u0022keep relative speed oriented along the relative position vector\u0022 would be able to make what you asked.

The larger the angular distance along the orbit, the larger the error due to how KSP computes relative speed (vector difference from target absolute speed and vessel absolute speed): the farther away, the more the two vectors point in different directions (you certainly observed that making a close R/V with target, relative speed starts high but gets down the more the target is close, even while neither vessel nor target have changed speed). That vectorial difference therefore includes an angular component, that seems an error to be compensated. Quite often players keep trying to compensate that error without reducing relative speed first, ending running circles around the target. Your missile will need to be very maneuverable to cancel that angular error while it approaches the target at high speed. Very possible it may have to use the main engine to provide a lot of vectored thrust, so your autopilot would require a routine to orient the engine thrust accordingly and then to keep firing the engine until angular error is reduced to 0 (which is when target is along the prograde direction, but beware of the apparent error due to distance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027d not use docking autopilots. They need to keep orientation of the vessel\u0027s port parallel to the targeted docking port, and thrust is generally only made out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E in translation mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-22T18:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you want big explosions BDarmory might help, but I am not sure since I don\u0027t use it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-22T21:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I actually originally started out by trying to use BDArmory\u0027s AAMs in vacuum, and learned my lesson.\u00A0 So I started messing around with modular missiles, but since the guidance wasn\u0027t any better than the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E at hitting the target, I got curios about other options.\u00A0 The \u0022Small High Explosive Warhead\u0022 works spectacularly by overheating the part(s) it collides with.\u00A0 You can even manually detonate it with an action group, but as noted above in this thread, it does no damage unless it makes contact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been having some good luck putting verner thrusters on the missiles instead of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 They are way more powerful, and I can now just translate until prograde is on target instead of having to\u00A0rotate the whole missile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat off topic, but I really think there needs to be a way to \u0022look\u0022 around with the navball.\u00A0 It\u0027s fixed field ov view means that I can\u0027t see my prograde vector and target sometime when having to do violent maneuvers.\u00A0 If I\u00A0could look the navball on target, I could maneuver more precisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
