I think your inexperience is showing here - but that\u0027s expected, KSP isn\u0027t a game you can learn in a week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou speak of wanting to recover \u0022the first 3 stages\u0022, which suggests that you shed that many while still on your way to orbit. Together with your rocket\u0027s price tag, I\u0027m fairly sure that your single biggest mistake is: thinking that a bigger rocket gets you further, or that it is necessary to go big to go somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way rockets work is quite funny: it\u0027s all about mass fractions. The relation of the mass of one stage to the mass of the next. A rocket with a first stage of 9t and a second stage of 1t can fly \u003Cem\u003Eexactly the same mission\u003C/em\u003E as a rocket with a first stage of 900t and a second stage of 100t... and not a bit more or less*. \u003Cem\u003EExactly\u003C/em\u003E the same. (* Unless engine Isp is different, yes, but I\u0027m trying to make a point here, guys!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I\u0027m betting that your rocket is simply way too large. You could build something half the physical size and pricetag, and it would still be able to go to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rule is limited at the lower end by your minimum payload weight, that is, the weight of the equipment that is expected to land on, and perhaps return from, the Mun. Chiefly this will mean the weight of your manned capsule, a fuel tank just large enough for the descent (and possibly return flight), an engine and landing legs. Bring lights if you have unlocked them, lights are massless and are invaluable when landing with low visibility. But every unnecessary kg you add on here will multiply itself over and over down through your stages, so be frugal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have created your minimum-weight landing (and perhaps takeoff) craft, you then build a launcher under it. Since it\u0027s all about mass fractions, each stage lower down will be exponentially larger than the one above it. Also, decouplers and engines cost money and are dead weight that the lower stages must carry, so try and make a low number of stages. A typical Mun mission can get away with three: one launch stage, one upper stage that circularizes your Kerbin orbit, and one transfer stage that flies you to the Mun and captures you into orbit there - allowing your payload (the lander) to do its job. Because it\u0027s all about mass fractions, try to make sure that every new stage you add is the same amount (percentage-wise) bigger than the one above it. This could be greatly assisted by the next game update that is going to be released any day now, as it\u0027s rumored to give you a way to see how much your rocket weighs as you build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a useful exercise: build a manned rocket that can launch from Kerbin, fly to the Mun, circularize a really low Mun orbit (apoapsis and periapsis both between 10 and 15 km!), leave the Mun again to return to Kerbin, and then circularize in low Kerbin orbit (~75km) on engine power alone. \u003Cstrong\u003EUse only 1.25m parts to do this.\u003C/strong\u003E Not only is this possible - it also represents 100% of the performance you need to put a lander down on the Mun one-way, and almost 95% of what you need if you also want to return said lander to Kerbin again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis exercise should help you learn to downsize your rockets - even if you really want to use the 2.5m 3-Kerbal pod for your lander! Because it\u0027s all about mass fractions, the same design principles that apply to tiny rockets also apply to huge ones.

Get one that requires \u0022Testing while landed\u0022 and you don\u0027t even have to launch the thing - just stick it on the pad and activate it with staging controls.

FinePrint is a mod that expands the number of types of available contracts and it\u0027ll become stock with 0.90, so that might be one you might be less adverse to using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that if you\u0027ve got a Mun rocket, you can get to Minmus - Mun takes 7200 m/s of delta-V while Minmus takes 6800 or so; while the transfer burn requires more delta-V, getting into orbit and landing takes less and the balance works out the same. So your \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1200,000 Mun rocket should be capable of a Minmus mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you mind sharing a screenshot of your rocket designs so far?

In fact, most discussion around funds concern it being too generous (check around; there\u0027s a few threads in these forums). Even in the early-game, running out of funds is unlikely; by mid-game, it ceases to be a factor, as you usually have over $10mil\u002B. This is intentional so that you don\u0027t have to spend your entire KSP experience chasing contracts that aren\u0027t fun or fulfilling, and allowing you to build things you want, like a space station around Eve or a rover for Dres. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Most contracts have a VERY long completion deadline, if any. On the other hand, they always give you an immediate injection of $ on accepting the contract. So if you\u0027re really desperate for $, you can always accept every contract to get the $ and worry about completing the mission later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbal rescue missions are easy because they\u0027re always near 0 inclination and 80-100km orbit. It\u0027s good rendezvous practice and you can build a rescue craft for less than $50k funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You shouldn\u0027t need a refueling station around the Mun. Frankly, you may never need one ever; I find that establishing a depot often takes way too much effort and time for what it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Testing parts \u0027landed\u0027 or \u0027splashed\u0027 at Kerbin takes literally 15 seconds per contract, so they\u0027re easy money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Send a small probe into Mun orbit. Boom, anytime you need money, accept a \u0027send data from around the Mun\u0027 orbit and use that probe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Even better, send a one-man lander to the Mun. Don\u0027t even worry about getting him home at this point. Just use him to \u0027plant flags\u0027 or \u0027send data from surface of Mun\u0027. If you keep him there, you can milk those contracts until you have enough money for your next big project. I currently have one probe and one lander on every body in KSP, pretty much ensuring that I will never run out of money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAHireMe","CreatedById":131205,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T16:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, as to your original plan for completing all of KSP stock before moving on to harder difficulty levels and mods, I\u0027d STRONGLY suggest allowing yourself to use at least SOME mods once you move past the Kerbin system.

Or you\u0027ll be stuck with launching a mission to Dres, for example, and finding out after two real-world hours of construction and piloting that your ship doesn\u0027t have enough delta-V to capture.
