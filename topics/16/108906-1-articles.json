But with the new aerodynamic rules, you then have to make your rockets tall and slim instead of short and stubby, to get things up there in the first place. This is an Issue; the Mun is bumpy and uneven, and ladders are a pain. And with a tall, skinny rocket, you risk knocking it over as you jetpack up to the door.\n\nSo, maybe a belly lander is the solution. This would, however, run into the problem that the powerful main engine would then be \u0027back\u0027 instead of \u0027down\u0027. That\u0027s where I\u0027m stuck. Do I use radial rockets the whole way down instead of the main engine? Do I eschew a \u0027main\u0027 engine in favour of radials? Do I use monopropellant engines instead?\n\nAlso, once again, aerodynamics for takeoff with the landing legs. They\u0027d all be on one side, and the landing engines all on one side as well.\n\nAny suggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:12:16Z","Content":"Because most airless worlds are low-G, you only need a tiny amount of thrust. You do most of the landing on the main engine, and only flip over to the ventral thrusters at the last moment. Vernors are usually the easiest way to do it, but a few of the little Rockomax radials will work if you don\u0027t have Vernors.\n\nTo demonstrate:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvM7_InE2rI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:15:54Z","Content":"I\u0027d say to land normally, your rocket facing upwards and letting it fall down to the side (using landing legs or RCS). And for take off, if your lander is not too heavy, use RCS to get it back up and take off normally.\n\nThis would solve the problem of landing stability as you *want* to make your rocket fall down but at the same time, no radial engines needed outside RCS (most radial engines in KSP are bad anyways)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:18:49Z","Content":"I have landed spaceplanes on Minmus by the \u0022tailsitter, then tip over\u0022 method.

With some fuel transfers between tanks and again center of gravity being over a pair of landing legs, it is possible to do this. All a rocket would need is a single thruster (RCS or otherwise), torque wheels, or center of gravity shifting through fuel transfer. Once the rocket is tilted 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or more is should be a fairly simple procedure to turn around in whichever direction and go full thrust on any low or non-atmospheric body."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:37:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, all the \u0022lander not aerodynamic when chubby\u0022 problems can be solved by launching it to orbit in various parts (#hoorayforfairings) and then docking\n\nNot at the \u0027first mun landing\u0027 point in the tech tree, though."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:33:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But with the new aerodynamic rules, you then have to make your rockets tall and slim instead of short and stubby,\n\nNever mind the new aerodynamics. I found that you can still bring the weirdest contraptions into space if you just apply enough power. If you don\u0027t go over the top, the premium for bad aerodynamics is entirely bearable. I also found that it\u0027s better to design a good spacecraft and cope with the lifter issues rather than the other way round."}]}
