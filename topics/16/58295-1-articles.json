Two pretty small ships with the 2.5m ASAS on them but despite that, they both won\u0027t stay on heading for longer than 10 seconds or so. Of course, me being the docking novice, it takes for ever to line one ship up only for the other to have drifted off heading. Each ship is composed of a skipper, x300-32 tank, ASAS, and mk1-2 command pod. Am I doing something wrong with my ASAS or is it just doomed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T20:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you have them in Kerbin equatorial orbit, the only heading they will keep is North or South. Otherwise they keep pointing (more or less) the same direction in space, which however changes as you\u0027re circling the planet. For example what is \u0022up\u0022 on one side of the planet is \u0022down\u0022 on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are more things to that, but for docking purposes it\u0027s just better to orient the docking port North or South, i.e. the place where the brown line intersects the brown/blue edge, or the oposite side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T20:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you remember RCS fuel and ports? Those are pretty much assencial to dock, more than ASAS. From there you can use ijkl for up down left right, and h n for forward backward movements. The RCS will keep the ship headed in the same direction as long as both it and ASAS is activated. Also, if they\u0027re close to eachother, thier headings shouldn\u0027t be changing. Make sure you set the navball to target mode.
