So far I have launched 2 COM satellites into Kerbin orbit and one Kethane-Ore scanner into the Mun orbit. Yesterday I just encountered solar eclipse visible from Kerbin. I have read that it happens once a kerbin month, but I was wondering if there is any way to calculate other events outside Kerbin like on other planets. Having a Events Calendar plugin is not so bad idea but I havent found one that do such a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ELF-","CreatedById":52049,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T12:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile not being impossible, I find this pretty useless, as all of these events are depend on your own current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a orbital station to the perfect equatorial orbit around kerbin, and you can watch a solar eclipse once per orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you can calculate th events like planet alignments, joolian satellites alignement or some thing else like that, but... Honestly, why would you need that? KSP is not an astronomy game, KSP is aerospace simulator. You should not bother looking for pretty events in the sky (we even do not have a stock binoculars, whatsoever a telescope)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of events will be either too far to be visible (only from map view, probably), or too boring to worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"elementalfx","CreatedById":79515,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T09:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell you are right. I was just purely wondering if it is any efford to do so. But you are right. Until we have at least telescopes etc. it is useless. I have some telescopes plugins installed but they are pretty hard to stabilise on distant bodies. However they gives you some Science points if you take some pictures of it, so maybe in a future it will give you a reason if you get rewarded pretty nice by taking pictures of an eclipse but it is just my thought. But thanks anyway for an efford to answer my question. I appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ELF-","CreatedById":52049,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T12:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am amateur astronomer of basic level, so it was interesting for me the first time when I saw the telescope plugin for KSP, but I soon realized that it does not have a good enough engine solution to show a better background behind zoomed body, that it lacks a very fine tune controls and so on, so I abandoned the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf player will be rewarded with science points for taking pictures of distant bodies it will be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what I would personally prefer is: player needs to first discover a body in the nightsky of Kerbin, before attempting to fly to it (so, tl:dr; the body is not shown on Map view, until it is discovered with a scope).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis requires a big engine overhaul as I see it, because my eyes were screaming in a horror when I was looking through first kerboscope at Duna, and have seen a BIG PIXELS behind that, instead of cool background stars with probably some galaxies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when it will get implemented, suddenly we will have a tool to calculate events like \u0022Jool passing 0.5 degrees north of Eve, if observed from Duna\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
