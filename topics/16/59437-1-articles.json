Then after first land i docked at the station. After analizing all i can with the lab, and sending data of crew report and EVA report, temperature, sismic that I can store easily, i came to a stop in my mission: when was the turn of my goos, sc9001 and soil sample, that are the real science cake, i realized that if I transmit the data, i can\u0027t keep the big chunck of raw data inside the lander, as i have to clean it in order to reuse it. So I planned a new lander and a new base module, in order to bypass this issue and by tonight i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll have it in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new lander will have a cockpit and a solidal engines body, plus a docked sc9001 with sensors array on it, and the base will get a new module that is a parking for 8 of this docked sc9001 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery landing, i\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll undock the science module from the lander and dock a fresh new from the base module for another land and go on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, now I have the final problem: As I resolved goo and sc9001 data store, I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find a way to store surface samples, I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even find a way to move it from the cockpit once I reenter the lander on the Mun\u0027s surface. There is a way to move this sample cockpit to cockpit, store it in other ways or stack it in the cockpit (didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t tried it actually\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6)?

I had a \u0022science station\u0022 that had fuel tanks, the science lab, and a lander. In addition, I had a return vessel to handle refueling the station and bringing science back to KSC.

As far as I know, there\u0027s no \u0022data limit\u0022 in modules, so you as long as there are no duplicate results, they get stored. So the pod can hold \u0022temp reading from Mun Highlands\u0022 \u002B \u0022temp reading from Farside Crater\u0022, etc. You cannot have two \u0022temp readings from Highlands\u0022 though (this gives you the \u0022dump experiment\u0022 dialog).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Use the mobile science lab to clean the goo cannisters and SC9001.

It matters most when landing, and smaller moons/planets have less gravity, and therefore a ship will have a higher TWR on a body with less gravity. The higher the TWR, the higher the acceleration you will have, so adding more engines will will make your ship speed up or slow down faster. Keep in mind you can go farther with one engine than with more than one, as long as you don\u0027t need the extra thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp is a measure of efficiency used in the Delta V equation.

Delta-V is a good measure of where your ship can go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Inline Advanced Stabilizer was the old ASAS that allowed you to maintain heading. Since the SAS overhaul, it has the exact same function and torque as the Inline Reaction Wheel, to add torque, and as you observed it weighs more. Effectively the Inline Reaction Wheel is superior in all ways and the Inline Advanced Stabilizer is pretty much useless in that respect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You are right, if you plan on using RCS for translation or rotation, having the thrust aligned with the axis is more efficient. 4 RCS blocks are best because they point directly with the direction of travel. You can add more than 1 pair of 4 in different places along the rocket as long as you keep them pointed in the right direction.

Yes, after a certain weight (the breaking force is different on different bodies with varying surface gravities) Usually I can just know by looking at the craft how many and what kind of landing legs I need. Experimentation/failure will help you with this, but if you want an exact weight I\u0027m sure its written on the wiki or forum somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Ion Engines are pretty much useless for normal uses because of the minuscule thrust, which makes landing on most bodies difficult if not impossible (Because of the TWR), and burn times to chance speed are long and make gameplay boring. The only place that I found them to be plausible is on is Eve\u0027s moon, Gilly, because it has almost no gravity and the maximum orbital speed is probably 20 m/s, so .1m/s of acceleration from ion engines is manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Essentially the first Antenna you unlock is the best. Features have not yet been implemented that give the others advantages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. I did a similar investigation for these engines for my science fair project, and I found that if you only use 1 engine and you have 2 identical rockets, they will produce the same Delta-V if you have about 500 liters of fuel (I forgot the number). If you burn less than 500 liters, the 48-7s will give you more Delta V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to do the math some other time, so I\u0027ll get back to you, but essentially if you burn less than a certain amount of fuel, the 5 48-7s\u0027s will be better.

The game automatically adjusts for their placement. You will get less thrust for greater monopropellant use in some directions though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Landing struts in 0.23 can\u0027t hold your craft upright. They have been made incredibly weak. That being said, they still work great for landing. They pad the impact of your ship. Engines work great for landing too, but the landing legs stick out to the sides and can offer better support if you land on a slope or just have difficulty making your craft come down straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Ion engines give you super high deltaV with super low TWR and they demonstrate profoundly how these differ. You can get a decent TMR (thrust to mass ratio) on an ion-powered ship if you make sure the mass of the ship is almost entirely ion engines and solar panels. If you use a very light probe core, not too much battery weight, only one xenon tank but several ion engines, and almost no mass in structural components, you get a ship that can accelerate at a good fraction of 1m/s/s. A ship like this can land on very low gravity worlds like Minmus if it maintains good sunlight and is able to run the engines for long periods of time during landing. You can save mass on your ion probe by taking some solar panels off and using lighter batteries instead, and just burning in short bursts and time accelerating while the batteries recharge, but you won\u0027t be able to land on much other than Gilly. Finally, you can put on tiny science instruments like a thermometer, barometer (probably won\u0027t need that one!), seismometer (for landings), and negative gravoli detector, and a little antenna, which brings us to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) I suspect the plans are in the works to make the less efficient antennas have a longer range. The middle one does transmit faster though. Perhaps the basic antenna is for low orbits with a range barely large enough to go across Jool, the second is for intraplanetary (or inter-munal if you will) with a range maybe across the Joolian moons, and the third is for interplanetary, with a range extending across the entire Kerbolar system. But currently they all have infinite range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) having a very high TWR for landers is a good idea. It not only makes landing easier, it can save lots of fuel. You don\u0027t want all your weight in engines though. I think both of those engine setups are great - but I have a preference toward the LV-909s and will use Rockomax 24-77s to add extra thrust if I run out of room for LV-909s and want a higher TWR. I try not to use the 48-7S because its TWR is too high for its Isp, and it seems like a cheaty engine. My preferred TWR for landing is at least 10:1 (in relation to the body being landed on) though I will shoot for 20:1 if I can get the fuel/engine mass ratios to work out. 3:1 is okay if you\u0027re landing on a high-G place like Tylo but I wouldn\u0027t go any less for airless landings. For Tylo I\u0027d still try to get at least 5:1 TWR for landing. It\u0027s really important that you don\u0027t have to fight gravity the whole way down. With a 20:1 TWR you can first place yourself in a low orbit, then bring your periapsis just below the surface, then gradually descend, shooting over the terrain at orbital veocity. You will pick up very little descent velocity this way, and you can wait to burn the engines until you are pretty close to the ground. Then you just thrust hard and keep your navball heading centered on the yellow-green tri-point circle (retrograde vector) as you come in for a landing. Watch the surface rushing up under you--it should come in at a relatively constant rate if you are thrusting right. If it starts to come in slower, decrease thrust. If it starts to speed up, increase thrust--nose up (point toward middle of the blue on the navball) if you have to. Once you get the hang of this trick, you can save a ton of deltaV/fuel on landings. It works best for medium-gravity airless worlds like the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or Vall, but should work on Duna and might be useful even on Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest lander engine for Tylo is the Rockomax 48-7S, but you can land on it with 24-77s and LV-909s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T15:44:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keymaster89","CreatedById":100480,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T17:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Trueborn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood point... i didn\u0027t want to go into mods at my first game for try it as it is, but for this, that add only a build assistant i should give it a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(BTW, i\u0027m a mod lover guy, after the first update i\u0027ll definetly start a new career and try tons of mods XD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@thereaverofdarkness\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) how do u use it beside of landing? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) i came to the same conclusion the first time i compared them... the only way to get this correctly scaled is to give them max communication range\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) that is pretty intense! rushing the ground at that speed! i prefer to slow down my orbit until i get a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 descent angle, around 10km kill my orizontal velocity and then control only vertical velocity to the ground... work really good for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T17:09:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use landing legs for keeping your stuff upright.
