Make a backup copy of your save file in case you hork something. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n2. Open it up in a text editor and search for the VESSEL section named \u0022Fredbert\u0027s Wreck\u0022 (or whatever it\u0027s named).\n\n3. Find the PART in the VESSEL.\n\n4. Find the line that says \u0022partName = probeCoreSphere\u0022 (that\u0027s the Stayputnik)\n\n5. **Change the \u0022probeCoreSphere\u0022 to \u0022landerCabinSmall\u0022**\n\n6. Save, exit the text editor, load the save file in KSP and you\u0027re good to go.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T17:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T17:06:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m with everyone. Klaw it and recover back on kerbin\n\nThat would be my preferred solution, too... except that the klaw is so buggy. Maybe others have had better luck with it, but I seem to destroy the universe (or other problem) every time I try to use one. Not even doing anything fancy. I make a simple rocket with a klaw on the front, grapple the stayputnik in straightforward fashion... and suddenly my craft has a slow but steady phantom acceleration that builds up until my craft suddenly explodes. And then any other vessel I switch to also does the same thing. Even if I re-load from save. Can\u0027t fix it unless I totally exit KSP and re-start the program. Bottom line: the klaw is *bad news*(at least for me), and I will not touch one ever again until and unless Squad has the bandwidth to fix it.\n\nThat\u0027s why I resorted to editing the save file. Normally I\u0027d steer clear of that, it just feels somehow unclean... but it\u0027s either get clobbered by the klaw bug, or the stayputnik bug (surely they didn\u0027t *intend* that). Editing the save file is a last resort, but in this case the only resort (for me, anyway)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:25:57Z","Content":"Heh. Use the Klaw and don\u0027t fear it. Then after you finish, save, quit the game, load it anew and play on.\n\nThe Klaw wakes the Kraken, but the Kraken very rarely attacks the Klaw\u0027s direct target - it tends to prefer more tasty morsels, like a large space station fifteen minutes later."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T03:04:36Z","Content":"Does this issue occur in the stock game, or with mods?\n\nAccording to Arsonide\u0027s response to another thread on this topic, this problem apparently is due to a bug with USI MKS:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve tracked this down to a particular ModuleManager config in USI MKS. The config adds seats to every part, including probe cores, which causes the rescue contracts to think they are crewable.
