And by tiny, I mean nothing but the initial pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Have your character step out of the ship (EVA) immediately, and then right-click him. Write a report, take a soil sample, and get back in the ship. Free science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* \u0022Recover\u0022 the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDump all of your science points into the science branch as much as possible. You\u0027ll eventually get things like the thermometer, barometer, a capsule of goo, a science lab, etc. After you get each of these, take them to each planet (including Kerbal\u0027s launch pad!) and right-click them and use them at each location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have the option of either transmitting the data home, or physically carrying it home. There\u0027s a finite amount of Science points you can get from any one method on any one planet. So if you transmit the data home, you\u0027ll have to make more trips, but if you carry it home, you can tap out all the points in fewer trips (3-4 instead of 10-15). There\u0027s also different \u0022places\u0022 to take the data. Write a report and do your experiments in each orbit of the planets. Apparently there\u0027s also \u0022near\u0022 orbits and \u0022far\u0022 orbits for some, including the sun. Do the experiments on the planet\u0027s surface, and even at different locations on the surface (I\u0027ve found at least two different points of interest on the Mun so far). Just keep doing the experiments everywhere you can think of, and then returning the data home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you eventually get to the point where you can haul a science vessel out, then things really get interesting. This vessel can be used to repeatedly transmit data back, then RESET the experiments to do it again! You can start moving the vessel around from planet to planet and grinding science with it. (I\u0027ve yet to manage to land the thing, I don\u0027t have all the parts unlocked to handle its size yet). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T20:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbin, Mun, and Minimus all have biomes (different types of terrain) and you can get science from each one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example: When you go to Minimus, land on the flat frozen lake part, do all your science and fly home.

Watch both seasons 0.22 (complete tech tree without Mods, or cheese) and 0.23 (in progress).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt it certainly easy to get enough science to progress through various stages of the tech tree with all the places and types of science that is out there to explore in KSP. But there are some tools (without mods) that will help you maximize the science you receive for any area. Here are some basic tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Repeat known successful missions with new science instruments! When you get a couple new science instruments, go repeat some previously successful missions with the new instruments. Often times, new instruments further up the tree get you a lot more science for the same mission. The new Science Archives allows you to easily see places where a couple experiments can still be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do lots of the repeat experiments (when applicable) while orbiting over interesting places. For instance, EVA reports when over various places on Mun get you a bunch of science to bring home, without needing to land. Another example - land near the edge of a crater, take a surface sample in the crater, and another surface sample just outside the crater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Transmit any science that gets you 100% transmission, then do the same experiment again to bring home. Crew Reports can be transmitted for 100% science return. Then you can immediately do another crew report (this time, keeping the results) for more science assuming you recover the pod after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of this is dependent on a solid fundamental grounding in Rocket Science, though. Designing ships capable of reaching interesting places, and returning samples safe and sound is where most of your trial, error, and frustration will (and should) be; not in figuring out how to fiddle a science tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/korbitalmechanics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKorbital Mechanics Let\u0027s Plays\u003C/a\u003E for some inspiration.
