So sadly, if you want to use structural tube you should put it in a fairing or it\u0027ll cause massive amounts of drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: To elaborate. Sometimes the game won\u0027t recognize\u00A0the ends of structural tube as being connected, and so treats it as a draggy end (this is probably when the game, for reasons known only to itself, decides to connect the tube\u00A0using its inner node rather than outer node). So in some cases merely using structural tube can result in excessive drag. But you might be okay using them as pure structural components.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever AFAICT structural tube NEVER shields its content from drag so they are no kind of substitute for a fairing or cargo/service bay. If you\u0027re using the inner nodes of the tube and care at all about drag, you\u0027ll be needing to put the whole thing inside a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-29T08:22:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2018 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by blakemw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-29T11:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is correct that no parts except fairings and bays do aero shielding.
