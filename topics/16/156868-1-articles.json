With this mod you can see where your science module is going to land. The only thing is that you need \u00A0to be beware of the fact when you decouple a stage, your crafts gets lighter, resulting in a shorter reentry. Unless you have a heatshield the retroburn stage. However, even this will cause the same problem because there\u0027s less mass \u0027pushing\u0027\u00A0trough the atmosphere, so the craft gives less resistance.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA bigger heatshield however, will result in a much more stable reentry, without the risk it\u0027s going to flip. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loren Pechtel","CreatedById":157006,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T02:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if you have the available tech for it but I found an ugly but working answer to recovering things that were too long and thus flippy:\u00A0 I put a heat shield on the nose, backwards, a decoupler and a nose cone on it.\u00A0 You have to have radial chutes of some type to actually land it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best answer I have found is a mod that adds SpaceX-style grid fins.\u00A0 Enough grid fins keeps anything from lawn darting and when they\u0027re deployed they provide quite a bit of drag, also.\u00A0 I had one without enough fin--it lawn darted but the fins were enough to get it down to drogue chute speed before it ran out of air.\u00A0 It was in the ocean a few seconds after popping the mains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
