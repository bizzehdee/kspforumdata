Gravity is applying acceleration to your ship, so the faster you can escape gravity, the less time gravity has to act on you (the further away from the source you are, the weaker gravity becomes). So with no atmosphere on a planet, your most efficient throttle setting to get into orbit is 100% (not strait up, you should still gravity turn).

Let me share what I understand about how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp is a measure of how efficiently an engine converts fuel into thrust. It is *not* a measure of fuel consumption, though fuel consumption is a function of thrust and Isp. Think of Isp in terms of thrust per unit of fuel; i.e. a higher Isp engine produces more thrust for a given amount of fuel than one with a lower Isp. If you are trying to get the most dV from a given amount of propellant, a higher Isp engine is what you are looking for. For game balance reasons, engines in KSP with a higher Isp have a lower Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR); this is not necessarily the case in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, Isp varies with throttle setting as an engine is only most efficient under a narrow set of operating conditions. In KSP\u0027s approximation of engine behavior the Isp stays the same throughout the throttle range and all other variables are linear, too. So an engine at half throttle in KSP produces half the thrust with half the fuel consumption while Isp remains the same. So it is no more or less efficient to burn longer at a lower throttle setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does matter though, is how the in-game conditions affect the use of a given amount of thrust. During an atmospheric ascent, if your craft is exceeding terminal velocity for its altitude it is wasting fuel trying to punch a hole through the thick air. In that case it would be wise to throttle back; even though the thrust:fuel-consumed ratio is the same you would be using the thrust generated more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, once in orbit and trying to complete a maneuver node the calculation assumes an instantaneous change in velocity. The longer the burn takes, the more fuel is expended away from the optimal point. Even though the Isp remains the same, the thrust is used less efficiently. So in orbit it is better, efficiency wise, to complete your burn as quickly as possible, i.e. at full throttle. This effect is large enough that sometimes a lower Isp but higher TWR engine can complete a maneuver using less dV than the more efficient engine, even though it converts fuel into thrust less efficiently, as more of the burn is completed near the ideal point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T16:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbal Space Program doesn\u0027t simulate chamber pressure, so burning at lower throttle \u003Cstrong\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E generate a decrease in efficiency.

The reason is to maximize the effect of the Periapsis and Apoapsis helping you. The most efficient place to affect the Periapsis or Apoapsis is at the opposite node. Also, during ejection burns (to go interplanetary) you get the most efficiency due to the Oberth effect of high velocities in a gravity well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is that it is the same, because fuel consumptions goes down if you throttle down, and goes up if you throttle up. However since you\u0027re burning slow you spend more time burning and more fuel is used in that longer time. But if you burn fast, the fuel consumption goes up and in that short time to complete a burn you used up more fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn essence, your hypothesis is correct; the rate at which you burn fuel has nothing to do with how efficient fuel consumption is - at least in space.

Let me share what I understand about how it works:\u003Cp\u003EIsp is a measure of how efficiently an engine converts fuel into thrust. It is *not* a measure of fuel consumption, though fuel consumption is a function of thrust and Isp. Think of Isp in terms of thrust per unit of fuel; i.e. a higher Isp engine produces more thrust for a given amount of fuel than one with a lower Isp. If you are trying to get the most dV from a given amount of propellant, a higher Isp engine is what you are looking for. For game balance reasons, engines in KSP with a higher Isp have a lower Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR); this is not necessarily the case in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, Isp varies with throttle setting as an engine is only most efficient under a narrow set of operating conditions. In KSP\u0027s approximation of engine behavior the Isp stays the same throughout the throttle range and all other variables are linear, too. So an engine at half throttle in KSP produces half the thrust with half the fuel consumption while Isp remains the same. So it is no more or less efficient to burn longer at a lower throttle setting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does matter though, is how the in-game conditions affect the use of a given amount of thrust. During an atmospheric ascent, if your craft is exceeding terminal velocity for its altitude it is wasting fuel trying to punch a hole through the thick air. In that case it would be wise to throttle back; even though the thrust:fuel-consumed ratio is the same you would be using the thrust generated more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, once in orbit and trying to complete a maneuver node the calculation assumes an instantaneous change in velocity. The longer the burn takes, the more fuel is expended away from the optimal point. Even though the Isp remains the same, the thrust is used less efficiently. So in orbit it is better, efficiency wise, to complete your burn as quickly as possible, i.e. at full throttle. This effect is large enough that sometimes a lower Isp but higher TWR engine can complete a maneuver using less dV than the more efficient engine, even though it converts fuel into thrust less efficiently, as more of the burn is completed near the ideal point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you read my second post you will see I corrected myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T19:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PDCWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you read my second post you will see I corrected myself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops, didn\u0027t see that, my apologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T20:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsp is constant for an engine, with the exception of in atmosphere vs vacuum.
