Until today I have had no real issue with docking anything with the help of MechJeb. Today, I launch an interplanetary ship core with no real issues. I get it into a 100 by 100km orbit no sweat. I go to launch the first of 4 cruise stage fuel/nuclear engine components and all hell breaks loose. The thing gets into orbit just fine, I get it into the same 100 by 100 km orbit just fine. As soon as it finishes its final burn to circularize I engage the rendezvous planner and autopilot, it goes to work, matches the inclinations just fine, sets up a Hohmann Transfer just fine, and starts to close for an intercept. The odd and hateful hell is when I get to about 20km out, the targeting sensors come on and show my range and even turn on the target relative velocity indicators like normal. The thing starts to do its burns and what not, and then I see it, my relative speed is not decreasing even with my rockets exhaust pointed right AT my target, its increasing, but, my distance is closing, so I figure, its just a glitch in the display. I get to 500m then 450, then 400 and so on, then it happens. The target suddenly is increasing in distance from me, 450, 500, 1km and so on, then at 5km from me, it suddenly warps to a million or MORE KM ahead of me. I hit the button to get closer and this idiotic dance repeats, this time, I get to about 200m distance then the target whizzes away and I am left with no fuel and a strong desire to cry, because at this point I have spent 2 HOURS trying to dock 1 of 4 modules to a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T04:05:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 04:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AlamoVampire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T06:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck if your battery is dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T06:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what caused your problem, but why didn\u0027t you just use the \u0022launch to rendezvous\u0022 option on the ascent autopilot? would have been a lot quicker and you could have gone straight to docking autopilot when it finished.

Don\u0027t know about you but if your relative velocity starts destabilizing wait for it to stabilize,don\u0027t plan any manuevers. So i waited for my relative velocity to stabilize again and retried, it worked then. However the relative velocity for me went from the real velocity,to zero then to about 4k and then back to the real velocity.If i remember correctly it took about 10 mins to stabilize (plus, i do think there was a bit of luck involved).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T06:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebattery power was not the issue, had 4 giant solar panels out \u002B 4 of the 400 rechargables on the thing.

But, again, the glitch has NOT reproduced itself YET since I now have 2 cruise and fuel stages docked to my target vessel, just need 2 more then off to Jool.
