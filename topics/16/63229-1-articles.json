The SoI is big enough to contain an orbit with the right SMA and eccentricity. Tricky to set up, as the canyon is moving as you go through it and there\u0027s high ground at either end according to kerbalmaps. Plus it\u0027s not enough to have the right SMA, eccentricity and inclination; you also need the right mean anomaly. I think I might try to get it to work in Hyperedit first as a proof of concept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
