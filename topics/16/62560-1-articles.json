It has about only 500 delta V left since my transfer burn, it has reached the encounter node. However, I\u0027m wondering the most effective way to slow the craft down without using too much delta V? This is not a return mission so that\u0027s not of my concern, however I\u0027d like to get into a orbit before I attempt to land.
