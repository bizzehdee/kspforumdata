It\u0027s starting to really drag on my system, and it makes maneuvering in the orbital map near Kerbin challenging at times. Is there any way to clear these things out? It\u0027s kind of cool to have orbital debris to attempt to fly to/around, but it becomes a real swarm all too quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any insight you might have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tosh","CreatedById":11055,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T15:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are three ways to do that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
