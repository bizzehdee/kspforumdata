I can\u0027t afford to lose whole vehicles, and I really can\u0027t afford to lose pilots, so I\u0027m taking baby steps in developing aircraft. My philosophy is to begin with simple configurations, a low fuel load, low thrust (increasing with successive tests) and only adding one part at a time, since every change produces a new complication. As instabilities develop in taking off before liftoff, at low altitudes and slow speeds, I hope to fix them, and work up to better performing craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simplest configuration I have found that\u00A0 flies uses a total of 18 of the first tier of aircraft parts (45 science)\u00A0\u00A0 Using a tricycle landing gear configuration, \u00A0 a fuselage with a Mark 1 cockpit, empty fuel tank fuselage, and tail cone;\u00A0 2 type C structural wings,\u00A0 elevons as ailerons,\u00A0 one engine; and two tail fins in a v configuration with the engine between them.\u00A0\u00A0 (A parachute is optional since taking off is one thing,\u00A0 landing is something else.) [I have an image, but haven\u0027t quite figured how to upload it.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first designs way back when\u00A0 frequently veered off the runway and crashed.\u00A0 Since I started using the snap feature to lock the angle of mounting the nose wheel to vertical, it\u0027s not nearly such a problem.\u00A0 The next problem crops up in tests of increasing power.\u00A0 At about 30 kph, the nose wheel starts to lift off, and then drops back down. At about 40 kph, the whole vehicle will lift off, but drops back down. It takes about 50-60 kph (at about 40% power) to get sustained flight. Can any experienced kerbal aircraft designers tell me what this behavior is called and what causes it?\u00A0 The thing will fly, since the ailerons and tail fins give it just enough attitude control, but It\u0027s such a beast that I can hardly recommend it as a trainer below about 500 m of altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do expect to be continuing flight tests with different configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-11T21:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 data-ratio=\u002267.60\u0022 height=\u0022629\u0022 style=\u0022width:392px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u0022930\u0022 alt=\u0022fzjmaXv.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fzjmaXv.jpg\u0022\u003EThat sounds like a typical first airplane.\u00A0 From your description, I built what\u00A0 is in the image at right.\u00A0 With just one Juno engine, it has just enough power to fly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurning off roll authority on the tail-fins is helpful, because ailerons do the job alone with less wallowing, in case you don\u0027t know that already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis forum doesn\u0027t hold images itself, but users put images at other places like imgur.com and link to them there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there is a particular name for sinking back down on the runway after first liftoff.\u00A0 Probably you pitch up a bit when the main wheels leave the ground, which will make you slow a bit; in that case coming back down is called stalling if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E held your pitch fixed, or porpoising if you fly using alt-S trim and the nose dips back down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is difficult to land without hitting the tail on the ground, with that first straight-tapered tail-cone.\u00A0 I crashed a bunch but\u00A0succeeded with a 70m/s approach, touching down at 55m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confutus","CreatedById":171610,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-12T00:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s close.
