But the lack of documentation is infuriating. There\u0027s no description of how to use things in KSP and I have to ask these things on the forum.

It\u0027s not your fault that it doesn\u0027t makes sense because it doesn\u0027t tell you what the real complaint is. All parts are attachable. Telling you the part isn\u0027t attachable isn\u0027t true. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it\u0027s ACTUALLY trying (and failing) to communicate is that a sub-assembly must be \u0022rooted\u0022 on a part for which the following two things are both true:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - It must have an OPEN, UNUSED attachment point on it. If the part you drag has all its attachment points (the green balls) already consumed by being attached to other parts, it will incorrectly claim the part has no attachment points on it. What it\u0027s REALLY complaining about is that even though the part has attachment points, they\u0027re all already consumed. It needs an attachment point that\u0027s open-ended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - It must be a subset of what\u0027s in the editor. You can\u0027t put the entire build into the subassembly tab. You must leave some piece behind. Therefore if you want to put the entire thing in the subassembly, then start it with a pointless dummy command core that you plan to leave behind in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso remember that having open attachment points at the \u0022leaf\u0022 nodes of the assembly isn\u0027t good enough. It must have an open attachment point at the ROOT of the part tree in the subassembly. And the root is always the piece you picked up to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe error message is utterly useless to tell people what they need to do to get it to work. It\u0027s very misleading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T23:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacewalking on Sunshine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spacewalking on Sunshine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I\u0027ve yet to understand is why it will accept some things as sub assemblies and others it will dismiss with a \u0022THIS PART IS NOT ATTACHABLE\u0022 message.\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to be allergic to docking ports, but I\u0027m not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassambly can only accept entire structures. That means you have to drag it by the parent. AKA, the part you started with.
