It used to not matter in the earlier versions of KSP because your spacecraft would be lit by the sun no matter where it was. But now that they\u0027ve modeled shadows and bodies blocking sunlight accurately, it has become much more important to have lighting. Both for docking purposes and for night operations planetside. If you\u0027re building a space station, you should place lights so that they\u0027ll illuminate the docking ports and areas around them. On a ship that\u0027s landing on the dark side of a planet, it becomes nearly impossible to see where you\u0027re going or how high up you are without lights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick that Scott Manley has pioneered is placing the small batteries (that almost any space station is going to need anyway) all around a docking port.
