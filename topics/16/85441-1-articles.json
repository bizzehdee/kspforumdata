The biggest negative change is that the LFB engine/tank combination had its efficiency reduced significantly; if your rockets use this engine a lot they could very well suffer from greater fuel consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T13:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by new version?
