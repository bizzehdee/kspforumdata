I line them up using RCS - the approach speed is less than 0.1m/s and both are almost exactly aligned. From what I\u0027ve read, once they\u0027re close enough they should magnetically clamp together, but this never happens. I just barely nose forward and it just gently nudges up against the other ship and pushes it away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave I got the wrong docking ports on?

Most of us have had elaborate missions go wrong because of a minor error. Even NASA has had similar issues.
