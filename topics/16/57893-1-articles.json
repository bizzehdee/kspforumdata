In the real world, the satellites need ongoing small corrections throughout their service life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can do in KSP, however, is cheat a little and edit the orbit parameters in the save file to achieve a true perfect orbit. They will then remain in that perfect orbit as long as you never make them active (either by switching to them directly, or by an active ship passing within 2.5km of them). As soon as they go active, the orbit will lose perfection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T13:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry not to do the 1-4x physical warp.

The satellite will usually alter its position slightly over the course of its orbit, but always returns to the original position after each orbit is complete. The variations in position are cyclical and negligible WRT the function of a GSO satellite. This is as close to GSO as one can get, and is quite satisfactory for my needs, for several long missions. Over time, the satellites will drift in one direction or another. Since the only reason I need GSO is for Remote Tech comms satellites, and they can maintain line of sight with one another over quite a large variation in position, I usually don\u0027t tweak their orbits until they are several hundred kilometers out of position. To reposition them, I measure the amount of time ahead, or behind, their ideal position they are. Then I adjust the orbital period in the appropriate direction by that amount, wait one orbit, and then return the orbital period to 6h 00m 00.0s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf my satellite has drifted retrograde and is now five minutes behind its nominal position, I will reduce its perigee until the orbital period is 5h 55m 00.0s. Then I\u0027ll wait one orbit and burn at apogee until the orbital period in 6h 00m 00.0s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy peasy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweaking GSO satellites is one of the most satisfying activities in KSP.
