When ARM comes out, I want to rename my current SANDBOX and CAREER modes with their current name and: PRE ARM added to them. Will this break my saves if I try to do this, or should the game be able to cope if I do this and then load as normal?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-26T09:06:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2014 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AlamoVampire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T08:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general the safest approach is probably to install each new KSP release in separate folder.
