You can see in the box in the bottom left corner, the gauge for pitch is barely moving; the rover is applying a lot less torque than it could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022u0IO5tU.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/u0IO5tU.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere instead I am pitching down, and it works normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYaw and roll work normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried going in space, it still malfunctions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tried to launch a new copy of the rover, it works normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI verified by spinning around in space, the effect is real. pitching up is noticeably slower than pitching down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there is some kind of bug where my rover is just not applying its full torque on the reaction wheels when turning in one specific direction. And it\u0027s a bug that happened at some point in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyone has any idea what it could be, how it could have happened, and if I can fix it somehow (short of getting a new rover)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
