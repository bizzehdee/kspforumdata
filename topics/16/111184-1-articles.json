I want to add something to the boosters and want the symmetry to be around each booster, not around the entire craft. \n\nFor example, if I wanted to add 2 fins to each booster, I would turn on 2x symmetry which would make each fin appear once on each booster, because the symmetry is centered around the craft. But what if I wanted each fin to attach twice symmetrically on a single booster, meaning the symmetry is around the booster itself?\n\nNot sure if I\u0027m bringing my point across clearly, but basically I want to know if/how this can be done.\n\nThanks!!"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacePi","CreatedById":143554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:58:50Z","Content":"Use only 1 booster, customize that.

Or am I doing it wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T21:17:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A\\_name**"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T21:08:43Z","Content":"There is a button that toggles between symmetry on the vessel and symmetry on the part you\u0027re attaching to.
