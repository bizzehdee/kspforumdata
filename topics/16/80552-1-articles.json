The yellow marker shows the direction that you\u0027re moving relative to the target (target prograde); the pink marker shows the direction that the target is actually in. Each of these markers also has an opposite mark showing the reverse direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you burn directly towards the target prograde marker, you will increase your velocity relative to the target. If you burn directly towards the target retrograde marker, you will reduce your velocity relative to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to do it is to wait until just before your closest approach and burn directly at target retrograde (the one that looks like the normal yellow retrograde marker) until your relative velocity (shown at the top of the navball when in target mode) hits zero. Then point directly at the target (the pink marker) and gently burn towards him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get the yellow marker on top of the pink one, that means that you\u0027re moving directly towards your target. To move the yellow markers, \u0022push\u0022 retrograde and \u0022pull\u0022 prograde. In other words, when you burn almost-but-not-quite prograde, the yellow prograde marker will move towards you. When you burn almost-but-not-quite retrograde, the retrograde marker will move away from you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get in close, keep your nose pointed at the target and use the RCS translation controls (JKLIHN) to fine tune your approach speed and direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: don\u0027t worry too much about your orbit during all of this. Once you end up next to your target with a zero relative velocity, you\u0027re going to automatically be in perfectly matched orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to get close: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, get into orbit and match inclination, and set the station as a target. Don\u0027t worry about height yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, look at the target: is it in front of you or behind you? If it\u0027s in front, you need to lower your orbit to catch up (but not so low that you hit atmosphere). If it\u0027s behind, you need to raise your orbit to slow down. Don\u0027t bother about circularising, elliptical is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit until you get a close intercept (anything \u0026lt;10km will do), then circularise your orbit to match the target. You\u0027ll probably still be a touch off; add a small manoeuvre node (prograde if you\u0027re in front, retrograde if you\u0027re behind) that gets you a \u0026lt;1,000m intercept. Wait until just before closest approach, burn target retrograde to kill your relative velocity, then point at the target and gently approach. Watch the target/prograde indicators as you approach and burn or RCS to keep them aligned. Flip and kill velocity so that you come to a stop about 40m from the target and then dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T02:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat wanderfound said. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I started out using the rule of 10 (10m/sec closing velocity for each km to target) and it\u0027s still a perfectly fine way of doing it if you\u0027re not in a hurry.
