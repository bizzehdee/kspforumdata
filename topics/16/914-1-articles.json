This will create a dummy stage plus the decoupler stage. Move the couplers to the \u0027true\u0027 lower stage and save/reload (as \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=1057.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESkunkmonkey\u003C/a\u003E suggests) and bam, no more sticky pad - the rocket sits on the decouplers, and while THEY might be stuck to the pad, they get left behind upon ignition of the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can actually make a big difference, without a sticky pad, a rocket as simple as a chute \u0026gt; module \u0026gt; decoupler \u0026gt; liquid tank x4 inline \u0026gt; engine \u0026gt; decoupler makes for an SSTO, or at least pretty close to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a perfect fix, bigger rockets may cause the decouplers to explode, but the only issue that really seems to cause is some browned underpants from our intrepid trio. Or total structural failure. Reccomend liquid fueled engines over the decouplers, throttled down and then brought up for launch. They don\u0027t take well to the sudden shock of full-throttle engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Too late I find that foamyesque actually beat me to the punch (with an identical ship design no less) in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=1007.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esimplest orbiter\u003C/a\u003E challenge.
