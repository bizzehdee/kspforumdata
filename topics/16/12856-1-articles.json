It\\\u0027s actually easiest to do this if you bring all three satellites at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet yourself into Kerbin-Synchronous orbit, at 2868.4 km altitude. Drop the first satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you want to drop the next one 120 degrees behind. You\\\u0027ll want to be back where you are now in 4/3 * the Synchronous orbit period, or eight hours. Grabbing an orbit calculator and doing some quick calculations, that means an apoapsis altitude of 4335.6 km for a periapsis of 2868.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn to put your apoapsis at that distance, orbit once, then when you get back into the Synchronous orbit, circularize. The first satellite is now 120 degrees ahead of you. Drop the second satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn to push your apoapsis out to 4335.6 km again. Go around again. Circularize again. Drop the third satellite. You now have three satellites at 120-degree intervals. For now, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGPS satellites aren\\\u0027t in geosynchronous orbits, by the way.
