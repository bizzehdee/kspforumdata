It is in the very earliest stages, and I\u0027ve run into a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m launching the pieces up one by one, and then using a \u0022tug boat\u0022 to pick them off the launch craft, and then place the piece onto the station. I got the piece into place, but now I can\u0027t get the tug boat to disconnect from the piece that I\u0027ve added to the station. If I try to disconnect the tub boat\u002Bsolar array from the station, then it works just fine. But it won\u0027t allow me to simply remove the tug boat from the solar array. Pic included.

It seems to have to do with docking parts that don\u0027t have any probe core or command pod, to each other. Even though the station as a whole has the cupolas, if the segment that you are docking doesn\u0027t have any control points it can cause this issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game seems to maintain some understanding of how multipart crafts like this are put together. So that segment without a probe core is still, on some level, considered separately from the vessel as a whole (the parts are all listed together under the same vessel in the persistence file, but there are still some traces of it being separate). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the time your solution of undocking one part, then the other works (you can sometimes push the part into place with the tug without actually docking). When it doesn\u0027t, or if you just want to learn how to fix it, there is a way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread describes a few scenarios for how things look in the persistence file and how to fix them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35777-Can-t-Undock-Bug\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35777-Can-t-Undock-Bug\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is fixable, but it\u0027s not exactly straightforward, and it requires some knowledge of how to edit the persistence file (you can also edit the quicksave file).
