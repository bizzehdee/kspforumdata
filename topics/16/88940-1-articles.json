For most purposes, the lower, the better. Once you\u0027re in a parking orbit in LKO, you can go anywhere, and courtesy of the Oberth effect, it is often most efficient to start from the tightest orbit you can manage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get there, just pull a gravity turn (a simplistic one is to turn 45 degrees at 10 km; for more sophisticated turns, you might try watching how MechJeb does it), cut your engines you get apoapsis to ~75-80 km*, and make a maneuver node at apoapsis to circularize. It doesn\u0027t matter if your periapsis is inside Kerbin during ascent: you will bring that up when you reach apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*If you\u0027re still deep in the soup, you might want to fire a bit more to account for loss of speed to atmospheric drag. Also, the higher the apoapsis, the more forgiving the process is for time to make and execute the node, plus the less chance you might accidentally dip back in the soup during the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-30T14:00:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2014 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T13:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe general rule of thumb seems to be that you need to do your gravity turn at 10,000m until your ship is tilted over 45 degrees i.e. half way between straight up and pointing at the horizon. Depending on your ship and it\u0027s rate of acceleration, you can either stay at this attitude until your apoapsis reaches the desired altitude, at which point you can cut your engines, coast up to apo, and then do your circularisation burn. For a slower accelerating ship, the alternative would be that if your apo isn\u0027t at the required altitude by the time your ship reaches 40,000m, turn a bit more so that your nose is 20 degrees above the horizon. This has the advantage of still pushing your apo up, but also increasing your horizontal speed more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no best apo or peri for a perfect orbit, as the orbit height will be dependant on what your aims are for that particular flight, other than both need to be above 70,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sakai","CreatedById":93661,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T14:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone! that answered my question! ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T15:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENobody mentioned that it\u0027s standard procedure to tilt towards the east.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T15:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI fly a little differently; I still do my gravity turn - 45 degrees on 090 at 10,000 meters - but what I do is watch my time to apoapsis after that point. Once it gets to 45 seconds I start tilting more towards the horizon, and I try to keep it right there at 45 seconds for as long as I can. I usually at some point wind up flying horizontal - this has the benefit of raising my periapsis while I\u0027m still in the ascent (i.e. both are going up simultaneously). What happens is that when you do finally call MECO and coast on up into space, your periapsis is already around 25-30k, which means the circularization burn generally takes less than 100 m/s of delta-V; I have on occasion had a circularization burn of less than 10 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
