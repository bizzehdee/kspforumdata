Only a mere 250kW is devoted to core cooling. So for a radiator to not be able to suck out a full quota of\u00A0core heat, it has to already be totally maxed out. In the testing I did, the radiators were handling a constant 16.5% load because of absorption of ambient heat -- but an absolute minimum number of radiators could still keep any drill or ISRU from overheating.
