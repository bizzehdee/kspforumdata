Laythe has a relatively thin atmosphere, and it\u0027s just thick enough to slow you down to about 80 m/s when you reach the surface, not enough to land (on the islands) safely. What kind of spaceplane is ideal for this moon? A light-weight craft with small wings? Broad wings? Where should the control surfaces be? I have practiced landing spaceplanes on rocky islands of Kerbin, and my orbital mechanics are solid, but I can\u0027t seem to get the craft just right. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-14T18:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe basic mechanics for a spaceplane on the thin atmo planets is lots of lift at low speeds, so need generous wing areas.
