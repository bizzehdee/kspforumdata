If you\u0027re flying to Duna, you don\u0027t need science: you\u0027ll get plenty from running experiments while you\u0027re there. But you do need \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1; going to Duna is expensive. Grounded part testing contracts don\u0027t pay much, but they cost \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A10 to run; 100% recovery from the launchpad. OTOH, there isn\u0027t that much science available around KSC, so anyone stuck there doing ground tests could probably use the boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well as providing a quick science boost for struggling newbies, I think the part testing contracts were also set up as they are in order to get around the \u0022I\u0027m two science points short of the next node, and I\u0027ve already done all the easy Kerbin research; do I really have to fly to the Mun again just for that?\u0022. If I\u0027m just a few points short of a science node, I\u0027ll go do a few grounded part tests and then ignore them in favour of more challenging aerial stuff until the issue comes up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1, once you know what you\u0027re doing it\u0027s so easy to acquire science that it isn\u0027t really much of a challenge (e.g. see Scott Manley\u0027s \u0022First Contract in Two Missions\u0022 thing). This was already true before contracts were introduced, and you don\u0027t even need elite Manley-grade skills to take advantage of it. Just stick a refuellable lander on a lab / fuel depot orbiting the Mun, and it\u0027s trivially easy to pop down to every biome in just a few flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that gets a bit tedious once you\u0027ve done it a few dozen times; having a way to easily sidestep the need to chase science points while still getting to play with contracts is a good thing to me. Nerfing the science rewards on the test contracts won\u0027t make it more challenging for experienced players, it\u0027ll just make it more grindy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWanderfound, you\u0027re a very experienced player.

And this is why I always pop in to object when people criticise some of the contracts (ground tests, etc) for being \u0022too easy\u0022. They were set up that way on purpose; the low-difficulty contracts are there to give struggling newbies a boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those just learning: don\u0027t be too ambitious too early. Learn to enjoy repeated failure. Test things out on a small scale before investing in something epic. Consider using Sandbox mode for \u0022simulations\u0022. Set up the Abort action group to kill engines, pop parachutes and decouple your capsule. Use the abort option \u003Cem\u003Ebefore \u003C/em\u003Ethe rocket hits the ground. Try to build cost-efficiently. SRBs are your friend, especially when combined with thrust-limiting tweakables. Think laterally: defuel your test rockets, drive rovers into the ocean for splashdown tests, plant flags near the runway for navigation beacons, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually don\u0027t bother returning with data, BTW. Transmission is less efficient, but it\u0027s good enough most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that KSP is a lot more difficult when you\u0027re starting; I left more than my share of impact craters and stranded Kerbonauts on the Mun while I was learning. My early attempts at rendezvous and docking could have been used as slapstick comedy. My first \u0022successful\u0022 Mun landing saw the legs flex just enough to destroy the engine. The second \u0022success\u0022 toppled over sideways just as I was about to go EVA. The \u0022rescue\u0022 mission sent to get those guys somehow ended up out of fuel in a Kerbol orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first space station had all of its docking ports mounted backwards. I once set up for a rendezvous around Duna with perfectly matched orbits...going in opposite directions. When I first started playing with perma-death on, it took me several campaigns before I managed to keep Jeb alive for more than a couple of missions (FAR \u002B DR \u002B early-tier tech \u002B attempting to reenter in large, unaerodynamic Mun landers for the recovery value = good unplanned disassembly screenshots).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Nintendo hard\u0022 factor is a major part of the appeal of the game; it\u0027s challenging enough to provide a real sense of accomplishment once you do get things done.
