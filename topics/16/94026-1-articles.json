I accepted the contract, built and launched a probe with the antenna and power specifications, and I held the orbit for over 10 seconds, but I still cannot complete the contract. For some reason, the game believes that I did not \u0022reach the designated equatorial orbit around Kerbin within reasonable deviation\u0022. The thing is, I did. I came within \u003Cem\u003E100 meters\u003C/em\u003E of the required orbital specifications. I even had my apoapsis and periapsis matched up with the contract one on-screen. My inclination was also as close as I could get it. What am I doing wrong here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/obUhc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
