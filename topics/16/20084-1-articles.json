Anyways, I need some help. I have an orbit around the sun that basically matches Duna\u0027s (my target) but I don\u0027t know what to do from here. Last night I tried a highly elliptical orbit to try to intercept it like I do with the Mun, but it just didn\u0027t work. I spent 6 in-game years trying to intercept Duna with no luck. Here\u0027s what I tried this morning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i742.photobucket.com/albums/xx68/crocodile100/screenshot1_zpsf5515e61.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1_zpsf5515e61.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I supposed to do now?

Then it\u0027s simply a matter of timewarping until Duna catches up with you. If you\u0027re feeling adventurous you could also take the orbit even higher to speed up the process. Just remember to brake down to a low enough orbit early enough to let Duna catch you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Banarath","CreatedById":12261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T08:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest changing your approach altogether. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKosmo-not made an excellent guide on how to do interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16511-Interplanetary-How-To-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16511-Interplanetary-How-To-Guide\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit math heavy, but it is better explained with this calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s much more efficient than matching orbits, and takes much less time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein addition to those guides, I use the program \u0022Screen Scales\u0022 to measure my angles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
