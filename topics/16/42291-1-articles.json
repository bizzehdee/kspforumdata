That could cause you to lose all the fuel in a probe RCS tank when you intended to use the RCS fuel in the booster stage. The fix, disable the probe tank by right clicking on it and clicking on the green triangle to get a no icon. That way, the thrusters, even the ones on the probe, will use the fuel from the booster stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, the RCS fuel tank will reset if you go do something else and return later to that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike anything, if you don\u0027t know the answer, do a search or set up a test.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T12:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ein short most stock parts passes fuel however it might be limits on number of parts it passes trough.
