Its been frustrating (parachutes being destroyed when I don\u0027t think they should be) so I haven\u0027t been playing it a whole lot. Today I\u0027m in sandbox mode just playing around, and I\u0027m having issues with my building of space planes. I don\u0027t really care to get to space atm, but its frustrating that my boosters cut out shortly after leaving the runway. I can\u0027t get more that 1000 meters up before they cut out. Am I neglecting something on my build? I\u0027m using MK2 parts with LV-T30 as well as the LT-T45. Both have similar results. Any help would be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T21:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard to say without seeing the vehicle but it could be a fuel line issue. Jet engines will draw fuel from anywhere but the rockets need any LFO tanks that aren\u0027t directly attached in line with them to be plumbed in with fuel lines. Also make sure that you\u0027re using the LFO tanks with the black stripes and not just the liquid fuel fuselages or you\u0027ll run out of oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T22:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat engines are you using? Do they stop because of a lack of fuel or a lack of air? Are you trying to run rocket engines using non-rocket fuel tanks and running out of oxidizer? What does the flight report log say at the moment the engines stop? (F3 to get the report up)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
