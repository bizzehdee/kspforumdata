Having wheels in a line like that also makes little sense, at takeoff the plane will pivot off the far back one which is way too far back from the CoM.

I don\u0027t know what mods you are using so I\u0027m not sure how strong those gear are, so they might be overloaded. But to me it looks like the connection between your fuselage and the side tanks is actually warping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes when a plane takes off, it swings a little from side to side or up and down causing sideways stresses on the gear.

Sometimes playing with the timing of SAS activation can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to check for is if your plane is generating down force as you head down the runway.
