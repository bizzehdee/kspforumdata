He then attempted to climb the ladder of the craft, given the name of MLTV-1 (Minmus-Mun Landing Test Vehicle). \u0022(X) Grab\u0022 did not show up. Frustrated, he jetpacked directly to the pod\u0027s hatch. Neither \u0022(A) Let Go\u0022, \u0022(X) Grab,\u0022 or \u0022(B) Board\u0022 showed up. Pressing any of those buttons resulted in nothing.\u00A0I reloaded the\u00A0quicksave from when he planted the flag, and he attempted again to get back in the pod. The same problem occurred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I reloaded the XBox. Anfrid Kerman was able to re-enter the pod. Hallelujah!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the worst was yet to come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt site 2, I clicked on his EVA button. He popped out of the capsule, but the options, once again, did not show up! He just hung on to the ladder on the pod, unable to let go, climb up or down. Could not turn on his jetpack. I had to cut the mission short because of this bug, which is probably worse than the command seat exploding bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat bug was incredibly annoying, but it could be avoided altogether by not using command seats. That leaves plenty of other options for rovers, like the MK1 inline cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how to fix this bug. Reloading the console takes 2 minutes and and the effect of doing that only lasts for 1-3 EVA\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-12T11:50:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2019 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jebediah Kerman Jr.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-12T15:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t own KSP on consoles but I have heard that EVA is quite bugged on consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd knowing how development is on consoles you can wait a year until that\u0027s fixed.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jebediah Kerman Jr.","CreatedById":189524,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-12T15:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought they were working on an update for console right now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
