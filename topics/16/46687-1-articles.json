I\u0027m going by memory, so please quicksave before you try it, but I think you want to aerobrake somewhere around 16km. I think 20km was too high, and maybe 15km was too low. The atmosphere starts around 44km, but is super thin. Don\u0027t forget you can even do multiple loops around as long as your PE stays in the atmosephere.

My braking occurs between 17.5 and 18.5 kilometers, but I\u0027m coming straight out of a Hohmann from Kerbal, not Jool orbit, so I may be moving faster relative to Laythe, and you may want to opt for my upper bound so as not to shed too much velocity.
