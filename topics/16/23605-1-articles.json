Everyone on the forum, coming together and posting there ideas would be good (again, if there\u0027s not already a thread like this). Maybe everyone could also post there computer specs for comparison? I find the game can be frustrating sometimes with lag/crashes/longer loading times than expected. I know this is a physics heavy game, but iv\u0027e never really had problems like this in any other games.

While this did improve lag very slightly, it was not worth loosing the visual effect. I run the game in windowed mode (non-full screen) by default, and was wondering if that would already be helping at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also I remember doing this for Minecraft a very long time ago: My friend told me how to do it. Something about allocating more memory usage to the game or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I think this thread would be beneficial for the majority who play this game.
