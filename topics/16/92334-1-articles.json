I\u0027ve got a question for you all. As you may know, I have a space shuttle, which is life- size - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-And it works, but it\u0027s a bear to fly manually, and here\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SRBs do not throttle independently from the SSMEs. This is a problem because I cannot operate the SSME\u0027s throttle, and so I cannot balance out the thrust when fuel flows. On takeoff, the SSMEs need to be throttled down, but later in flight they must be at full throttle, and the SRBs need to throttle down. Now, the SRBs are not really solid, they are liquid fuel, which means like the real thing, they can lose thrust over the duration of the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the orbiter needs to drain its orbital fuel on ascent to balance with the orange tank, but then i have to feed the last dregs of orange tank fuel back into the orbiter at apsis. IS there a way I can automate this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I\u0027m looking for is some kind of plugin that allows two throttles, or that allows an autopilot to both keep the craft flying straight and aldjust thrust along the way. Is this possible, or do i have to write one myself? And is it possible to write one myself without destroying the stockness of the game? Or, can i make an action group setting where I can \u0022activate\u0022 or deactivate the throttle (not the thrust) of an engine, OR adjust throttle limiters of multiple engines in flight. Because right now i\u0027m stuck with manually adjusting the thrust with thrust limiters, and manually feeding fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm sorry if none of this makes sense, but in short I would like to find a way to automate all this without a stock-ruining mod......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(EDIT: Ideally, I\u0027d get a space shuttle-guidance computer and connect it to KSP, i\u0027m sure that would do the trick)...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-09T15:16:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2014 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by zekes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T02:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E of anything that can do what you describe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think of that \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be able to is KOS.

The Shuttle\u0027s guidance computer could steer with the SRBs via thrust vectoring (unlike KSP solids) but it couldn\u0027t throttle them (they were no more throttleable than any other solid rocket). They did have a thrust profile that varied with time (unlike KSP\u0027s solids), but that was accomplished through clever design of the shape of the hollow center in the solid-fuel grain, and was preset when the motor grain was cast at the factory. Once those puppies were ignited, they were going to burn through their canned (pun intended) thrust profile until tailoff and separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your problem, it seems to me that what you need is some way to tweak the thrust-limiter tweakable of BOTH your strap-on boosters simultaneously. I would think there should be some way to do that with scripting (though I am not a scripter nor a modder, so take my opinion in this with a large grain of salt).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T03:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38069\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDavon Throttle Control\u003C/a\u003E gives you multiple independent throttles, to which you assign individual engines.
