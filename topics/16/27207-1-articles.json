Don\u0027t forget to account for the rotation of the body itself, and also for the fact that, as you burn laterally, you\u0027re basically pulling the final landing site towards the point your craft is hovering over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got plenty of fuel and thrust, you can actually adjust your course a bit in midflight by tilting your lander back in the general direction of your landing site. It does use a lot of fuel, though. Another method is to try short suborbital hops until you\u0027re close enough for satisfaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d hardly call it precision, but I\u0027ve been able to get within a few kilometers of my target on my initial descent, often close enough that I still have fuel to correct my course once I\u0027m sure I\u0027m going to overshoot.

From then on, I attempt to manually adjust just by burning the right way. I also try and set a target on the ground of the base - make sure you don\u0027t have the \u0022Target\u0022 mode in the nav ball - This helps you to know the direction you need to burn. Also, when in Surface mode, burning above the retrograde vector, about halfway between it and straight up, will kill lateral velocity while not affecting your landing position.
