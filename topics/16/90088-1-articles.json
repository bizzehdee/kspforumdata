Most of the time rolling instability is caused by misalignment, but that misalignment can be caused by overloading the nose gear. The new SP Mk2 parts are rocket fuel parts, whereas the old were jet fuel. I may be wrong, but I think the oxidiser adds a considerable amount of mass. When you move the nosewheel backward it redistributes the plane\u0027s mass between the gears with less bias to the nosewheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said all that, some surfaces on some parts just don\u0027t like to make x-axis alignments.

When you move the gear back, you also increase the plane\u0027s angle of attack (the angle the wings tip upwards from level), which has the effect of increasing the overall lift.
