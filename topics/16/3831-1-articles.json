We, the players who spent our time growing with the game, are of course hungry for every \u0027next\u0027 feature, but for someone who might come in late it could well be overwhelming. Allow me to be your guide into this game and lend you a hand on your quest for the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rockets, my strategy and even my approach ain\\\u0027t the only ones that lead to success. Many others have very different styles and they all can be successful. Take a look at the various threads and especially the different space ship designs people built. Some are mostly for fun, some are just hilarious bombs, but there are also a lot of very sophisticated and successful designs. Try them! Play with them! Find the ones that fit your style best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I want to suggest right away is to avoid the temptation of taking a shortcut. Do the \u0027missions\u0027 step by step. NASA didn\\\u0027t simply slap together an Apollo rocket when Kennedy said we\\\u0027re going to the Mun, so why should you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, instead of 10 years it\\\u0027s more like 10 hours from the first flight to the Munshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts and player made parts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s get this out of the way first. There are quite a few player made parts and packs to be found at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.net/kerbal-space-program-mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalspaceprogram.net/kerbal-space-program-mods\u003C/a\u003E Some people consider this cheating, wanting to rely on the \u0027pure\u0027 and \u0027original\u0027 parts. But some of these parts make life a lot easier, they add flavor and some parts (like those lander legs) are only available from mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of 0.13, when we were finally allowed to attach liquid tanks radially and hence we can now build rockets that can stand on more than just three legs sensibly, it has become possible to do a Mun shot on vanilla parts sensibly. Earlier, it was mostly a rather unwieldy monster made of boosters, some boosters and more boosters. The Stock craft attached is a vanilla-only parts Mun craft. But we\\\u0027ll get to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts and what they\\\u0027re good for\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to resist the temptation to go to the page I just mentioned and download everything. You\\\u0027ll be overwhelmed by the amount of parts and you\\\u0027re in for a quite frustrating experience if you do. Plus, the more parts you have in your stock, the longer it takes for the game to load (not as much as it used to, but it\\\u0027s still going to increase your loading time by some margin). For now, I\\\u0027d suggest staying away from them and just use vanilla parts \\\u0027til you\\\u0027re comfortable with them, then add some mods for flavor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s take a look at the various different parts and their meaning. Start the game, then go to the vehicle assembly building (the big one on the left). As of version 0.13, you\\\u0027re presented with a selection of capsules to use. For now, the only one you have is the stock one so take that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look to the left of the screen. On top, you have six ledgers that we\\\u0027ll now discuss in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPropulsion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stuff in propulsion is what moves your rocket. It contains fuel tanks, rocket engines and solid boosters. For now, this is the standard fuel tank, the two different rocket engines, the RCS fuel tank and the stock solid booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiquid fuel tanks and rocket engines\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince they belong together, they can as well be handled together. Every engine needs at least one fuel tank to work. Without, it\\\u0027s just dead weight. You can use two, three or even more fuel tanks for a single engine, likewise you can use couplers (we\\\u0027ll get to that) to fuel multiple engines from a single tank. They\\\u0027re quite a bit heavier than the solid boosters, but they can be controlled. You can decide to run them at half power, or shut them off and power them back on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027ll notice that you have two different engines to choose from. One is a more powerful one, the other one gives you more control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolid boosters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid boosters have two settings: 100% throttle and burned out. The moment you start a booster, it will burn for its allotted time and then simply shut off. No control, no way to turn them off aside of jettisoning them (and then it\\\u0027s a gamble whether they may hit your rocket on their uncontrolled flight path...), but they\\\u0027re cheap and lightweight compared to their thrust and power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERCS fuel tank\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS fuel tanks are for position control. These are the tanks for the thrusters that offer you lateral movement and a lot of control, for the price of being fairly weak. We\\\u0027ll get to them when we need them, for now, let\\\u0027s ignore them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommand \u0026amp; Control\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, things that let you control the craft better. In here, you\\\u0027ll find two different SAS modules and the thrusters for the RCS tanks. SAS modules make flying the craft a lot easier, so it\\\u0027s usually a good idea to have one of those on your rocket, especially if it\\\u0027s a HUGE rocket that is hard to control otherwise. For now, we won\\\u0027t really need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStructural \u0026amp; Aerodynamic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically couplers, struts and wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three couplers in the fold. The radial decoupler, to slap boosters to the sides of your craft. The stack coupler, to throw away lower stages that are spent. And the tri-coupler to have three instead of just one leg to stand (and thrust) on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for wings, they let you turn the rocket more easily. If you notice that turning your rocket becomes near impossible, this is what you want to add to your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts allow you to make your rocket more sturdy. If you rocket wobbles and looks like it\\\u0027s falling apart, if your outer boosters look like a cheap chairoplane, this is what you want to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd new in 0.13, the fuel lines. Fuel lines allow you to connect tanks that are, for example, attached radially to funnel the fuel in them to the main tanks. I\\\u0027ll get into detail with them in a separate tutorial... when I finally figured out reliably how they work. For now, attaching them is simple. Take one, attach it to the tank FROM which the fuel should be flowing, then attach the other end to the tank TO which you wish to draw fuel (in 0.13.1 it got turned around, in 0.13.0 it was attach TO tank first, then FROM tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUtility and Scientific\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust the parachute in here for now, but it\\\u0027s essential. Without, landing might be a tad bit hard on your kerbonauts. In various player made packs you\\\u0027ll find satellites, more parachutes and various other tidbits here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe rest\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot so important for now. They are empty anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to orbit is fairly easy, once you know how to do it. A common misconception is that you just have to point your rocket upwards and then somehow you magically end up in an orbit. That\\\u0027s not the case. To get into an orbit, you have to get some kind of horizontal momentum. In other words, fly to the side instead of up. The only reason we fly up first is, obviously, that it\\\u0027s kinda hard to do an orbit while your rocket is dragging on the ground, but also to overcome air resistance. Air, and hence its resistance, ends at about 70,000 Meters on Kerbin. Our first goal is, hence, to get to an altitude of over 70,000 Meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut while we\\\u0027re doing that, we also must somehow reach a serious amount of lateral movement. At 70,000 Meters, we\\\u0027ll need about 2200m/s horizontal speed to stay in an orbit and not fall back onto Kerbal. Our first goal is hence to combine those two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOur orbital rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let\\\u0027s build a rocket. We want a rocket that can reach orbit and return our kerbonauts safely back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut underneath the capsule a stack decoupler, so when we return we can throw away any useless weight. On top of the capsule, put a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow put 4 fuel tanks below the decoupler, and one of the powerful engines underneath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut 6 radial decouplers around the rocket. For symmetry, you can use the tool at the upper left corner of the hangar, to make six instead of just one decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a solid booster on every decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\\\u0027s time to mess with the staging. We want the boosters and the liquid engine to fire at the same time. Simply grab the engine and its fuel tank on the right hand side staging display and pull them down into the lower stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiftoff!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit the launch button (upper right corner in the hangar) and let\\\u0027s see how she fares. To launch the rocket, hit space and be prepared for a rocky ride! We have no SAS modules, so you will have to do some serious steering. Get used to it! Your first goal is to keep the rocket upright and pointing towards the sky. It will spin a little, correct that! The boosters will eventually burn out, jettison them as soon as they no longer provide thrust. The key to success is as little dead weight as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 10-15,000 meters it\\\u0027s time to start banking towards the direction we eventually want to go. Since it\\\u0027s a good idea to make use of Kerbin\\\u0027s rotation, try to fly towards 90 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow is also a good time to introduce you to the different speeds concerning orbit and surface. If you click on the speed indicator above the artificial horizon, you can see it. Orbital speed is the speed relative to the center of mass. It WOULD be equal to surface speed if Kerbin didn\\\u0027t rotate. Surface speed is your speed over ground. For now, just remember that surface speed is what matters during landing, orbit speed is what matters during orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, back to our flight. Bank slowly. At about 30,000 Meters you should be aiming at about 45 degrees up. In a perfect world, you should hit the 70,000 Meters about the same time as you hit the 2300m/s. Since few things in this world are perfect, try to get a bit higher. We can use that hight soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAttaining orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you hit about 70,000 meters it\\\u0027s time to check the overview map. Hit M and let\\\u0027s take a look at our flight plan. Most likely, your flight curve indicator (the blue line) will show that you\\\u0027re in for a short trip. Aim towards the direction you want to go (90\u00C2\u00B0 if you followed my suggestion) and keep the throttle up \\\u0027til the apogee (labeled AP on the flight path) is a few kilometers ahead of you. In a perfect world, you\\\u0027d want to apply thrust ONLY while you\\\u0027re at apogee, to maximize your fuel efficiency. Since you probably won\\\u0027t have the luxury of that much thrust, you will have to start thrusting a little earlier than that. With time you\\\u0027ll get a feel for how much thrust your rockets can muster and how soon or late you may fire them to achieve best fuel efficiency. Your goal now is to lift the perigee of your orbit (the PE on the flight curve, which is right now still probably below Kerbin\\\u0027s crust, i.e. on or \u0027in\u0027 the Planet) to above 70,000 Meters. Once you\\\u0027ve done that, congratulations, you\\\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: You only thrust towards 90\u00C2\u00B0 (i.e. in the direction of your flight) to raise your orbit and towards 270\u00C2\u00B0 (away from your flight direction) to lower it. Don\\\u0027t thrust up (away from planet) or down (towards planet) once you\\\u0027re almost in orbit. Staying in orbit is a matter of horizontal speed. Not a matter of \u0027flying up\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGetting back down\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting back down is fairly straightforward: Aim your rocket against the flight direction indicator (the green thingie on your artificial horizon, it should be pointing towards 90\u00C2\u00B0, i.e. aim your rocket to 270\u00C2\u00B0 on the artificial horizon where that green thingie with an X inside is located) and thrust. Your goal is to come down in water, for an obviously softer landing than on land. You needn\\\u0027t lower your perigee to the ground, getting down to about 30,000 meters is enough, the air drag should do the rest. Don\\\u0027t forget to jettison the rocket and deploy the parachute (i.e. hit space often enough), and welcome back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-13T14:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESome advanced maneuvering and transfer orbits\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we managed to get into an orbit, let\\\u0027s try to get more control over our craft. A Mun shot will require us to change our direction a few times, and since fuel is precious in outer space, we\\\u0027ll want to use as little as possible of that precious fluid to get as far as we possibly can. Below you find my standard orbiter. It\\\u0027s a bit bigger than the basic orbiter. And with bit I mean a damn lot. Hence it has an Advanced SAS module to keep it manageable. It also features a gimbaled engine at the center of those first stage fuel tanks. Both will come very handy. But you\\\u0027ll quickly see how \u0027more fuel\u0027 doesn\\\u0027t necessarily also mean \u0027more fuel to spend\u0027. Because most of the rocket will be gone when you finally manage to get into an orbit. The \u0027normal\u0027 engine powered legs of the rocket will be spent before the gimbaled engine in the center will eat through its fuel, so be prepared to get rid of those radially coupled tanks when they\\\u0027re dead (you\\\u0027ll hear a \u0027whoosh\u0027 sound when it happens, and the push suddenly falls to 1/8th of its original thrust). By then you should be in orbit, or almost there, so it\\\u0027s no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rocket is meant to be my \u0027Gemini Project\u0027 of KSP. As soon as docking gets into place, this rocket is probably the one that I will use for docking practice. You can actually try some \u0027pretend docking\u0027 with it, I\\\u0027ll get to that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiftoff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket handles fairly well for its size. Turn SAS on (hit T), push the throttle to the top and launch. Separate the boosters as soon as they\\\u0027re spent, else there\\\u0027s usually little to do, the rocket is really stable and needs little input. Keep the speed at the maximum (I found out air resistance holds no candle to the impulse gain by thrusting at max power). As soon as you leave the denser parts of the atmosphere (around 32,000 Meters), start banking towards 90 degrees like you did previously. At about 45,000 Meters you should slowly start to level out, for a stable Orbit around 70-90,000 Meters, you\\\u0027ll need approximately 2200-2300m/s orbital (!) speed. The outer rocket legs should take you to orbit, leaving the inside stage for maneuvering in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn Orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat stage \u0027inside\u0027 the circle of six fuel \u0027legs\u0027 is meant to be the orbital maneuvering stage. I recommend using it to get a feel for how orbital mechanics work, how transfer orbits work, how to change inclination, and most of all, how to do all that while spending as little fuel as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETransfer Orbits\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA transfer orbit is, simply put, the way to change your apogee (highest point in your orbit) and perigee (lowest point in your orbit). As you see, an \u0027orbit\u0027 isn\\\u0027t necessarily circular. It can be highly ellyptical without failing to be an orbit. It only fails as an Orbit if your perigee is too low (and you hit the ground when you\\\u0027re at the \u0027bottom\u0027 of your ellypse) or if your speed exceeds escape velocity (i.e. if your apogee is \u0027too high\u0027, or rather, your speed too high to result in an apogee and forcing you eventually to fall back towards Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe laws of physics also dictate that you\\\u0027re fastest while at perigee (closest to the planet) and slowest at apogee (farthest away from the planet). Which makes sense, to get to perigee, you \u0027fall\u0027, to get to apogee, you \u0027climb\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your goal is only to reach a certain height at one point in your orbit (as we will when we try to get to the Mun), the most fuel efficient way to do that is to thrust at Perigee. Thrusting towards the movement vector of your vessel will lift the apogee while not changing the perigee. Thrusting away from it lowers the apogee while not affecting the perigee. All of that of course considering that you\\\u0027re EXACTLY at perigee. Since perfect, unlimited thrust does not exist, your perigee will be changed ever so slightly by that maneuver as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe opposite applies to thrusting at apogee. Thrusting towards the vector at apogee raises your perigee. Thrusting away from it lowers it. This is very convenient on your return trip, since you\\\u0027ll only need a little fuel to lower your perigee enough to get back to Kerbal, which will be very useful due to us not having a lot of fuel left when we get back from the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry it! Thrust at perigee and apogee to lower and raise your orbits. Try to get into a circular orbit by thrusting at the right times in the right direction. Try to get into an insanely ellyptical orbit without going over the escape velocity (you\\\u0027ll see if you do on the map (M), if your flight path has a beginning and an end, and isn\\\u0027t an ellypse no more, you are too fast to ever return to Kerbal). Find out what happens if you thrust while you\\\u0027re between apogee and perigee. Always remember: Only thrust towards or against your speed vector to affect your orbit height. Never up or down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbit inclination changes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you don\\\u0027t want to rotate just east-west. Sometimes you\\\u0027ll want to have an inclined orbit, especially when we\\\u0027re going to the Mun, the best landing spots are unfortunately not at the equator. We\\\u0027ll have to tilt the orbit a little. Now, this will of course cost us fuel. But how much? And how to consume the least fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said before, your orbital speed is lowest at apogee. That also means that speed changes at apogee have the most impact. Or, in other words, if you want your orbit to change inclination, you should do that change at apogee where a little thrust is all it takes to change a lot of inclination. Try it. Get into a highly ellipitcal orbit (with a high apogee and a low perigee). When you\\\u0027re at apogee, thrust towards the north. You\\\u0027ll notice your orbit changing direction considerably. Count the seconds you\\\u0027re thrusting. Now do the same towards south at perigee. You\\\u0027ll notice that the effect is by far less. Be careful when thrusting, though, since if you\\\u0027re not pointing exactly 90\u00C2\u00B0 away from your orbital vector, you\\\u0027re either lowering or raising your perigee. And since you\\\u0027re changing your orbital vector when changing orbit inclination, that means that you can\\\u0027t simply keep thrusting towards north or south without eventually not being at 90\u00C2\u00B0 towards your orbital vector anymore. Don\\\u0027t forget to check your perigee and apogee when you\\\u0027re done and correct it. Now, at apogee, you can correct it for just a few drops of fuel. When you\\\u0027re down at perigee, it\\\u0027s a titan\\\u0027s work to keep the capsule in orbit if your perigee got too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDocking practice and RCS thrusters\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your second stage is burned up, you can use the rest of the time for some docking practice. Don\\\u0027t worry, that final stage should have more than enough juice to get you back from pretty much any orbit within the Mun orbit. That spent second stage makes a beautiful docking target. Get into a stable position (i.e. no banking/tilting), putting the game into 5x speed acceleration for a moment to put the rocket on rails helps a lot here and turn on the RCS control with the R key. Separate the stage and immediately put some backwards thrust onto the RCS to stop moving away from the jettisoned stage. Now turn your capsule around and pretend your nose cone is a docking adapter. Try to hit the side of the stage with your nose in an angle that would allow a docking adapter to \u0027lock\u0027. The RCS control allows you to move your capsule sideways (with the i,j,k,l keys, and h and n for forwards/backwards thrust), which lets you align it perfectly with the stage. Try to move away for a bit, then approach it again. Eventually we\\\u0027ll get some docking in place and you\\\u0027ll want to be able to do it!

The procedure is straightforwards and not much different from earlier. Wait until you\\\u0027re at apogee, then thrust against the orbit vector to lower your perigee to 30k meters or below. Depending on your apogee, it might be a good idea to first lower that, in case you went for an insanely elliptical orbit (or, later, return from the Mun and are in such an orbit). The atmosphere might not be enough to lower your speed so you don\\\u0027t get back into an orbit. So far we do not have heat friction and G-forces in effect, but I guess it\\\u0027s not a bad idea to prepare for that time and try to neither enter the atmosphere at some 5000m/s, nor at g-forces that liquify our Kerbonauts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-13T15:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo the Mun\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, now\\\u0027s the big moment.

Jettison the attached legs as soon as they get dry (you\\\u0027ll notice it when the three outside engines shut off, listen for the shutoff \u0027whoosh\u0027).

You have almost a full orbit time before we do a TMI (trans-munar injection). To find the right time for the TMI, go to the overview map. Turn it so that you look at the Kerbin/Mun system from the top, with your rocket describing a circle around kerbin. Now turn it until the Mun is at about 60\u00C2\u00B0 right of the middle line (i.e. about in the direction of the right upper corner of your screen). Now wait until your rocket is \u0027below\u0027 Kerbin in this picture, then apply full throttle towards the orbital vector. Switch back to the overview map and watch your apogee rise. When it gets close to reaching the Mun orbit, slow down. You do not want to overshoot, your goal is to have an apogee that\\\u0027s just a little inside that Mun orbit. This maneuver will consume about all of your remaining fuel in the ascent stage. There should be a little left.

Point your ship towards the side your vector is already pointing (i.e. either 270 or 90 degrees, depending on whether you would hit the left or the right side of the Mun) and thrust. Not too much! Careful with the throttle, you have a rocket underneath you that can escape the pull of Kerbin, a body that\\\u0027s by some margin heavier than the little piece of rock you\\\u0027re heading for! In a nutshell, 1/4 thrust is about the maximum these engines will ever see in the rest of their short lifetime anymore! Once you have a perigee that\\\u0027s above the Mun surface (about 1000 Meters will do, more doesn\\\u0027t hurt, though), we\\\u0027ll wait again to reach that perigee. Be prepared to align the rocket away from the thrust vector. If you already see a \u0027PE\u0027 marker when you get into the gravity well of the Mun, you could have skipped that last section, all you have to wait is to reach that \u0027PE\u0027 marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunar orbit insertion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\\\u0027re at Perigee, thrust against the speed vector to get into orbit.

That might not be good for the health of your rocket! Maybe it\\\u0027s not a bad idea to even wait until you passed perigee if that perigee is below 20,000 meters. Your goal is to lower the speed to about 600m/s, give or take.

And preferably in a crater on the light side of the Mun so you can see what you\\\u0027re actually doing. That shadow you cast is a really neat way to tell how far away from the ground you are, and since we do not have radar height sensors (at least not yet), it\\\u0027s your best indicator to avoid that \u0027oops, ground already?\u0027 moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no craters at the Mun equator. At least not on the lit side. Now, you could of course wait a few days or weeks for the Mun to circle Kerbin and make the other side lit... I frankly don\\\u0027t know for sure if that works, I never tried it... or you could change your orbital plane to cross over a crater in the sunlight. Note, though, that the Mun moves a little while you wait, i.e. that craters on the \u0027left\u0027 side get lit while craters on the \u0027right\u0027 side will move into darkness. Depending on just how ellyptical your orbit is, and hence how long an orbit takes, this might be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you decided for a crater, do an inclination change, just as you did during the second phase of the missions around Kerbin. Keep an eye on the overview map to see whether your inclination change works out. Try not to burn the whole fuel in that second stage, but even if you do, no big deal. When the outer tanks go dry (they get used up faster since the gimbaled engine in the center uses less fuel) you should be ready for the descent burn, so try to time it so that your fuel runs out when you\\\u0027re actually about to touch down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that the Mun is rotating. It will move towards the right, so if you incline your orbit, aim to the right of your target or it will move out below you!

Now there is very, very little error margin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you cross the edge of the crater, keep your eyes peeled for a spot that looks flat, then start thrusting. Your goal is to get to zero horizontal movement (turn the artificial horizon back to \u0027surface speed\u0027!), your vector indicator should point exactly down (or, if you\\\u0027re getting too low, up) until you are PERFECTLY hovering. Do NOT attempt to land while you still have lateral movement, the rocket is very top heavy and it WILL tumble and crash if you have too much sideways movement. The RCS thrusters help a lot here. When your speed indicator points down (i.e. if you\\\u0027re \u0027falling\u0027), thrust the RCS TOWARDS that marker. I.e. if the marker is right off center, push right. If it\\\u0027s above, press \u0027k\u0027 (i.e. \u0027pull\u0027 the steering lever to go up, like in a plane). If you\\\u0027re climbing, it\\\u0027s AGAINST the marker.

Use them to take off, don\\\u0027t bother going too high, just stay above the ground and head towards a 90 degrees orbit. Since you are not on the equator (at least most likely you\\\u0027re not), this will end up in an inclined orbit, but that\\\u0027s no worry right now. The worry right now is to get that vessel up to speed again and keep it from falling down onto the Mun. Try to get to about 400m/s before even considering anything else. Your rocket will probably run dry before you reach that speed, dump it, turn RCS on and use RCS to build up more speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we have learned, it\\\u0027s best to thrust at apogee to raise the perigee. Since we\\\u0027re not aiming at a high apogee, just one that keeps us from crashing, take a look at the overview map. Note that your RCS thrusters have precious little thrusting power, so waiting right for apogee is probably not an option, but you shouldn\\\u0027t burn much earlier than reaching it. Also, we actually needn\\\u0027t get into a stable orbit. Just one that takes us once a bit more than half around the mun and still keeps us above ground when we cross that white line on the overview map that indicates the Mun\\\u0027s orbit around Kerbin.

I\\\u0027ve read all guides you wrote, and all were quite helpful. I find stuff like doing a Mun shot easy now. The thing with pictures is true, though. I\\\u0027ve seen one guide where you added pics, but have done so using forum attachments. This is a bad idea for two reasons - one is, the pics are actually small thumbnails that have to be clicked on to expand them, and the other, they\\\u0027re all at the bottom of a (very long) post, meaning every now and then in text you have a reference \u0027like you see in pic #32\u0027 (or whatever). When this happens you have to scroll down, find and expand the pic, then scroll back up and find the segment where you left off - interrupting the flow of reading. This will probably put off a lot of people from even viewing the pics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is easy - use one of the image hosting services, like imageshack, tinypic, photobucket, or something that allows you to just hotlink the images using the IMG tags. Pics will be loaded large, precluding you from having to expand them (just make sure they\\\u0027re not too large to not wreak havoc on the formatting) and you can place them smack in the middle of the text, allowing you to put a pic right at the segment of the text that\\\u0027s relevant in relation to it. This makes for a much smoother reading experience as you don\\\u0027t have to have a scroll-click fest every time you want to see a pic for example. Another advantage is, pics will still be there by the time forum attachments will be gone (most forums delete attachments after a while due to limited and costly server space). Just a suggestion for any future guides (hope there\\\u0027ll be some, you write excellent guides and when we get planets they\\\u0027ll be of much use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t want to come off as spoiled.
