I recently tried going to the north pole.... and\u00A0I managed to get my ship stuck in a polar orbit without any engines at all, and no\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel left after trying to use it to deorbit myself. I have a plan A rescue shuttle built and ready to go, but I tend to have a habit of my plan As\u0027 ending in failure. Anyone have a suggestion of plan B? My stranded ship is no longer in any condition to deorbit, due to a small accident with the engines causing my heat shield to explode.\u00A0I cannot revert, (already went back to space center) and I really am fond of my pilot so I do not want him to die/be stranded. Can someone give me suggestions of a plan B? My plan A is to just send up a small shuttle with a mk1 crew cabin and enough fuel to deorbit, EVA my stranded pilot into said shuttle, and then land it using parachutes and the heat shield. I have a feeling this too with end up stranded and in pieces, so that\u0027s why I need a plan B,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T23:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pod with a heatshield and parachutes is really simple...you mentioned a \u0022shuttle\u0022 not sure how complex that is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T23:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet out and push\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Really - EVA \u0027jet pack\u0027\u00A0can be refuelled an infinite number of times, just by re-boarding the command pod. \u00A0Get out, push pod retrograde, re-board = refuel, repeat until desired periapsis or you\u0027re coming back into the atmosphere anyway and it isn\u0027t safe to EVA).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T14:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222683348\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468969422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164179\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tjt\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, tjt said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pod with a heatshield and parachutes is really simple...you mentioned a \u0022shuttle\u0022 not sure how complex that is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stranded ship is made out of a mk1 command pod and a science Jr. It has 2 radial parachutes but no heat shield.

Just be sure that the extra mass of the Mk 1 cabin doesn\u0027t require you to tweak your launcher. Or, if your probe cores are up to the challenge, you can also send an empty 1-man capsule with a robo-pilot instead of using a second Kerbal, as Pecan suggested.

But that\u0027s at least as hard as docking, so probably not what you want. Any way you slice it, though, you have to bring a second craft to rendezvous with this pod, and the simplest thing at that point is to EVA the stranded guy to the second craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-20T17:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThxs guys!
