The trick of course is going to be placing the RCS thruster blocks in the right spot to give you good overall steerage. 12 blocks is what I recommend per station bit - 4 as close to the top as you can manage, 4 as close to the bottom, and four along the center of mass. Preferably all twelve blocks should be placed the same radial distance from the central axis of your station bit to avoid uneven torque when rotating (you can mount an RCS block on cubic octagonal struts or even girders if necessary). RCS fuel tanks will also be needed, of course. RCS makes docking a heckuva lot easier (largely because of the H and N keys; you don\u0027t have to turn the whole assembly around to speed up or slow down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend using bipropellant (standard engines) for getting to the rendezvous point, and using RCS for the actual docking maneuver.
