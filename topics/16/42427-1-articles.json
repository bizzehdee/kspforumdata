On big wings and heavy craft I try to put one or two struts between each wing panel to avoid flapping and snapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the spaceplane hangar I put my CoL slightly behind the CoM, which makes takeoffs a bit trickier but helps with stability in flight; if the CoM every moves behind the CoL (because, for instance, of fuel burnt off) the plane will become unstable and your pilot will have a bad day.

A lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tip I didn\u0027t know that defeated my designs for so long; landing gear placement matters. Rear landing gear should be only slightly behind the CoM; if it\u0027s too far back, the plane can\u0027t rotate its nose up on take-off and it\u0027ll never leave the runway. (If it\u0027s too far forward, you\u0027ll tip back until the tail hits the runway which is bad for the paint. If you\u0027re worried about dragging the tail on take-off, put one extra set of gear near the tail so that when extended it barely gets below the tail... far enough to stop it from hitting the runway, but not so far that it prevents the nose from pointing up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChevronTango","CreatedById":70939,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T13:33:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy Pro Tip is to angle the wings back by about 10-20 degree\u0027s using shift\u002B[WASD]. If the wings are parrallel to the ground occasionally angles and things conspire against you and you can end up creating lift into the runway (rather counter intuitively). Angling them back ensures you are generating the lift up, and means at higher altitude you don\u0027t have to point your nose up as high (and therefore not waste as much fuel with engines that you\u0027d ideally like pointing prograde)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZenithRising","CreatedById":77506,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T14:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the suggestions guys.

Most likely if you are placing your wheels onto the wings you will come across this issue often and will need to find the right spot of the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only tip to resolve quickly is to firstly build the body of your plane (plane without wings) chuck the wheels on and test to see if it is stable down the runway. The wings only add lift and a bit of weight to your plane, however sometimes will need to place on the wings in which it becomes a case of trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T23:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the space enabled (vectoring rocket, docking port, monopropellant) planes in my \u0022self flying planes (mostly)\u0022 stock package at the Spaceport.

When something is flying through the air the centre of mass wants to lead the way (think abouta dart from a dartboard, or just stick some chewing gum on one end of a McDonald\u0027s straw and throw it). This, however, is a difficult condition to meet since you will usually have engines at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CoM can (and probably will) also shift around as fuel is used up. Engines draw their fuel in order from the furthest away fuel tank to the nearest, so for simple designs (fuel down the middle and engines at the back) this will usually mean the engine is draining the fuselage from front to back. This will shift your CoM backwards as you spend your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this you can try to use fuel lines so that fuel is drawn from the middle, taking fuel from front and back equally. But this can require some tricky fuel line routing since you can no longer stick your engine directly onto parts that are crossfeed capable and are in turn connected to the rear fuel tank. One solution is to stick a structural plate at the back of the fuselage (these are NOT fuel crossfeed capable) and stick your engines on behind that. Then route fuel from the middle tank directly to the engines using fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this does not guarantee that your CoM won\u0027t shift: that will only be true if your middle tank is right on top of the CoM to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sauron","CreatedById":69931,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T02:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne VERY helpful tip I picked up recently that has helped me go from 20 ton SSTOs to ~50 tons is wheel placement.

Having many intakes on the front of the craft will tend to cause it to flip because of their high drag coefficient (~7 times higher than other parts). The most reliable way to control CoD is to place as many of your wings as possible near the back of the craft (with only a little bit at the front to keep it under control). The stock aerodynamics are made for rockets, which are fletched like arrows, so you do well to have arrow-like craft.
