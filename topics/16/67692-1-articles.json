Somehow my traveltimes taking approx. four times longer. Before updating I launched two vessels to Minmus. The time between each encounter with Minus field of influence of each vessel was ~15h hours. Now I got to wait 2 days and 3 hours till each vessel gets into a orbit of Minmus. On the other hand a got a planned maneuver-node for a course-correction in one kerbal day. Now my kerbal alarm clock tells me I have to wait 4 days till I reach the node. This list can be continued with many other examples. Did I miss something in the changelogs? Or is something broken at my saves? I also tried to restore my old save (backup of the last 23.0 save) but after loading its the same.
