You need to FIRST convert it to a flyby by nudging the periaps outward to [theoretically \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E] altitude BEFORE you circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more general point, you\u0027re revealing what is essentially the heart of the \u003Cstrong\u003EMechJeb Debate\u003C/strong\u003E. Now, full disclosure, I use MechJeb too. The real space program uses autopilots, the Space Shuttle was only flown manually twice (evidence suggests the third time was an attempt to do so during the \u003Cem\u003EShuttle Columbia\u003C/em\u003E disaster, though if so, it was obviously inconsequential and futile) and both known attempts were planned to be limited. One was aborted fourteen seconds prematurely, and the second time almost resulted in the loss of a mission objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with manual OR autopilot inputs, in KSP or on Earth, is the Oberth Effect and something that I think may be called \u0022arc distances.\u0022 Essentially, think of it this way: If you\u0027re standing at the front of, say, a bus. The two sides of the windshield of the bus are wider apart than your whole armspan. If you go to the rear of the bus, however, you can cover the width of the windshield with your hand with outstretched fingers. The further away you are, the smaller adjustments you have to make to effect a HUGE course correction at the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the game, the Mun, Duna, even Kerbin itself are huge when compared alongside the actual size of the craft you\u0027re piloting. But the distance of even a few centimeters in travel direction coming out of an escape burn can literally mean the difference between crashing into the center of your target body such as in your photograph, and conversely being flung outward on a gravity assist, albeit an unintentional gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome elementary explanations are in order here. Orbits, you might need to know, are calculated around the CENTER of a planet. That\u0027s why you actually have an \u0022orbital velocity\u0022 when sitting still on the Launchpad. The surface of Kerbin is rotating around the center of the planet, so technically you are orbiting. You may already realize, however, that the orbit is slower than escape velocity, so gravity takes hold. This is a fair approximation of what is happening here on Earth, too -- as you sit playing KSP, you are literally \u0022orbiting\u0022 the center of the earth once every 24 hours. The International Space Station also does so, but at an altitude (above the average-sea-level surface of the planet, not above the atmosphere, and certainly not above the center of the Earth) of ~277km. To get your altitude there in your chair, or the altitude of the space station, above the center of the Earth, you need to take your \u0022indicated altitude\u0022 (close to zero for you, ~277,000 meters for the station) and add that number to, literally, the radius of the planet from the center of the core to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you see impact trajectories like the one you display in that imgur link above, that \u0022escape angle\u0022 from the Munar SOI is deceptive, since it \u0022looks\u0022 like you\u0027re going somewhere afterward. Mathematically, you would, if the entire mass of the Mun were a dimensionless dot in orbit around Kerbin. You\u0027d swing around that center of mass at ostensibly extraordinary speeds, and fling outward in nearly the opposite direction on a parabolic trajectory. So, as far as MechJeb is concerned, you already \u0022have\u0022 a periaps. The problem is that the Mun takes up space. It has a radius at its equator of two hundred thousand meters. That means a periaps of 200km \u003Cem\u003Efrom the gravitational center\u003C/em\u003E would be a [very high speed and likely crash] landing. In terms of orbital mechanics however, we consider that center-radius of 200km to be \u0022zero.\u0022 A negative periaps is therefore an impact. An \u0022orbit,\u0022 as far as we\u0027re concerned, of 25km is actually an orbit of 225km above the Munar center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mentioned the MechJeb Debate. Some people see it as cheaty, and would mock you and me for using it. Others find the game frustrating without it and \u0022need\u0022 it. I personally tend to fall into the middle: I use it to give me suggestions, but I modify my maneuver nodes the way I want them (using the PreciseNode plugin, I highly recommend it) and I consider myself capable of burning them myself. Now, since a smidge left or right will sometimes result in missing my intended capture angle, I am willing to let MJ perform the burn for me, as well, but I don\u0027t let it go off uncorked; I pay attention to it with my mouse cursor hovering over the \u0022Abort Execute\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb, or the autopilot on the Space Shuttle, is a wonderful tool when it is used to \u003Cem\u003Eaugment\u003C/em\u003E your flying skill as opposed to replacing it. Think of the game of pool on a billiard table. Show someone a birds-eye-view picture of a set of billiard balls in random arrangements like they do on television and any person can intuitively guess on some of the easier straight-line shots. But ask the average novice to hold the pool cue and actually execute them, that\u0027s a different story. You have to work on your aim and your cue-control, and this is the same with golf, or baseball, or hockey, rugby, or either of the two major forms of football. The same here: I can \u003Cem\u003Eplan\u003C/em\u003E my burns well enough, but sometimes, even with fine-controls enabled on my keyboard, and my admittedly huge-*** high resolution monitor, sometimes a single button push to the left or right will be three times what the burn actually needed, and I\u0027m thrown off elsewhere. So, I use MJ to perform those very sensitive burns that are often reported by the maneuver node to be less than 2s in length, or in situations where using PreciseNode tells me that even .01m/s in antiradial burn vectoring will change my capture periaps by more than 20km in altitude. Can you use your mouse or your keyboard to precisely burn .01m/s along a specific antiradial vector? Or change an existing burn plot by exactly .01m/s antiradial? I can\u0027t, and that\u0027s when I choose to use MJ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am gathering (and not mocking you for this) that you need MechJeb for more reasons than I do. The question you pose here leads me, and others I\u0027d wager, to believe that you don\u0027t quite grasp basic orbital mechanics. And that\u0027s fine -- even the people who designed the Apollo program in the 1960s didn\u0027t fully understand them at first, either (lots of history to be studied there, if you like learning cool things about what people did yesteryear, I highly recommend reading up on it.) We, as a community of Kerbal Space Program players, weren\u0027t born knowing orbital mechanics, and I\u0027m fairly certain that unless a KSP player among us actually happened to go to school for something where orbital mechanics was a thing, or happened to work for some point at JPL (such as the author of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.xkcd.com/1356/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.xkcd.com/1356/\u003C/a\u003E) chances are we didn\u0027t even know much about orbital mechanics before playing this game at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m not knocking you for your obvious reliance on MechJeb to tell you what\u0027s possible and how to do basic things. That\u0027s the great thing about this game -- it appeals to so many even without the mods, but with the mods that audience is increased by what I think is an entire order of magnitude. But I can say that your problem is rather easily solved when it happens, and PREVENTING it is even easier than solving it. I\u0027m not talking down to you, this is the actual answer to your question: the Munar \u0022orbit\u0022 pictured in your imgur above is preventable by tweaking your Kerbin transfer burn, likely by less than 1m/s in VERRRRY sensitive and finicky increments along what could end up being divided among all three axes (grade, normal, radial). Alternately, you can perform a correction burn, likely less than 1m/s at a midcourse node as well. Absent that, then you change your periaps to a desired level IMMEDIATELY after transitioning to the Mun SOI, and THEN you circularize at the new periaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry dude, but there exists no other answer to your question in any form at all. If this answer does not help, then you need assistance understanding the fundamental elements of the answer, but again, there exists no other available answer other than the ones you\u0027ve been given here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I do not apologize, because that would be a cop-out and my saying, essentially, \u0022You\u0027re on your own dude.\u0022 I\u0027d be happy to Skype with you and walk you through it, step by step, soup to nuts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T16:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots happened while I was typing and editing that post above.
