I\u0027ve got enough rovers out by the Neil Armstrong Memorial in my Sandbox game to open up a used car lot now, and about a half-dozen probes. All I did was add a permanent habitat and called it a base - and that was just 9 Mk1 Lander Cans on a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You bet.

Ofcourse, a fully docked base looks better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There are a few mods out there that add specialized base modules. Without those, you\u0027d need to improvise. I usually make a \u0027habitat\u0027 module by sticking 2 hitchhikers ontop of eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could put up a comunications module (for the fun of it. The entire base is obviously just for the fun of it), a rover. If you have the Kethane mod, you can turn it into a mining base. Than you\u0027ll need a miner, a power supply module, and a fuel tank module (those 3 would need to be connected). And ofcourse some way to transfer the new fuel to a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There\u0027s not much you\u0027d need to escape from on a Munarbase. I mean it\u0027s not going to deorbit and crash like a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you could put a simple rocket next to the base that can get back to Kerbin. Or multiple, one small one for each Kerbin. A Mk1 command pod only needs a single fuel tank and LV 909 engine to get back to Kerbin, so they are easy to build\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T11:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t build a base at mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr one day you\u0027ll find your base in a new crater...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T13:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@JiWint What?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T14:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@JiWint What?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ve re-done the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s terrain several times.

Just land them close to eachother, and dock them like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pritty tricky though, since the wheels have suspention so a heavier module will compress the suspention more than a lighter module. So they might not be all the same height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to try this, I\u0027d suggest practicing on Kerbin first. Do note though, that the gravity is stronger on Kerbin, so if you can do it on Kerbin, they might not be the same height on the Mun. But it\u0027s a good start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Compression is less of a problem on Minmus, due to the lower gravity. Should also be easier to land big modules there for the same reason. Might be a good idea for practice\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rex3921","CreatedById":69610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T18:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Sirrobert!
