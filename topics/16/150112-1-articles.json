Was just the container, the small heatshield, a parachute, and four separatrons (moved to be fairly flush with the offset tool).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn decoupling, all of this was staged at once. The separatrons fired, pulling the container away from the ship and deorbiting it at the same time (spacecraft had to be facing retrograde, of course). Since the thing was aerodynamically stable, it flipped itself heatshield first as soon as atmospheric drag increased. And the parachute was pre-set to deploy below a certain altitude once safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was surprised how much the separatrons actually managed to drop the periapsis - far more than I had intended. The lack of excess mass through uneccessary parts like probe cores and such probably helped a lot. Though if you want to drop it from a very high orbit... not sure how far it actually goes. I tested it only once, from low Kerbin orbit (somewhere between 70 and 80 km).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, if you want to brake out of a higher orbit, you have only one choice: more reaction mass. So either you go the fully autonomous stage route, which you have been doing, and just add more fuel; or if you do a dead stage, like I did, add more and more separatrons until there are enough of them for the job. Gotta be mindful of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E after burnout though - the thing must be able to flip itself heatshield forward without control, after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-15T22:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to wikipedia, the FSW-2\u00A0flew a 200km PE - 400km AP orbit.
