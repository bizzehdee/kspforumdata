I didn\u0027t use any unconventional linkage methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just attached an Fl-800 tank to an Fl-200 tank. When i go to the launchpad the 200 tank behaves as if it isn\u0027t attacthed and starts glitching around, ultimately causing the rocket to explode. This is making my next stage impossible to build because what happens is when the bottom, larger stage accelarates, it bumps into the 200 tank that is unstable and instead of pushing the entire rocket upwards as one entity, the bottom stage hits the top stage of the rocket as if it were colliding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also does the same thing when I use the rockomax brand adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must be missing something here, I\u0027ve made a few rockets and this is the second time it has happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aAYZsze.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aAYZsze.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits hard to show what it does with screenshots but i spammed f1 while flying and notice the highlighted area in the 2 screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EBLEUiD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EBLEUiD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esee how this one is on the opposite side? It moves between left and right really fast and causes the rocket to tilt and go off course and then explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m7eJcH8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m7eJcH8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T01:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Estructural linkages dont break unless they were experiencing more than a few G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso... i think lowering your thrust helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso...MORE STRUTS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Audiopulse","CreatedById":8838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T10:49:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.

When the top of the long tank moves, that motion is greatly amplified down at the little tank. Then the little tank kicks back into place, carrying some momentum, and swings the other way. This quickly becomes a vicious cycle until one of the two, or both, get ripped off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
