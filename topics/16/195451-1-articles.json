IMHO the easiest way to do that is to place them into orbits that are low enough that they stay below the inner edge of Ike\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.

They should be in opposite places in their orbits i.e. One flying over south pole while other toys over north pole.

Once found, I\u0027d use the link provided earlier to get a keostationary probe above the location along with perhaps a probe or two in Tundra/Kolniya orbits for higher altitude work later on. With just those satellite positioned where they are, you should have no issue doing what you need. Just remember to get a satellite in or near a stationary orbit above wherever you plan to land so you won\u0027t have an issue reaching Kerbin again when needed.
