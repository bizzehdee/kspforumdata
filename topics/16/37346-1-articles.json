To get captured is simply to bring the apoapsis of your orbit within the SoI. If you\u0027re just trying to get captured, lower is always better. You are of course right if you add the constraint that you want to get into a roughly circular orbit. However, if you\u0027re coming in very fast, you\u0027re probably best off coming in low, slowing down to get captured at periapsis, and then adjusting your inclination out at apoapsis before settling into your final orbit anyway.

I can often manage a sub-surface periapsis with less than 50 m/s delta-v spent fine tuning my transfer, and can always manage a sub-100km periapsis with that budget, once I have an actual intercept. Using conic mode 0 helps with the accuracy during this step, as you can focus on the target planet and see where your periapsis is in regards to the target planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you cross over into the SoI of the target planet, use normal/antinormal/radial/antiradial thrust to put your periapsis right where you want it. Do not try to raise or lower your periapsis by burning prograde/retrograde. Normal/antinormal will affect your inclination, radial/antiradial will affect your periapsis. The more accurately you have placed your periapsis in step 1, the less effort it will take in this step. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Burn at periapsis to put your apoapsis where you want it.

Now, instead of losing as much energy as it leaves the well as it gained while dropping into the well, it spends more time leaving the well, which means it spends more time affected by that gravity, which means it loses more energy than it gained.
