Even if I had to reset my PC yesterday for reasons, and have unfortunately lost my save file, I plan to start over and continue playing, perhaps being more efficient in how I play. One of my troubles before losing my save file was launch vehicles. I could get into orbit, fly past and orbit the moon with satellites and put a man into space, but I never understood the actual launch vehicles, I just used what worked, which meant typically three stages with four liquid side boosters, which for me wasn\u0027t terribly efficient or effective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many stages should I have ideally? What type of fuel should I have in those stages?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn my launch vehicles I had my first stage which had a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.2, then it separated and activated a second liquid fuel stage, and then a third hypergolic fuel stage. I found however that my second stage did more work than needed, it accelerated me too much and since it had no restart capability I was usually stuck with a higher than needed orbit, or on the wrong orbit in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-18T17:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few guidelines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n1.2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is a bit on the low side.

I don\u0027t know how you came to such an absurd conclusion!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a less blatantly trollish note: Gaarst\u0027s advice is mostly correct, although my intuition is that you\u0027ll want \u0026gt; 1.0 TWRs on anything short of an \u0022almost in orbit\u0022 upper stage. I did a systematic examination of landing/ascent from airless bodies a while back, and generally speaking, it doesn\u0027t cost you all that much to increase your thrust, since engines are so light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Cost efficiency may be a different matter, as fuel is definitely cheaper than engines, although if you add more fuel, your first stage gets bigger, which means bigger first-stage engines, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy typical strategy (from before I ran that examination) was to build a half-solid-half-kerolox first stage to get ~4 km/sec \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and 1.4-1.6 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then a restartable hydrolox upper (with a few linear \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters and some hydrazine for ullage) with 6 km/sec and 0.8 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. While intended to get me to Kerbin escape in 6.4x, it should fall right into the zone of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E launches. I\u0027m refining that a bit with my new career; if I decide to continue designing my boosters for Kerbin escape velocity, I\u0027ll probably do a similar 4/5.5 km/sec \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E split, with 1.4-1.6 and 1-1.2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, respectively. I may, though, start going for 2-3 stage designs, with the goal of 2 stages to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and an optional 3\u0027rd stage for Kerbin escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re wondering why Kerbin/Earth escape velocity is such a big thing: if you set a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E target around there, you can pretty trivially inject towards a GEO orbit, lunar injection, out to the other planets, etc. Real-world rockets tend to go for, at most, GEO, because there\u0027s not much money outside GEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222882349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481390742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022122674\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/10/2016 at 11:25 AM, Starman4308 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, added the ascent to the simulations in two ways.
