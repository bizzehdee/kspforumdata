You can deduce the angular distance from the radius of the planet / moon (i.e. Minmus is 60 km radius, that\u0027s 377 km circumference, so hopping 100 km away is an angular distance of 30.4 degrees). Calculating the departure velocity is a tad more complicated, and you\u0027ll have to take into consideration the altitude difference between start and finish. But then, you can just accelerate until your map plots the trajectory to the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T13:20:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jesrad\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk-fg","CreatedById":98390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T14:13:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips, latest blogpost on the link explains it perfectly, indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo without atmosphere, 45deg would only be optimal on a discworld or for a relatively short hops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould these angles change with the atmosphere, given the drag and Isp changes there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine they should, as such most-efficient-for-vacuum arcs seem to be very low-altitude, so should it be more efficient to go up and do horizontal burn outside of the thick atmosphere layer at some point?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk-fg","CreatedById":98390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T14:31:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mk-fg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mk-fg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould these angles change with the atmosphere, given the drag and Isp changes there?\u003Cp\u003EI imagine they should, as such most-efficient-for-vacuum arcs seem to be very low-altitude, so should it be more efficient to go up and do horizontal burn outside of the thick atmosphere layer at some point?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough I guess there might not be an easy answer, given vastly different ship engine configurations - i.e. with several powerful engines and 1 NERVA, guess it should definitely be easy to take-off and use ~800 Isp of the latter for longer trajectories...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T17:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t the most fuel efficient method on a planet with atmosphere involve wings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk-fg","CreatedById":98390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T19:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sojourner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sojourner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWouldn\u0027t the most fuel efficient method on a planet with atmosphere involve wings?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
