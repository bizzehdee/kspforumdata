Basically I am just wondering if it was removed or something in .14.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have about 15-20 flights in progress at the moment, and several additional ones that have left debris behind, but are they themselves landed and ended on Kerbin. I also have one that I started a while ago and that is now about 1.5 trillion meters away in a sun escape trajectory. I have a couple of Mun bases, and have performed a few rendezvous with artificial Kerbin satellites. In any case, I am saying all this because from what I understand of the nature of the persistent.sfs file, if the version is still using it, there must be one present for all of my flight to be saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I know I once saw it in the past, but not sure where it was, and now file searches don\u0027t reveal anything at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate help with this if anyone has constructive suggestions or ideas of mathematically absolute nature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy computer, if it is relevant, is a Lenovo ideacentre Windows 7 HP with an Intel i7 processor 3.4 Ghz, 8 GB ram, Radeon 6450HD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure this has nothing to do with my computer though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-18T00:33:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2012 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by willitstimothy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feragorn","CreatedById":7549,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-09T03:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP_win/saves/default\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should be the file track.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"willitstimothy","CreatedById":17395,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-09T05:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks much, but I don\u0027t even have a \u0027saves,\u0027 or any synonym of such folder... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...in my KSP_win folder that is...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and I have 0.14.4...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and I have multiple ships/debris in orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and they\u0027re all still there when I go back again.........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-18T00:31:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2012 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by willitstimothy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-09T06:46:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere\\\u0027s the main KSP directory saved on your computer?
