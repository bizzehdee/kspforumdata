I watched a video by Matt Lowne (linked below - thanks for the work Matt)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this video he designs a rocket that has as a first stage a single stack of 800 fuel tanks with a swivel at the end. Attached radially in a pair is another stack of 800 fuel tanks with reliant engines. Standard decouplers are used at the top, and fuel ducts are used to feed the center engine from the side tanks. Matt comments that when the side tanks are empty, the idea is to eject the two side stacks, and the center stack is still full of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI copied his design exactly, and was able to follow the video and get to Mun and back. Now, however, I want to do a rescue mission for a Kerbal around Minmus. I modified the design for a heavier payload (two seat capsule, external monopropellant, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, etc). I\u0027m expecting to need more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E out of the first stage, and thought that I could just double up on the side tanks/reliant engines. But then, while out on a walk (where my head tends to go to new and diffferent places ...) I thought about adding a pair of solid boosters instead. This lead me to the problem of who is going to run out of fuel first - the side liquid engines, or the side solid engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can also devise scenarios where it changes - a more vertical launch profile to maximize the initial AP, or a flatter profile to get circularization for \u0022free\u0022. In one case, I\u0027d run all liquid engines at max, and the two side engines are more likely to run out of fuel before the solids. In the other case, I would probably throttle down the liquid engines as much as possible, in which case the solids would run out of fuel first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this was a long lead in to my question, and what I would like to be able to do. In decreasing order of happiness:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Have both the liquids and solids set to decouple as I anticipate based on my expected launch profile. I can manually switch the decoupler staging during flight to get what I want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Be able to manually trigger the decouplers during flight by click in the stage stack during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Be able to tell the decouplers to trigger automatically when a given (pre selected) engine is out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have KSP 1.8 and both DLC. Is there a way to accomplish #2 or #3 (I haven\u0027t looked into the robotics, etc. that the DLC\u0027s provide)? If not, does anyone know if KSP 2 will allow this. If not that, does anyone else think this might be a useful feature request??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for listening\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrian\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/kMmiVegFTqU?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-24T19:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction groups for manually activating decouplers regardless of position in the staging stack.\u00A0 (Set in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E during construction or can now be set in-flight.\u00A0 Allows number keys plus a few others to activate just about anything that can be activated).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor automatics you\u0027d need a mod, probably an autopilot one such as MechJeb (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E) or KoS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS:\u00A0 Making a heavier vehicle doesn\u0027t mean you need more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E already includes calculation based on mass so as the vehicle gets heavier your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E) goes down.\u00A0 What you need is more fuel/better engines to bring your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E back up to whatever the mission requirements are.\u00A0 Eg; it always takes 3,400 m/s to launch to orbit (roughly) but it\u0027s easier to achieve that much with a lighter vehicle.\u00A0 As a separate issue note that you can \u0027tweak\u0027 (right-click and adjust in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) SRBs to produce less thrust over a longer period, which may help with stage timing when mixed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-24T19:07:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2019 07:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bcbarnes","CreatedById":78762,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T00:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPecan, Thanks for the info and explanations.
