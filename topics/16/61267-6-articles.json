Use liquid fuel boosters on upper stages that decouple from the main ship and you should have fuel lines form the boosters to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Don\u0027t do any long term things unless you don\u0027t want asteroids in your save.(you dont get them in old saves files,because of the ARM update)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Check staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Name your ship and save it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Check for ASAS,RCS(If you need it) and power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Use docking for big ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.

You WILL fail. Miserably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 2: The prime deities of the Kerbal universe are Nuclear Engines, Asparagus Staging, F5 and F9, and Maneuver Nodes. Use them. Always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 3: Do it without MechJeb first. It will help you in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 4: Remember to extend your Solar Panels before time warping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 5: Use RCS for precise orbital maneuvers, not just rendezvous. It\u0027s much easier and precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 6: When it comes to interplanetary, slow and steady/super-efficient wins the race. Ions may be like watching paint dry, but when that paint dries, it\u0027s beautiful. And science-filled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 7: Use. Phase. Angles. It will save you hundreds, thousands of deltas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 8: Go unmanned before risking your Kerbals. If you don\u0027t want to or can\u0027t do the math, replace the capsule with a probe, add more weight until you have the same weight as if you had the capsule, and go on your mission. Or use the glorious F9. Either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 9: Add moar SCIENCE! The more science equipment you have on your ship, the more science you\u0027ll get. Of course, your ship will weigh more, so make sure you can still complete your mission. No use bringing that last SC-9001 on your Duna mission if it makes you unable to get to Duna!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. 10: When in doubt, just get out and PUSH, dang it! Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 more satisfying than making it back to Kerbin with the power of ingenuity and a powerful jet pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere we go! The knowledge of an experienced ksp\u0027er passes to to the masses of bright, promising newcomers! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
