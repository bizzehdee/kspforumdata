In rocketry, everything that is not fuel is either dead weight or payload, and we call this the rocket\u0027s \u0022dry mass\u0022. By staging, you keep the same amount of fuel, but reduce the amount of dry mass; therefore, your fuel efficiency goes up a whole lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more often you stage, the more often you can get rid of unneeded dry mass, and thus, staging often is ostensibly better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever! Staging equipment is not free. For starters, you need a decoupler. A decoupler costs money and has a mass. This mass makes your rocket slightly less efficient during the entire flight time \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E that decoupler is staged away. And what\u0027s even worse: you need another engine. And engines cost a lot of money, and have a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there comes a point where adding yet more stages actually makes the rocket less efficient. First, you arrive at a point where the cost savings from being able to downsize the vehicle due to efficiency advantages from staging get gobbled up by the equipment costs for decouplers and extra engines. And if you push it even further, there comes a point where the extra mass from more and more decouplers and engines removes more efficiency than staging will give you back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is especially a problem when you only have very heavy engines available to you, like the LV-T45 in your rocket. Therefore, I have a hunch that your rocket has already crossed that \u0022too much staging, too little fuel in each stage\u0022 threshold. As you advance in the tech tree, you will soon unlock a nice, lightweight upper stage engine; but until then - and honestly, even then - I would recommend you simply use one upper stage with two fuel tanks instead of two stages with one fuel tank each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, knowing that, you\u0027re better equipped to make a new attempt at building yourself an orbit-capable rocket \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 But, if you want to practice flying your gravity turn some, I can recommend you a very simple practice rocket with which to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMk16 Parachute\u003Cbr\u003E\nCommand Pod\u003Cbr\u003E\nDecoupler\u003Cbr\u003E\nFL-T200 fuel tank \u003Cstrong\u003Ex8\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLV-T45 engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, as you may notice, only has a single engine on it.

While it can fly straight just fine if you keep your heading near prograde, large deviations may cause a loss of control.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- It is capable of reaching a stable orbit, but only just. If you fly it well, you will be able to get up to something like 80x80 km, and have just enough left over to deorbit again and perform reentry. If you don\u0027t fly it well, you will come up short.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- It rides its launch engine all the way to orbit. Because of all the mass you shed along the way, the acceleration provided by this engine will be extremely high as you approach the end of your flight. This makes it tricky to keep precise control of your trajectory and destination near the end, requiring you to carefully manage your throttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these things are intentional, since this is a training vehicle.

Obviously that is something only computers are precise enough to get right, and humans like us will always have to steer a little more. But it should illustrate the reason why your rocket may fail to gain altitude. Too large of a pitchover too early may mean that gravity pulls your nose down too early - and trying to fight that is difficult and dangerous (will definitely waste fuel, may even lead to losing control of the rocket).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many guidelines, like \u0022pitch over 5 degrees after reaching 50 m/s of speed\u0022 or the like, but the uncomfortable truth is that the exact moment, altitude, speed and pitch magnitude are all completely vessel-specific. Every rocket will perform a little differently. And often, the only way to figure out how to fly a proper gravity turn with a new rocket you just built is to... well, launch and see how it goes. Good players can guesstimate how agressive they need to be based on the rocket\u0027s thrust-weight-ratio, and can generally (but not always) avoid failing the first time. But that takes a lot of practice. It\u0027s a skill only experience will teach you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a newcomer, you\u0027ll more or less be flying the turn manually - you keep SAS on, keep an eye on your altitude, and steer the rocket to be roughly at the correct angle for each altitude by hand. For typical rockets, you want to be just above 45 degrees** as you cross 10-11 kilometers altitude. If you\u0027re steeper than that, you can compensate by flattening out more agressively afterwards (either by steering, or by throttling down). If you\u0027re flatter than that, you may have a problem unless your engine can push hard and let you fight the turn a bit. As a result, try erring on the side of being too steep rather than being too flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(** keep in mind that that\u0027s your pitch angle, not your heading. The heading is what\u0027s displayed at the bottom of the navball, and should always be as close to 90\u00B0 as possible for a typical launch. The pitch angle is the little numbers written on the blue/brown ball itself. 45 derees pitch is the halfway point, where there\u0027s a prominent white line.

When you start off, the top of your flight curve (Ap) is very very close to the nose of your rocket, and the time needed to reach it (i.e. fly horizontally, briefly) is very low, mere seconds. Time-to-Ap increases, and Ap moves further up and away, as you accelerate, so the trick is to keep that time-to-Ap rising until you get to about 30s at 10km, then 40s for most of your time in the upper atmosphere, and then it should shoot up on its own as you approach orbital velocity (ideally at around 60km).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you have KER, you have time-to-Ap nicely presented in the top left part of the HUD, so the later stages of your ascent should be easy to perfect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the launchpad, it is harder to get right.
