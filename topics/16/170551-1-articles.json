It\u0027s good! The hardest thing to me was the docking tutorial, even to catch up the other vessel \u0022Stranded\u0022. But watching A LOT YouTube videos about rendezvous and docking I finally did it! So I was thinking... \u0022I\u0027m a PRO now, let\u0027s try the scenario with a Space Station, undock the Space Shuttle and try to dock this again\u0022. How stupid I was, it looks impossible, I got really frustrated about it. Btw, I was watching some other videos on YouTube about Geostationary Relay Network for example and it looks even more complex to me. So my question is... is that normal as a new KSP player? Get a little bit frustrated about don\u0027t get to some \u0022mission\u0022? Do I need to study something or just play it and at some point all get the practice/experiencie and a more understandable overall to do even the more complex things in the game? Sorry about the long post, but I\u0027m really loving this game, even without understanding a bunch of things and I\u0027m anger to learn and create shuttles, rockets, space stations, rovers, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you guys and I\u0027m sorry about any english mistake, it\u0027s a work in progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-06T20:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does not have a learning curve, it has a learning wall.
