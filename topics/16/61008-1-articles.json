In Career mode, I just unlocked the rover tech. So I built one. It has the RoveMate frame, headlights, 4 wheels, solar panels, and an External Command Seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought the Seat would be enough for me to test it with a Kerbal on board, but it said I needed an actual command module. So I stuck a docking port on the end and attached a command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested it, and successfully EVAed a Kerbal and got him in the rover. I detached the docking port, extended my solar panels, and had a fun time driving around the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, it works, time to attach it to a rocket and take it to the MUN!! That should be the easy part, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, first of all, I didn\u0027t want to have to build the entire rover again, so I saved it as a Subassembly. The thought being that I could stick Little Rover onto any rocket I wanted. Maybe several of them. Whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that, apparently, is where things stopped going well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a rocket with a free docking port and loaded up my Little Rover subassembly, but try as I might, I couldn\u0027t get its docking port to function. It would not attach itself to the docking port on my rocket. The green dots on the top and bottom of the rover still work, but I don\u0027t want to use those. I want a rover that can detach, drive around, and reattach itself and ride home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can\u0027t be that unusual of a thing, right? I just want a lunar module with docking ports on either side, with a rover attached to each of them. This shouldn\u0027t be so hard, should it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried several workarounds, including building the rocket first and building the rovers directly against its docking ports, but it won\u0027t work. They won\u0027t snap onto the rear end of the RoveMate chassis unless I START building with the chassis, in which case I have to build the entire rocket starting from the rover. And while that might work, it\u0027s kind of a pain, and there would be no way to bring a second rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really feels like I should be able to save it as a subassembly, but I can\u0027t get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T05:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not good practice to save payloads as subassemblies, since they only have one attachment point which is the root node of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, save the rover as a craft and save things like rockets as subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, in the most basic configuration, you can put a decoupler on the top or bottom of the rover and attach the rocket to whichever side you like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Name Lips","CreatedById":101633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T05:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, but if I save it as a craft, how do I add it to my rocket?

Then my kerbals could get out of the lander and hop in their rovers and drive off. When they got back, they could re-dock the rovers, and then the entire lander with 2 rovers could fly back up and dock with the mother ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tabakhase","CreatedById":101288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T05:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43208-0-22-Oct17-SelectRoot-Set-a-new-root-part-0-22-fixes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESelectRoot Mod\u003C/a\u003E, that can fix these Issues =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou play Stock?
