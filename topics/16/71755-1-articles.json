For this, the lab and the science module (from top to bottom) are decoupled (to stay with the cruiser).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest then lands on Tylo. For ascent, the two lateral pylons are decoupled and stay on the surface. Then, the remaining vessel again docks to the science module, is transferred to the next moon (Val, Bob or Pol), decouples from the lab module, lands, lifts up again, docks to the lab again (which is with the cruiser), take data out of the stuff (thermo, Goo, the works), which are then cleared with the lab, transfer to next moon, rinse and repeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractical tests had these problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Tylo using MechJeb worked, but was off about 10 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent worked up until only about 0.5 m/s left on the maneuver node, which then shifts to an angle that does not help anymore but keeps burning anyway (MechJeb that is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStopping this by hand (orbit was achieved, although not an exactly circular one). Then, the rendezvous autopilot has the same problems. Burns the nodes up until about 0.6, the node marker then shifts to a kind of perpendicular position, MechJeb keeps burning, but in a direction that does not help any.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I can do all that by hand, but since this mission profile includes quite a few rendezvous and docking maneuvers, I\u0027d like to really use MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is my problem here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it MechJeb? I had some trouble at other bodies as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is it the design? The command capsule below the tank?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022obvious\u0022 problems I checked. I did change the controlling part to one of the big docking ports. The one on top as well as the one facing forward in between. And back again to the command capsule. Power is there. Torque is there. No clipping (I can see).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone has an idea? I kind of like my design and would hate to redo it. But if all else fails, I will.
