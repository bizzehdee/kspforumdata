They have too much TWR and go too fast.\n\nNote: This works best with a rocket that has some kind of tail-fin installed!\n\n0. Pre-flight Checklist: Enable SAS (T-Key). Enable Full Throttle (Z-Key).\n\n1. Launch vertically to 1000m or so. \n\n2. At 1000m, pitch your rocket over to 10 degrees off of vertical.\n\n3. Once stable at 10 degrees of vertical, **disable** SAS (T-Key).\n\n3a. Your tail fins will keep your rocket pointed in the right direction.\n\nNOTE: Adjust throttle as needed to avoid atmospheric stress. Throttle back if you see the following signs: Supersonic air streams (they are white) or super heated atmosphere (red).\n\n4. Let your rocket naturally pitch over to 45 degrees (do not use any WASD control input!). Your goal is to let your rocket hit 45 degrees at about 15km.\n\n4a. If you are too high, throttle back, let gravity do it\u0027s job and help your rocket turn.\n\n5. Once you reach 25km, Full Throttle, hold nothing back unless you see atmospheric stress.\n\n6.

The reason is the tendency for the air resistance to overwhelm your controls and cause your rocket to flip.
