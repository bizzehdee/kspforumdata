I have a big relay satellite in a tundra orbit around Duna. If Kerbin\u0027s not visible, the rover connects through the relay with a pretty good signal (and, I\u0027m using Kerbalism, is transmitting data back at about 200 b/s). When Kerbin comes into view, however, the rover chooses the more direct path and connects directly to a DSN station, with a much lower strength (and about 0.2 b/s throughput).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a method I can use to force the rover to use the relay satellite all the time? Or choose the stronger signal over the more direct one, I guess?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-20T04:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, nope.

If you\u0027re not familiar with it, it allows you to set different frequencies for your antennas to use. Two antennas can only talk to each other if they\u0027re using the same frequency (everything uses frequency 0 by default)\u00A0and relay satellites only relay between different frequencies if they have an antenna for each frequency. DSNs can talk to any frequency, but you can disable specific frequencies so that the DSN won\u0027t talk to antennas on those frequencies\u00A0directly, only through a relay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate a new frequency for the rover\u0027s use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet the rover\u0027s antenna to the frequency you created.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet the DSN to\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0talk to the rover\u0027s frequency.
