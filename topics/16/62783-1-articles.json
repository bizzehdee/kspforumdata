Ie does a full tank have the same terminal velocity of an empty tank. If the mass of the fuel is added to the tank before the drag is calculated, I guess it would be like that... but if the weight of fuel does not affect this (as it shouldn\u0027t... really), then fuel optimal ascents would generally be done at much higher velocities, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion #2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf drag is proportional to the part\u0027s mass, does it work the same way with lift?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw a youtube video on making SSTs (ram air intake spamming, bassically), they recommended using swept wings because the lift rating/mass was higher than delta wings... but when I look at the stats (given that I fly and my dad is an aeronautical engineer), I look at the L/D, and that would imply that delta wings are best (at least within the atmosphere, I suppose there is a point where lighter wings are preferable for maunevers in space, even if they are aerodynamically less efficient - and getting to orbit uses ore fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also heard that lift increases linearly with velocity, not ^2 ... does it work like this with drag as well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was changed to exponential... would this allow control surfaces to work at higher altitudes (assuming you\u0027re going faster), or are they modeled in some funky way -perhaps like reaction wheel torque?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T14:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnswer #1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the mass of the fuel is included.

Test by launching a rocket to, say, 2km, with three orange tanks and one mainsail. The mainsail will burn fuel from one tank. Decouple everything so you have the mainsail and the three tanks falling all separately. The half-empty tank will fall at the same speed as the rest. No, this does not make sense, but that\u0027s KSP physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag is calculated as 0.5 rho Cd A v^2 where rho is the air density, Cd is 0.008, A is the drag value times the mass (including fuel), and v is your surface speed. With mass in tonnes, you get drag in kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift is calculated as f(AoA) * lift * pressure * speed, which gives a value in kN. The function on the angle of attack is different between wings and control surfaces (if it moves when you hit wasd, it\u0027s a control surface); wings have the most lift near 25.7 degrees, whereas for control surfaces f(AoA) = sin(AoA), so the steeper the better. The direction of lift is perpendicular to the surface prograde vector, so if you\u0027re climbing, some of the lift is reducing your horizontal speed. That\u0027s called parasitic drag. Parasitic drag is linear in speed because it\u0027s just lift that\u0027s going the wrong way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T23:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnswer #1:\u003Cp\u003EYes, the mass of the fuel is included.
