I\u0027ve now been playing for Deadly Reentry for a bit and I\u0027m familiar with landing a small probe on Eve. However, the two goals seem counteractive, anything big enough to make the ascent, is going to going to take something like 100T of shielding to bring down, which is going to make the aerobrake less and less gentle, which is going to be a circular problem to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve contemplated an idea of building a massive shield out of several 3.5M shields, but it will take all day and I don\u0027t want to start unless I know it\u0027ll work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T02:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust an idea.

After the 1000 attempts to program the probe autopilot correctly I found the best decent profile is a VERY shallow one. Get your AP down to around 110km orbit, then bring your PE down to 60-70km orbit. This will be a VERY shallow re-entry profile, but you will slow down a GREAT deal before you get to the lower atmosphere where it gets really thick. As soon as you get below the fireball stage deploy a drogue chute to slow down for main chute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T16:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR makes the atmosphere less thick so it IMO makes the thing easier.
