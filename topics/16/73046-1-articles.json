While in descent toward your target (let this be a base in this example, not that it matters) and with your navball in surface mode, is it correct to assume that if you keep your retrograde marker positioned on the target marker you will land on/very near the target? Obviously paying attention to your descent rate as you want to arrive in one piece ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give this a go tonight - just checking up front.

Then as I swing around further I burn again to put my trajectory into the ground \u0022just past\u0022 the target. How far past is \u0022just past\u0022? Well, this is something best learned from experience, and which depends very heavily upon the thrust to weight ratio of your vessel. For a ship with very high thrust to weight, it\u0027s close to the target. For a ship with low thrust to weight, it\u0027s much further past the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point I coast in for as long as possible. The most efficient way to land is to fire your engines at 100% thrust at exactly the right time to ensure that you hit exactly 0m/s at exactly the same time as you reach the surface. Obviously nobody is actually going to be able to do this, but that\u0027s the goal you\u0027re shooting for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I am \u0022approaching\u0022 the target position I burn hard retrograde, which will decrease my horizontal velocity, pulling my intersection point with the ground back towards the target, as well as decreasing my vertical velocity. At this point it is always better to be too high than too low: if you\u0027re too high you can pitch your nose down towards the horizon and burn to kill off horizontal velocity, then coast along and drop vertically onto the target position (which is inefficient, but extremely accurate). If you\u0027re too low, you\u0027ll either overshoot (because you\u0027ll have to stay aloft longer than you want to in order to be able to kill off all of your horizontal velocity in time) or you\u0027ll crash into the terrain at a high horizontal speed (because you tried to kill off all your horizontal velocity but didn\u0027t have time to do so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI normally aim to come in vertically for about the last 100m or so of my descent.

Leave a little wiggle room: you will eventually land a little short of the spot you\u0027re aiming for, while the Mun (or whatever) keeps turning below you.
