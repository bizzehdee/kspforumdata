Again, would prefer not to touch the Starships, but the nearly useless station is fair game and if we need to, we can touch the starships. The one on the right is redundant now that the crew one has safely landed. Getting stuff down from up here would be challenging, but I was going to try to make flights up here with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E ship to refuel things. In order to take anything down, I would have to do those flights with the crew ship instead (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E drills) or modify the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E ship to carry crew.

There are other assets on Duna, but they are too far away to be practically reached by the rover, and I likely won\u0027t do suborbital hops with the Starships just to grab a part, as that means two high risk landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any ideas on how to flip the plane right side up with only the resources in the Duna system?
