The only remedy I have for this is to use several of them but it is still causing me problems. The other parachutes like the MK-16 and MK-25 are my prefered however when they fully deploy the jerk is ripping the command module off of the rest of the lander. If I try using a few radial parachutes attatched to the base of my lander they tend to want to tip my lander over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to build a ship that can go to Eve, land, take off, and return to Kerbin (or at least high orbit of kerbin). To do this I am attempting to minimize the fuel used in landing safely on Eve, this requires parachutes but as I said, when they fully deploy the jerk is ripping my command module off of the lander and basically stranding my kerbalnauts on Eve. Are there any tips that you can give to stop this from happening? I have a refueling satellite in orbit of eve already, my problem is getting safely down to the surface with enough fuel to return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other bit of landing nonsense I am having is with my ladders. Both of the Telus ladders are disappearing from my lander and I don\u0027t know what is happening to them. I need them to lower my kerbalnauts to the surface and allow them to get back into the cockpit, only other alternative is to lower the struts on the lander and hope it balances on its engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T13:07:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by annallia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T13:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry attaching struts to the parachutes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AnalogAddict","CreatedById":59758,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T13:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParachutes will indeed make a craft rip apart, I suggest letting the atmosphere slow you down more before deploying the \u0027chutes (put your PE @ 35k on Eve, or something similar), or use a drogue \u0027chute or two off the top of your craft to keep it heads up and steadily decelerating before deploying the normal \u0027chutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo address the ladders, they are retracted wherever you placed them in the VAB.

About all I can say is this: more chutes and more struts. If you have radial engines attached to the core, put chutes on BOTH. If you just put them on the engines, the sheering force of the center not stopping but the engines slowing may tear it apart. Ditto for the reverse configuration. However, if you can try to slow everything down at a comparable rate, sheer forces will be less and it has a better chance at staying together. And of course struts would just give it that much more structural integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as it tipping a bit, I think if you can get it so that it slows down to less than 5 m/s, which shouldn\u0027t be a problem on eve, I\u0027m not sure that will be all that much of an issue in the end unless it\u0027s just tilting wildly to one side, in which case you may want to re-arrange how your chutes are attached to see if you can add them in a way that causes it to lean less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, try to make sure you make \u0022weak points\u0022 (RCS tanks, SAS modules) in areas that minimizes the stress on those pieces.

Drogues will help. Other thing you might try is to fire up your descent engines (if you have any) to try and slow down a bit right before the chutes deploy (i.e. right before they fully open and jerk your craft). For Eve, I realize you don\u0027t want to fire them for too long; a second or two would probably be sufficient based on your design - Scott Manley does this in his Eve tutorial.

If you put parachutes on your pod, at the top of a heavy rocket, once the parachutes open the rest of the rocket still wants to continue down, thus ripping off from your pod. Solution: put the chutes on the heaviest part. Same if you mount more tanks or stuff radially off the center tank and put parachutes on those, the centertank will still want to continue downward with so much energy that it\u0027ll just rip everything to shreds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd your lander tipping over because of radial parachutes is because you\u0027ve put them below the center of mass, again simple physics.
