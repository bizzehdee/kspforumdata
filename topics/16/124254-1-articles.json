How is everyone doing? Hope everything\u0027s great!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am writing with this doubt I have regarding landing manoeuvres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sending several payloads to the Moon to start my Lunar refueling base and obviously I want to land them as close as I can to link them up and get it working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy precise problem arises when I need to adjust my orbit\u0027s inclination to the land target -\u0026gt; is there any instrument readings I can use to perform this in an accurate fashion? I am using MechJeb but I don\u0027t get the relative inclination to target measure when selecting a land object as my target (almost surely because it woulnd\u0027t make sense as any orbit could fly over a given land point and have different lunar-relative inclinations). I have (unefficiently) worked around this by plotting fake lunar-impact manoeuvre nodes to find out how closely-aligned I am with my land target, but I wish I had an instrument that could show me my relative inclination to any given land target by a simple reading while in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely I am missing something in MechJeb or probably there\u0027s an easy way to calculate it given the orbital information MechJeb does provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help you guys could provide will be greatly appreciated!!!!

The least steep you descent is, the further to the West you should aim. This is because the planet will rotate as you descend so you need to account for descent time and flatter descents take longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Put a manouver node at the point where your descent will intercept the planet. Adjust it so that it reduces all speed to zero. This will tell you time and direction that you should fire your engines to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fire at full power about 10% - 20% AFTER the point when the manoeuvre node tells you to start. If you do it right on the dot you will be too short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point your aim is to have your horizontal speed down to zero at the point when the target retrograde markers is exactly centred in the blue side of navigation ball. When this happens it means you\u0027re right on top of your target and can simply drop down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As you\u0027re doing final approach (some kilometers from target) you will notice the target retrograde marker moving roughly towards the centre of the navbal. What you want is to make sure it goes to its centre. The way to do this to make small adjustments by firing your engine to make sure that in the navball you always have 3 indicators in a line: your ship\u0027s retrograde indicator -\u0026gt; your target\u0027s retrograde indicator -\u0026gt; the centre of the blue side of the navball. The closest the target\u0027s retrograde indicator gets to the centre of the navball the closest your own retrograde indicator should be of it, ending with all of them at that centre point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to think of it as a game where your ship\u0027s retrograde indicator pushes the target\u0027s retrograde indicator away from it. The furthest your ship\u0027s indicator is from the centre the strongest it is pushing the other one way, and if it\u0027s at the centre then the push is zero. By firing your ships engines when it\u0027s pointing away from its own retrograde indicator you push that retrograde indicator away, with the aim being to keep that 3 indicator alignment i pointed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you\u0027re about 500 m away from target you eyeball it for final landing - this is the part where you mostly start ignoring the navbal since as you get very close to it the target\u0027s retrograde indicator will quickly drift away from centre. At this point I usually do small burns to send my ship towards the desired landing area and maintain a hoover as it slowly drifts sideways. Once you\u0027re on top of where you want to land, aim the ship to its own retrograde indicators and do a controlled burn following that indicator - by aiming at the retrograde indicator rather than straight down you will both kill horizontal and vertical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf everything went well, thumbs up, otherwise it\u0027s time to load that quick save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly suggest you train in Minmus first, before try the Mun - Minmus has less gravity so everything happens slower and you\u0027re less likely to quickly gain tens of m/s of descending speed as result of a few seconds of distraction, which is what happens when doing it in the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
