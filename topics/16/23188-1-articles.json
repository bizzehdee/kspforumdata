Yeah, i tried other stock planes and the avionics behaved quite well. On this thing though, it just takes control, meaning i cant steer the plane, it will just go the same direction as before, but i need to completely disable the package to do anything.

You actually don\u0027t need too many control surfaces to maneuver a plane, you just need to make sure that the CoL is very close (but just behind) the CoM. This should also help with the Avionics freak-out, since fewer control surfaces should help reduce the effect of SAS overcompensation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027d try flying the plane without SAS activated; if you can\u0027t fly it without SAS, you need to make it more stable. Use the trim function (ALT \u002B WASDQE) to balance the plane instead and try flying it manually, since it will be easier to land the plane manually than hoping that the autopilot works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warscribe","CreatedById":58388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T23:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E5 dead Kerbals later, i can say that didnt do much.
