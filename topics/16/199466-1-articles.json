No kidding, spent a couple hour messing up with control panel, photovoltaic, grand slam, and so on, and didn\u0027t\u00A0got nothing out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been searching online on forums, youtube, guides, and it looks so simple, all it takes seems to put them on the ground and they are working - for others - but not for me. Two hours later those devices are still there on the ground looking back at me and refusing to produce science. Two or three are displaying a menu, others are not displaying anything and I can\u0027t even take them back into inventory...I do not know guys, are those machines bugged?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1664610241437667926/C3EA5EC6CD14605764E0136DA07DFA222A5D7A72/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.33\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 style=\u0022width:600px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022C3EA5EC6CD14605764E0136DA07DFA222A5D7A72\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1664610241437667926/C3EA5EC6CD14605764E0136DA07DFA222A5D7A72/\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T23:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some tricks to it. Mostly in which kerbal deploys the devices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want a scientist to deploy the science experiments. They create science seven times faster or more, if a scientist deploys them -- depending on the number of stars the scientist has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you want an engineer to deploy the solar panels. The panels produce energy depending on the number of stars of the engineer that deploys them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there may be a bug. When you launch the craft, the experiments have to be in an inventory somewhere. If they are in a storage unit, that\u0027s good. If they are in a kerbal\u0027s inventory, they may never work. So don\u0027t put them directly into a kerbal\u0027s inventory. To know if they are non-functional, you need to walk right up to them and face them. If you can get a menu, then that\u0027s good -- all they need is power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, after all that, you get them to a destination and drop them on the ground just like in your picture. Each device needs power from a solar panel. You need a control station, which also needs power. You do not need to interact with them to get them started. They produce science slowly. Once they reach a 10% level, they try to transmit. If they don\u0027t have a communications link to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E at that moment, the transmission fails and they wait for the next 10%. Each 10% transmission can easily take 10 to 20 days, and it\u0027s not a lot of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf a kerbal picks up a science device, he takes the remaining science out of it. If he picks it up and puts it back down, then that counts as redeploying it -- and then you need to be paying attention to whether he\u0027s a scientist or engineer and how many stars he has again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, from your picture, I think the most obvious problem you are likely having is power. You have 4 devices, and only one solar panel. Did a 3-star engineer place that solar panel? Look at the menu from the control station. It shows how many units of power are coming in, and how many experiments are attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Metanolo","CreatedById":75909,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T23:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolar panel is generating 3 units, but apparently none attached. My best guess is the inventory bug you mentioned did\u00A0strike\u00A0for at least 2 devices (no\u00A0menu or pick up allowed, stuck there forever I guess), and the ramaining devices are not linking with the control panel...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the reply but I suppose I\u0027ll let them be.

So that one may be working. But to get science out of that one, you need to impact pieces of ships into the surface. The bigger they are, and closer to the experiment device, the more science you get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quazarz","CreatedById":208584,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-10T02:21:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere seems to be a bug with deploying the breaking ground deployables with EVA construction mode. Every time I have tried it, the unit becomes completely inert, can\u0027t interact and can\u0027t pick it back up. The proper way to deploy is to take it into the kerbal inventory and click the arrow in the bottom right corner of the items icon. An unfortunate side effect of 1.11 is that you can\u0027t hold your jet pack and a deployable at the same time so it\u0027s pretty tedious \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
