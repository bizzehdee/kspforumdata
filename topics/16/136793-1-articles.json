Orbit Speed of arroumd 2780m/s; Surface Speed of arround 2620 m/s. My path was counter clockwise arround Kerbin\u00A0My vessel was perfectly aero dynamic at that speed and didn\u0027t drained power during the descend however it took quite long to break and it used arround 120 Ablator of the Heatshield. Now I now I still have arround\u00A080 left so I could have went on longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo. Now finally to the question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I come in from an higher Appoapsis, like returning from Minmus or even from the orbit of \u003Cs\u003ESol\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Kerbol / Sun\u00A0if I chose a periapis of arround 30 000m I will burn up as I will be way too fast.
