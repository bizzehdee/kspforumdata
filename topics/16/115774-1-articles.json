Try putting the periapsis at something like 30 km.\n\nBy the way, that planet is called Kerbin ! \n\nTell us if you make it"},{"CreatedByName":"Weaverworld","CreatedById":147956,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T11:57:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi,\n\u003E I\u0027m new to the game and I\u0027ve decided to play the tutorial missions. \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m trying to finish the \u0022Get to the Mun, Part 2\u0022 mission but every time I get to Kerbal I crash because my parachute deploys too late.\n\u003E \n\u003E If I deploy it at over 270 m/s it tears off and I get a message saying: \u0022Parachute destroyed due to heat and aero forces\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E But if I wait for the speed to get below 270 m/s the chute doesn\u0027t fully open until it\u0027s too late and the capsule crashes.\n\u003E \n\u003E Please HELP!!!

If it\u0027s a Mk16 parachute, and it\u0027s appearing to fully open at 500m (you can right click on th part to check this number) then you will need to increase this above ~700-800m (make it a 1,000 to be safe) - the length of time needed for the mk16 to slow a capsule down changed recently - and new ships built with the Mk16 have a new open altitude of 1000 set - perhaps the ship in the tutorial is still set to 500m.\n\nWemb"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:14:37Z","Content":"M16 is notoriously terrible with a long time to open, I think some 400-500 meters nowadays, and a considerable time. A fall from a 150m parachute tower would crash the kerbal.\n\nThe radial-mounted chutes need some 150m at 250m/s and take a very short time to deploy, the tower experiment would have them open even before the dome part cleared the platform (\u0022exploding upwards\u0022).\n\nThe XL parachute takes some more time to open, about 250m at 250m/s, but still considerably less than the M16 crap.\n\nIf you can, research the radial chutes ASAP and forget M16.

They can deploy at about 450/ms and slow you down to a less suicidal, safe speed to deploy the mains. And it helps to land in the ocean because you always know when you come down because the ocean is at sea level. Air brakes are great too if you are coming in at a really steep angle and don\u0027t want to completely burn up."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:55:32Z","Content":"I\u0027ll deploy the small chute at 650m and it works out well ...
