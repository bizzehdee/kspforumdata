Instead what I did to do similar to what you want to do is as follows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Copy your save folder somewhere just in case\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. build a proxy lander ship that is same approximate height as your launch vehicle. Make it very simple. Just a tall structural stack to parachute down so it is same orientation and height as your launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Land it at the ksc launch pad. I would recommend getting it near with quicksave, then use vtol flight to position it. Doing this will get all the rotation and position information in your persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Place planned launch ship on the KSC launch pad and exit back to root menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Over-write your launch ship\u0027s co-ordinate data by copying proxy ships co-ordinate data then delete proxy ship from the persistence file or a quick save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Load up your save. If it works, copy the save file once more so you always have that positional data stored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the ship should be positioned exactly how the proxy ship was. I believe that the co-ordinates work by center of gravity so that might be where you need to base the vessel\u0027s height from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING! I have not done this with stabilizer towers. I assume they point straight down so it should work, but in your screenie, it looks like it goes sideways. Not sure if that is a mechanic of how the launch towers are programmed in, or if is simply because they rotate to your persistence edit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUndoubtedly, this is a timely and complex way to do it without software programs, but it saved me during a mission I was running, where one design oversight would have lost me a weeks worth of planning and flight. The issue was I had to add a part to a rocket to make it fully functional on my eve rescue ship. Unfortunately, I forgot that it was a ladder point as well. I got to eve, and couldn\u0027t exit the ship. I nearly raged. But what I did was I made a new ship save with that ship lander configuration and ladders fixed. I then copied position of the lander on eve onto the lander on KSC and deleted the current lander. Viola, I loaded the game back up, and new lander was in exact position and configuration, but with my kerbalnaut able to depart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boex","CreatedById":19600,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T20:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESurely if it\u0027s a problem with the planet-rocket orientation, you could just grab the whole rocket in the VAB and spam Shift\u002BA a few times to orient it correctly, via trial and error?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
