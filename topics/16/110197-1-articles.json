I\u0027ve really got back into KSP after ver 1.X (and watching some space stuff on Modern Marvels. \u0022That\u0027s a cool rocket...oh yeah, KSP!\u0022) Still very much a beginner. Managed to land on the Mun several times now without killing everyone aboard the lander, and twice I even managed to land so that the lander was still operational. (Though getting docked again with the return craft still alludes me. Eventually Jeb gave up and returned home without Bill. But Bill had the last laugh as Jeb didn\u0027t survive the landing. He\u0027s still laughing up there, fuel-less in Mun orbit)\n\nAnyway, back on topic:\n\nIt seems like the buildings at the Kerbal Space Center really don\u0027t like flaming debris falling on them. Which is problematic as I tend to generate such debris getting into the air, and the KSC always seems to start under my flight path. Is the answer to just add parachutes to everything and hope for the best? Will they deploy without being connected to any kind of control? And will that help with later stage recoveries that land much further out?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T05:36:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:23:15Z","Content":"The easiest option is to start your gravity turn early, even just a tiny smidgeon eastwards, before your first stage (SRBs or whatever) needs to drop. That will generally cause them to hit the ground just east of the pad, so no problem.\n\nIf you want to put chutes on them, you can do that and it\u0027ll work-- just make sure that you\u0027ve set up the staging so that the chutes on the ejected stage are in the *same* stage as the decoupler that ejected them. That way, a single tap of the space bar will both eject the stage and release the chutes."},{"CreatedByName":"paploo","CreatedById":43857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:24:31Z","Content":"Hey SignalCorps,\n\nI have had parachutes deploy if I put them on the same staging event as the decouplers\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACgranted it wasn\u0027t my intent to do that, but I didn\u0027t double check my staging events before launch and made an oops. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI am interested in the overall trajectory of your launches though\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACat what altitude are you expending your first stage to the point that you are releasing it? Especially in 1.0, you should be angling over a few degrees right after launch, and this has been enough to arc the spent first stage tanks away from the pad, regardless of whether I\u0027m launching a little local mission or a large interplanetary space station."},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T04:57:25Z","Content":"I can\u0027t offer any advice, I just blew up my runway."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:04:26Z","Content":"Also, tweak your chutes on the stuff you want to recover to open late. Like 100 meters off the ground. 50 could be pushing it. If they spend too long floating downward slowly, you may get 22km away before they land and if so, they\u0027ll be deleted by the game.\n\nI personally don\u0027t recover anything. Money\u0027s pretty easy to come by so long as you keep a full docket of contracts to complete, and get as many of them per mission as is practical."},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T12:07:42Z","Content":"Anything that doesn\u0027t have a pod or probe will count as debris and any debris in the atmosphere will despawn if you go too far away from it.

It doesn\u0027t matter if it has a pod or probe core. It\u0027s anything at all that goes out of range and below a certain height (approx 25km altitude on Kerbin). Even a manned pod will be deleted if it\u0027s not the active craft and out of range of the active craft."}]}
