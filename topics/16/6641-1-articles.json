If you find yourself in this situation, follow these correctional maneuvers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrectional Rule of Thumbs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo speed your craft up to meet up with the satellite, \u003Cstrong\u003ERetrograde\u003C/strong\u003E and lower periapsis just slightly. For every orbital period that passes, you will gain on the satellite. The more you lower periapsis, the more you gain on the satellite per orbital period. Once you have sufficiently caught up, bring periapsis back up to to make a circular orbit again at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo slow your craft down to meet up with the satellite, \u003Cstrong\u003EPrograde\u003C/strong\u003E and raise apoapsis just slightly. For every orbital period that passes, the satellite will gain on you. The more you raise apoapsis, the more the satellite gains on you per orbital period. Once you have sufficiently caught up, bring apoapsis back down to to make a circular orbit again at periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems illogical, but when you lower/raise an orbit, your velocity doesn\\\u0027t change much. What changes significantly is the distance you need to cross to complete an orbit. High orbit = more distance = longer orbital period. Low orbit = less distance = shorter orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis maneuver is best used when you cannot see the satellite\\\u0027s distance indicator in the flight screen. It\\\u0027s a good way to get the distance indicator into view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Skipping Maneuver\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis maneuver is best used when you can see the satellite\\\u0027s distance indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo slow down yourself in order for the satellite to catch up, retrograde a bit to lower your speed. Watch the satellite\\\u0027s distance indicator in order to help control the rate at which the satellite closes. As the satellite gets closer, prograde in increments to gently slow the rate the two crafts closes until their in a reasonable distance away from each other to perform docking maneuvers. Once achieved, you can fix your orbit, or attempt a dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant\u003C/strong\u003E: After you retrograded, your craft, by laws of physics, will start to lose altitude. In order to keep altitude under control, you want to thrust upwards, away from the celestial body your orbiting (do this by placing your indicator on the north pole of your navball and thrust). This type of burn will raise the front half of your orbit, and lower the back half of your orbit without changing your orbital velocity. Periodically thrust up in order to keep altitude (hence the term \u0027skip\u0027). I find it best to use the main engine to maintain altitude and RCS thrusters to slow the rate of closure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to speed yourself up to catch up with the satellite, prograde instead and periodically retrograde as you get closer. To keep altitude in check thrust straight down (south pole on navball). I think you get the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAligning A Tilted Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight after the pivot point (where your two craft\\\u0027s orbits meet), you want to thrust in the direction of the satellite\\\u0027s orbit. (on the navball, you should be thrusting in between the yellow markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this guide, you now have the ability to create space stations, meet up with other planets, and other things you could imagine. Enjoy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou really want both crafts apoapsis and periapsis to be extremely close to the same spot and extremely close to the same altitude. It makes things alot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarvestR is planning on implementing a feature in the game to help with rendezvous. Since it will be more precise and be a bit more versatile, it probably would outdo this guide.

It\\\u0027s quite a good tool to help with orbital matters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot to mention: Altitude and orbital radius aren\\\u0027t the same thing. To find orbital radius, take the altitude and add that with the planets radius. (I made that mistake a few times.

Basically, you need a bit of finesse when your that close. When distances are so big, its okay to go full burn and throttle at its highest, however, the smaller the distance is, the more gentle you need to be in the controls. At distances less than thousand, you basically need an extremely gentle touch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, assuming that your going the same speed with 500 meters between the two crafts, I\\\u0027d increase/decrease your speed by 10-15m/s (use the skip manuever, and make sure apopasis is only a 10-50 meter deviation). As it gets closer, you want to incrementally burn to slow down the speed at which they close. RCS is a great for this scenario thanks to its gentleness and versatility of direction at which to burn in any orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E500 meters, to me, is just at the cusp of the viable distance to do docking maneuvers. I strongly suggest you send a rocket out in orbit, decouple a target part, and play around with RCS, watching how each little push affects the relative position of the craft and target part and the speed the move away from each other. As you get more comfortable, push your craft farther and farther away and attempt to get back to it. This exercise should give you a better idea on how much finesse you need to gently close those 500 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know any way to lock the cameras, but the best view is a side view of your craft and satellite.

To find the altitude your craft should be, add 600,000m (kerbin\\\u0027s radius) with the target satellite\\\u0027s altitude. 600,000\u002B300,000=900,000. Then you multiply it by 1.59. You should get 1431000. What you have now is Orbital radius. You want altitude, so subtract Kerbin\\\u0027s radius from the number to get your altitude. 1431000-600000=831000m. So, to rendezvous with a satellite 300,000m high, you need to get your craft up at an altitude of 831000m first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll see if I can get a video up sometime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see, this made some light in my head, you are right, I didn\\\u0027t consider Kerbin\\\u0027s radius, no wonder I failed with both techniques.
