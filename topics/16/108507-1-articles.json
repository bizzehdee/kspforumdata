It is capped, so say there are already 14 contracts in total then probably you need to reject some available or finish some active in order to show the new ones. Otherwise new contracts won\u0027t be computed.\n\nIf you don\u0027t have any - then that\u0027s probably a bug."},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:36:20Z","Content":"I guess you\u0027re at the beginning of a career and haven\u0027t finished the \u0022reach space\u0022 contract (climb to 70km)?
