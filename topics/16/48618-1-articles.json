It\u0027s also why there *is* a terminal velocity; otherwise, gravity would be able just to accelerate you forever until you smack into the surface -- as it does on airless bodies. On an airless body, the ideal TWR is infinite: you\u0027re just doing a Hohmann transfer. Drag is why this whole question is complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerminal velocity refers to the speed that you\u0027d be falling in steady state due just to gravity and drag: at terminal velocity gravity pulls you down at roughly -10 m/s^2, and drag pushes you up the same amount. But it\u0027s not a hard limit like the speed of light: you can go faster if you have engines. At TWR 2 flying straight up, you can go at terminal velocity: you lose one TWR to gravity, and one TWR to drag, by definition. At TWR 10, you can go three times faster: you still lose one TWR fighting gravity, and the remaining nine fight drag, which grows quadratically in speed. That quadratic relationship is why you want to avoid flying too fast. The atmosphere thins out with altitude, so that terminal velocity roughly triples every 10km of altitude on Kerbin; by 30 km, terminal velocity is higher than orbit velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ae00505","CreatedById":154036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T18:09:38Z","Content":"\nI am trying to analyse your situation but I need more information like what else did you change or kept constant while changing the TWR.
