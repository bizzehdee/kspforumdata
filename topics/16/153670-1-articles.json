At the moment I\u0027ve got a lot of \u0027collect atmospheric report from position \u0027x\u0027 \u0027 contracts building up in my contract offers page. These contracts seem to offer some money but not much science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on my current abilities I can\u0027t fly a rocket accurately enough to achieve the mission parameters so a plane is necessary (I can orbit a Kerbal and return him to Kerbin, and have done a Mun flyby). Given that I\u0027d need to invest 45 science to get basic Aerospace plus 50K on upgrading the runway (I haven\u0027t yet got up enough speed to launch from the original dirt field) this seems a hefty investment for early game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is - will there be future contracts that will repay the science / cash investment or is flying something of a dead end in KSP career mode?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-18T13:54:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying absolutely repays itself in science and funds --\u00A0if you can afford the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etime.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as science goes, one flight to the north pole and the west coast allows you to hit more than a dozen Kerbin biomes that you can\u0027t get at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. With normal difficulty, that\u0027s 600 points of science right there. Additionally, the atmosphere analysis science device (with normal difficulty) delivers something like 300 more points of science for flying over various biomes at high and low altitudes. Even assuming very low tech science devices, you are still looking at several hundred science points from one trip.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as funds go, if you return your plane to the runway after you are done with your flight, you get a 100% refund on the plane.
