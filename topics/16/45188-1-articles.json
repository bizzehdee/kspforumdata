In fact, my wife requested FAR so she would not learn bad habits, as she put it. But hey, if you like monstrous planes with eight wings clipped into each other, fifteen air intakes per engine and three times the amount of engines it ought to need to even fly, then stock KSP planes are for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E If the aerodynamic center (or aerocenter - it\u0027s not the center of lift) is in front of the center of mass, the plane will straight up flip out and kill everyone involved. So that\u0027s not what\u0027s happening here, and is anyway counter-indicated by the fact that as you go supersonic, your aerocenter shifts backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Fuel drain can and will shift the CoM as well - but for me that only becomes a problem when going to rockets for the atmosphere transition burn. Usually, that happens well above where the atmosphere is a major factor, typically 35-40 km up. So probably not that. And as mentioned before, it looks very different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED) As your supersonic velocity increases, depending on the structure of your plane, your control authority may decrease selectively - particularly I always have trouble getting enough pitch-up. Bigger control surfaces farther from the center of mass and aerocenter are typically called for. Also, ensure that control surfaces are specialized - otherwise they may work against each other, giving you less, not more, control authority. My guess would be that that is the problem you are encountering. To test it, you can fly your aircraft at lower speed and see how high up you can maintain pitch-up, or you can try lengthening the fuselage, adding bigger canards, and making sure they\u0027re the only surface controlling pitch - that should see some effect too. B9 delivers some nice big stabilators that should serve you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHengeProphet","CreatedById":14895,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T06:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would personally say that 600 m/s is on the edge of too slow for an attempted SSTO flight. I am generally in the region of 1000 or more at that height, which by velocity alone should push you to a higher altitude. Once you are above 13-15km, you should be able to use rocket engines to sufficiently nudge your way out of the atmosphere. Keep in mind that you don\u0027t need to blast out of the atmosphere, as enough speed will allow you to drift out on relatively low fuel usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is generally the process I use for both my FAR and stock game files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T07:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow long is it taking you to reach 10k, what is your climb angle (how far above the horizon line is the velocity vector) and how far above your velocity vector is your nose while you are climbing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShifting fuel shouldn\u0027t be an issue unless you\u0027re taking an inordinately long time to get to 10k, you shouldn\u0027t have spent enough fuel getting there for things to have shifted much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E600 m/s is fine for 10k.
