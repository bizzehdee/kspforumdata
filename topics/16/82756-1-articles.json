(I completely forget the technical term for it. The vertical wing part usually placed in the back) I\u0027ve seen the typical design where you have one (with one rudder control) placed right in the middle of your plane and towards the back behind your main wings. But then I also see designs where you have two of them on the wing tips, either straight up or slanted outwards or inwards. Sometimes, I see two placed on either side of the plane\u0027s body, but still in the middle-back of the plane. Sometimes straight up, sometimes slanted. Sometimes I also see smaller wings placed at a slant, but without rudders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does placing tail wings like this affect? I know that slanting the wings themselves will affect the vertical location of your center of lift, but I haven\u0027t seen any obvious advantage to where you place them on your craft or whether or not having multiples really does anything for you aerodynamically. (Obviously having multiple rudders gives you stronger Yaw control)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T20:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you talking about in FAR/NeAR or stock aerodynamics?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T20:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVertical stabilizer/rudder is at the end of the plane usually to prevent flat spin or to help the plane to face forward - the surface is usually so small that it has negligible lift and cannot really be used for the plane to change direction, its main purpose is to stabilize. As such it is mostly irrelevant what exact geometry is used. Slanted/straight and one/two/more of them is mostly matter of personal taste and aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T23:23:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple rudders give you stronger yaw control and the farther away from CoM they are the better is their lever action which helps reduce their number eventually. And they are also used to fly a \u0022coordinated\u0022 curve. Basically you \u0022steer\u0022 with ailerons but thats only 1/3 of the truth since in a coordinated curve you also use pitch elevators and rudders to speed up the curve and to keep the ball of the turn indicator in the middle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Turn_coordinator_-_coordinated.svg/1020px-Turn_coordinator_-_coordinated.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u00221020px-Turn_coordinator_-_coordinated.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP the number of rudders at least for space planes, as in planes going into space, depends mostly on how many you need to keep the plane stable and not breaking out left or right when the engines get deprived of oxygen at high altitudes short before you need to switch to rockets.

As you roll, the nose wants to fall down because of the change in lift between the left and right wing. The rudder is to keep that nose up by offsetting the difference in lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal location is always at the back in the center but other factors may lead the designer to put the rudder into a different configuration.
