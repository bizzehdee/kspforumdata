Driving them around is great, but gets rather boring after a while. I was wondering if there is a mod or anything that will allow you to designate a target (to do science in a different biome), and have the rover auto navigate to the destination? Isn\u0027t that sort of how the Mars rovers work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T21:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Mechjeb can do this, i\u0027ve heard it can, but i don\u0027t know for sure as i couldn\u0027t figure mechjeb out, but i think its called something like automatic rover or something.
