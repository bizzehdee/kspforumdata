I have been watching some YouTube videos on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E flights. Some of the people show turning on fine controls in atmosphere for a more controlled flight without big/sudden changes. It is denoted by the pitch/roll/yaw indicators turning from and orange-ish color to a blue-ish one. Playing on an XBONE, I can\u0027t find any way to do this. Does anybody know if it is possible, and if it is, how is it done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) This is a bit more tricky. Just screwing around with some\u00A0 plane designs, I was trying to make a heavy lift \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with the MK3 command pod. Once I took it to the runway,\u00A0 the controls IMMEDIATELY went hard right on the yaw. The engines were off, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was off, I wasn\u0027t touching any stick surface. It just went full right yaw automatically. I tried numerous different designs and it was always the same thing with the MK3 components. Does anybody know why this happens, and/or how to account for this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T04:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I haven\u0027t tested precision mode recently.

Knowing that it wasn\u0027t a bug made me rethink what I was doing. After 4 or so hours of redesigning the craft from the ground up, I decided to add 2 more rear landing gear closer to the longitudinal mid-line and that ended up solving the problem entirely. I guess that the two landing gear assemblies placed farther out on the wings were allowing some torque across the body and introducing the yaw I was experiencing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not really married to any specific part combinations, and had used so many different combinations it seemed pointless to say exactly what I had used.
