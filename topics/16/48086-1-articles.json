Was playing around with hullcam, had 4 placed along my shiny new Vulcan Mk III Mun Rocket (still in testing) and decided to see what the LES jett looked like close up while still on the pad. Kinda went \u0022OK\u0022 and reverted flight to launch while still in the cam view. This proved disastrous and it acted like it was falling through the atmosphere at extreme velocity, cept no planet.... weird. So went back to the space center, cept one problem.... it doesnt load in. All I have is a black screen. I have the back button to the main menu, but that is it. Cannot click on any buildings, cannot get into the tracking station to end that flight, and my attempt to edit the persistent file failed, which resulted in no menu when I clicked on resume flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing I want to keep is my crew and Kethane.... everything is kinda expendable. Anyway to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshington","CreatedById":73509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T02:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing you always try: Restart the game\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T02:43:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDOH! yes, that fixed it.... oi. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16 \u002B/-yrs of dealing with computers and I derp over a simple fix...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T02:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve all done it.
