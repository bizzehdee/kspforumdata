This could be a problem, but the way I solve this problem is I don\u0027t do the final \u0022lineup\u0022 burn at the target, but some altitude above the target. This is slightly wasteful, but it mitigates this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have a couple advantages given your problem setting: your fuel shuttle, whatever it is, is presumably landing mostly empty, which means your turn and thrust capability is as good as it\u0027s ever going to be. If you can get to Minmus orbit if your tanker is \u003Cem\u003Efull\u003C/em\u003E (an obvious design requirement), you must have reasonably sizable Minmus TWR when \u003Cem\u003Eempty\u003C/em\u003E, right? At least this would be my expectation. (So for example, even though when full my VTOL rover has a meagre ~1 m/s acceleration, when almost empty it\u0027s about 8 m/s, which is pretty good for a Minmus landing even when I\u0027m being careless.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I solve the same problem, for my fleet of Minmus fuel shuttles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first obviously designed something really easy to land, and dock. So for example, my fuel shuffle is basically a giant VTOL rover, with well balanced downward pointing engines, and a probe core in the exact center pointing up, a port on one end, and a klaw on the other. It looks downright stupid doing transfer burns (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s48.photobucket.com/user/SZKP2021/media/KSP/FuelShuttleBurn_zpso2y2jjnl.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esee here\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E), but it\u0027s also very easy to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I start my descent 10 minutes before impact, that means that the point of impact is going to be slipping about 5.5 kms on me (if at equator), which is about five-ish degrees. I eyeball it, naturally erring towards overshooting by a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe navball makes very clear to you when you\u0027re about to be right over the target -- at this point to be clear I am still \u003Cem\u003Ehigh\u003C/em\u003E over the target (perhaps as much as 500 meters or so, hopefully a bit less), but once I get lined up vertically pretty much all I have to do is drop, which makes things much, much easier -- this is wasteful of a few dozen m/s deltaV or so, but then again, I\u0027m about to refuel with the \u0022free fuel\u0022 anyway, and my safety margins aren\u0027t that tight. Again, because the fuel shuttle is empty in your problem setting, killing horizontal velocity should require rather a relatively short burn, so you should have plenty of warning so you can \u0022time\u0022 it right. (Versus the lift back into orbit when full. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But there timing doesn\u0027t really matter at all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen of course the vertical landing is very easy. I usually land within about 100m or so. (I obviously try to \u0022miss\u0022 a bit so I don\u0027t destroy everything.)
