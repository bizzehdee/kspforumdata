The ET is somewhat smaller proportionately than the real Shuttle\u0027s because of the performance and flight profile differences between KSP and RL. Booster burn time is within a few seconds of the real thing (124s RL, 121.6s here). The Vector engines are thrust-limited; they provide about 25% of the liftoff thrust (vs. the Shuttle\u0027s 18%, consequence of the smaller ET).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/56mup2zahma373s/Shuttle%20Stack.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/56mup2zahma373s/Shuttle Stack.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction groups: 1 controls the body flap, 2 deploys the inner elevons, 3 deploys the split-tail airbrake, 7 deploys the ladder, 8 opens the cargo bay, and 0 deploys the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe careful flying it -- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E does not like off-center thrust and the off-center gimballing makes manual steering sort of squirrelly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey thanks.
