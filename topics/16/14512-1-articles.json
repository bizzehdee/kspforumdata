I\\\u0027ve successfully navigated the interstellar space between Kerbin and Kerbol with a space vessel that weighed more than 40 kerbal mass units, however the design was extremely simple (everything stacked end to end like a rocket), which helped fend-off the space kraken. An extremely simple design wasn\\\u0027t all that kept the beast away. I had a very powerful gimbal engine and 8 radiating gimball engines boosters that shoot outward, a surprisingly small, but decent amount of SAS power with ASAS of course., and RCS thrusters. I believe the time it was most vulnerable to the space kraken is when I had to burn the engines, once I got it in and out of rails to get it stationary it was fine.

Granted, I\\\u0027m no Unity expert but It makes a bit more sense. We all know that when we go faster then 9000m/s, our controls start to become unresponsive and phantom forces start acting on our ships. Its more pronounce on complicated ships with multiple parts then it is on simple ships with a few parts. Parts.....parts....... why is the number of parts on a ship related to the likely hood of phantom forces actingon your ship when going over 9000m/s. I then recalled an incident on a previous sun diving mission I conducted earlier. It was a very simple and light craft, designed with consideration that the space kraken still lurks in deep space. However, before I exited Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence, and traveling way below 9000m/s, I turned off my ASAS, which was on the entire time from take off, and my ship started to spin and tumble uncontrollably. Any input on my part would just add to the problem. Apparently the spinning was the result of colliding parts on my ship. I fixed the problem by repositioning the colliding parts and problem solved. Funny how that incident acted as if the space kraken was clawing at my little ship. Could colliding parts be the root of the mysterious phantom forces and unresponsive controls? Well, lets say that when Unity is calculating something going faster than 9000m/s, it starts to lose some precision. For example, lets say two parts are both supposed to be calculated at going a speed of 10000m/s. However, Unity goofs because it has trouble calculating things going that fast and calculates one part going 10000m/s and the other part at 10001m/s. The parts are now going in different speeds. If they were connected, but going at different speeds, wouldn\\\u0027t some collisions start occurring between them and cause the same tumbling and spinning as seen as my sundiving vehicle? I bet money that it will. It also explains why a simple ship with a few parts are spared more frequently from the clutches of the Kraken then a bigger ships with more parts. It comes down to the fact, that more parts, means more errors and different velocities between the parts which results in more collision which equals more force. Little ships don\\\u0027t have that accumulative effect because there so simple and SAS is way overpowered on something that small then for a bigger ship. Also controls act funny because when you try to change the orientation of a ship, it only adds to more of the forces acting on the ship which means more collisions, etc, etc, you get my point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOASIS is very simple in design, and where parts collide, so it doesn\\\u0027t get the full wrath of the kraken. It does need assistance from RCS, ASAS, and gimballed engines, but thanks to simple design, it survives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for long post, here\\\u0027s an emoticon ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thorfinn","CreatedById":8349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T06:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022duckunlimited2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022duckunlimited2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, lets say that when Unity is calculating something going faster than 9000m/s, it starts to lose some precision.
