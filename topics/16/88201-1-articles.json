It is important to have an ergonomic chair that supports the lower back and evokes good posture to avoid developing or compounding back problems. Now a days, many will be sitting all day long \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 either in office environments or operating machines. Even though sitting requires less physical effort than standing or walking, it still puts a lot of stress on the lumbar area. Joint effects of a sedentary lifestyle and a job that requires sitting can lead to many health problems. So, selection of a suitable chair is a critical step in preventing health problems for people working in a sitting position.
