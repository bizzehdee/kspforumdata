So I made a quick video tutorial on rocket dynamics and stability, located \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/O_usTekNJ0M\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to post it to this forum to have a place to record feedback - if you have any suggestion, questions, or comments, please feel free to let me know and I\u0027ll try to respond as quickly as possible. I will also soon be doing a brief tutorial on more advanced rocket/aircraft dynamics and control theory (in a nutshell, how to make the most out of your SAS/ASAS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mewp","CreatedById":40351,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T02:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, I have done a quick tutorial on aircraft stability as well - here a look\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUTr3sFvB9I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be doing a few more videos on some more complex flight concepts - let me know if these are useful.
