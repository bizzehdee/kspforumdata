For example, everyone knows that the US Space Shuttle utilized two solid rocket boosters mounted to either side of the external fuel tank. Without these, the main engines on the shuttle would only provide a third as much thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also see in Kerbal that the solids available \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E provide more thrust than a liquid engine with the same mass of engine itself and fuel. The main downside to solids is that once ignited, they can\u0027t be shut off until the fuel is depleted. As the great Eugene Kranz once said, \u0022There was no way to shut \u0027em down, no way to throttle \u0027em, so if you had a problem with those, you rode it out until you could separate from the solids.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T16:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs above, they do provide slightly better TWR than liquid rockets \u002B fuel tanks, but in the current state of the game it really doesn\u0027t make much difference and it\u0027s nice to have full control over throttle.
