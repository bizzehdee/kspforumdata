While you can derive the launch angle and DeltaV required from them (or use Olex\u0027s calculator to get the optimum) if you want a simple \u0027light engines when countdown reaches zero\u0027 function then they\u0027re not terribly useful to you and I would look at the protractor mod instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-11T22:12:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2012 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by EndlessWaves\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apothecarian","CreatedById":47761,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T04:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for this advice.
