Landed on Duna, Eve, Mun, Minmus, built a handful of stations and ships/landers. My problem is, my main interplanetary ship can make it to Duna, but does not have enough fuel to come back. I get it back into orbit ok but then need to send another ship to dock and and save the Kerbals, thief the leftover fuel and burn back to Kerbin. I\u0027m looking for some Craft files of your interplanetary designs so I can learn from them.

I could do better with a controlled landing with a sky crane like I do on the Mun but I tend to crash it on Duna and find reloading saves a bit of a cheat.

Then you need almost no fuel to land on Duna if you target the low lying areas to land in so you have enough time to slow down. I fit 4 x drogue chutes on a stage to trigger early (10-12K), and depending in the mass of the ship, 4-8 normal chutes deployed once you\u0027re travelling slow enough. The rogues fully deploy at about 3K up, the standards at 500 m from the ground. You may need engines to decelerate to deploy (or may not) and will probably need them to slow the last 100-150 m to the ground. Use the internal camera \u00A9 to watch the radar altimeter to get a good feel for the ground height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can usually get back and soft land (re packing the chutes is a must !) with either my heavy one piece lander or the light lander plus docking stage.

It may not matter that you launch a 1000 ton monster to get to the Mun and back, but when you want to do more delta-v intensive missions, figuring out how to get all of the delta-v you can out of your ship becomes a priority, especially once the part count gets high and you can hear your computer\u0027s sad little cries for help.

You should go to the fourth stage before landing though, or you\u0027ll wind up lithobraking. The fourth stage (just a command module with control stuff, parachutes and legs, an FL-T400 fuel tank, and an LV-909 engine) has enough power and delta-v to get you into Duna orbit and back to Kerbin with ~800 m/s to spare, if used wisely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iEvermore","CreatedById":57098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T18:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot for the input guys.

Since the ISP is dependent on the atmospheric pressure, and Duna barely has any atmosphere even at \u0022sea level,\u0022 the atomic engines will still be more efficient.

Landing on Duna with a local TWR of about 2 is possible, but... unnerving.
