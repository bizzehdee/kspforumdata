Still making better and better dV SSTOs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, one issue ive come up with recently, is dealing with eliptical orbits especially if you happen to be an elliptical orbit yourself, that is in a completely inconvenient direction (such as your long axis being 90ish degrees off). How do i EFFICIENTLY get onto an intercept and get to said place. Is it best to just mess with it and get the 1st encounter you can, or is it instead better to get into a close orbit somehow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue ive started actually working with is asteroids. They only give me one shot to rendezvous, and i seem to be eating well over 1000 dV minimum for even a lucky good intercept, sometimes im unable to get a good intercept and end up using 3K dV to get to the asteroid by inefficent path matching. Are there any tips you pros can give me on how to 1st of all approach an asteroid, and then how to get to this asteroid, intercept it, and do something with it without needing absurd levels of dV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo well, i hope someone here has some tips, and preferably specifics on what to do in what situation. Im not gonna say im a pro or anything, but i do know how to intercept stuff, and i have managed to do all of the things im asking for help with, my main dilema is just that whatever i do i end up eating so much dV that i prolly could get to jool and back twice with the amount of fuel im wasting on just 1 lowly asteroid. Same with things like fixing eliptical orbits and rendezvousing with something else thats in a eliptical orbit that happens to be well off of me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-08T23:20:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2015 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T04:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding asteroids, I favour intercepting them in solar orbit.

From there, get your orbit to touch the target orbit at its periapsis. From there it\u0027s all about arriving at that point at the same time as the target.

You can fiddle around to make that take less dV, and the best way to do THAT is to use Mun to alter your orbit in any major way.

It\u0027s most efficient to get plane changes done when your orbital velocity is the lowest. As you may know, your orbital velocity is lowest at the apoapsis of a highly eccentric (elliptical) orbit. It\u0027s also pretty low at high orbits (high altitude, very big circle or ellipse).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly how you get to Gilly will depend on its orientation when you arrive, so there\u0027s no 1 prescriptive method for getting there cheaply. There are some basic principles that can help you, though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, fine tune your approach while in your transfer orbit from Kerbin to Eve. There are several good places to do this: Right after you leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI; at an ascending or descending node (burn normal/antinormal to match planes with Eve); and 90 degrees from your encounter (burn radial in/out to get your periapsis close to Eve, and fine tune your inclination by burning normal/antinormal). Try to get your periapsis close to Eve (target 100km - 200km) and make sure your hyperbolic orbit goes COUNTER-CLOCKWISE around Eve (West to East)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, do a final fine-tune right when you enter Eve\u0027s SOI as there will have been some floating point errors at the SOI change that throw your approach off. The goal will be to get your periapsis close to Eve in order to minimize the delta-v you expend in orbital insertion (you\u0027re using the Oberth effect). Some people like to aerobrake at this stage as well, but I usually put my periapsis about 30km above the edge of the atmosphere (in Eve\u0027s case, the atmosphere abruptly ends at 90km, so I target 120km). Also, are you going counter-clockwise?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, perform your orbital insertion burn (burn retrograde at periapsis) and stop with a highly eccentric orbit. I like to have my apoapsis altitude to be much higher than Gilly\u0027s highest altitude. Now target Gilly and check where your nodes are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario A: If you\u0027re lucky, you\u0027ll have a node close to the apoapsis of your highly eccentric orbit. If that\u0027s the case, you want to perform your plane change at the node closest to the apoapsis. Your next move is to burn prograde at apoapsis until your periapsis is at or above Gilly\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario B: If you\u0027re unlucky, your nodes are going to both be near your periapsis. When that happens to me, I wait until I\u0027m at my apoapsis and burn prograde until I have a very high altitude, almost circular orbit. That gets those nodes out to a high altitude where your orbital velocity is low. Perform your plane change at whichever node is closer to your apoapsis for maximum efficiency, but if your orbit is pretty circular at this point it won\u0027t matter a whole lot which one you chose anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you had scenario A or B, your last step is to play around with maneuver nodes until you get an intercept. But the hard part is over. At this point, your delta-v expenditure is going to be pretty minimal no matter what strategy you choose. The big parts are your Eve orbital insertion and the plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T00:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESide note: if you can combine two burns, so much the better, like the final plane-change for Gilly and placing your periapsis near where it needs to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
