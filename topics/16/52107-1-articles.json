First, at launch, make sure to attach an antenna. This will transmit science back to Kerbin using electricity. Watch out, since power is hard to get by early on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet your rocket to orbit, and along the way in atmosphere, every now and then right click your capsule, select \u0022crew report\u0022 and hit transmit. Dont take any more reports when youre about to shut off your engines since it takes alot of power to transmit. Once you get apoapsis to around 75, cut the engine and coast till you hit 60km. There, EVA your kerbal and take an EVA report, but this tkme, keep it rathrr than transmit it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres a big difference between eva and crew reports. You can store as many eva reports as you want in your capsule as long as theyre from a different place, but you only gain 50% science when you transmit them. Crew reports get you 100% science, but you can only hold one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet back in your capsule, and finish your orbit. During this orbit finishing burn, take another crew report and transmit it while youre still gaining power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there on take a single crew report, but keep it. Then eva your kerbal and make a full orbit, taking reports above grasslands, highlands, the sea, mountains and stuff. Keep all the eva reports in your capsule. These places are \u0022biomes\u0022, and each grants you new science when you take an EVA report. After youve reported all biomes, burn retro, land your rocket and recover it. Thisll get you alot of science :-). Note that each scource of science has only limited science to find, but each biome depletes seperately and EVA and crew reports also deplete seperately. After a while, youll have to go to the mun for more science, and farther out from there. But Kerbin can net you most of the basic supplies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, after a while, you can also research science modules. These are additional, seperately depleting pools of science for you to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LtHeckard","CreatedById":83627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T17:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you right click your capsule, you can select the crew report button, and you can transmit it or you can take it back to Kerbin, but you can lose some scientific value if you transmit the data.

Hope it\u0027s up again soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for reaching biomes: Without being able to build planes, your next option is to come down from an orbital or suborbital path onto the target location. The best biome to practice targeted landing is the desert across the ocean west of the space center. It\u0027s a big target and it\u0027s along the equator, so getting into a low orbit by launching east will take you over the biome without any extra maneuvers (go east to go west!). Use a maneuver node to plan a burn that will bring you down somewhere in the middle of the desert, typically placing the maneuver 45ish orbital degrees before approach. You\u0027ll quickly learn that you\u0027ll come up short of your target line quite a bit; this is because the map trajectories do not factor in the atmosphere slowing you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor surviving the fall on LAND and not water there\u0027s a few tricks you can use with the starting parts to get you down safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The rectangular strut available from the beginning can be used as crude landing gear if they extend past the parts you want to protect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can attach extra parachutes to the ends of the struts or radially attached fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can save a little fuel and burn straight up just before landing to slow down a bit more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-An upside-down stack decoupler will drop what it\u0027s connected to but remain attached to the pod above, making it a handy radial attach point for exact 90 degree placement of other parts (the Mk1 pod is slanted, so can be annoying to attach things to)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
