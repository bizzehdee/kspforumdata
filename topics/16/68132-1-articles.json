I had a ship explode, kraken style, even though it was a new ship to my save. Ive had asteroids disappear while I was closing in within 1km. I had an old (pre arm update) ship blow itself apart at launch and then at a second try at launch the engine stopped for no reason and I couldnt do any control at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy game is totally unmodded and the lost control ship had plenty of power and resoyrces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany thoughts?

Do you use a lot of mods? I was experiencing random crashes because I had installed too many memory intensive mods, it was quite frustrating so I disabled one or two of the big ones and ksp runs smooth without problems. You should probably try disabling all of your mods and trying the game without, then start adding them and see how it plays. Good luck figuring it out, hope it gets sorted soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Project Pluto","CreatedById":94830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T17:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve experienced some bugs.
