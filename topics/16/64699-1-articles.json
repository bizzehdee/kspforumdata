The altimetry map (available in both low-res and high-res) gives you elevation levels and slopes; the biome map shows you what biomes are there. However, the biome map scanner conveniently also happens to point out anomalies, marking them with an X. This helps you land a vessel at the exact location (make sure the vessel is equipped with a MapTraq unit so it can access the satellite map).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the addon also includes one last short-range scanner which, when brought within a kilometer or two of a previously detected anomaly, will change the map marker to reveal what it is and that you have visited it. A great way to keep track of what you have not yet seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANsat probes keep mapmaking even when not the active vessel (so long as you don\u0027t mount other mod scanners on it that don\u0027t have that ability), so it\u0027s recommended to send them everywhere ahead of your manned flights. By the time the Kerbals arrive, they will have a nice map waiting for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biker Joe","CreatedById":82495,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T15:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone been no Monolith01 before?
