To dock, you must match speed and direction (velocity) with the target so that you make contact gently and don\u0027t just collide. But if you match velocity with something in orbit, you are also in orbit and therefore no longer sub-orbital. That being said, we often do fly our KSP ships directly from launch to a rendezvous, which is basically doing what you\u0027re asking about. So yes, it can be done, but only if you don\u0027t use those terms for it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T08:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eto dock, you have to have about the same velocity (aka, about the same DIRECTION and SPEED)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou have the knowledge to answer that yourself now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DannySwish","CreatedById":57623,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T09:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you CAN dock with something sub-orbital, it\u0027s just that you\u0027d have to make the space station also sub-orbital. I had to do something similar once around Moho to rescue Jeb. His lander didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back into orbit and was falling back towards the planet, but I managed to dive in with a rescue craft, dock, and re-establish orbit before crashing. It was the first successful docking I ever did, actually. (#pro)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
