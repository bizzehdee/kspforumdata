So far I can orbit Kerbin, the Mun, and had a near encounter with one of the planets. I even almost landed on one...almost. There are many great Kerbalnaughts who have given their all for my space program...and a few that will, when their capsules run out of air. I have even managed to get a few of my Kerbalnaughts back to Kerbin. (Do you realize how many things you have to do wrong to escape the Sun\u0027s gravitational pull?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question: I\u0027m having issues attaching SRBs and having them function correctly. I would like to attach a Solid Rocker (fuel) Booster to my first stage, have them ignite with my first stage, but be able to separate them when the are expended. So far, I\u0027ve had no luck doing this. I have figured out how to move stuff around on the stage gage while building. I can even use the snap-to and symmetry buttons....I just can\u0027t seem to do well with SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any insight you are able to provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I\u0027ve done numerous forum searches and didn\u0027t have much luck finding the information I need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crater","CreatedById":48907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T06:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite simple, once you work out how to think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a simple ship with a capsule, a fuel tank, and an engine, all in stage zero. Now add a pair of radial separators. That will become stage one. next add your SRBs, they will add as stage two. Then, finally, move the engine from stage zero down to stage two. This will make it activate with the SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may help to think of the staging as the activation sequence for the parts, rather than the separation sequence\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T06:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo do this, you can put the SRBs in the first stage, where your other engines ignite too.

That way, you\u0027ll start the SRB\u0027s and engines simulsaneously, and next time you hit space (hopefully after the SRB\u0027s have burned out), the SRB\u0027s will fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maxthrust","CreatedById":54178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T22:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the responses.
