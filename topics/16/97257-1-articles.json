If you try the stock thing of going up to 10k then turning 45 degrees, you\u0027ll send your rocket end-over-end, or it\u0027ll just plain fall apart if you have disintegration enabled. While you can of course manually nudge it eastwards during a vertical launch, that\u0027s got a real habit of inducing roll-wobble. I find that letting the launch clamps hold things on a small incline means I can just put the SAS on prograde, tune the TWR to ~2-2.5, and it\u0027ll give me a lovely smooth ascent without any of the twitchyness on the longitudinal axis. Usually gets me to ~20km pointing between 45 and 30 degrees, which generally gets into LKO with the advertised 3200 delta-v, or very close to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cicada models above both took about 3600-3800, which I\u0027m attributing to the higher drag of the wide frames.
