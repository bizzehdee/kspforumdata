Nukes overheat when attached to the KW tanks but pause their overheating when attached to the double, single or half rockomax tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, why is there a difference in the overheating between the difference type of tanks? I\u0027m wondering about it from the coding perspective. Like, if I go into the config file, what variable changes it? The max temperature is 2900 K/C for all the tanks, so that\u0027s not the one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why I\u0027m asking about this is that I\u0027m making a massive nuke-powered space tug and any of the custom 2.5m NERVAs explode (ie the KSPX ones) when placed under KW tanks. I place the nukes under a pair of double rockmax and away from the 3.75m KW tank and it works fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather use the KW tanks because the large 3.75m tank is \u003Cem\u003Eso useful\u003C/em\u003E and the tug looks so much better when I stick to one design style. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I dunno if this is the correct forum lol)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T00:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is only a guess but I think it has to do with the orange insulation on the Jumbo 64.
