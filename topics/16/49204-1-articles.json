For one thing, unless I\u0027m reading the specs wrong, the antennas get progressively worse in terms of electricity usage as well. They all have the same packet size, but the intermediate antenna uses 15 electric charge per packet, and the advanced one uses 20 (the basic is 10). This means the basic is the most efficient...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you can enqueue as many experiments to transmit as you want, and the antenna will work its way through them. This essentially means that you can do something like spam an experiment while passing through Duna\u0027s upper atmosphere, choosing to transmit every time, and then once you\u0027ve landed, sit on the ground with solar panels out and warp until transmissions complete, thus getting nearly all of the available science for that experiment in Duna\u0027s upper atmostphere with a single brief flight through it and a single experiment part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the time it takes to transmit seems to be unaffected by warp.

The farther down the tech tree you go you unlock WORSE antennas? That doesn\u0027t make any sense.

Only thing you really have to worry about is power usage and transmitting time, seeing as noted the packet sizes are the same. The later antennas eat more power but transmit faster, in some cases that is preferrable. Also mass is a factor, if you\u0027re happy queueing reports and transmitting them one at a time you can simply use one antenna. Efficiency per transmission doesn\u0027t change but the efficiency over time does increase with the later antennas, meaning you can transmit the same amount of data but faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found that having several antennas with faster transmission speed can be very useful when you need to transmit from several experiments and preferrably fast, like barreling through the atmosphere.

I may have overdone the spamming (as in definitely, by the time it got towards the end, all the experiments were returning 0 science), but when you see 1200 points for a single experiment, you don\u0027t want to miss a single chance at getting more of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I do it is to put all my experiments on an action button. Hit the button, click transmit on each popup. Wait a few seconds after clicking the last one for all the animations to complete, then hit the action button again (the delay avoids a popup that you may be running into that does cancel the previous experiment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve found that having several antennas with faster transmission speed can be very useful when you need to transmit from several experiments and preferrably fast, like barreling through the atmosphere.

From the time it started queueing things for the first antenna, it never queued anything for the second antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, a little experiment, and now I understand better. The system that assigns an experiment transmission to an antenna doesn\u0027t load balance very well. It seems that if all the antennas are in use, it assigns the transmission to the first antenna it finds, even if that one antenna has a lot of items queued and the other antennas only have a single item to transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as long as you\u0027re generating a constant stream of experiments, it seems that you\u0027re better off with multiple 16s instead of the dish antennas.
