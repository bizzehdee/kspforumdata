The only thing I wanted to save was the payload of the rocket, so I deleted a sizeable chunk from the bottom of the .craft file, then saved it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, when i load the ship in-game, im forced to pick a new cockpit, just as if i was starting a new craft. Then, when i go to pick up the remnants of the old craft, as soon as I pick them up they turn red, and there\u0027s no attachment nodes, so they\u0027re useless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, no matter how much I \u0022Trim\u0022 off the .craft file, it corrupts the rest of the ship. What gives?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T20:31:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETaking parts out of a save file is very very tricky, and if you remove the root part, you won\u0027t be able to reattach the rest of the craft because when it was last saved, it has no available nodes. It\u0027s the same problem as a node being needed with subassembly manager. So yeah, you can\u0027t just do it like that sadly. You can try keeping the old root part and removing it after, you might have more success.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ty-","CreatedById":72612,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T20:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the \u0022root\u0022 is the command pod.
