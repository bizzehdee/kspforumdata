With my old (and failing) 320 GB HD everything was slowing down, inc. KSP. I replaced it with a 1 TB Seagate for $80 and with its faster read/ write and through-put, its like a new computer. Everything is much faster, inc. KSP. It used to take several minutes to load the game. Now its less than a minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get no lag (unless I\u0027m launching a 700\u002B part craft). Of course my graphics are not maxed, but are at decent settings. I use Steam (and got KSP via that venue). I use Time Machine and an external 1 TB Seagate as well for backup (which worked out well when I replaced the internal drive). To give you an idea of time difference for me. Restoring the (failing) old drive would take 35 HOURS. Restoring to the new drive took THREE hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might want to go into Apps/ Utilities/ Activity Monitor and see what might be hogging resources, besides KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and I hope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
