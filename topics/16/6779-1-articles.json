I\u0027ve searched the forums, the wiki and google and I still don\\\u0027t get it.

I fly a rocket and I go back to tweak the design and next time I launch, staging is completely different than the previous flight. Typically, at launch the SRB\\\u0027s drop off and explode. or I get halfway to orbit and go to launch the 2nd stage and instead of starting the motor all the fuel gets dumped. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-18T11:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the items in one stage get activated at the same time, either that or the difference is so miniscule that it doesn\\\u0027t really matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing you describe, your stages reverting to how KSP thinks it \\\u0027should\\\u0027 be is a bug, unfortunately.

In the meantime the only solution is to either try and build your rocket in such a sequence that the standard staging sequence is in fact correct, or try again from scratch and hope the bug doesn\\\u0027t get you that time.

The rest can all be put in a single stage since they all work all the time.

I\\\u0027ve been playing since August, so I know how staging is supposed to work and how it used to work.

Or not works, to be precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I build a rocket and the first time its on the pad, the first stage launch ejects the SRB\\\u0027s. Bah! Back to the VAB and the icons show the SRB decouplers in their own separate stage ABOVE the lowest stage; which means the decouplers will fire when the lowermost stage is finished. At least that\\\u0027s the way it used to work and that\\\u0027s the way it does on the 2nd attempt (sometimes. Not always.)
