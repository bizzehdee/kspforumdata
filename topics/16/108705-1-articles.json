You can tweak their thrust to control their acceleration before the rocket is placed on the pad. Disadvantage, no control of their thrust during flight.\n\n2. You want to keep your speed well below the sound barrier in the lower atmosphere or you will have issues with drag on the front of your rocket that can cause you to swap ends. Still, you want it high enough to get it out of the lower atmosphere as quickly as possible. Experiment with different designs as well as changing throttle settings to control your flight.\n\n3. Turn gradually as opposed to the old 10k-45\\* rule or you will swap ends or worse. Each design is different to where the turn works best. This is a learning process. Once above 70K there is no atmosphere effects that will affect your flight.\n\n4. Yes and no.\n\n5. There are several mods that will tell you which biome you are in. But there is a diminishing return for repeated experiments in the same biome. You do have Crew Report, EVA report, EVA landed, soil sample, Material bay, Goo Pod, and several other experiments that will yield Science for each Biome on Kerbal or off world and in space."},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:52:24Z","Content":"1. Solid fuel boosters tend to be heavier for a given delta-V than liquid fuel. Also, solid fuel boosters are limited to the sizes provided in-game (unless using a mod like [Procedural Parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106975)), which may not match the actual size required.\n\n2. There is a threshold, yes; loosely speaking, it\u0027s where drag and gravity are equal, as increasing speed will increase drag loss more than it decreases gravity loss, and vice versa. This speed is also known as \u0022terminal velocity\u0022, as when your rocket falls down, its acceleration due to gravity will be offset by drag and thus cap its speed. The exact value will depend on your rocket design - long and narrow has a higher terminal velocity than short and fat, for instance.\n\n3. One assumes less-than-instantaneous vector changes. Imagine the extreme case: straight up to 70km altitude, then straight horizontal to orbital speed. While you\u0027re performing the horizontal acceleration, you\u0027ll have to keep your rocket in place against gravity, yes? Why spend the effort of lifting the horizontal fuel all the way to 70km, and holding it there, when you can burn it earlier?\n\n4. Most efficient in terms of fuel expended, yes. Simplest? Cheapest? Maybe not.\n\n5. There are mods that do this - [\\[x\\] Science!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119562) and [ScienceAlert](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76793) come to mind. Stock, you can look at the Science Archives tab in the R\u0026D building to see what experiments you\u0027ve done where."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:13:57Z","Content":"To add\n\n1. SRB also has no gimbal, making it hard to control (need both fins and reaction wheels)\n\n3. Gravity turn means you want the gravity to help you turn your vertical speed into horizontal - keep in mind your orbital speed is horizontal, not vertical. First go to 70km\u002B then turn means you\u0027ll need to build all horizontal speed yourself. That\u0027s much less efficient.\n\n5. Depending on the situation and experiment, it could be biome-specific or just global (i.e. biome doesn\u0027t matter). [This](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Possible_combinations_of_Activity.2C_Situation.2C_and_Biome)gives you a good picture what possible combinations are."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:14:18Z","Content":"1. SRB were nerfed if 1.0, so their niche is much smaller now\n\n2. Speed is much less of a concern than ever before in 1.0\u002B. You do pay more in atmospheric drag, but you also leave the thicker atmosphere faster. Practically speaking in 1.0\u002B if you don\u0027t burn up first you will likely save fuel by going faster. This is new, so I don\u0027t think I have fully adjusted to this, but empirical test show it is true. \n\n3. Once you are in orbit, all you speed is parallel to the ground. So all the time you spend burning perpendicular to the ground is wasted energy -- known as gravity losses. \n\n4. Basic jets aren\u0027t that great, and as DeMatt points out airbreathing stages are expensive if you are not making a reusable craft. \n\n5. I found the Science Alert mod to be great for helping me learn what I was missing."},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:47:43Z","Content":"To add a little more...\n\n1. SRBs, while cheaper than the alternative, are very heavy compared to how much you get out of them. In early career, when you are limited pretty severely by weight via the tier 1 launchpad (18 tons), you can get more dV out of a rocket using only liquid-fueled rocket engines because they are more efficient. Using multiple SRBs will add a lot of weight without adding as much dV."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T04:37:50Z","Content":"To go into a little more detail:\n\n1) SRBs have a lower ISP than liquid lifter engines. This means that it takes more fuel mass to produce the same amount of thrust. Because of this, SRBs generally should be used as early as possible so that you can get rid of the less effective mass ASAP. In early career mode, I might use SRBs to get a rocket up to a high apoapsis, then circularize using liquid fuel engines. As I transition into having more variety of liquid fuel engines, I tend to use SRBs less often outside of the first stage, and then mostly to get the rocket out of the lower atmosphere so that the liquid engines have a higher ISP. Also, as rockets get heavier, I find SRBs to become less and less useful.\n\n2) it used to be that you wanted to follow terminal velocity for efficiency, but that\u0027s not the case so much with the reduced atmospheric drag in 1.0 and later. I still find myself not exceeding terminal velocity below 25-30km altitude, but this is now because of rocket stability. Going transsonic alters the way drag affects the craft, and quite often crafts that are stable below terminal velocity may not be stable above it.\n\n3) First, understand that the atmosphere drops off rapidly, enough so that other factors become more important than aerodynamic drag. The two major factors are gravity losses and steering losses. \n\nFor gravity losses, you\u0027re looking at two factors. First, if you thrust straight up with a 2.0 TWR, 1 G of gravity cuts your acceleration to 1G of thrust upward. If you\u0027re at 30 degrees above the horizon, however, your thrust equals 1.0 upward and 1.73 toward the horizon. 1G of gravity negates the upward thrust, but now you\u0027re accelerating towards the horizon considerably faster than you were accelerating upward when thrusting straight up. Second, as your horizontal velocity increases, the more your forward momentum cancels out gravity (the phantom centrifugal force) meaning you spend even less of your thrust fighting gravity.\n\nFor steering losses, if we ignore gravity for a moment, if you burn in one direction for 1000 m/s of acceleration then turn 90 degrees and burn another 1000 m/s of acceleration, you\u0027ve only given yourself 1414 m/s of acceleration. If you had turned 45 degrees in the same direction then burned for 1414 m/s, you\u0027d have the same velocity, though not necessarily the same position.\n\nSo basically, a gravity turn is all about balancing all of these. Turn too aggressively, and you\u0027re fighting too much aerodynamic drag, don\u0027t turn aggressively enough, and your gravity and steering losses increase enough that they increase than the aerodynamic drag decreases.\n\n4) I haven\u0027t tried doing spaceplanes in 1.0 or later, but from what I\u0027ve heard, turbojets aren\u0027t as good for spaceplanes as they were previously. Many players have switched over to either strictly using RAPIER engines or a mix of RAPIER and turbojet engines. In either case, in 1.0, spaceplanes are more about reusability than low fuel cost. Prior to 1.0, I had a no-cargo spaceplane that would come so close to orbital velocity that it only took 50-80 m/s of delta-v to circularize. That\u0027s not happening anymore.\n\n5) Different experiments respect biomes at different altitudes. The negative gravioli detector, for example, is the only science part that pays attention to biomes at the \u0022high above\u0022 altitude range, all other science experiments will get you one shot at a full-value report. Most, if not all, science experiments respect biomes at ground level.\n\nEDIT: SRBs SHOULD be used ASAP, not shouldn\u0027t.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T22:42:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S**"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T05:05:37Z","Content":"That helps a lot everyone.
