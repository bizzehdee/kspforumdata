Typically you won\u0027t change the surface area of the blades, so C\u003Csub\u003EL\u003C/sub\u003E (essentially \u0027deploy angle\u0027) must increase and/or Velocity (rotational speed) must increase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut of course there is a caveat... if the angle the wing/blade makes with the oncoming air is too high, the C\u003Csub\u003EL\u003C/sub\u003E suddenly decreases and ceases almost entirely over a short span, which in turn decreases the amount of lifting force it can produce, which is commonly known as a stall. You can see this happen when you hold your hand out a car window at highway speeds - hold your hand flat (no angle of attack) and your hand is not suspended, but tilt it upward and your hand wants to rise! Keep tilting upward you reach a point where your hand is pushed backward, not upward as the turbulent flow and impacting air give relatively little lift and mostly drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally a note on air density and stalls - just like water is more dense than air, so the design of \u0027wings\u0027 designed to operate in those two very different densities must differ in their properties because of how density affects the stalling angle of attack; think airplane propeller vs boat prop... less dense air favors longer, thinner airfoils at lower relative angles while more dense water favors stubbier, wider blades at a higher angle. Another example is that because air density decreases with altitude, and you can only increase the angle of attack so much to increase lift, it is velocity (rotational speed) that must make up for the decreasing density, not angle of attack. (Also keep in mind that because lift increases by the SQUARE of velocity, it makes more sense to increase speed rather than angle of attack for high altitudes...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you choose in KSP is simply a balance of these factors...\u00A0 Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-09T05:50:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2021 05:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Wobbly Av8r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quazarz","CreatedById":208584,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T15:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery helpful answers, thanks to both of you.
