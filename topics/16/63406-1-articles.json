Whenever I\u0027ve got to map a body I try to start it where I can do it overnight and just leave it running, that way nothing is missed due to physics warp. I really wish there was a way to keep it running, and there may be a mod that does something of the sort somewhere, but I don\u0027t know of any.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uzric","CreatedById":102098,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T19:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScanSat does it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot the ability of using two ships at a time, but to map while the vessel is inactive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-13T22:00:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2014 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Uzric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T19:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there is not. but I feel your pain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
