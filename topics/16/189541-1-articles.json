Now My rover doesnt have any connection back to kerbin, so I am planning to create a relay network that allows the rover to communicate with kerbin. Now what I simply want to know is that if I time-warp really fast will the rover be destroyed or something?? Learning from veterans I have seen that time-warp can cause alot of trouble. I really dont want that to happen with my rover.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-03T15:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt tends to vary with the wheel suspension settings and the mass of the rover.

The only way to destroy a ship with this is having an orbit with a periapsis so low that you crash with a planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Physics warp: This will sometimes spell doom on your ships and rovers, depending of the situation. For example, a rover in Eve will most likely break with warp x 4.

It might be in danger if: you regain control of it (enabling physics) or another vessel you control is close to it (2.5 Km or less).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space boy","CreatedById":200084,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-05T13:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223699400\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189541\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572793480\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289439\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/3/2019 at 8:34 PM, StrandedonEarth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt tends to vary with the wheel suspension settings and the mass of the rover.
