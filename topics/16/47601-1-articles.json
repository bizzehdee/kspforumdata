Specifically, if you are changing your semi-major axis by more than a factor of 12 (SMA = (apoapsis\u002Bperiapsis)/2 \u002B radius of parent body). In interplanetary space, this only applies to transfers between Moho and Jool/Eeloo, but can also be useful for moving around between low and high planetary orbits. It also is very useful for doing Kerbol escapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it means using the Oberth effect of whatever body you\u0027re currently orbiting to move from one orbit to another. The idea is that you overshoot your initial target orbit, then make your adjustments at extreme (very low or very high) points in an elliptical orbit where it is more dV-effective in order to (possibly) save dV on the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T01:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference I see with this is that transfer windows really don\u0027t factor in the same way.
