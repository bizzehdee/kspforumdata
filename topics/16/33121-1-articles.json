However, the pads on the small landing legs I\u0027m using have sunk into the ground, and the lander is happily sliding along the surface at a steady 2.7 m/s and is showing no sign of stopping. It\u0027s basically stable, but I cannot quicksave or go back to the space center as the lander is still technically moving!

If you have RCS, try that first; Gilly\u0027s gravity is so low that a full burn\u0027s liable to kick you out of orbit (which you no doubt know). Once you\u0027re airborne again, switch your spedometer over to \u0022surface\u0022 if it isn\u0027t there already and treat it like a very low velocity Mun landing (kill your horizontal velocity; once the retrograde marker\u0027s straight up on the navball, let off and float down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that fails, I\u0027d suggest finding a flatter place to land.
