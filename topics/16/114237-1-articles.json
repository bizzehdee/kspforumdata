Fly too slow, and you\u0027ll waste energy fighting against gravity. Too fast and you\u0027ll waste it fighting against drag, which will increase exponentially with your speed.\n\nI usually try to keep the G-force meter around 2Gs until I reach 12-14km, while flattening the rocket\u0027s trajectory as much as I can without having a big AoA (Angle of Attack, the angle between your attitude and your prograde marker).\n\nSo, to answer your questions\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do you think the last part of the flight (after 10km) changes a lot on the dV expense ?\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that the last part of the flight does matter, and if done efficiently you\u0027ll be left with more dV to use on orbital maneuvers.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is really necessary to flat it more than 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ?\n\nA fine balance between your attitude/prograde marker and your altitude, flattening your trajectory as you get higher is very important. Yes, it\u0027s better to flat it more than 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, but don\u0027t do it too soon or you\u0027ll be wasting energy again.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is is better to let the rocket fly by itself or force it to flat ? (cosinus loss, is that it ?)\n\nYou might need to force it a little. Too much and you\u0027ll have a high AoA, which will mean you\u0027ll have a lot of drag, and even danger of your rocket flipping over. This does not matter in the upper atmosphere so much, if by 25-30km you\u0027re not flat, forcing your rocket to flat will save you some fuel.\n\nBasically, getting into orbit can be compared to driving between two opposite points of a square, you can follow the sides (making a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA turn), or go through the diagonal, covering less distance. This is the difference between burning up, then eastwards when you reach the Ap, or flattening your trajectory as you go, reaching the Ap as you circularise the orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T12:45:22Z","Content":"Maybe I could try to cross the 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 under 10km, maybe 8km.

You shouldn\u0027t need more than a TWR of 2 at launch pad.

Maybe add some vernor engines as well to the bottom to provide more pitch authority, instead of reaction wheels, which add more weight. The fuel used to power these is negligible compared to the mammoths. Try doing a manual ascent.\n\nI like to keep my orientation pointing just outside of the prograde marker, but I don\u0027t usually launch rockets as big as yours.

What is your TWR? However going slower at 10k will increase your gravity losses, lowing thrust at 45 will increase your gravity losses. Your best bet for improving the efficiency might be to increase payload weight. or switch 2 or your engines to rhinos and tanks and stage off the mammoths before the rhinos since they will run out of fuel first. Can you change the thrust limiter on 2 engines at once? You could always just toggle the rhinos on/off to maintain the speed you want. Also having the 2 rhinos at the end should greatly increase your dv of the craft as they will be more efficient after 15ish km. you might use more dV but you will have more for the same mass.\n\nAlso I do hate how concerned ppl are with dV efficiency\u0027s.

Again, this is from persona experience only, but what I have found is that lower thrust rockets tip over more and faster. Throttle down a bit.\n\n -Not enough drag near the bottom of the rocket. I know nothing about physics but from my personal experience more wings on the bottom help the rocket naturally tip over without any control input (after the initial pith-over maneuver, that is).\n\nAlso, it seems like you\u0027re already doing this, but in case you\u0027re not, you should be aiming for a [true gravity turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn#Vertical_climb), which requires zero control input after the initial pitch-over maneuver, letting gravity (and drag) do the rest of the turn for you.

The radial stacks with Mammoths should burn out when the gravity turn is well underway (at 30 km?), while the central stack with a Rhino would last long enough to complete the mission.

It is OK, when your get off the ground fast, but you should get your climb-rate under control. I assume that your Craft maybe has quite an TWR when the tanks empty. If your G-Meter displays more than 3 G you basically have two options: Turn earlier, flatten out more, or throttle down. The above rules are more-or less a general advise, for typical launchers. \n\nBasically what you are observing is that your climb rate is relatively high regarding your horizontal speed. As a rule of thumb: as soon as you have passed transsonic try to keep the ascend-speed somewhere between 200 and 300 m (thats a Time to Apoapsis somewhere in the range of 20 to 35 seconds). The VSI on top has a logarithmic scaled analog readout, then there are also mods like KER or MJ giving our digital display. I personally prefer using thottle\n\nto adjust the climb-rate - once you are used to it, a \u0027late gravity-kick\u0027 can easily circumvented.\n\nWith a little practice you can gravity turn by using throttle alone (after the kick), only correcting heading with steering-inputs. If you find yourself mainly correcting the angle with steering input, than your TWR is off for the current phase of the flight (too high, or too low). In your case - IMO to high. I assume that somewhere within you flight path a throttle-down to 2/3 for about 10-20 seconds would solve your problems; probably somewhere between 10 and 20k as most are going supersonic there."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T01:27:39Z","Content":"As long as you don\u0027t exceed a 55 km Ap before 30km altitude, just cut/reduce throttle until prograde is where you want it. The only losses you suffer is some of the Oberth effect since the coast will have you do more of your burn at a lower velocity. That velocity loss likely has less of an effect on energy efficiency than cosine losses.\n\nEfficiency of atmospheric launch of a nuanced thing. You need to balance drag, thrust, and mass against each other. Low (or single) stage launchers complicate this by reducing the flexibility in thrust and mass profiles. At what point does engine mass outweigh TRW gains? Faster acceleration gets you out of the air faster reducing dV losses, but needs more fuel per dV. Taking to the extreme, very rapid exit from the soup could require suboptimal burns to orbital velocity. Is the reduced time in the soup worth it?\n\nThe mechanism of your gravity turn is gravity applying acceleration towards the surface. This alters the velocity direction via vector addition. The turn rate has an inversely proportional relationship with engine acceleration and a porpotionate relationship with the sine of the angle from vertical of your heading. High TWR designs need an aggressive turn to account for a shorter burn and the reduced work of gravity. OTOH, a shallower accent increases drag losses. Especially since you are flying with greater speed. The important thing is to grain horizontal momentum. That controls your angle from horizon at a given time from Ap.\n\nTry fidiling with your initial pitch mauver while trying for that 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 10 km. This part of the flight is where you need acceleration the most. If you exceed 110% atmospheric efficiency getting to a 10 km angle of 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or more, reduce your engine array for mass savings. Don\u0027t use throttling if you have too much power down low. Reduced engine weight reduces other requirements. Be warned, due to the sinusoidal nature of the gravity turn, the greater your pitch-over, the more accurate it needs to be. It could be worthwhile to note both the initial pitch-over and the desired angle a minute later so you can correct before you deviate from flight plan too much.\n\nDisclaimer: I tend to be bad with high TWR gravity turns in atmo. I much prefer space planes.
