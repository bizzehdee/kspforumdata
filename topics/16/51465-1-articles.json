If you go somewhere new, expose both goos, and recover without transmitting, you get 7 \u002B 3.1 = 10.1, which is like 83% of the total available points in 1 go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf OTOH you go to the same place, expose 1 goo, transmit it, expose it again, and expose the 2nd goo 1 time, recovering both of those, you get: 2.8 (1st sample, transmitted) \u002B 3.1 (2nd sample, recovered) \u002B 1.4 (3rd sample, recovered) = 7.3. Now, there are still 12.5 points in total so technically you don\u0027t actually lose any, but recovering the remainder now will take forever because you\u0027ll have a longer series of 0.1 iterations to go through, whether you transmit or recover. This is because the R\u0026amp;D system counts the number of times its seen the same experiment from the same place, regardless of how it got there. So here, the 1st sample returned was actually the 2nd sample because the 1st was transmitted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you don\u0027t transmit, you get the bulk of the available points in 1 shot and can go on to other things. If you mix transmitting and receiving, you leave nearly 1/2 the points on the table so now you have to go back 2 or 3 more times to catch up with where you\u0027d have been if you hadn\u0027t transmitted.

As you progress in the tech tree you unlock several extra experiments, especially the accelerometer and the gravioli which gets you insane amount of science. Those are far up in the tree. Does that mean you will redo every mission you have done before??? Or just move on and keep exploring new things and grab science elsewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T06:32:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 06:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by merlinux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T07:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou missed a key variable. You ONLY returned and ONLY transmitted. The loss comes in if you do both in the same game. Which, most people only playing 1 game at a time, is the most likely scenario. So I stand by what I said.

Now, there are still 12.5 points in total so technically you don\u0027t actually lose any, but recovering the remainder now will take forever because you\u0027ll have a longer series of 0.1 iterations to go through, whether you transmit or recover. This is because the R\u0026amp;D system counts the number of times its seen the same experiment from the same place, regardless of how it got there.

If you mix transmitting and receiving, you leave nearly 1/2 the points on the table so now you have to go back 2 or 3 more times to catch up with where you\u0027d have been if you hadn\u0027t transmitted. This gets to be a boring grind very quickly so most folks aren\u0027t going to do it, thereby forfeiting points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. Read my above post, if I transmit once for 2.8 points and then recover, the science generated by the recovered experiment \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E yield more science than what you say. Doing the math, transmit once for 2.8 then 9.7 of total of 12.5 remains and so returning the next experiment would give you 55% of that which is 5.3 points, you really should test this for yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, transmitting anything except crew reports is an impediment to progress, just like using probes. If you send a probe, you\u0027ll have to send a Kerbal later to do the crew report, EVA report, and surface samples, which is also a boring grind. So, send a Kerbal the 1st time. And if you\u0027ve got a Kerbal, you\u0027re going to bring him home, so you might as well return 2 copies of the physical experiments to get the most points you can out of the mission, and never have to go back there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the most points out of a mission, first transmit as many times as you will or untill you get bored of the clicking and then return with stored experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit, 9.7*55%=5.3, obviously not 9.7...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T09:27:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by kurja\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T09:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just cite my earlier data to make this as clear as I can: three transmitted goo observations yield 2.8, 2.2 and 1.7 points, then storing and returning a fourth observation will yield additional 3.5 points for a total of 10.2 points which is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Emore\u003C/span\u003E than what could be gained by making \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Etwo\u003C/span\u003E return missions for 7\u002B3.1 = 10.1 points.
