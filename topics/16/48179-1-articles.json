I plan to put my space program \u0027in hiatus\u0027 until the window arrives. However, i would like to get a realistic measurement of the spacecraft\u0027s mission time on its flight after i timewarp to the transfer. Since i\u0027ll be waiting for 94 days, it\u0027ll tell me that yes, my IPV has been in orbit for 94 days. But i wish the mission timer to begin when i leave Kerbin, not when i first orbited the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way that i can reliably reset the mission clock without mucking with the CFG?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T04:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure this can only be done by editing the persistence file.
