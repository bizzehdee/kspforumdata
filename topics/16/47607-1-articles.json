The CoL \u003Cem\u003Eindicator\u003C/em\u003E isn\u0027t affected by the placement of non-wing parts, such as intakes, even though the \u003Cem\u003Etrue\u003C/em\u003E CoL is affected by the drag characteristics of those parts. Since the drag of a part is based on its mass * maximum_drag (where maximum drag is almost universally 0.2), the drag characteristics of most parts is complete cancelled out; if you have lots of high maximum_drag parts at the front and low maximum_drag parts at the back, that could be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final thing I can think of is that your cargo bay doors might be subtly deforming under the lifting forces applied to it; if it doesn\u0027t warp symmetrically (note: it will never warp symmetrically) it could cause phantom-like forces to be applied to your craft. I understand that you\u0027d prefer not to strut the doors down so that they can open properly, but if strutting them in place fixes your problem then you know you\u0027ll need to redesign that part of the vehicle. Keep in mind that parts on the same craft do not calculate collision, so this might be more of an issue than you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, nice design; probably needs more vertical tail to look right though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheaterman","CreatedById":32757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T05:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick, dirty and easy fix: put a few rotation wheels \u0026amp; RTGs near the center of mass of your craft.
