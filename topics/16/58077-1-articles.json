Not Kerbal, but my whole system. I got a chassis intrusion failure from my motherboard which reset the whole system.

Using MechJeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S or standard SAS or even having both off. every vehicle goes into a wild spin on all axis. I tried uninstalling and re-installing, then reinstalling mech-jeb. There is obviously a registry entry, or game file that is not removed by the uninstall that has been affected.
