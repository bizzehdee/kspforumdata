LH2 is one that comes to mind. If it isn\u0027t kept below a certain temp it will begin to boil off. In RF this means that you will begin to lose fuel out of that tank if it goes above that temp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor non-cryogenic fuels you can use any other fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2-You have to EVA to install them into the engine after you have used the ignition on that engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3-Some engines require a pressurized system in order to work. If you have a fuel tank that is not pressurized and an engine that requires a pressurized system you will not be able to start that engine no matter the g forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-LH2\u002BLOx is a good basic first stage fuel, so is Kerosene and LOx. It depends on what you are trying to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- Not impossible, just exteremly difficult to do. You most likely will not be able to do it in one launch. The real mission to Mars was planned to be launched in stages and docked together in orbit, refueled then launched to Mars. With a refueling tank already in orbit around Mars and a resupply module there sent remotely months prior to the manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll reasonable questions by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T03:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4-LH2\u002BLOx is a good basic first stage fuel, so is Kerosene and LOx.

That\u0027s higher than the vacuum Isp of kerolox upper stage engines! By contrast the J-2 is an upper stage engine, so of course it\u0027s going to be optimized for vacuum and the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real problem is that since no lower stage uses the first stage as payload, the returns on making it lighter are next to nonexistent (especially if by doing so you make it cost more). By contrast, if you make an upper stage twice as heavy it requires the equivalent of two of the old rockets under it. The N1, despite having a far, far more efficient engine in its first stage, and massing about what Saturn V did, had a LEO payload capacity of only 3/4 Saturn V. But the real kicker is it had a TLI (i.e. puts it on course for the moon) payload of \u003Cem\u003Ehalf\u003C/em\u003E what Saturn V did. That\u0027s due to the efficiency difference between kerolox and hydrolox for a third stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW Hancer I answered your questions in the RF thread if you didn\u0027t see it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
