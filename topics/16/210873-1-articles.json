I mean, documentation should be a bit more obvious to find. Anyway, I found it, and it clarified some of my confusions.

One of them was \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/183500-13-111-ground-effect/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKSP GroundEffect\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and I noticed some changes in how aircrafts behaved. But then I found this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/179445-18-112-ferram-aerospace-research-continued-v01605-mader-030422/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EFerram Aerospace Research Continued\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0that promises a completely new aerodynamic model, so I decided to try it... I think I wasn\u0027t prepared for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- First thing I noticed the controls for my aircrafts were messed-up, they weren\u0027t moving the way I expected.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Then, when i wanted to reconfigure them, assuming it was a glitch, I noticed the configuration options were completely different and there is when it started to become confusing...\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Lastly, as you can see in the screenshot below, my aircraft blew to pieces at the slightest pitch adjustment...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I decided it\u0027s time to ask the experts. And here I am, asking: How should one \u0022do stuff\u0022 in KSP with this mod installed? Please guide me, help me understand what\u0027s going on, how you do things and basically take my hand and walk me through. At this point I\u0027m so lost and frustrated that my other alternative is just to uninstall the mod... which would be a pity, considering what it advertises...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot23.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022506\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/d7zxB55/screenshot23.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-30T18:17:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2022 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Matrazuchi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leganeski","CreatedById":220954,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-30T05:30:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224204179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210873\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669762145\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022223683\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matrazuchi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Matrazuchi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Lastly, as you can see in the screenshot below, my aircraft blew to pieces at the slightest pitch adjustment...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure how exactly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E works, but this is probably because you\u0027re flying really fast through dense air. The dynamic pressure on your plane at the time of the screenshot is about 132 kPa (assuming you\u0027re at the equator just before noon, which is what it looks like to me based on Kerbol\u0027s reflection in the water). In comparison, a typical rocket launch in real life reaches a maximum dynamic pressure of about 30 kPa, and even that\u0027s enough to cause significant structural concerns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re flying against that much pressure, slight pitch adjustments will cause the wings to start producing a huge amount of lift, and in this case, it\u0027s more than they can handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a reason why planes don\u0027t normally go supersonic until they\u0027re high up in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matrazuchi","CreatedById":223683,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-30T11:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow, I didn\u0027t expect the difference between KSP model and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E to be so drastic... but yep, what you\u0027re saying makes sense.
