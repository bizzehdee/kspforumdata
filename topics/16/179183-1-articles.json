I do think that having debris of 10.000 will noticeably slow down your save. Having a faster computer will run saves with larger amount of vessels better and I think having anywhere close to 10.000 vessels will be a slideshow. I expect anyone boasting the hightest number of vessels in a single savegame also has a lot of game slow downs. I think people stop playing their game when the amount of used vessels becomes that big as it will become to difficult to organize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T23:45:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Sigh* I thought things got a bit \u0027busy\u0027 when I had 70 flights in progress.\u00A0 3,000\u002B hours and I\u0027m still a beginner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo answer for you but good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
