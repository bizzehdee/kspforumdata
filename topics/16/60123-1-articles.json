IMO not using an apollo style lander is a waste of fuel on Duna. Every kilogram you bring down you must also bring back up again. Added bonus is that you can assemble an apollo style mission in near kerbin orbit. A mission to add the lander, a mission to add more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then after your mission you can send up a taxi to retrieve kerbals and science. Refuel the whole thing, send up more kerbals, and do the whole thing again.
