I must be a fan ^^).\n\nRegretfully, I must concur. (Space)planes came into the game because so many people were more keen on Kerbal Flight Simulator than Kerbal Space Program. For them launch vehicles just don\u0027t rock et (sorry, I\u0027m in a funny mood) enough - which is fine, we all want Squad to make a game that appeals to as many people as possible, without spoiling \u0027our\u0027 fun. So now I see the game as being several separate things; rockets and spaceplanes are as different as sandbox and career modes and are attractive to different people for different reasons. Looking for compatibility or sense between them is as pointless for looking for sanity in the tech tree. As it stands there is obviously some balancing to be done, but it seems \u0027about\u0027 right for both preferences.\n\nThe regret comes in because i) so many updates have been entirely, or mostly, about spaceplanes. ii) so many people *only* do planes, even where they make no sense at all. iii) As someone said recently \u0022SSTO, by which I like so many people mean spaceplane ...\u0022 (\u0022SSTO\u0022 means Single Stage To Orbit - if you mean spaceplane, why not say spaceplane? If you mean to Minmus/Laythe/wherever, why not say that?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T17:48:29Z","Content":"I must disagree in the \u0022different people\u0022 department.\n\nFor me, spaceplanes are useless. I suck at landing taking at least 3 reloads to get the plane on the ground with more than 70% parts still in place (frequently less than 80% though). I can\u0027t make one with decent payload, looking enviously at people who carry orange tanks to the orbit effortlessly. I get semi-decent milleage, reaching the orbit with, say, 1500m/s left. The savings are nonexistent considering I\u0027m using Warzou\u0027s Cygnus family of SSTO rockets, of which I usually recover more than from my planes after a rough landing (most landings are rough.) I\u0027m running an intense space program, the Duna mission awaiting a transfer window sits in a 70m long monstrosity, a class E asteroid is being brought into orbit, and several probes are scattered over other planets. A train of 6 varied, large cars rolls across the Mun.\n\nAnd yet I keep making and flying SSTO planes. Usually outside my career game, in a separate sandbox save. Because they are fun to build and challenging. Because they present a new set of problems, and interesting solutions. Because it\u0027s easier to come up with something nobody thought about and make the forum go \u0022whoa\u0022 with a novel spaceplane design than it is with rockets. Because they are prettier.\n\nMaybe I\u0027m switching between two games that way. Still, I think the game is more than the sum of two different simulator games. Especially when I start putting strictly rockety parts in the planets (SRB, Poodle) or strictly plane parts in space stuff (munar rover built on air intakes frame; before radiators became available, wing strakes as radiators for nukes)."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T17:52:03Z","Content":"I got a SSTO to orbit yesterday with ~4,700 dV left...
