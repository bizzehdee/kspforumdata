As the plane accelerates and the wings begin to produce lift, it will often be the case that the weight distribution on the landing gear will shift. If the weight shifts onto the single gear, you will crash. (Often this will happen for craft with a nose-up attitude on the runway and a 1-fore, 2-aft gear arrangement; the wings will pull the rear gear off the ground shifting weight onto the forward gear.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Landing gear attached to certain parts (structural pylons, certain struts, etc.) are not stable, and will undergo spontaneous rapid disassembly at high speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Always, always, always make sure your thrust vector passes through your center of mass.

Anyway, Bubba Wilkins, even with perfectly level gear, there is a way to get the nose up. Pitch the forward canards or wings up (shift A) or even all wings, so that they may get air pushing under them to initiate lift. I\u0027m sure you knew that. :-) In practice I tripod my gear with the two rear gear \u0022shorter\u0022 than the one forward gear, as well as pitching the wing surfaces up.
