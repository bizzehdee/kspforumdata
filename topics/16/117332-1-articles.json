Reading THAT thread, I found out there is a way to remove the signal delay, which I want to do. \n\nIt says the settings config file is created once KSP is started. However, after starting KSP, and double checking the Remote Tech file, the settings config file is still not there. \n\n[http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/guide/settings/#alternative-rules](http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/guide/settings/#alternative-rules) \u003C--- The page describing how to get to the settings file.\n\nThank you in advance ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T19:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nabiscovinco**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:23:18Z","Content":"Start a save, go to tracking station, then quit.

The only alteration is the disablement of signal delay. I also included changed setting for stock antennas and probe cores, they are the same as original but with added Remotetch support for Asteroid Day parts, the antenna and probe core. I thought it might come in handy too :-)\n\nEDIT: I hope I do not violate any licencing rights with this.
