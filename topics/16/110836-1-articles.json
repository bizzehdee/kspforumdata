So the question is, does anyone have figures about what amount of ore is contained in each asteroid class?\n\nRoughly 80-90% of the asteroid mass. 10 kg equal to one unit of ore. So a 100 tons asteroid will yield some 9,000 ore, which equals to a large MK3 liquid fuel tank.\n\nThey just aren\u0027t worth it, which is a pity, as I was looking forward to use them as orbital refueling stations."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:11:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They just aren\u0027t worth it, which is a pity, as I was looking forward to use them as orbital refueling stations.\n\nWhat were you expecting tho 100t asteroid turning into 100t fuel? In real life tar sands(Oil sands) gives %0.03 oil after the sand and dirt is removed and refined. Lets assume that in asteroids you are looking for oxygen and hydrogen to turn into fuel since they are the easiest kind of materials you can find as oxydizer and liquid fuel. This is giving you %1 turn rate atleast. I could understand if we had comets in ksp and mining them could provide maybe %90 fuel since they are generally made of ice.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T01:21:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T02:06:49Z","Content":"As much wood as a woodchuck would chuck wood if a woodchuck could chuck wood.\n\nBut really, I don\u0027t know, that just popped in my head lol"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T02:23:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What were you expecting tho 100t asteroid turning into 100t fuel?

If so, that\u0027s 18k liquid fuel - almost two of the big MK3 tanks. Or a few Rockomax Jumbos, if you go that route.
