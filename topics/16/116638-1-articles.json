I set my periapsis at, say, 197,000 meters, and the ship just explodes when it gets down to that level. It\u0027s weird. It\u0027s like the atmosphere is at almost full density right at the top. Am I doing something wrong here? The lowest I can put my periapsis is about 198,000 meters, and at that level, the braking effect is nearly non-existent.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T10:22:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 10:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T07:10:30Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re doing anything wrong...
