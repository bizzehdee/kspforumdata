This counts particularly for take-off and initial ascent, where you are burning straight up. The reason for this is that as long as you are fully vertical, you need to expend the local gravity\u0027s worth of dV every second, just to maintain your status quo (I call it the \u0022hovering component\u0022). That dV is lost, permanently, filed under the heading of \u0022gravity losses\u0022. Only the acceleration (and therefore dV expenditure) that exceeds local gravity will actually move your rocket. Thus a rocket capable of producing 1.5 G\u0027s of acceleration will only accelerate at 0.5 G\u0027s when flying straight up - expending 100% of the fuel for 33% of the actual gain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(You could also make that case for aerodynamic losses caused by high thrust increasing the dV cost to orbit, but for typical launch profiles, gravity losses outnumber aerodynamic losses by at least 5 to 1.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you tilt over towards the horizon, things change to your advantage. Since your engines are no longer pointing at the ground as much, they are no longer fighting gravity as much. When you are pointing fully at the horizon, gravity losses are zero, and 100% of your expended dV goes towards actually changing your velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this, it\u0027s generally a good idea to jump off the pad as fast as you can, and have the shortest possible vertical flight portion (even if you throttle back later). 10 seconds less spent fully vertical will decrease your dV cost to orbit by about 100 m/s!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as I like to say, \u0022overloading the launch stage is free\u0022. Basically, if you have a TWR of 2.0, you can launch very efficiently and minimize gravity losses. But you could instead also add fuel to the launch stage, resulting in less TWR, but an overally higher dV for your rocket - and unless you really overdid it with your stage already, adding fuel gives you more extra dV than you lose to a less efficient take-off. This holds true until you reach a TWR of 1.2 (at sea level!), a figure you should never drop below. The reason it is \u0022free\u0022 is because if you were to add extra dV to any other stage of your rocket to maybe gain the same effect, that stage becomes a bigger payload for all the stages below it, reducing their dV in turn. Only the launch stage has no other stage below it which could choke on its weight. Therefore, overloading it is free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you are concerned for dV, and your launch stage has a lot of TWR, you have two options:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.) take the high TWR and launch with it, making your ascent more fuel efficient\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.) stuff more fuel into the launch stage until its TWR is no longer too high for your tastes, but still above 1.2 at sea level\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust limiting your launch stage (or launching at less than 100% manual throttle) is an option that\u0027s almost always a worse idea than the two above. There are edge cases where it can be useful, such as all-solid launch stages. If you have three SRBs, and set the center one to 100% and the other two to 70%, then the center booster will cut out early while the other two still continue burning. This smoothes out your TWR curve, particularly since SRB stages really tend to ramp up in TWR hard near the end of their burns; which in turn can make your rocket\u0027s gravity turn more predictable and controllable. A more predictable and more controllable gravity turn can mean a more efficient ascent in its own right, since you\u0027re neither going too steep for too long due to being unable to tilt over enough, nor need to risk being too aggressive and ending up too flat too low down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-21T14:12:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2016 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T17:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222466291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134633\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458524232\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139010\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xyphos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Xyphos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust Limiters.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIDK how long this feature has been in game but I just now noticed it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand it tho, with MechJeb\u0027s dV window open, adjusting Thrust Limiters on engines only effect TWR but not dV. what gives?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust limiters are useful for tweaking and fine-tuning. \u00A0They can even be adjusted during flight, not just at the design stage. \u00A0I use them as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRestraining SRB exuberance. \u00A0I always use lifters based on a single core LFO stack 2nd stage with an all-SRB 1st stage. \u00A0This number of SRBs usually has a TWR of 3.0 or higher, which is too much for a safe ascent. \u00A0So I limit their thrust on down so the 1st stage has a TWR of 1.5 or so.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBalancing RCS thrusters (using RCS Build Aid): \u00A0Sometimes you need to put a thruster in a specific spot but the design of your ship won\u0027t let you (like there\u0027s a joint between stack parts or a spaceplane wing in the way). \u00A0So what you do is put it somewhere nearby and then use the thrust limiter either on it or the other thrusters until they balance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpecial Effects: \u00A0Interesting fireworks, flat-shooting missiles, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T18:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrust limiters for SRB\u0027s cannot be adjusted on the pad, only LFO\u0027s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T13:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that if you\u0027re consistently setting a thrust limiter on launch stages (much) in the VAB it\u0027s a sign that your rocket might have\u00A0too much legs and might be able to get away with fewer or smaller engines.
