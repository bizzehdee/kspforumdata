The picture below shows things just before I did a burn to get home. I did the burn and when I got to Kerbin Periapsis. I did a retro burn and I slowed down but then I sling shot around picked up a lot of speed and started heading out to space. I\u0027m not sure what I did wrong. Also I did circularize the Mun orbit because I could not get Kerbin periapsis close enough from the original orbit. I\u0027m getting a lot of very elliptical orbits and as the photo shows mine had a significant inclination. I would like some advice on how to improve on this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022S7VfO4z.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/S7VfO4z.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-29T16:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like your burn didn\u0027t put you deep enough into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere for enough aerobraking. 63 km is too high to have much of an impact on your speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve returned from the Mun dipping to Kerbin Periapsis of 45-49 km, but this required two to three passes through the atmosphere to finally slow down enough to land. If you\u0027re landing a Mk1 or Mk1-2 command pod you can dip as low as 35 km as long as you have a heat shield and some ablator on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks like a Mk1 pod with a fully loaded heat shield. It should survive re-entry if you set Kerbin PE to 35 km, and you\u0027ll land in one aerobrake\u00A0pass.
