I\u0027m in science mode and only have the first two techs unlocked, so my items are limited. This setup flies fine until I eject the solid fuel stage (runs out around 4000m) - at that stage it starts spinning out of control. I\u0027ve also tried it with two solid fuel stages and a decoupler, as soon as the first is ejected control is lost. At this stage I\u0027m just aiming to get into space.\n\n![n3lvk2.png](http://i60.tinypic.com/n3lvk2.png)\n\nLaunch config (bottom to top):\n\nRt-10 solid fuel booster with two basic fins\n\nDecoupler\n\nLV-T30 Liquid fuel engine\n\nFL-T100 fuel tank\n\nCockpit\n\nChute\n\nSAS is enabled from launch.\n\nAny help?"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:56:52Z","Content":"This one doesn\u0027t look powerful enough to reach space anyway - you probably just want to redesign one."},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:09:31Z","Content":"you can stack more fuel tanks on top of one other for one engine"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T20:20:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E you can stack more fuel tanks on top of one other for one engine\n\nThis.

At 4000 meters up you shouldn\u0027t exceed 150 to 200 m/s otherwise the density of the atmosphere and the resulting drag will pull you in a spin for sure.\n\nAlso, although some things have changed, don\u0027t you have a LT-V200 fuel tank yet with two techs unlocked, that would be more suitable here and make sure you have a pilot in the seat so you have SAS.\n\nGreets,\n\nJan"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:09:49Z","Content":"As g.koster says, you can stack additional fuel tanks on top of each other, and they\u0027ll supply fuel like one big fuel tank. Additionally, two fins is not enough for full directional stability - you need at least three, using symmetry to place them as a ring. The reason you flip out is because it\u0027s a positive-feedback situation - once you start turning, without fin drag to offset the capsule drag, the flip force just gets stronger as you turn more.\n\nSo I\u0027d redesign it as follows (top to bottom):\n\n- Parachute\n- Capsule (with monopropellant removed, right-click on it in the VAB and then drag the bar to zero)\n- Decoupler\n- 3x FL-T100 fuel tanks\n- 3x Basic Fins (in a ring on the bottom FL-T100)\n- LV-T30 (with throttle limited to 50%)\n- Decoupler\n- RT-10 SRB (with thrust limited to 70%)\n- 3x Basic Fins (in a ring on the bottom of the RT-10)\n\nIf you wanted to do a strictly SRB flight, I think you\u0027ll need three RT-10 stages, and have fins on at least two of them. And of course actual orbit will need a bigger rocket yet."},{"CreatedByName":"daniel1234","CreatedById":143642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:26:46Z","Content":"Thanks for all the help! Over the last few hours I\u0027ve worked out a lot of what you guys have been saying from experimentation - I spun from a mixture of too much Delta-V and not enough fins, plus that thing wasn\u0027t powerful enough anyway. I\u0027ve noticed that SaS has little effect, I think because that setup has rigid fins (they don\u0027t move when I change pitch/yaw/roll) and the engine has no vectoring. Am I right in saying this or am I missing something? One more question, can someone explain why this is the case:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Right now your CoM is riding right on top of your CoT.

The thrust to weight ratio is too high, right click on the SRB during design and turn it down..\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve noticed that SaS has little effect, I think because that setup has rigid fins (they don\u0027t move when I change pitch/yaw/roll) and the engine has no vectoring.\n\n SAS only stabilises using the equipment it has available, if your craft cannot produce enough torque to overcome the torque generated by aerodynamic forces then it won\u0027t do squat. More control authority can help prevent unruly rockets form flipping, especially if SAS counters the rotations early, but ultimately theres only so much that it is practical to add and it wouldn\u0027t solve the underlying problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T21:54:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghpstage**"}]}
