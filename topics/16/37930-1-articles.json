The roleplaying reason is that I want to monitor the global weather patterns on Laythe. The thing is, I don\u0027t want them to fall over or land in water (so parachutes are basically out of the question) and ideally I\u0027d like to deploy them all in one mission. Additionally, I want it to be possible to retrieve them/reposition them later. My first thought was to build an airship (with the HooliganLabs airship mod) and to lower them to the ground with KAS winches. With electric rotors (from Firespitter) and a heavy nuclear generator (udk_lethal_dose\u0027s station parts pack), I could travel all around Laythe. I seem to be awful at creating airships, though; they\u0027re all quite unbalanced and can barely steer. Can someone give me pointers, or an example design that would be good for such a mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pods weigh just a bit over 2 tons each and look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2fArnlz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222fArnlz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knas","CreatedById":73907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T22:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use mods but just use parachutes.
