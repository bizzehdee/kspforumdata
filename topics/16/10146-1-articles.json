If you just want to be able to land on the Mun, you may need either a different craft or simply a slightly different technique.\n\nBasically, you want to eliminate almost all of your lateral momentum while you\\\u0027re still high-up. Once you\\\u0027re falling pretty much straight down, you\\\u0027ll want to orient yourself vertically. Leave your engines off until around 60km up. Do a full thrust there until your velocity is down to around 100m/s. Then cut your engines again. Wait until 20km and then you can start a controlled descent -- once again, decelerate to about 100m/s first, then burn as needed to slow your descent in time to meet the ground.\n\nIf you run out of fuel when trying to land, you may find some ideas from my own Mun lander craft on how to do your staging and suchlike:\n\n[http://www.sporemodding.com/stuff/MITM-I.craft](http://www.sporemodding.com/stuff/MITM-I.craft)\n\nI have successfully landed about 90% of attempted landings. There were only a 5% crash rate, almost always down to pilot error. It\\\u0027s pretty easy to control, too. Just remember -- when reorienting the craft in its lander stage (which I normally reach just after beginning descent on the Mun), you\\\u0027ll want to turn RCS off. The SAS gives plenty of torque for reorienting it.\n\nBeyond that, there are plenty of threads around with the specifics, but judging from your post you are experienced enough to know what to do with some simple instructions.\n\nThe best apoapsis on a TMI orbit tends to be between 10M metres and 12M metres, that should get you headed towards the Mun without too much lateral velocity. I find going right for the Mun\\\u0027s own orbital radius can work pretty well (11.3M metres)."},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T13:25:12Z","Content":"Well, if you want my \u0027forigiving\u0027 method:\n\n I aim to put my apoapsis on TMI in the middle of the Mun, so I\\\u0027ll hit the Mun if I don\\\u0027t change course. Then I burn retrograde until my velocity vector is near vertical, starting at maybe 40,000 feet or so. Once my retrograde indicator is near vertical, I lock my orientation upward and brake with my main engines while adjusting lateral velocity with RCS till I\\\u0027m pointed straight up and down, moving straight down relative to the planet, etc. \n\nIt\\\u0027s not fuel efficient at all, but it reduces the problem to a one-dimensional one fairly quickly."},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-04T15:21:16Z","Content":"Burn radially until your PE is 5km above the Mun\\\u0027s surface.

That might be due to your craft design being too small for the trip, or it might be due to inefficiencies in your trajectory. (If you get the ascent speed and gravity turn optimized, that leaves a lot of fuel for the rest of your trip.)\n\nCheck out those tutorial videos.
