It is too late for revert, as it is a mothership that was assembled during multiple launches, and it is well underway. What I want is to pretend the ship was never launched, by simply deleting it from the savegame, and magically having my kerbals (all 12 of them) be back at the space center. \n\nIs there a relatively easy way of achieving this?\n\n(I realized that having ~15 tonnes of food onboard is stupid, so I installed a greenhouse mod instead).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T00:03:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 12:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:43:51Z","Content":"Deleting the ship is easy, it is the Kerbals that are the hard part.\n\nFirst things first: make sure you have a backup quicksave.sfs file, so that any damaging changes are easily reverted.\n\nAlso I recommend you just use HyperEdit to bring your ship back to LKO, then retrieve those kerbals that way. But here are the steps to editing the save file/\n\n**Please read through these instructions in their entirety, so that you are prepared to handle all the steps.**\n\n**You will need to keep track of all the kerbals that you will be moving.**\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Find your ship in the save file by opening it in a capable text editor such as Notepad\u002B\u002B or gedit on linux. Use Ctrl\u002BF to find you vessel name. The header of your vessel will look like the code snippet below\n\n2. Delete the follows:\n\n    VESSEL        {            pid = b3c113e8efd8483ab60eb37a71bbdd90            name = [Ship Name Goes Here]            type = Ship            sit = LANDED            landed = True            landedAt =             splashed = False            met = 140124.970329955            lct = 124075818.523473            root = 0            lat = -4.42956507922574            lon = 288.699115981021            alt = 1117.85894691315            hgt = 1.095864            nrm = 0.00524677,0.999986,0.0005325079            rot = 0.6037621,0.5427328,-0.4667104,-0.3508469            CoM = -3.109872E-05,1.614197,0.000536263            stg = 2            prst = False            ref = 239007968            ctrl = True            cPch =             cHdg =             cMod = 0            ...and so on for the next 5000\u002B lines, all the way until the code next says \u0022VESSEL\n\n3. Now look up the Kerbal roster in the save file, then look up the all the kerbals on that Ship in the roster. They will be marked as \u0022Assigned\u0022\n\n    KERBAL        {            name = Valentina Kerman            gender = Female            type = Crew            brave = 0.55            dumb = 0.4            badS = True            tour = False            state = Assigned            ToD = 0            idx = 0\n\nChange it to \u0022Available\u0022 for all of them\n\n4. Finally, there is the parameter \u0022idx=##\u0022 for all of them. You are going to have to find the highest value for your **already** **available** kerbals. It may be 0, 3, or some higher number, but it will always be the number of available Kerbals - 1\n\nIn ascending fashion, you need to assign the \u0022idx\u0022 value of all of them incrementally. It does not matter what order, so long as there are no repeats and no skips.\n\n    KERBAL        {            name = Valentina Kerman            gender = Female            type = Crew            brave = 0.55            dumb = 0.4            badS = True            tour = False            state = Available            ToD = 0            idx = 3\n\nidx set to 3, because I have Jeb, Bill and Bob available at the moment.\n\nIf the above steps do not work, then I must have missed something. The other option (much safer!!!) is to use HyperEdit to bring your ship into low Kerbin orbit and either bring them down safely to the surface or send a retrieval vessel to get them.\n\nHope that helped.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T22:53:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by quietghost**"}]}
