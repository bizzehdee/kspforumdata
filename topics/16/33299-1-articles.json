More/larger control surfaces toward the back might also help, though putting those at the front can cause problems. Once in the air, however, that plane might have stability problems because the center of lift is ahead of the center of mass. That does help get the nose up for takeoff, but tends to KEEP drawing the nose up while you\u0027re trying to maintain level flight. It also appears that the center of thrust is slightly above center of mass, which will cause a bit of torque to force the nose down. Try place the engines lower. Last but not least, wheels at the very back become a fulcrum and turn the length of the plane into a lever that presses the nose down. Try moving the back wheels farther forward. Nice-looking plane, though. I\u0027d like to see pics of it from other angles. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spooks","CreatedById":68403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T17:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehere a few pictures\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafter some luck finally got in the air\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut then disappeared mk4 and a portion of the plane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen became uncontrollable so I hope you can see in the picture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if I bring back the wing also help that the ass does not hit the road?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UzUreIc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UzUreIc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oFeef5E.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oFeef5E.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dUU33DV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dUU33DV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mq8XbWI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mq8XbWI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T20:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with the mod parts you\u0027re using, but it looks like the center of mass is still a bit ahead of the center of lift, so I\u0027d suggest moving the wings back a bit more, even if that means they extend back past the end of the fuselage.

One thing that might be contributing to the loss of control is that fuel tanks in KSP empty at the front of the ship first, so the longer that plane flies, the lighter the nose is going to get. (Assuming the fuselage pieces you\u0027re using are the stock kind that double as fuel tanks.) Concentrating the fuel supply in the middle of the plane means less shifting as the fuel is used, which you could do by replacing some of those fuselage/tank pieces with struts or other structural parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T21:36:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spooks","CreatedById":68403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T21:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for the information\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to try\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is the link to the mod \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/mk4-fuselage-system/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/mk4-fuselage-system/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere is some vague with that mod the camera sometimes starts to float\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand it is 100 times harder than say the b9 pieces\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
