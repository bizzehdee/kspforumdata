There is the rationale that an ordinary player might use (for example, fly a rocket using the test engine, after landing, since the contract says \u0022landed\u0022). Then there is a broader interpretation (landed can mean that its may be launched from the land launch pad or runway without having been flown first). Then there is a more creative approach which is simpler, cheaper, faster and still technically satisfies the contract (fire an LFE with no fuel tank used or fire an SRB with all propellant having been emptied out in the VAB first). The player may learn how to think of the contracts as puzzles, most of which are solvable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is true of the testing of parts after splashdown, as discussed in other posts above.
