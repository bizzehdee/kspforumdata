The game says this upgrade should allow \u0022unlimited number of active contracts\u0022. Although the upgrade did indeed remove the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0limit on the number of contracts, I found that the game simply didn\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eoffer\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0me any more contracts once I had 14 active. Whenever I\u0027d complete a contract, I\u0027d be offered a new one, one-for-one, but no more than that. One day when I completed a story contract, the game offered me\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etwo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in its place, which expanded the \u0022rotation\u0022 to 15, but a few contracts later, for no apparent reason, I completed one and was not offered a new one, reducing it back to 14. The other day I completed a non-storyline contract and was offered two in its place, so it\u0027s now back up to 15.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ozf2hHV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022594\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ozf2hHV.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what\u0027s going on here? Is this \u0022intended\u0022 behavior by the game? An arbitrary technical limitation perhaps (e.g. due to the contracts being stored in a fixed-size array in the game code)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like to be able to have more than 15 active contracts. Right now, more than half of the effective \u0022slots\u0022 are tied up with long-term missions that I can\u0027t (or don\u0027t want to) start yet - e.g. I need to unlock the requisite tech tree nodes to complete ore contracts, and I don\u0027t want to skip any of the storyline contracts (thus I can\u0027t escape Kerbin until I\u0027ve finished exploring Minmus, since that would skip that contract). This leaves only a few slots for active turnover of contracts, which makes it difficult to e.g. get enough tourists on the books to fill up a big, efficient craft to take them to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way to \u0022fix\u0022 this? Perhaps a setting, or a mod? It seems weird for the \u0022size of the market\u0022 to be effectively capped like this; one would expect the market to increase as I demonstrate the ability to perform more ambitious missions more efficiently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-11T02:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180446-ej89/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022180446\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/180446-ej89/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ej89\u003C/a\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cake is a lie.\u00A0 So is the \u0027unlimited contract\u0027 feature of Mission Control.\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-131-contract-configurator-v1233-2017-10-05/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EContract Configurator\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0will let you have up to 18, I think\u00A0(and it offers some other features that you may like, so have a look), but I believe what you\u0027d really like is found in Gamedata\\Squad\\Contracts.\u00A0 It\u0027s a file called Contracts.cfg, and near the top is a line that says \u0027AverageAvailableContracts = 10\u0027.\u00A0 Change this to what you like.\u00A0 Just be mindful that there is a limit for a reason, so watch out for issues that may arise from raising the limit to something absurdly high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-11T03:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed this as well, the \u0022unlimited contracts\u0022 term is a bit misleading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I stop getting offered mission I typically take it as a sign I really need to actually complete some lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the building upgrade tooltip and/or description should be clarified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-11T03:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell it\u0027s not actually a lie.
