The rest of the impact force will be applied to Part B, and if that force applied to Part B\u0027s mass exceeds Part B\u0027s impact tolerance then Part B is also destroyed. Otherwise Part B converts the impact force to Velocity and pings off into the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that making any kind of sense?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T23:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@The_Rocketeer: Yes, it is.

Of course, I have no idea how this is derived but it appears to affect \u0022splash damage\u0022 to nearby parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom experiments with destroying KSC buildings, it appears that mass is WAY more important that velocity in term of inflicting damage, which is the opposite of the expected result from the equation Ek = 1/2 * m * v^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn equally important but often ignored item in this regard is the total absence of radiated heat in KSP. In KSP, heat only moves via highly abstractied conduction with convection and radiation being completely ignored. Given there\u0027s little or no convective heat transfer in space, I can deal with that part. But radiant heat is even more of a factor in vacuum than in an atmosphere, which has serious implications for all outrigger engines and especially tractor (as opposed to pusher) engine configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
