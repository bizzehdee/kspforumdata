But back to my point. I\u0027m going to start a minmus colony. But i\u0027m curious on how do i start. What should i prepare for, And is minmus as hard to land on as mun was. (Trust me i gave up from trying to land perfectly after the 30th try) Because i don\u0027t wanna be stuck trying to 30 times. So yeah basically, What should i prepare for. How should i get this done.

It is small, so the gravity is almost zero. You can land huge things on matchsticks. Not that you will need to. The easiest way to explore it is to go with a MK1 lander (the smallest lightest 1-man can), with a smallest fuel tank/engine, thin legs, stuff like that. Leave the main ship up in orbit. Go down where you please, do the thing, go up, dock transfer stuff, repeat. Getting the Lab module to the orbit there is easy too, so one lander with one goo and one matlab will do, long as you have a lab there. You might need a tanker of fuel every now and then to keep your lander fueled, but it is not too much of an effort and good fun too : )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I am going to make a full-blown mission around/on Minmus (and/or Mun) my next career (yep, restarting).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T01:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinmus is much easier to land on than the Mun but slightly harder to get an encounter with, as you\u0027ll need to do a little plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T01:42:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gravity is so low it\u0027s actually kind of annoying, since a good bump can send things flying quite some distance.

Well, a super light rock made of like, air and feathers, but a rock all the same. There are large flat planes on Minmus so ideally aim for those. You can let your velocity build while you descend, but when you get close-ish, burn it off to about... 100-50m/s. Note that when I say close I mean, really close, almost-seeing-your-shadow kind of close. Minmus\u0027 gravity is so light that if you overdo your deceleration, it takes aeons to get moving again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAaanywho, the reason why I like this method is that you don\u0027t need to worry about doing any lateral RCS maneuvers to negate your lateral velocity. You start more-or-less at a vertical plane, so any adjustments are pretty basic. You want to get your retrograde marker centered on the dot at the top of your little blue globe, so make adjustments in excess of your tretrograde to \u0027chase it\u0027 into place. Then, make tiny thrusts to adjust your speed as you see fit. Short bursts to avoid gaining lateral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep your SAS on at all times too. When you land, you\u0027ll need it to actually counter any slopes you might have glued yourself too (my lab on Minmus, tilting at a good 20-30 degree angle, held up by SAS mostly).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-31T01:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2013 01:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Keramane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T02:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only been there manned once so far, my next trip has been shelved while I work on a new refueling station. Anyway, from the short time I spent there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It\u0027s pretty easy to land as long as you don\u0027t have any sideways momentum, it\u0027s very easy to knock your lander over if you\u0027re not coming straight down. If you aren\u0027t freaking out like I was the first try, you can use RCS/SAS to keep from falling over as long as it\u0027s not too bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Be VERY CAREFUL with rovers. I managed to get one up to around 18m/s surface speed and then I came up on a small ridge I didn\u0027t see and went airborne, coming down on one wheel.
