The question is, I got a satellite polar contract which need me to rotate to 45 degree of the polar orbit you can easily reach via going north or south.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a efficient way to do it at launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-08T22:05:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a lot like doing a polar one.
