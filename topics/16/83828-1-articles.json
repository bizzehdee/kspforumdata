It\u0027s staged so the lower outer stages drop and the upper outer stages light, dropping upper stages as they run out of fuel and with each tier separately feeding into its respective centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59091477/screenshot95.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot95.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe physics rate is about 5 seconds per real second at liftoff, but it otherwise works, save for the glitch in question, which can oddly be worked around by pressing the stage button once for every decoupler in the stage. More strangely, this only seems to affect ditched stages taking fairings with them when under very high part count, as the upper stages detach all at once in a nice ring, as do the engines above, and the lander seen above stages just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso of note, I\u0027ve got minimal mods -- just alarm clock, enhanced nav ball, engineer, and hot rockets.

It\u0027s apparent that the fairing coming with the decoupler doesn\u0027t matter (as I tried with several engine types), the part count amazingly doesn\u0027t matter, as putting very part-dense subassemblies on the test craft wouldn\u0027t cause the glitch, nor would tearing most of the craft off the lifter in the original ship make it cease.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore oddly, this may in fact be a good bad bug, as the weird decoupling behaviour lacks that inward pivot issue one sees these days.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T07:37:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI often found it was Launch Stability Enhancers that were the big problem. On a very large with 32 of them or some number like that some would not detach at the same time. The engines would fire up and the ship would rip itself apart as one side is tied down and the other rockets upwards. The only Fix I found was the exact opposite of your problem. I would place decouplers under the engines and LSE\u0027s under those. The ship on the pad was held better as this didn\u0027t cause the ship to bend inwards which happens with outside attached LSE\u0027s so that I would only need a decoupler per large stack and maybe a few to hold the middle or top of the ship steady. This reduced the change of a LSE\u0027s not detaching and meant on the bottom ones it was reliable decouplers that detached (never had a problem).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T13:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had trouble with multiple 3.25 diameter in-line decouplers not firing.
