I\u0027ve been trying to turn it into an SSTO craft, but I\u0027m struggling with the TO part of that equation. I think it ought to be able to achieve orbit (I can get it out of atmo easy enough, but I don\u0027t have enough rocket dV to circularize), and I have a feeling it\u0027s my flight profile that is screwing me. Right now I take it up to 16-20km, let it hit top speed on jet engines (1.somethingkm/s), light the rocket and stand it on its ass, shut down the air breathing engines before they flame out. This... doesn\u0027t work well. So, how should I be going about things to get this thing into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t remember the exact numbers and don\u0027t have access to KSP at the moment, but here is what is powering it: 2 turbojet engines with 2 jet fuel tanks and 4 ram air intakes. 1 aerospike with 4 FL-T400 fuel tanks. I don\u0027t remember the weight of the ship, but it\u0027s little more than fuel, a couple wings and a cockpit. Does this sound like it should get into orbit? I can post a pic later this evening when I get home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T02:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, after some more dinking around I got it figured out.
