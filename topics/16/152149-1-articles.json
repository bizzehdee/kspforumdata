I have a 2 ship expedition to Duna, the orbiter with science lab did not use the asparagus lower end but the lander did. So, I ran into an epic fail at Duna and I\u0027m going to restart this entire Duna science gathering mission. But...I want to transfer the asparagus lower end, which is saved as a \u0022subassembly\u0022, to the orbiter ship. I disconnected everything from the orbiter, from the Kerbodyne adapter down, and then replaced it with the asparagus subassembly (which also is topped with the same Kerbodyne adapter). But, after doing that, nothing above the adapter shows up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E staging?
