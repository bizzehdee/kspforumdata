I\u0027ve experimented and found it takes a lot of fuel to go from a 100 KM Eve orbit out to Gilly. I tried a 10,000 KM orbit and was able to send a satellite and lander to Gilly with fuel to spare, with the intercept out near apoapsis, but another satellite of the same design used all its fuel getting down to 100KM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used MechJeb, which ended the PE at well below 100 KM when I set it to 102 KM, which required using all the remaining fuel to correct. Looks like that\u0027s a maneuver where I\u0027ll just have to use SASS to point retrograde and run the throttle myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T02:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that coming in from interplanetary, having a highly elliptical orbit and raising your Pe until you get an encounter works best for getting to Gilly, in terms of getting the encounter.

But you CAN combine them if you do them in stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to Gilly, what I do is aerocapture at Eve just skimming the atmosphere enough to end up in a big elliptical with a major axis approximately as long as Gilly\u0027s minor axis. Then circularize this at Ap, which should have your orbit outboard of Gilly\u0027s Pe but crossing inside of Gilly\u0027s Ap (this costs several hundred m/s). At this point, match planes with Gilly (another couple hundred m/s). Now what you want to do is burn from your position outside of Gilly\u0027s Pe to intercept Gilly out near its Ap, so you have the lowest possible relative speed to it. This is critical because Gilly\u0027s SOI is tiny so your encounters will be brief and you want to let orbital mechanics do most of the braking for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, when going for Eve, it depends on what orbit I want to end up in, but usually it\u0027s WAY closer than Gilly\u0027s Pe. This means a deeper pass aerocapture pass to end up in a smaller orbit, then circularize as need be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese 2 things aren\u0027t really that compatible, which is why I recommend using separate ships for each destination. But if you want to do it with 1 ship, then it would go like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnce you enter Eve\u0027s SOI, make sure your inclination is good for the stuff that will be staying at Eve.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake a skimming aerocapture as described above for going to Gilly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOut near Ap of the resulting orbit, undock the Gilly-bound ship and circularize it there, so you can leave it be while you\u0027re messing with the Eve stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhile still out at this distant Ap, tweak the Pe of the Eve-bound stuff a bit lower so you can aerobrake its Ap down much closer. Once you\u0027ve got the Eve stuff in the orbit you want, you can leave them there while you go back to the Gilly-bound stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHave the Gilly-bound stuff match planes with Gilly, then work on getting an intercept, which might take several orbits. And in any case, it\u0027ll take a while between burning to intercept and actually getting there, which is plenty of time to go back and land the Eve stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real difference between this and doing it with multiple ships is that the Eve-bound stuff can just fly for Eve and the Gilly stuff can just fly for Gilly, so you don\u0027t have to juggle the Eve-bound stuff between the 2. And of course, each ship will thus be smaller so are easier to get off the ground and all that. But it\u0027s still a bit complex to send multiple ships to Eve in the same launch window because the trip is so short that they don\u0027t spread out very much and all arrive a few hours apart. But seriously, that\u0027s enough to do what you need to do with each one before the next needs attention. Kerbal Alarm Clock is essential no matter how you do it, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd 1 other thing. It\u0027s a good idea to put some linear RCS thrusters facing UP on your Gilly lander.
