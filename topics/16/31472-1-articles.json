There\u0027s no way for me to dock it/attach it to any pod either because there are no flat surfaces on it, and I really need to know how to spawn a kerbal in with it.

The Kerbal can then get out of the lander and start using the rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo attach your rover to the side, there are a few ways. I would recommend putting the smallest docking ports on your lander and rover and attach them like that. If you used decouplers, the decoupling force would make the rover hit the ground pretty hard and probably break something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
