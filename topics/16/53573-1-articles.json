Instead, switch to map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you burn to get closer to your target, you\u0027re not just \u0022traveling in space\u0022 and bridging the distance between you and you\u0027re target, you\u0027re also adjusting your orbit. [4] Sounds like you\u0027ve converted your orbit in something highly elliptical, hence the sudden velocity change. The same with [5]; you\u0027ve changed your orbit into something that \u003Cem\u003Etemporarily\u003C/em\u003E gets you closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought experiment: you\u0027re behind your target. So you burn aiming your ship towards it, right? Well, if that is a short distance (two, three minutes max) it will work. But if the distance is longer... You\u0027ve just \u003Cem\u003Eadded\u003C/em\u003E delta-V to your orbit. Which means you\u0027ve increased your semi-major axis. Which means that your orbit period increased. Which means that each orbit you will actually \u003Cem\u003Efall behind\u003C/em\u003E on your target. What you really need to do in such a case is actually burn aiming away from the target. Your velocity drops, so does your orbit, and now your orbital period is \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E than the target and you\u0027ll gain ground each orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I do for rendezvous:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFix plane inclinations. Once you designate a target you should see the difference in inclination, as well the ascending and descending nodes. That\u0027s the point where you need to change inclination to match it with the target. Around Kerbin, anything less than 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 will be fine, but expect trouble if it\u0027s more than, say, 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGet close. 18 km is not close, 5km is as far as I usually venture, with an exceptional 8-12km if I really #### my orbits.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere\u0027s a time to be patient and save fuel. Rendezvous is not that time. Move too slow and you\u0027ll hit the part where your orbits diverge. I usually aim to bridge the gap (whatever it is) in about a minute. Is the gap 5000m? Then I burn for 85m/s. Don\u0027t overdo it though; every m/s spent will be doubled as you\u0027ll have to slow down too.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnce I get close (hint: when your target is passing your ship as you look at it from a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle.

Likewise, I have a 3 part vehicle - SSTO launch vehicle, orbital transfer vehicle and lander. I decouple the OTV from the launch vehicle, and transfer to Mun, leaving the launch vehicle in orbit around Kerbin. Once in orbit around Mun, I decouple the lander from the OTV, and land. Then take off and re-establish orbit, and rendezvous with the OTV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst time round, I had a remote guidance system on the OTV and Mechjeb on the lander. As soon as I decoupled, the OTV accelerated away from me. I aborted the flight and restarted without the remote guidance system. This time, when I decoupled, it didn\u0027t do anything strange. However, once I got to within 2km of the OTV after landing on Mun, the relative speed jumped (instantaneously) from 1.0 to 280, and the relative speed on the navball seems to be out of whack. If I click REL- on Mechjeb, however, it does point me in the right direction. I managed to get to within a few meters of the OTV, but it keeps accelerating away from me at about 1m/s/s. Docking is impossible. I considered the possibility that it might be trying to target something else, so I unselected and reselected the target.
