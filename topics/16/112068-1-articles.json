Now for a fuel tank, it seems quite clear that flying through the air sideways produces quite a bit more drag than flying through the air end-on, but is this also true for wings? At first it seemed like the delta wings I was using generated a fair bit more drag than the much narrower strakes I ended up with, but now I\u0027ve seen a fair number of designs around that seem to use both swept and delta wings, which cut a much wider swath through the air than the strakes. IRL, all planes that go super-extra fast, like the SR-71, do have a very long and narrow profile, but is this actually true in stock KSP aero? TIA for any insights on this...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T20:33:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program**"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:43:07Z","Content":"Devs told us that stock aero doesnt use wing shape stuff, and makes any wings change shape in the aero calculations, if its going slow, it acts like a rectangular, non swept wing. If its fast, it acts more like a swept wing or delta wing. The surface area still matters though so less wing = less drag."},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:28:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Devs told us that stock aero doesnt use wing shape stuff, and makes any wings change shape in the aero calculations, if its going slow, it acts like a rectangular, non swept wing.

On a related note, would you happen to know if clipping wings into fuselages, etc. alters their effective area and/or drag? I\u0027m not trying to cheat the aero system or anything, but sometimes the shapes you\u0027re given just don\u0027t fit the design."},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:36:32Z","Content":"I have read other posts (too lazy to look for citations) that state that clipping parts does NOT reduce their drag. I have reading nothing about the effects on the lift model though. Perhaps someone can test that out?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:50:17Z","Content":"Tested, only FAR mod calculates those with voxels, stock just cares about inline/radial difference which doesnt make sense for wings."}]}
