If you are in a very high orbit your orbital period will necessarily be very long - which means you could entirely miss a transfer window because you\u0027re in the wrong part of your orbit to make the burn. Of course, you could just make the burn anyway, using much more deltaV, but then you lose any putative fuel-efficiency from the high orbit anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot being able to burn when you want to will even be apparent from Mun altitude so all in all, you\u0027re spending more deltaV to get there, losing any benefit from Oberth effect and (probably) losing any benefit of an efficient, timely, transfer window.
