(ie a lander inside of a cargo bay) but in my game when I try to attach another docking port to a shielded or inline port (ie Mk2) i have no attachment nodes. What gives? am I missing something or is there a Mod which adds this feature? thanks for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T15:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you see someone using a docking port to attach a lander inside of a cargo bay, then they\u0027re not using shielded docking ports; they\u0027re using a regular docking port that just happens to be inside the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shielded docking ports (inline clamp-o-tron, Mk2 clamp-o-tron, shielded docking ports) are generally for putting on the outside of a craft, and their purpose is to have something that\u0027s aerodynamic for atmospheric flight but can be opened for docking when in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ForScience6686","CreatedById":144187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T15:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone done testing of the drag for the shielded port in comparison to nose cones?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnusualAttitude","CreatedById":129962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T15:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64711-1-0-TweakableEverything-1-12-For-all-your-part-tweaking-needs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64711-1-0-TweakableEverything-1-12-For-all-your-part-tweaking-needs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe \u003Cem\u003ETweakable Everything\u003C/em\u003E is what you are looking for...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
