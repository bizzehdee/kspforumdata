I have rt10,rt5,lv45,testing first and I can only get these part test, deselecting and returning till i can do it suborbital. the next series is BACC the mk16 and mk2 r parachutes. (ps they have to be done even if they give no science else the keep returning, and the next lot is the tt38k and the one first set. etc. etc.\n\nthe next cycle will have everything again in order but one offset. \n\nSo there is a memory which testing has been done and you can do that one for some time or the rest has been done!!\n\n**secondly.** on a 10% game make sure that you only start to do part testings don\u0027t upgrade to early your vasilties as you will be overwelmed by contracts that are not giving science.\n\n**thirdly.** This get me thinking. Could it be that you don\u0027t get part testing contract anymore because they are under prioritized by other contracts because you have done them all?? If so then I think someone should inform the developers one this bug/feature. I see it as a bug but they can have put it in as a feature, but they should ad least be aware of the effect."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T09:00:48Z","Content":"Parts available from testing are sort of like within one or two tiers you already have - once you research more, you\u0027ll be eligible to test more parts.\n\nIn case you don\u0027t know - you can just reject contracts with no penalty and new contracts will spawn. This way you can just focus on the contracts you want to do. Parts testing are dull - especially those with weird parameters (alt~1000m v~600m/s ???). I usually just complete it once for each unique trajectory/celestial body, then reject everything (with the exception of testing landed, as it\u0027s easy money/sci)\n\nFor early career you really need to make progress as soon as possible. Staying somewhere is not efficient at all."},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T09:18:41Z","Content":"too through you have to keep moving. But playing a 10% game you have the get you science some were. Most close biodomes are gone with the first three sciences. to to grow you need part testing. And indeed strange contracts that are not fitting my growth are discarded.\n\nBut playing a 10% game you need 53 part test to get the next three sciences. the main bottleneck on a 10% game ad least early on in a 10% games is science, money still flows in fast. no more then 50% of each contract is spend on the craft. And 100% craft recovery is is very simple from sub orbital."},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T23:27:14Z","Content":"Those test contracts can be really useful if properly misused. The parts are usually in tiers you haven\u0027t unlocked yet, and once you accept the contract you can USE those parts as often as you want and for anything you want, until the contract completes or expires."}]}
