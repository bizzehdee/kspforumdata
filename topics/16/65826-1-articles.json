In rocketry, the two are (for all practical purposes) synonymous. Delta-V refers to change in velocity - it is a measure of how much you can change the velocity of your craft. Note that this does not mean one burn (although it can); it means the total amount of change in velocity that your ship can manage throughout the entire voyage - in essence, it is your budget for your flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf (according to the maps) you have enough delta-v for your voyage, and yet you are still running out of fuel, then the problem is not that you need more fuel. It\u0027s that you need a better (more efficient) flight plan. Getting to and from other planets is hard, but it has far more to do with \u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E you leave and how you travel than it does with how much fuel you have. Almost any craft that is capable of a Mun landing and return can return from Duna - the delta-V requirements are almost identical - but you have to have the right flight plan to do it. The delta-v numbers given by the maps represent best-case scenarios for transfers made during the optimal transfer windows. If you aren\u0027t flying during one of those windows, then it can take much, much more fuel (prohibitively much, if you are flying at exactly the wrong time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENine times out of ten, careful flying trumps exhaustive building in this game. Make sure that the phase angle between Kerbin and Duna is correct before you leave, and make sure you have the right ejection angle when you go - if you do that, then you\u0027ll most likely find that the ship you have is already capable of doing the job. (If the terms phase angle and ejection angle don\u0027t mean anything to you, then I recommend that you look up a tutorial on interplanetary flight; it\u0027s not all that hard once you understand what to do, but it\u0027s not intuitive.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"g0tchas","CreatedById":81760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T04:05:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm - then I\u0027m not going to get much fun out of KSP.
