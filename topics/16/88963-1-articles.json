Is the phantom force thing a common thing with the current version of IR?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a station with a rotating solar array a while back and docked dozens of ships there with no problems. One thing you might do is attach your truss with docking ports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to sandwich an IR rotatron between a pair of docking ports then put that between the station and the solar array truss you could try the rotatron for a while. If you have trouble with it and want to get rid of the rotatron at a later time you dock with the truss with a station tug. Undock the truss and rotatron from the station. Then undock the rotatron from the truss and use a kerbal on EVA to push it away from the station. Then just redock the truss to the station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this suggestion would use 4 extra docking ports, you could also just use 2 and make the rotatron part of the truss and just change the whole thing in orbit if there\u0027s a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually try to put modded parts on a station on removable assemblies like that in case a game update or conflict with another mod breaks them. I design the station so I can take it apart fairly easily, remove offending mods and put it back together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
