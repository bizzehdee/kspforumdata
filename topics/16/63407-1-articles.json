The file I linked here includes a 7 Jumbo tank with asparagus style staging. With that payload it has a whopping 4838 atmo and 5701 vacuum delta-v, you can get the 254T payload to an orbit of 620km without touching the fuel in the payload. It has flight controls (RCS and SAS*6), 6k Battery life and 6 RTG\u0027s to keep you powered up until forever. It\u0027s also so stable I just launch it from the platform, no Launch Stability Enhancers. Some of the strutting could be prettier, but that\u0027s as nice as I\u0027m making it tonight. The center booster is set to 25% thrust limit and has its own RCS pack because it has a tendency to flail about when it pushes that big of a load by itself. The Mainsails are separated from the tanks by an octagonal strut to allow them to cool properly, meaning you never have to reduce thrust on any of the other engines. Zero fails thus far, lifting much more than you were originally looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-09T10:09:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2014 10:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Himynameisjake\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMuch better ship design.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oskar-","CreatedById":78952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T21:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(edit: added embedded images)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of mine, from way back in 0.19\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/urymqyH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/urymqyH\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/urymqyH\u0022 alt=\u0022urymqyH\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the six oranges in a 265km orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/JiI451T\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/JiI451T\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/JiI451T\u0022 alt=\u0022JiI451T\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-09T00:50:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2014 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Oskar-\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eimage embedding\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Himynameisjake","CreatedById":101602,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T10:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XzlNJnc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XzlNJnc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus shot, any particular place you want your five full jumbo tanks sent op?
