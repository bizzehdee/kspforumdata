I think the restrictions on where these devices can operate are a bit absurd. It would be nice if there were some science you could do from orbit, since in the real world 99% of our planetary science is done from orbit, and the instances where we\u0027ve actually put science on the ground are pretty few and far between. There are no landings in the outer solar system except Titan, for example, and none on a body without an atmosphere outside the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a suggestion: someone from Squad should dig up the Wiki pages on real science missions.
