It would literally make it impossible to fail the task. And that, by extension, means you can \u0022succeed\u0022 in a way so wrong that it has nothing whatsoever to do anymore with actual spaceflight. Is that what you want to \u0022learn\u0022 from the tutorial - what you want to take with you into actual gameplay, where fuel is not unlimited? All that will do is leave you just as frustrated (or more), because the way that worked in the tutorial no longer works during actual gameplay. That would make the entire tutorial pointless. But if you succeed in the tutorial as it is now, then you will know a way that reliably succeeds everytime in the real game too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, learning is a process of acquiring useful knowledge - through your own action, and if necessary, also through failure. The first thing the tutorial teaches you is that fuel is limited. This is among the single most important lessons in KSP, and it would be gross negligence to not teach it at the earliest possible opportunity. The second thing the tutorial teaches you is that failure is always an option. KSP may not look like it, because it is a fairly slow game, but it is \u003Cem\u003Eincredibly\u003C/em\u003E skill-based. It is genuinely difficult to do things right, especially for a beginner, and even most good players can still be reduced to slack-jawed awe at a video of someone who pulls off a feat through sheer skill that sounded physically impossible on paper. You need to get used to failure. Your rockets will explode during flight. Your planes will fail to take off. Your one-hour mission to the Mun will end a total loss because you mistimed the landing burn by a second. All this and more \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E happen to you, repeatedly. And the tutorial says: Ah, too bad, you didn\u0027t get it this time! Here, revert and try it again. Which is precisely the lesson you need for the main game. Failure is data. Failure teaches you what needs to be done to succeed. It is your most important teacher of all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo swallow that frustration down. And trust yourself: you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E do this. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Give yourself some credit!
