However there is a special case item part namely the Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel tank. The orange spaceshuttle liquid fuel tank one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part is very special. It\u0027s the only part as I have found so far which you have to manually Research after you have spend the science points on unlocking it in the first place. You do so by right clicking and click \u0022research\u0022 on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you dont the item appears as \u0022Part model requires an Entry purchase in R\u0026amp;D\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere I assume R\u0026amp;D stands for research and development. Or your research depertment for short. This is thus what I already said I did. But the part remains greyed out at the launch assembly and continues showing the message that it requires Entry purchase in R\u0026amp;D.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I then revert back to the research department the Rockomax 64 fuel tank has switched from a Unowned status to a owned status. But I can still right click it and research the thing. But the process repeats itself everytime when I find it still greyed out at the Launch assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is that when I repeat the steps the ROckomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank duplicates itself in the R\u0026amp;D interface as you can see by this picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/2995/0soa.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope somebody can help me out with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: (OFFTOPIC Q)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody care to explain why the Jumbo-64 tank is special in its purchasing steps in the career mode.
