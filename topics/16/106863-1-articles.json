The upper stage engine is a 48-7S and the first stage engine is an LV-T45\n\nAround 10-15km it suddenly decides to flip backwards, and I can\u0027t do anything about it. I have SAS on stabilize, and I haven\u0027t locked the LV-T45 gimbal\n\nReplacing the 48-7S with an LV-909 seems to help a tiny bit, but not much.\n\nIf I replace the service bay, probe, and nosecone all with an Mk1 Command Pod, it works flawlessly. Is there some kind of issue with the service bay or the nosecone that\u0027s causing me grief?"},{"CreatedByName":"Logris","CreatedById":99103,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:45:48Z","Content":"It will be because there isn\u0027t enough mass at the top of the rocket.\n\nI imagine by about 15km you have emptied the top 1 maybe 2 fuel tanks.\n\nThis means your center of mass gets lower and lower until it causes the rocket to flip over.\n\nThis is why changing to the command pod fixes it, because that adds enough mass right at the top to compensate.\n\nPerhaps you could add another stage, or add more fuel to the payload.\n\nAlso bigger/more fins as low as you can get them will help."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:05:33Z","Content":"The aero forces around the 48-7S are not helping, I assure you. Remember, aerodynamics now plays a huge part in the game!\n\nAre you staying inside your prograde marker on ascent? If not you will be generating unnecessary drag, and most likely flip over."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:42:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It will be because there isn\u0027t enough mass at the top of the rocket.\n\u003E I imagine by about 15km you have emptied the top 1 maybe 2 fuel tanks.\n\u003E \n\u003E This means your center of mass gets lower and lower until it causes the rocket to flip over.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is why changing to the command pod fixes it, because that adds enough mass right at the top to compensate.\n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps you could add another stage, or add more fuel to the payload.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also bigger/more fins as low as you can get them will help.\n\nYeah, this seems to be spot-on\n\nI doubled the fins and slid them farther down, and also moved the upper stage fuel tank to be above the service bay.
