If you go to the tracking station, on the upper left side of the screen there are buttons that allow you to toggle through viewable debris, probes, ships, landers, stations, etc. How specifically do I classify what I am building in the VAB or SPH? I\u0027ve had what I intended to be stations listed as probes and ships, so what do?
