Today I decided to send a very small lander to the Mun. I managed to land it very smoothly (at like 1 m/s). As soon as I landed, the landing legs compressed and then extended like a spring. Since then, the lander keeps bouncing, reaching less than one metre in the air and then falling back down. As it touches the ground, there is an instant in which it is basically still, allowing me to time warp. However, as soon as I go back to real time, the bouncing continues. If I exit the game and reload the craft, it shoots up a lot higher and then goes back to bouncing. Does anyone know how I can solve this issue?

Spring should be lower then dampening, dampening slightly higher. If problem still persists you should drag these values down as close to zero.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2: This option works regardless, but, should be used also if method 1 doesn\u0027t work. Which is, use tinier landing legs! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EI see you already have these. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3: Use 3 legs instead of 4. A craft only requires 3 legs to stand upright. Also saves you weight from the launchpad while making the entirety a flea length more efficient.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what if you just changed to 3 legs, lowered spring and dampening, then what do you do?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA: You might feel that the other tiny rover wheels or landing gear parts can substitute landing legs like the ones you got currently installed. Your decision...\u003Cbr\u003E\nB: Use other parts like cubic octagonal strut or smallest wing segments to use as stationary legs to substitute the actual ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with KSP is that the part on terrain collision effects are not that optimized to simulate the proper physical interactions one might expect. Bugs like this will appear.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven the parameters like spring and dampening are arbitrary but do work. In a way, lowering both dampening and spring creates the same effect to deter bounciness as if you were installing a smaller leg which has lower spring and dampening by default while it\u0027s spring and dampening can be lowered also.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe effect of spring and dampening on the terrain is in some way calculated on the spring, dampener and I suppose a few other factors relative to the weight of the vessel it carries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the lighter the craft the less legs, the tinier the legs and the least spring and dampening should be applied. There comes a point where the least legs, the tiniest one and the absolute 0 spring and dampening setting doesn\u0027t work. In that case you need smaller landing legs or the tweakscale mod to scale it down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Eedit:\u003C/strong\u003E I might have improperly watches the .gif\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut is the vessel moving with the surface as the legs retract and extend or is the rest of the vessel still while the legs move in and out? Are the ends of the legs touching the terrain? Or do they retract away from the surface and then lower down again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not clear to me on the gif where the surface is because of you graphics settings. In a way it seems it itself is completely still and only the landing leg animation plays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn which case it\u0027s still useful if you even cared for it but then what I wrote isn\u0027t very helpful as this then is something else.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-24T15:52:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2018 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KraterKreator","CreatedById":150238,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-30T20:57:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just had the same thing happen to me.
