In the past I thought the new aero was fine, but I\u0027m starting to have doubts. Those of you who are familiar with me, know I\u0027m a rather successful FAR user in pre-1.0, so I know how to launch a rocket. However, the drag seems a bit, unpredictable in 1.0.2. I\u0027ve had plenty of rockets work just fine that were un-aerodynamic pieces of trash, and then a streamlined rocket like [this one won\u0027t even go straight up](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39750083271554097/668384EF1E4C6BF5C644C8E2B150C6A78620EA81/)without flipping over. I just feel like it just isn\u0027t as intuitive as it should be, certainly not as intuitive and predictable as FAR. With FAR if you didn\u0027t go too far off the prograde and didn\u0027t have too much forward drag then the rocket would do fine, but with 1.0.2 it just doesn\u0027t seem to be the case. An aerodynamic rocket should not flip when it is pointed at a perfect prograde, but it does.\n\nI\u0027d love to figure out a reason this occurs, has anyone figured anything out as to why a seemingly well built rocket won\u0027t fly when others do just fine? Are fairings actually shielding from the air? That is kind of what it feels like, as if the drag from the cargo was pulling it around.\n\nEDIT: (Oops, this was supposed to be in Gameplay)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T19:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T20:04:24Z","Content":"The thing that bothers me most with drag now is how it is modeled in relation with part occlusion.

So it sounds like we aren\u0027t much different than 0.90. Leave the nose cones and fairings off, they make it worse.\n\nEDIT: Yep, removed the fairing and it flew right into space.

The fairing base is the same size as the tank below it, the only difference is the probe core. But there isn\u0027t another choice in probe cores because Squad put all the more appropriate cores end of the tech tree instead of with the sized parts they belong to (2.5m in this case). Either way, it shouldn\u0027t matter, even turbulence doesn\u0027t make 90 degree turns, that fairing base is close enough to the tank below it that it shouldn\u0027t be caught in the air. If it is, that is broken and it is pretty much the same as 0.90 where all parts on the craft create drag regardless of where they are."},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:06:20Z","Content":"It looks like that rocket goes down to 1.25m before going back up to the 2.5m fairing.

I don\u0027t think that is the problem anyway, I removed the fairing and the problem went away.
