If said kerbal lands on the ground, he freezes - stops moving, reacting to anything. I can switch control to him ( [ ) but he won\u0027t move, won\u0027t react, can\u0027t perform any action. He stays that way after loading a save, even after reloading the game.\n\nIs there some way to \u0022unfreeze\u0022 such a stuck kerbal?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T10:34:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T15:05:09Z","Content":"Usually when my Kerbals trip up or fall off a ladder they do the same. I think pressing space causes them to get up again? Or just try WASD, Space and R key.

Just change that to \u0022LANDED\u0022.\n\nOr maybe that\u0027s the fix for broken saves when you somehow manage to quick save while in a vehicle which is momentarily flying.\n\n!!! IMPORTANT !!! Make a copy of your save file before you try changing it by hand"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T15:23:25Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had that happen, but not in 1.0.2 (yet) [This thread may give you some techniques to fix it.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75586-Master-Thread-Unresponsive-Kerbals-in-EVA)"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T16:58:53Z","Content":"I had something like that with my rover seat. It rolled over once and the Kerbal refused to do any thing. Couldn\u0027t leave the seat and he\u0027d occasionally fire his rcs boosters despite being stuck in the seat. I couldn\u0027t even access him via the eva list in the tracking station.\n\nI eventually freed him by flipping the rover over. So you could try that. I mounted some landing struts on it jsing kas to achieve that but with a plane crashing it the right way is probably easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T08:01:12Z","Content":"My trick to unfreeze them is a sepratron/flea kick. Since the engines have exhaust, and exhaust is fast, you aim at them and fire. You must send the kerbal to the air (no ground skidding to death) and control him with his RCS fast."}]}
