There are Ablators in front to stop heat from harming them and them overheating. I\u0027ve noticed they seem to still catch air a bit though. I was wondering if those ablators also stop air from pushing on them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably more noticeable on high speed reentries. But they definitely still catch air. Is this likely the limit of what the ablators can stop or are they not designed to do that? some of it could be the fuel, gravity, and\\or acceleration. How much is normal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Once I stopped acceleration this stopped. I\u0027ll have to get a pick on reentry to compare it.
