Getting fed up of flying standard Jet engine contracts half way around Kerbin. Something that not only adjusts AOA (like Mechjeb), but can actually hold a certain altitude and can track a navigation waypoint (like those you must fly to in contracts). It would be great if this was working by only adjusting trim so if you disengage it, the trim would remain stable.\n\nAnyone?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T14:27:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Old Foxboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T09:48:36Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-1-0-x-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-1-7-1-%28May-8%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-1-0-x-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-1-7-1-%28May-8%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:26:55Z","Content":"Thanks."}]}
