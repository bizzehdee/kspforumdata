However I am having a frustrating time getting my launch vehicle to actually launch. The pictures show the story just as well but here is my issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like launching stupidly large ships and was running into physics issues trying to use a 4 layer asparagus launcher made of stock tanks. So I downloaded KW Rocketry to use the larger tanks/heavier engines. Except no matter how much I reinforce my ship, it usually falls apart on the launch pad once the physics initialize. I\u0027ve found the work around to that by launching the second the physics come online and throttling up before the rocket falls to the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept once the rocket gets to 3000-4000 feet (different depending on the rocket design I use) I get hit with a sudden heavy jolt out of nowhere. If I throttle down through that altitude, the ship is still hit with a jolt but it usually survives and I can go back to full throttle. Most of the time I can then happily carry on to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept... about 1 in 5 launches, when a stage runs out it causes one of the now empty tanks to jolt up and down like it\u0027s attached with bungee cords. If it bounces the wrong way it knocks something important loose and the kraken feasts. I can solve this by killing thrust and dumping tanks a second or two before the fuel runs out. But between throttling down at 3000-4000 feet and killing thrust every asparagus stage drop I\u0027m wasting a lot of delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I\u0027m pushing against the limits of what the engine wants to work with but is there anything I can do to prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T06:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as your ship isn\u0027t over 250 tons try using mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Leviathan super max lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload it here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vTRL2n8wvzQkEtUTBCNHpIMW8/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-vTRL2n8wvzQkEtUTBCNHpIMW8/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee how to operate it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/UcRPj31D2hE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA slack tank asparagus design doesn\u0027t suffer from the sudden deceleration jolt like asparagus with engines attached to them.
