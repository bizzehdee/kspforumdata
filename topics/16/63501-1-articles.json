As long as deviation from the \u0022flight path\u0022 is no more than 15 degrees ((all stock, so it\u0027s an easier feat.))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I decided to make something smaller and easier to control. Surely enough \u0022something\u0022 went wrong. More precisely, is that after take-off (at around 140 m/s), plane starts deviating to the left in the yaw channel violently. SAS and manual controls both fail to maintain this thing stable. Flight ends briefly a couple hundred meters away from the endge of the runway.

Version with an extra balancing fuel tank at the front had the same problem, just more slowly developing (thanks, added mass!).
