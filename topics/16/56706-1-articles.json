You can still pull off a rescue mission; Jeb\u0027s suit won\u0027t run out of air or anything like that. Just have him cling to the outside of the hatch and he should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming you\u0027re low down on the tech tree - let\u0027s say Basic Rocketry only. If you\u0027re higher up that that, great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA two-Kerbal craft with 6,375 m/s of total delta-V oughta be able to do the trick (actually, that\u0027s way more than what you need, but I want to make sure there\u0027s a good fudge factor there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty easily designed - for your M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn stage, you need two Mk-1 Command Pods, a Mk-16 Chute, (if you have Survivability though, by all means change that to two radial chutes for extra safety), a TR-18A decoupler, an FL-T400 and an LV-T30 engine (put the tank and the engine below the decoupler; you want to blow them loose for landing). That should get you 1,784 m/s of delta-V; you only need 1,480 to get to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and back. Add an FL-T100 only if you think you need more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe booster will be the tricky bit; your M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn stage comes in at 5.15 tonnes. I\u0027m calculating that a single-stage rocket would require 4 LV-T30s at a minimum to get that into orbit; each engine would require a stack of seven FL-T400s. As a three serial-stage booster, you\u0027d want one LV-T30 in the upper stage, two in the middle and three in the lower stage - fuel requirements for each stage are 9, 19 and 39 FL-T100 equivalents each; I anticipate that one would be a tall rocket no matter what.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch with Bob in one capsule and leave the other empty. Once you\u0027re up, make your M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn transfer. Once in M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit, target Jeb\u0027s ship. Burn normal at the descending node or anti-normal at the ascending node to zero out your plane. Then set up a maneuver node at the next apsis. Pull prograde; if the projected distance between you and the target decreases, keep pulling until you get a close intercept (within 2 kilometers, closer is better). If the distance increases, stop and pull retrograde - be careful that you don\u0027t put your periapsis below 10 kilometers. If you can\u0027t get an intercept, wait until the other apsis and try again. Burn as the node indicates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re within two kilometers, you need to do the old stop-reaim-start trick at decreasing distances; you can\u0027t dock, obviously, but treat it as a docking approach anyway. Once you\u0027re within a comfortable distance, have Jeb jetpack over to the rescue ship. From there, set up a standard M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar return and fire up the engine when you\u0027re ready. If you run out of gas before closing the periapsis to within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, decouple the command pods from the engine pack and have one of the two Kerbonauts get out and push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Missed the bit where you couldn\u0027t get Jeb out of the pod. That\u0027s an issue - same design, but instead of two Command Pods, try one command pod with some modular girder adapters on the end arranged in a claw shape. And even moar luck...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
