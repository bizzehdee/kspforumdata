I land fine, and usually I have enough fuel to make it back to Munar orbit, but it seems I\u0027m always looking at about 300-350 m/s delta-V left once I\u0027m in Munar orbit, which is cutting it close for making it back to Kerbin. (I suppose I shouldn\u0027t be orbiting Mun at all, but even jetting right toward Kerbin to escape Mun, I still cut it close.) \n\nI\u0027ve tried one 400-size fuel tank with legs; one 200-size tank with four 100-size radially attached with fuel lines; and other configurations. Always I seem to be just short of what I need to get home. Yes, I can slap on a docking port and refuel in orbit, but I\u0027d prefer just to go home directly.\n\nAny advice on configuration for return landers? I did search on landers here, but much of the advice isn\u0027t focused on \\*return\\* landers.

Make it a two stage lander (landing/return) with enough fuel in the return stage to get back to LKO. This has the downside of being a touch larger than a usual lander. \n\nExample:\n\n![RT7TlWol.png](http://i.imgur.com/RT7TlWol.png)\n![j682mhYl.png](http://i.imgur.com/j682mhYl.png)\n\n2. Instead of making a heavy lander, make a larger transfer stage and leave it in orbit. Once you bring the lander back up, dock with the transfer stag and let it carry you back home. It is possible to do this with a dummy stage that is just a fuel tank and engine, but it is far easier if you put a probe core and reaction wheel on the transfer stage so you can align it easily. It will also require solar panels and a battery. You can also build your lander so that it jettisons the ascent stage after docking to increase the dV budget of the transfer stage.\n\nExample:\n\n![NVUT46El.png](http://i.imgur.com/NVUT46El.png)\n![RjVnZ3ml.png](http://i.imgur.com/RjVnZ3ml.png)\n\n![P5hlSYtl.png](http://i.imgur.com/P5hlSYtl.png)\n\nSorry that last image is dark, the transfer stage is performing it\u0027s escape burn back into Kerbin orbit.

It is possible to soft land even rockets on Mun if it\u0060s flat enough. If it\u0060s about lander construction I doubt that\u0060s the problem. You can give it a good go almost right at the start of career mode if you do trajectories and orbits right. For the escape you barely need any fuel to get back at all. Remember to escape backwards from Mun when you leave, and not directly at Kerbal. We\u0060re not moving in lines here but in orbits. A line is always slower and more fuel inefficient. Mun moves at 512 m/s along its orbit. The faster you can escape the gravity the faster you\u0060ll be picked up by Kerbal and the less fuel you\u0060ll need. It\u0060s the same with every planet and moon. Naturally the fastest way back therefore is directly back along Mun\u0060s orbit. Just a short burst in the right direction and you\u0060ll go right down your new orbit to Kerbal\u0060s atmosphere. Minmus is the same and it\u0060s almost as if you fall down to Kerbal if you leave it the right way even though it\u0060s very far away. Gotta love science right!\n\nTo explain why a bit, if you leave Mun along its forward path you\u0060ll be moving at 500-600 m/s but, like I said above, Mun will be moving at 512 m/s along its orbit (Therefore effective escape velocity= 600m/s - 512m/s = 88m/s) so it\u0060ll take a long time to outrun it basically. Go the other way and you\u0060ll be moving as fast while Mun will be moving away from you (Effective escape velocity 600m/s\u002B512m/s = 1112 m/s). Huge difference as you can see. If you go in a straight line toward Kerbal you\u0060ll be somewhere in between. Let\u0060s average out 88 and 1112 and say you\u0060ll have an effective escape velocity of 600m/s. But you will also have less control over the peri down in Kerbal\u0060s gravity well and will need more fuel to get down. You will also stay longer in Mun\u0060s gravity and you will lose orbital speed while waiting to get picked up. Always leave backward:) That\u0060s what we\u0060re doing when we launch every rocket to the east really. West (From the Space Center) is the direction of Kerbal\u0060s orbital movement around the sun and it therefore takes longer to escape Kerbal\u0060s gravity if you go out the wrong way. And because of the equatorial spin it is also harder to get out of the atmosphere that way so a double whammy of physics right in your face. You should try leaving on a reverse orbit and compare how much fuel it takes to the normal way. I haven\u0060t tried it in KSP yet but I wouldn\u0060t be surprised if it took twice as much burn to get to Mun going west. Maybe more. Simple concept really, once you stop and think about it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T02:25:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 02:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:13:04Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t 300m/s enough for returning from Mun orbit?

This is my first KSP career in which I\u0027ve landed a Kerbil on the Mun and returned her to Kerbin safely on the first\\* try!

The multi-stage lander worked great: I landed with a bit of LFO in four radial tanks, which were feeding a fifth central tank, keeping it full. After EVA, flag-planting, and general tomfoolery, Staemma Kerman climbed back in and just shot straight up, as I was on the \u0022retrograde\u0022 side of the Mun. You guys were right: I simply skipped Mun orbit and went directly to Mun escape, and the Mun disappeared ahead of me more quickly than I\u0027m used to, which was great.

But the idea is to escape its gravity as quickly as possible, which you do by moving back along the orbit because then Mun is obviously moving away from you. If you go straight up you\u0060ll stay in the gravity well longer and therefore you have to create more m/s yourself = you need more fuel. I just picked a number. You are using the map and stopping the burn when the periapsis hits Kerbin\u0060s atmosphere anyway right? I was just talking about escape vectors and not really the velocity of the lander.\n\nEdit: Just thought I\u0060d post this to demonstrate the concept. A short burst back along Mun\u0060s orbit and you make an apo, and naturally the peri is at the bottom of the well. Going in any other direction should require more fuel before the apo gets made, and they might not be this convenient if the burn starts circularizing the Kerbin orbit while you get away from Mun.\n\n![screenshot7_zpsgcphbfg5.png](http://i1026.photobucket.com/albums/y329/Benthuusi/screenshot7_zpsgcphbfg5.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T11:47:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 11:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fishslap","CreatedById":143204,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:48:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @Fishslap: Thanks for your detailed reply.

And you\u0060re right about the velocity to escape Mun. But I was talking about the speed you need in order to find a good peri on Kerbin. And again, you need to develop much less speed using your fuel if you go backward rather than forward because Mun just disappears along its orbit as soon as you throttle up. It is actually a very good idea to stay in orbits for a long time at first to experiment a little with the various angles you can use to leave. If you grab the central wheel you can move your maneuver node around the orbit to see where you get picked up. And a short burst from Mun\u0060s orbit will intersect with Kerbin only if you go backward. Straight down it\u0060s a medium burst, and you usually also have to build speed first to get picked up and then brake again after to shorten the peri. So you might actually end up with two medium bursts just to get home. And of course if you go the wrong way you\u0060re not very likely to make it back at all, at least not early on. You\u0060ll be tailed by Mun for ages before you can even find a peri on Kerbin. And then it might not even be deep. You can sometimes even find yourself in a circular orbit when you get free and have to again brake to cut an apsis down to reentry level. I think 30 degrees retrograde sounds right. But it depends on what you\u0060ve been doing on Mun and whether you have a circular orbit when leaving or not. You certainly don\u0060t want to waste fuel circularizing your Mun orbit before leaving. In the picture I posted above I came out at a somewhat inclined orbit and ended up tangential to Mun\u0060s orbit going outward, so it was certainly not perfect. But it was still only a 12 second burst with this lander: \n\n![screenshot6_zps8c1yaowz.png](http://i1026.photobucket.com/albums/y329/Benthuusi/screenshot6_zps8c1yaowz.png)\n\nAnyway, I guess you\u0060ve proven that taking off to the west is a bad idea then. Those numbers sound about as I expected, and it is certainly not for people running out of fuel at Mun... I\u0060m not aware of any reentry difference depending on which direction you\u0060re coming from though. Apparently there is more air resistance at the poles I am told - at least in real life - because cold air is more compressed than warm air (heat causes everything to expand/vaporize). What you say about the direction sort of makes sense though. I guess we\u0060ll have to study up and find out about it:)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T23:57:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fishslap**"}]}
