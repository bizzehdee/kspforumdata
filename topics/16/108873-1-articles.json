I send another probe to Minmus, this was to be put into orbit with an resource scanner and I had an old one on a probe. So I landed the old, added an KIS container instead.\n\nNow landing the new probe swap container for scanner with KIS, new launch flag is gone. Quit game and reloaded to just after landing probe.
