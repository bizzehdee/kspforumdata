Minmus is still traveling at around 270m/s around kerbin. If your doing a really high energy transfer your going almost strait up so thats 1km every 4 seconds tangental to your vector. If you spend enough dV to make the trip in 2 hours and align your vector dead center on where minus is now you\u0027ll most likely still miss the SOI by the time you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my own experience I generaly find the departure time for a high energy burn to minmus is prety close to the time you\u0027d leave for a hohman if you\u0027ve got a good TWR. The more energy you put into the transfer the more your vector deflects closer to minmus\u0027s current position. Its not quite 1:1 so you\u0027ll slide off target the faster you go but it will still get you prety close. delay the burn by a minute or so and give it a normal componant so your vector still crosses minus\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other trick is to look at your SOI departure from kerbin time. Minmus has about a 300 hour orbit give or take. Its orbit is also about 2/3 of the way to the SOI limit so you\u0027ll only be crossing its orbit a few hours before hiting the boundry if your going fast enough. for every hour to the SOI limit you need to aim for your vector crossing minmus about a degree or two ahead of it. Drop a node, give it as much dV as you wana devote to the outbound leg, aim your guestimate number of degrees ahead of minmus and give the node enough of a normal componant that your projected vector crosses minmus\u0027s orbital track and you should get an encounter. Play a bit with draging the node if need be and it should pop up eventualy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas a test case 3km/s burn from LKO well away from the AN/DN (so part of that is a normal componat) gets me about 6hours to kerbins SOI crossing minmus\u0027s orbit a about the 3 hour mark. Aiming 5-10 degrees ahead of minmus and I start geting encounters with minus. Departure time is a couple minutes after when a homan to minmus would burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T20:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t get closest approach markers on an escape trajectory, but you do get encounter markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to go to Mun or Minmus quickly, first launch the craft to roughly the same orbital plane as the target moon.

You may not have the closest approach thingy, but you will still see when you\u0027re projected to pass Minmus\u0027 SOI. If your initial burn went off well (high TWR helps a lot), that maneuver to regain an encounter shouldn\u0027t take more than a few m/s -- so there\u0027s only a limited number of possibilities to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproach 1a: Try to match planes with Minmus as close as possible before the initial burn. When trying to regain an encounter, you\u0027ll only have to explore two dimensions rather than three.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproach 2: just trust that your initial burn wasn\u0027t too far off and pull the brakes as you approach Minmus. Once your projected trajectory no longer leaves Kerbin, you\u0027ll be somewhere near Minmus and have your closest approach markers back. Proceed as usual. Should cost you perhaps one or two hours more, and an extra 500-1000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproach 2a: Put a maneuver node to where you will cross Minmus\u0027 path. That node doesn\u0027t need to do anything, it is just for timing purposes. At perhaps one hour before reaching that node (crossing the line), start thrusting sideways so that direction to target and target-relative prograde line up. Repeat in five-minute intervals. Again, this assumes that your initial burn wasn\u0027t too far off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T10:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi guys, many thanks for the feedback - you\u0027re all pretty much saying the same thing - drop a maneuver node down pull it out past minmus orbit until the part that intersects is the right time (using a 2nd maneuver node it should say how long before it takes to get to that point and then remove it) and then pull the node around kerbin until I get an encounter. I think this should work well for mun but for minmus I might have to launch my rescue vehicle in to an orbit which matches minmus\u0027 inclination first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for putting in an emergency hab system in orbit around minmus - that doesn\u0027t sound very kerbal but might implement that with excursions to duna or the jool system - having a spare habitation module ready and close by would be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn scifi films and books when going to another star they burn the engines constantly until they are halfway to the star system then turn around and then burn to start reducing their velocity - high dv, low duration flight. Would be interesting to see if I can get a minmus encounter which would take twice as long to get there (give or take a minute to turn around) as the burn takes. Then burn out would be pretty simple but then turning around and burning retrograde might change the orbit a great deal - perhaps I could use that burn to also pull my trajectory in close to the moon so I could hug the orbit in close to the ground and land - now that would be an epic mission! - a suicide burn starting halfway between minmus and kerbin!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T12:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA proper torch ship (continuous burns) requires an etremely high ISP.
