The reason being that the two booster design I use, as I said will get 30\u002B tonnes to LKO or 20 to the Mun. However, if I need to lift a bit more, all I have to do is go to the VAB, click on the radial decoupler connecting the booster stages and use 4x, or even 6x symmetry, and instantly I have a bigger rocket capable of lifting more.
