Otherwise, add one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rotation, large ships: Patience, even a small pod can rotate a jumbotank if you give it the time it needs. You will need to think ahead though, make maneuvers far ahead and hold that button for a minute on physical timewarp. If you are the kind of person that realises he has to flip his bunch of jumbo\u0027s 180 degrees in 20 seconds, this will not work for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it gets too big and slow, add one or a few big reaction wheels, they are very powerful. Again, just be patient and rotate carefully, you should not expect a big ship to rotate as fast and agile as small ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso make use of the thrust vectoring. Finish a maneuver node with a spin towards your next one or use a small low throttle burn to create angular movement. Turn off SAS and let it spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick is to asymmetrically disable some engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0027Extra\u0027 delta-V: You mean that delta-V you lost in the first place by adding mass? Remove it or replace the RCS tanks by fuel tanks and you\u0027ll go a lot further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fine tuning trajectory: This is indeed useful, but I do not think this is a must. If your TWR is low enough (disable engines?) you can fine tune interplanetary encounters just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Translation, small ships: Thinking ahead and quickly rotating \u002B doing small burns with the main engine can make RCS redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Translation, medium ships: This is THE perfect situation to use RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Translation, gigantic ships: Tons of RCS \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Ebe used, but I prefer swapping it out for control-grouped bipropellant engines facing forward and/or sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still a newb ... but a lot of what you said is along the same lines as what I was thinking.
