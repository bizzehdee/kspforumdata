Mostly because the transfer window was the next available. I sent two rockets, one with a lander/ascender, and one with a return transfer vehicle. Due to some piloting errors on my part, or maybe just the luck of the IEEE floating point math, the return vehicle ended up in an orbit with an inclination somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 degrees. I didn\u0027t look that close, but I believe that it\u0027s something like a BACKWARDS equatorial orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, two more ships have been dispatched, and are on their way, but because, you know, Moho, you can never really have enough dV, so I\u0027d like to salvage what is essentially a mostly-full big orange tank. The inclination change is extreme, though, so I\u0027m wondering what the most efficient way to do it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do it the \u0022normal\u0022 way, burning normal/antinormal at the AN or DN, or I could raise my orbit, and then do it at the Ap. Which would be more efficient? Does it matter?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T20:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoing it at apoapsis is more efficient, but not easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Moho is a horrid choice for a second planet to go to.

Where exactly is the return vehicle, in orbit of Kerbin, Moho, the Sun, where exactly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s in orbit of Kerbin, you could just launch to the west. The extra delta-V you\u0027d need is not that much all told. You\u0027d only be about thirty degrees or so off the inclination of the return vehicle but that\u0027s doable; far better than doing the 150.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I agree. If you\u0027ve done Duna, I might suggest either Gilly or Dres as a second manned interplanetary destination. Hell, you might even consider Ike.
