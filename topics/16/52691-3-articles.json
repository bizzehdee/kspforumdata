You have a vector going in the positive x direction at 10m/s. You have a vector 3m above that vector in positive y moving 15m/s in the positive x direction. You also have a vector 3 meters above the axis moving left in the negative x direction at 15 m/s.

Simple math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s make the negative x direction negative (for simplicity\u0027s sake, and it will also represent retrograde as it is going the opposite direction of our \u0022surface\u0022) and positive x positive (as well as prograde, going in the same direction as our surface). Our 10m/s vector is the \u0022surface\u0022 and moving 10m/s positive direction. Our next vector (one we want to match speeds with our surface) is moving 15m/s in the positive direction. How do we get to 10m/s? We add -5m/s (10 - 15 = -5). That\u0027s our change in velocity (delta v).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s do our other one now. We have 15m/s again but in the negative direction. So how do we go from -15 to \u002B10? Math again. 10 - (-15) = 25.

This is irrelevant though on planets with an atmosphere or very low surface speeds, as the atmosphere will change your velocity to the surface speed (it moves at the same speed as the surface) and low surface speeds won\u0027t matter too much (a surface moving at 1m/s won\u0027t make a big difference in your change in velocity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t understand this you might want to take a physics class.
