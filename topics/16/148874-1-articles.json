Re-entry is a balance between spending enough time in flight to slow down and not crash but getting down quick enough not to overheat. With long thin rockets with heat shields, a shallow entry from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to work, but with planes this seems a recipe for firey death. If I have s space plane, say a Mk2 based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, how should I attempt re-entry? What\u0027s a good height for PE after a de-orbit burn? Should I fly with a nose up attitude for maximum drag or a more straight on approach to get down to the high drag/high lift thicker atmosphere quicker to minimize time spent getting hot? Do radiator panels make a difference to survivability? Help greatly received\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T23:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNose-first concentrates heat on just a few parts and will incinerate your craft. Come in with the belly of the plane facing prograde to maximize braking drag and distribute heat. Radiators don\u0027t help much because they draw most strongly from the parts they are connected to, but would be destroyed if you put them on the parts getting hot during a re-entry. As for a periapsis to aim for, I don\u0027t think it matters that much as long as you don\u0027t to come down too radically fast. I generally put mine between 32kms and 50kms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-29T02:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want something that can pull a 40 degree\u002B \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E (and then pull out of the stall once the thermal loading drops enough (1.5km/s orbital) that you can just glide...).
