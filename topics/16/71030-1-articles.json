Eve isn\u0027t an option because of the high gravity, but Dres and Moho are probably do-able. What would you guys suggest?

You can get a fairly substantial number of science points just by flying past each of the 5 moons, and perhaps landing on Vall, Bop and Poll (smaller than Tylo, no atmosphere like Laythe). For the most part it\u0027s also closer than Eeloo, if not in distance in terms of dV because of the possibility of aerobraking on arrival at Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking outwards:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho: Worth going to just to say \u0022I went to Moho\u0022.
