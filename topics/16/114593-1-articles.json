It appears to me that vessel battery charge is not simulated while I am piloting another craft using time acceleration (which is most of time allowing for the acceleration). After I thought about it I\u0027ve concluded that perhaps this is a deliberate optimisation to avoid slowing the engine down. Am I correct about this effect?\n\nIt may be a bit of a bore to have to sit there watching a huge battery slowly charge up (for long night locations) if I notice that it\u0027s low; is there a mod that improves this otherwise unexpected behaviour?\n\nThe next thing that occurred to me was to wonder about researching in the sci lab. I think it continues regardless which is convenient. Am I right about this or have I simply not been paying enough attention to the research level?\n\nDoes this sort of behaviour impact anything else of importance?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nRichard\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T22:16:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:07:26Z","Content":"In general, most things in the game turn off completely when a vessel is \u0022on rails\u0022 (i.e. isn\u0027t the currently piloted vessel, or within a small radius of it). Examples:\n\n- Heat doesn\u0027t radiate or build up\n\n- Electrical power stops (both production and consumption)\n\nThere are a few specific things that *do* continue in the background. Examples include resource mining and science lab research.\n\nAs to \u0022why is it this way\u0022: It used to be that *everything* stopped when not in focus. With 1.0, a few new features were added that are time-based (e.g. resource mining and the new science lab mechanics), and for time-based features to work sanely, they need to continue working in the background. But the overall game wasn\u0027t overhauled to cover everything.\n\n(And that\u0027s not just an oversight. There are some things that would be hard to model when on rails, for example heat flow, since that would suck up memory \u0026 CPU.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:09:55Z","Content":"When you are piloting another vessel, everything else is \u0022on rails\u0022. This means other vessels will not gain or lose electric charge, or heat. The science lab works somewhat differently, as it\u0027s progress is tracked separately and the lab is updated to the expected science amount when you return to the vessel. \n\nThe exception to this may be vessels that are within physics range, but I\u0027m not positive.\n\nToo slow."},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:16:39Z","Content":"Thanks for the fast replies; this is something for me to bear in mind to make sure the batteries are fully charged well in advance of a night-time excursion\n\nThanks,\n\nRichard"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T14:28:53Z","Content":"this is obviously ripe for abuse.
