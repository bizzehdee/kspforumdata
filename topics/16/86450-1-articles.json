Due to the orbital insertion burn necessarily being done in space, orbital spaceplanes require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA difference between rocket based and air-breathing aerospace plane launch systems is that aerospace plane designs typically include minimal oxidizer storage for propulsion. Air-breathing aerospace plane designs include engine inlets so they can use atmospheric oxygen for combustion. Since the mass of the oxidizer is, at takeoff, the single largest mass of most rocket designs (the Space Shuttle\u0027s liquid oxygen tank weighs 629,340 kg, more than one of its solid rocket boosters), this provides a huge potential weight savings benefit. However, air breathing engines are usually very much heavier than rocket engines and the empty weight of the oxidiser tank, and since, unlike oxidiser, this extra weight (which is not expended to add kinetic energy to the vessel, as is propellant mass) must be carried into space it may offset the overall system performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to note that mass fraction is an important concept in the engineering of a rocket. However, mass fraction may have little to do with the costs of a rocket, as the costs of fuel are very small when compared to the costs of the engineering program as a whole.

Airplanes needs insane amounts of delta-v to work against drag, but it is not so bad for overall economy, because they have huge ISP values. Boeing 747 (one version) have 4*260 kN = 1040 kN thrust. I do not know, but if I assume that it needs half of that during a cruise flight, it uses about 6 km/s dv per hour of flight (I assumed mass of 300 t, about half between empty mass and maximum takeoff mass). Intercontinental flight takes easily more dv than return trip to any planet in the Solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T14:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWings will have L/D ratios well over 1:1, some above 20:1, but for a spaceplane, its probably going to be more like 5:1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means for every 5 kN of lift they generate, they\u0027d generate 1 kN of drag.
