so if you change the attitude, the craft won\u0027t shift it\u0027s momentum instantaneously.\u00A0 If you pitch up abruptly, now you\u0027re changing the airflow from impacting the nose head-on, to now impacting the belly of the plane, changing the entire underside into one massive draggy airbrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If you\u0027re not accelerating fast enough, your TWR is too low and you\u0027re expending too much fuel while you try to speed up.\u00A0 Add more thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If your velocity vector (little airplane symbol on your navball) hangs out below your nose watermark (center of the navball), you don\u0027t have enough lift for how much weight your spaceplane has.\u00A0 You keep your nose high to maintain\u00A0a constant flight path, meaning a portion of your engine thrust is being used\u00A0for lift.\u00A0 The underside is now producing excess drag, and your engines aren\u0027t thrusting in-line with your flight path.\u00A0 Not efficient at all, add more lift-producing surfaces.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If you need to constantly have \u0022pitch up\u0022 input to prevent the nose from sinking, your Center-of-Lift (CoL) is too far behind your Center-of-Mass (CoM).\u00A0 Your tail control surfaces (or forward canards) are now deflecting into the airstream just to keep your nose up, producing excess drag.\u00A0 Readjust your design so the CoL is just slightly behind CoM.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Drain your fuel tanks in the SPH while you have the CoL and CoM markers enabled.\u00A0 Watch how far the CoM drifts forward or back.\u00A0 This is important.\u00A0 Just because your craft flies good with full tanks, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027ll fly right at the end of the mission when you\u0027re trying to land.\u00A0 Mount the majority of your expendables (fuel, monopropellant, cargo/payload) as close or as evenly-placed in front and behind the CoM as possible.\u00A0 This will keep the Center-of-Mass\u00A0from drifting throughout the flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Main landing gear placement is one of the most overlooked design features on spaceplanes/aircraft.\u00A0 It should be just aft of the CoM so that the craft can rotate during takeoff.\u00A0 Too far back and the plane won\u0027t be able to takeoff until it shoots off the end of the runway;

I then start using more AOA to get as high as possible while avoiding the transonic region. \u00A0It\u0027s a compromise between \u00A0getting drag from excessive AOA and drag from encroaching sound barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. eventually you find yourself in \u0022coffin corner\u0022 where you can\u0027t get sufficient lift without either excessive AOA or exceeding 280m/s, then i go prograde and try to accelerate to 400m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. if you make it while still being reasonably high up ( above 7km), you\u0027ve probably got it made right now.
