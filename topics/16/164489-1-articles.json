Since your ore tanks are full, maybe just leave one drill running while you\u0027re off doing something else. That should be enough to keep the ore rolling in while your converter works on the ore you already have. The thermal control systems are great, to me, because they take heat from anywhere on the ship. They don\u0027t have to be near the heat-source. And they work better than radiators.
