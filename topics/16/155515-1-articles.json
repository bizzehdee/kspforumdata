That would be the first thing to check. My experience has generally been positive though, I can usually tell quite accurately if my landing is\u00A0going to result in deadly confetti or not before the wheels touch down. Being a pilot, I can only assume I don\u0027t need to talk to you about the speed and approach for a landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that leaves only one thing beyond the impact tolerance: As much as I love KSP, it\u0027s not necessarily the best collision\u00A0simulator, especially when large numbers are at work both for vertical and horizontal speeds.
