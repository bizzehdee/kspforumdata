I am trying to fly to the Mun, so I create a maneuver, zoom out so I can see the Mun, then try to adjust the maneuver so I get an encounter with a close encounter periapsis. If I zoom out so I can see both Kerbin and Mun, the icons are so small that it is difficult to select them, I often grab the wrong one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to make this easier?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a way to disable for instance flags from the map, so I don\u0027t target them and not the maneuver when trying to manupulate it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there some advanced tutorials for maneuvers available somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no problems with simple maneuvers such as Hohman transfers, but could use some help with more complex stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any help you can give a fellow astronaut \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T11:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can enable/disable Flags/Debris/Bases/etc. in a small menu that pops up top center if you point your mouse there in map view.
