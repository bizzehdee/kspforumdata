The reason is the during the burn your orbit steadily shifts towards the ideal ejection path and your TWR increases. At some point starting a burn earlier than node time results in an ejection angle that EXACTLY match the ideal ejection angle and that\u0027s what you want. Of course under this condition although your ejection angle is exactly correct you will be displaced position-wise from the ideal instant velocity change orbit. But we\u0027re talking about a change in position on the order of kilometers over a trip that will take months so it\u0027s trivial to correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hard part is to work out the correct time split. The burn definitely start later than the 50/50 burn time but the exact timing is different for each ship and probably different again even for the same ship but different burn lengths.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThink about it this way: if you want to go to another planet and transfer window is here, you ideally want an instantaneous velocity change relative to Kerbin\u0027s orbit around Kerbol in prograde or retrograde direction. But even if you have a magic engine that could give you this instant change in velocity you still do not do the burn exactly at Kerbin midnight or Kerbin midday because as you coast your way out of Kerbin SOI Kerbin\u0027s gravity will curve your path so that it starts to deviate from the ideal Kerbin-Kerbol prograde or retrograde direction. So instead you do your burn earlier, somewhere around the Kerbin terminator to compensate for Kerbin\u0027s gravity bending your flight path.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSplit burn around the node is the same idea. you start your burn earlier than the ideal ejection angle suggests to compensate for Kerbin bending your path while your engines fire.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe most extreme example of this idea is the spiral orbit:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022spiral-orbits-spacecraft.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/spiral-orbits-spacecraft.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere you have an engine that has a TWR so low it needs MONTHS to complete the interplanetary ejection burn. So what you do is point your ship prograde several month before the transfer window and fire up the engine. As you engine fire over the month you slowly build up velocity and spiral out in an ever wider orbit until you finally build up enough velocity to escape the SOI right as the transfer window arrive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not hard to work out how long you need to fire your engine for to get escape velocity.

If you can perfectly calculate your delta-V for every mission with little fuel wasted (whether by hand or by mod), then you may not have a use for a place to stash\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esurplus\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fuel left over after launch or at the end of a mission. If your ships never have an emergency that requires you to quickly deliver them fuel before they crash into the Mun or get ejected from the system, then sure, you won\u0027t need that fuel stash around the Mun. If every new craft design you come up with works perfectly on the first go, then you wouldn\u0027t see any benefit from having a single design fine-tuned for efficiently launching to a\u00A0station at a known and practiced orbit,\u00A0at which point it can be refueled for the rest of its journeys elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf all of those conditions describe you, then you won\u0027t benefit from having\u00A0a space station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, actually, my ships always do work the 1st time and never run low on fuel.\u00A0 It\u0027s not hard to do this.\u00A0 If you\u0027re having trouble with it, you should work on your basic design and navigation skills instead of using a station as a crutch for the underlying problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel is actually pretty cheap to buy compared to the income you make from contracts, to the point that by about 1/2way through the tech tree, your money worries should be permanently over.\u00A0 You can then\u00A0start doing things that don\u0027t even earn any contract income and still have plenty in the bank, plus more income coming in from contracts.\u00A0 There is thus zero financial incentive to set up a refueling system in the Kerbin system, especially because the ore-related parts are fairly far up the tech tree, after you\u0027ve reached this state of being independently wealthy.\u00A0 And certainly if you\u0027re not solvent, you\u0027ll never save enough money on fuel to even pay off the set-up cost of a refueling system, let alone save enough on fuel to get youself solvent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there you are.\u00A0 No financial benefit to\u00A0a fuel\u00A0station (and in fact it becomes a permanent drain on income if you use life support, due to the necessity of resupply missions).\u00A0 And as already discussed, mobile labs have been rendered pretty much useless since their\u00A0single useful feature (resetting Goo and Materials) has been taken over by scientists and their ability to farm science is pathetic.\u00A0 Thus, in practical game terms, there is no reason to build a station in Kerbin\u0027s SOI on your own initiative.\u00A0 Now, if a well-paying contract wants one, go for it, and maybe even make some use of it yourself.\u00A0 But if you don\u0027t have a \u0022build a station\u0022 contract, then the only reason to build one yourself is because you think it\u0027s cool, accepting that it\u0027s a waste of your time and money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222326132\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128002\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450338686\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Atlas2342\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Atlas2342 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m playing sandbox and for the sake of achievement, I want to put my station there.
