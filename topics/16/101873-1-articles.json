And that is a thing that is not physically possible in KSP (or IRL either). When you think about it, an orbit is not actually around the planet, but around the CENTER OF MASS of the planet, which is for this purpose identical to the CENTER. So you can\u0027t be having a flat orbit that sits on the poles like a"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T11:35:14Z","Content":"An orbit will always have to pass over the \u0022middle\u0022 of a parent body.
