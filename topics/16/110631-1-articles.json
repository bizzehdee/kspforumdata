Now i want to and i dont see them anymore...\n\nDo you guys have an idea to get them back?\n\nThanks in adcance!"},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T18:38:46Z","Content":"What do you mean, you\u0027ve never done a rescue contract!? I\u0027ve staffed my entire program with rescued kerbals; much cheaper than recruiting them! I even had to upgrade the astronaut complex to fit them all in.\n\nI don\u0027t know why those contract aren\u0027t being offered. I believe some contract offerings and/or their rewards depend on reputation. Maybe you need good rep to be offered rescue contracts?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:01:10Z","Content":"Yeah I know, pretty stupid I found out just a while ago pretty far in my carreer. \n\nI\u0027ve good reputation, so that isn\u0027t the point.. maybe it is because I ignored them all the time? But the question is how to get them back"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T08:10:41Z","Content":"If you decline enough contracts, I\u0027m sure there will be some new rescue missions available at some point. They might not be as easy as rescuing from low Kerbin orbit, but they\u0027ll be available."}]}
