I\u0027ve been trying to build one capable of getting the classic orange tank to 100KM LKO. I\u0027d like a reusable launch vehicle for larger payloads for interplanetary missions. But so far I haven\u0027t had any luck. Building SSTO\u0027s I can do. But after a certain point It takes more fuel to just get the added weight of that fuel into space that it just no longer is capable of SSTO, my current design is a delta wing bi-plane design with 7 turbo jets and 2 rockets. It gets to 1200m/s at around 20KM but then fails to lift that last bit into orbit when I switch to the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/mdgo8zh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mdgo8zhl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mdgo8zhl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Vgsp6hT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vgsp6hTl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vgsp6hTl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anyone have any ideas, advice or screenshots of their working B9 heavy SSTO?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gauss H2K","CreatedById":67066,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T08:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAren\u0027t the B9 SABREs essentially made for SSTO\u0027s? Why not use them, and save some weight since those turbojets become dead weight after 20km, and the rockets are deadweight before that. Also you might try adding more intakes, 20km is high, but not high enough. I would also aim for 1.4-1.5 km/s at 25km before switching to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T16:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a thread of my SSTOs, most of which are using B9 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56945-Hodo-Creations-SSTO-craft-designs-and-files-for-those-who-want-them\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56945-Hodo-Creations-SSTO-craft-designs-and-files-for-those-who-want-them\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here are some of my older still functional Heavy lifters using B9 parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESP-400A\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eover 60 ton lift capacity (2 orange tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/InqsB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is finding that balance point for the cargo, and managing to get it to fit. The power is the easy part, most of my SSTOs that I have made have a TWR of over 1.5:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use SABRES, they are good, but really not that efficient. For long haul cargo runs I actually make sure to only use the SABRE rocket to push it to orbital speeds after that I turn it off. Most of my earlier SSTOs didn\u0027t use SABREs. Tubrojets are fine up to mach 3.5\u002B then they start to die off. So the trick is to get up to around 25km, slowly while accelerating as fast as you can. Most of my ascents take upwards of 10mins, I climb out of the lower thick atmosphere as fast as possible, usually at 45deg nose up, once I am at 12-15km I bring the nose down to 20deg and continue to accelerate until I hit 25km. If I have designed the aircraft right it should get to mach 5 before I have to switch over to rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer LV-Ns for the boost stage if possible, but you can use what ever is lightest and most efficient. LV-Ns are heavy and weak but great for fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T16:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
