SInce they are classified as lost kermans... does that mean they are permanently dead? and if they are... is there any way to bring them back from the dead? I really dont want to create new planes and ships just because I didnt know of the reprocussions in this update. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Starsy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T02:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen your persistence file (Notepad is fine) and scroll down to the end of it.

I was about to say that that feature of the update would be kind of brutal in sandbox mode, (though In career mode, I wouldnt mind permadeath, it would encourage Testing your rockets with sattelites like the Stayputnik instead of Using Kerbans as Guinea pigs\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T05:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, Harvester posted in another thread that they\u0027d added a \u0027difficulty toggle setting\u0027 as to if dead kerbals come back or not. It defaults to on, and there\u0027s no UI for the toggle at the moment, so they\u0027ll come back on their own at some point in time without doing anything.

By default it is set to allow. I may be reading it wrong but it only seems to be there for Jeb, Bill and Bob, so if you kill any of the new applicants, it\u0027s possible that may be permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems to be keeping track of achievements.
