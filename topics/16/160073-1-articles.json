The Communotron-16, however, is not very powerful. In fact, it is the weakest antenna in the game. The HG-5 is slightly better, but not by much on the scales of space. The two of them just don\u0027t have the power to hear each other across that kind of distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your low orbit spacecraft also had a HG-5 instead of a Communotron-16, then you would have 5,000,000 meters of effective range between two HG-5 endpoints, and you could talk to your orbiting constellation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-02T11:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2017 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volodyuka","CreatedById":57842,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T12:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I see, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
