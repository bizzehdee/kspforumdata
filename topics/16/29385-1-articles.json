Then press F5 to quicksave. Then, backup your persistence file in case you mess up, and then open the quicksave file. Look for your failed lander in the quicksave.sfs (use ctrl\u002Bf!) and copy ALL of the information about its position, speed, etc. (you don\u0027t have to copy the stuff with the parts and stuff). Then, find the lander on the launchpad and put the data of the failed lander into that one. Then, go back to the failed lander and edit it slightly. After that, save that and then, in KSP, press F9 to quickload and the successful lander \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be where your failed lander was, assuming you did it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T22:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds exactly like kerbal engineering to me.
