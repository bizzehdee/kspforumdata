After a fairly long time tweaking things in the SPH and numerous unsuccessful test flights, I managed to make a shuttle that performed pretty well. It consisted of a launch stage with 2 S1 SRB-KD25k\u0027s radially mounted to an orange tank, which fed fuel into my shuttle. The shuttle has 3 LV-T45\u0027s (2 firing initially and a third for when the SRB\u0027s finish burning to balance the thrust vector). The shuttle was fairly small (Mk 2 parts), had a small cargo bay and a small monopropelant tank for completing my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting a small satellite in orbit from the cargo bay, costs me about 25,000 funds (it could be reduced by taking fuel out of the orange tank as I have a fair bit more delta-V than I need). By comparison, I could mount the satellite to a rocket and get it into orbit for maybe 5,000 funds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a reason that the shuttle option is so expensive? I\u0027m guessing fuel may be disproportionately expensive when compared to engines. Obviously, the main difference is that I am putting an entire spaceplane into orbit compared to just a satellite, but I thought the whole point of the shuttle was to make the expensive stuff reusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure people have managed to make KSP shuttles that have a much better economic efficiency than mine, but I don\u0027t see how you could even come close to making up the cost difference between a shuttle and a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T13:52:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rusty6899\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T17:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs that after the 100% recovery from landing on the runway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T17:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn short, yes, space shuttles are really a terrible idea for economic efficiency - the cost of two of those SRBs - never mind ditching the orange tank - makes it not worth while.
