I\u0027ve been rubbing them together for ages, and still no fire. I\u0027m curious as to whether anybody else has had this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESilly to ask, but senior docking ports will docking with other senior docking ports, yes? Are they unidirectional? (ie: maybe I mounted them incorrectly?) If so, how on earth do you tell?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something obvious I\u0027m missing? There doesn\u0027t seem to be the magnetic \u0027snap\u0027 of the other docking ports, which suggests that this may be a bug? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Before anybody asks, there\u0027s nothing wrong with my docking technique, they were quite literally touching, parallel, etc etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T00:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are working fine for me.
