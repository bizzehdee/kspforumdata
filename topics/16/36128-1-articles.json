KSP uses the Time version, so the specific impulse of our engines is measured in Seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA higher specific impulse value means that the engine will produce more Delta-V from a given amount of propellant, which is actually far more important than the consumption rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe propellents tab is the RATIO in which each is consumed.

It\u0027s especially confusing in the case of the Ion Engines, which lists consumption values of 12 electricity and 0.1 xenon: like the liquidengines it\u0027s actually just a ratio.
