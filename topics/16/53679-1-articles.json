Generally, you either want to come out of an encounter prograde, retrograde, or either of those two with a bit of inclination (although gravity assists for plane changes require even more timing). This also means it can be beneficial to come into an encounter at an angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, you want to get those encounters without burning much fuel, and this is where the manoeuvre nodes come into play. Target the planet you want to slingshot off, and note how far away the position indicators are. Then place a node after the encounter with 0 delta-v, this makes the target system show what happens after one orbit. If the position indicators are still not close enough to get an encounter with a small burn, place another node between the last node and the encounter. The node will (hopefully) go onto the previous node\u0027s orbit and make the target system show the positions after two orbits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep doing this until you\u0027re satisfied with the closeness of the positions, burn a little to get a good encounter, then either repeat or burn to your final destination. Eve is handy for assists as it\u0027s the most massive inner planet, but be careful not to hit the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turvok","CreatedById":60891,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Supernovy. That helps that it is possible.
