You need to download a lot of mods to make RSS work. Get Realism Overhaul and the other required mods (real fuels, engine pack for real fuels \u002B a lot of different engines, stretchy tanks, kerbal joint reinforcement, etc). It will take a while to figure this all out because you basically need to relearn the game.
