I\u0027m more or less folllowing one of the Modular Base Building tutorials like on YouTube. \u00A0 I gave up try to use the \u0022bottom carrier\u0022 style of.rover since I experienced very strange (and violent! ) problems involving try to position the rover underneath a Base tube payload. Maybe this worked OK on previous KSP version but on the latest version I would experience explosive part collision effects where the tube would blow up into the air, the moment when the rover was underneath the power dock port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - I switched to another\u00A0method involving a pair of small 4-wheel rovers which can dock to the sides of components (using Dock Jrs) and carry parts around with legs up. These rovers are used in pairs. \u00A0 They also click together using their back dock ports to form a larger 8 wheel rover. Which I\u0027ve found can move just about anything!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I am finding it impossible to connect these two rovers together in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or SPA build editors. The editor does not always seem to recognise the docking JR points as valid attachment points. \u00A0 I was able to attach Rover1 to a small Base node part (basically an OCT2 with Docking Jr\u0027s at both top and bottom ends). But attempts to load/merge Rover 2 and have it attach to the other side of the Base Node all fail.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strange thing is in the tutorial videos this all seems fairly easy and trivial. Has something changed since 2014 so that Dock ports are problematic attachment points in the build editor. Or is their some other technique or editor command I\u0027m not using correctly here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try to supply screen shots when I\u0027m back on my Home PC (typing this now on my cellphone)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJ Stevenson\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get your Ass to Dooon-ah\u0022. - Arnold Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThreePounds","CreatedById":116058,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-07T19:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a fairly long post and I have trouble understanding what exactly your issue is? I suspect it\u0027s the sub assemblies not attaching correctly? For some strange reason there are two methods in KSP to get to vessels to stick together: Merge and sub assemblies. Both function somewhat differently and have their own quirks and are confusing to use at the beginning. Here is how they work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMerge: You can only merge and attach a vessel correctly if the root part can be attached. From my experience it\u0027s best to have an open node on the part you want the other vessel to attach. Make that your root part. Load the second vessel, then merge the first and attach it. I currently can\u0027t remember if you can surface attach merge too, I have to try that out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSub assembly: The quirk of this method is that you can\u0027t save the root part as part of the sub assembly. So if you want to save an entire vessel, you have to attach a dummy part to the node you want the attachment to happen, make that the root part and then save the rest. You can then load your second vessel and attach the sub assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I said, this feature of KSP is quite confusing to use. So if you\u0027re still having trouble, you can share the craft file with me and I make some screen shots or a short video for you showing you what I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JStevenson","CreatedById":176292,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-08T03:21:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your advice.\u00A0 I actually do have a screenshot but haven\u0027t figured out how to attach it to a post here!\u00A0\u00A0 Anyways, the basic problem is I can\u0027t get my two rovers to \u0022stick together\u0022 via their attachment nodes (all are Docking Port Jrs).\u00A0 Even though this works fine in live running tests.\u00A0 I\u0027m simply trying to figure out a safe way to package two of these bad boys in a single payload to send to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-08T06:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223167707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504840893\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176292\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JStevenson\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, JStevenson said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe basic problem is I can\u0027t get my two rovers to \u0022stick together\u0022 via their attachment nodes (all are Docking Port Jrs).\u00A0 Even though this works fine in live running tests.\u00A0 I\u0027m simply trying to figure out a safe way to package two of these bad boys in a single payload to send to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you load a sub-assembly it will only attach using the part that was designated its root part. If you want to save the rover as a sub-assembly that will attach using the Docking Port Jr. then you need to use the \u0022Re-Root\u0022 tool to designate the Docking Port Jr. as the root part before you save it as a sub-assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the \u0022Re-Root\u0022 tool is a little tricky. It\u0027s the zig-zag line icon to the right of the \u0022Rotate\u0022 gizmo at the top of the editor. Once you select the \u0022Re-Root\u0022 tool you will need to click once on your rover model, then click on the part of that model that you want to become the new root part - your docking port in this case. The rover should reorient itself to show that it now has a new root orientation. Then, open your sub-assembly pane, click on the new root part (the docking port) and move your rover over to the sub-assembly drop zone and save it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, when you select the rover from the sub-assembly list it will attach using the docking port to any available end-node on the ships you are editing. For future reference, there are several parts that\u00A0 cannot be used as root parts. Radial decouplers are the most frustrating, they can\u0027t be used as a root part, but in-line decouplers can be. Any item that can\u0027t be the first part used to start construction also won\u0027t work; like parachutes and ladders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-08T06:35:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2017 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-20T14:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe-root. ^^^^^ !\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
