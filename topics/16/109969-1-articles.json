I looked around the wiki and in the cfg file, and it seems that it\u0027s designed to be that way (the atmCurve goes down very quickly.) It\u0027s low on the tech tree, so my question is, what exactly can I use the basic jet engine for in early career?\n\nInitially, I thought it was designed for all of those Kerbin survey contracts, but they all want an altitude reading at like 18km\u002B or so, which seems impossible to reach with a basic plane (okay, I know it\u0027s not impossible according to some challenge posts, but it\u0027s very hard for new players like myself.) For parts testing, it\u0027s just so much easier to put them on liquid fuel rockets.\n\nThe only use I\u0027ve found for it so far is strapping one to my makeshift rover (made it with the cheap landing wheels since real rover wheels are higher up on the tech tree) and drive around KSC for science. Saves me a lot of fuel compared to an equivalent rocket-powered rover.\n\nI think it does provide a nice educational value about how (hard it is) to design planes, but it just doesn\u0027t seem to help with any in-game contracts or goals. So, what am I missing?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T18:10:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by simsatellite**"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Jim","CreatedById":142312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:15:10Z","Content":"I used it for short range (same continent as base) surveys in flight that specify \u0022below\u0022 a certain altitude.
