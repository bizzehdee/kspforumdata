Might need to set your mouse to have a right and left click. \n\nOh a little prob I had with my Mac. F5 for quicksave and F9 for quick load requires three keys. Control , Alt and the F(x). The wiki at the top of the forums has a lot of helpful info also. Enjoy and good luck on your first Mun landing."},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T07:16:03Z","Content":"Control \u002B click is the default equivalent of right click. That will work for you but don\u0027t forget left control is throttle down by default... For mine I have it set up so that click on the trackpad with one finger is left click, two fingers is right click."},{"CreatedByName":"ToneStack","CreatedById":142969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T03:41:48Z","Content":"Thank you very much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Thrust keyboard conflict was the reason right click didn\u0027t work.

From the preceding posts, the answers to these questions are not clear:\n\n1. Is \u0022right-click\u0022 the only way to get context menus, or are there other ways to do it? (other ways that are, perhaps, more accessible to one-button mouse users?)\n\n2. Is ctrl-click on a Mac expected to open context menus in KSP (albeit with the undesired byproduct of reducing the throttle)? Or is it not expected to work at all? I tried it, and it didn\u0027t seem to work at all.\n\n3. ToneStack solved the problem by changing right-click to two-finger-click. I assume that only works for touch pad users. Is there also a good solution for mouse users?\n\nI have a two-button mouse, but I\u0027m playing the game with my nephew, who is using a one-button mouse -- he\u0027s the one who needs help. He somehow built a plane with inverted control surfaces, and we need the part context menu to fix that. I\u0027d be grateful if someone could post a solution easy enough for a nine-year-old.\n\n-TC"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:08:40Z","Content":"On a mac you can set a right click, look in mouse options, even a one button mouse like my magic mouse, it just reacts to top right corner as right click. The only extra key you need in the VAB is the alt/option key, that is the mac \u0027hotkey\u0027 and then it plays like normal, but better scrolling."}]}
