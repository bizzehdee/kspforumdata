However as a starting point, the VAB allows construction of a craft which extends from top (ceiling) to floor. On the launch pad, we can think of this as the altitude of the top of the craft, which is about 148 meters. Since the launch pad elevation is about 70 meters, the difference of 78 meters would be \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E height of the inside of the VAB. Perhaps the SPH length has a similar dimension.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are tricks to allow a craft to extend further (into the VAB floor), and you might be wanting some similar trick for the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECamera restrictions seem limited to within the assembly buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck on your project!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T20:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the XL Girder is ~3meters (There\u0027s no length given) then the SPH very roughly 100m long, as I\u0027ve built a structure ~30 such girders long.
