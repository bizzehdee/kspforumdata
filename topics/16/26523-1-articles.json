I rarely see temps over 4k. Another problem i have is the inflatable heat shield flipping me over when the drag gets high enough. By reentering between the 25 - 30 km range, ive found that yes, i do still flip over, but only after i have slowed down enough not to torch my kerbals. At that point i cut the thing loose and get the chutes out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T20:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022skipping back into space\u0022 concern exists in real life because most capsules only have a limited amount of time that their life support systems will keep the crew alive.

Therefore the water\u0027s presence is in fact *causing* the stone to bounce upward, imparting a force upward on the stone (and not just drag in the retrograde direction, but in fact a force that is actually upward). This is a terrible, terrible analogy if what\u0027s actually happening in shallow re-entries is that the air exerted no upward force whatsoever on the craft and instead exerted entirely retrograde force only on the craft (drag), and the air is not the slightest bit responsible for making the craft go back up into orbit at all, but rather the craft would have done that anyway and the air just failed to prevent it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater *causes* a skipping stone to bounce upward.

If you were too hot for too long it would deplete the material and it would fail. If you entered too steeply the peak temperature or peak G would be too high and it would fail.

As far as I can tell it just has a temperature and no durability so the goal is to keep the stress on the shield low and make the duration as long as possible.

They are designed to produce lift when re-entering, and while they are designed to fly at their best at very high ultra-sonic speeds, they completely stall only slightly above Mach 1 (at trans-sonic speeds). When the capsule is tilted in the right direction (thanks to RCS thrusters), it acts as a wing : air pressure is higher on the heatshield, and lower above the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom Wikipedia :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn practice, capsules do create a significant and useful amount of lift. This lift is used to control the trajectory of the capsule. This controls allows for reduced g-forces for the crew, as well as reducing the peak heat transfer into the capsule. The longer the vehicle spends at high altitude, the thinner the air is and the less heat is conducted. For example the Apollo capsule had a lift to drag ratio of about 0.35. In the absence of any lift the Apollo capsule would be subjected to about 20g deceleration (8g for low-earth-orbiting spacecraft), but with lift the trajectory can be kept to around 4g.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when the capsule \u0022skips\u0022 the atmosphere, lift is produced, and not only drag. Of course nothing can produce more lift than drag (else we wouldn\u0027t need engines !), but the effect is significant enough to greatly bend the trajectory of the spacecraft. This, combined with the slingshot effect, can be a one-way ticket when re-entering from lunar velocities (roughly 10,500 m/s vs \u0022only\u0022 7,500 m/s for a LEO return). And to escape Earth SOI, you don\u0027t need to go much faster than 11,000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spherical capsule (like Vostok) produces no lift at all, and only drag, typically getting 8-9g on re-entry. There is also a safety mode on the Soyuz that, if the other controls fail, make the capsule automatically spin on itself at a fast rate, which nullifies lift. This is called a \u0022ballistic reentry\u0022, and the spacecraft decelerates exactly like a spherical capsule in that case. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_TMA-11\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESoyuz TMA-11\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E re-entered that way, and was nearly 500 kilometers off-target, because of the lack of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T23:44:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by N_Molson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T00:02:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso with Deadly re-entry you have to take re-entry speed into account.
