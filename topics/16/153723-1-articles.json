I thought it might have something to do with facing, some of my components are upside-down and others are manually rotated afterwards (I was experimenting with an appollo-like dedicated lander stage that needed a stack separator and had to do an in-space rearrangement to get all the pieces aligned properly). But I flipped the one piece I know is backwards (the fuel tank for the lander engine) and nothing changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?
