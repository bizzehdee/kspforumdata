I suspect that adding winglets would help a lot. Might as well remove the RCS too. Also having the reaction wheels on the centercore would probably help, rather than dropping them with the boosters. Asparagus staging can in itself introduce spinning, the reaction wheels probably simply weren\u0027t enough for the SAS to control the rocket.
