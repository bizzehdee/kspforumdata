It would require decades of KSP play time to wear the drive out; browser caches probably write more to the drive in a day than KSP does, but nobody worries about that.\n\n(Disclaimer: technically there is an upper limit to the number of writes an SSD can perform, but they\u0027re getting very advanced with wear-levelling and redundant capacity and error inspection and reporting, and by and large you\u0027ll have gotten rid of the drive long before it wears out.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T15:13:47Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew**\n  \ngrammar..."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T04:33:52Z","Content":"If you\u0027re on Windows:\n\nMove (don\u0027t copy) your savegame folder where you want it.

I\u0027ve had an SSD for 2 years, which gets about 20-30GB written to it daily (system hibernate mostly), and shows no errors or signs of failure. Kerbal save files are rarely more than 10MB, and autosaves every 5 minutes lead to about 120MB per hour. Even at 24 hours per day, this is 2.8GB, and well within the drive\u0027s rewrite specification. Windows likely does more write activity with the swap file than KSP will in a typical day, but you\u0027d be a to *not* have swap on SSD.\n\nPeople saying \u0022Oh, but SSDs wear out\u0022 is the equivalent of \u0022Oh, I bet your Ferrari needs a lot more fuel than my Tata Nano\u0022 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:29:37Z","Content":"thanks for the answers, its good to know there is nothing to worry about ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI may try it anyway next time, just to see if it works."}]}
