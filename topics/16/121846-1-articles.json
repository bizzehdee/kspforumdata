After doing a few other missions, and therefore warping time a little, I realised the probe orbiting Bop was gone. Due to the shape of Bop, I assumed that the map view did not correspond to the actual surface (like Gilly) and that the probe crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore recently in my RSS save, I put a probe in very low orbit around the Moon (50x15km), and the same thing happened: after a while, the probe was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add that in both cases, I did orbit the body more than once while focussing the vessel, and I did not crash. Furthermore, while the average surface altitude on the Moon is 8km, I haven\u0027t found any feature reaching 15km (it went maybe up to 10-11km at the borders of the greatest craters) so the lunar probe did not crash with the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was wondering if there is a sort of minimal altitude/height below which a probe is considered to crash on the ground ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, is there a way to determine that altitude or height above ground ? Maybe using the surface features or radius of the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, does this happen for all airless bodies, or just some of them are glitchy ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T22:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes actually.
