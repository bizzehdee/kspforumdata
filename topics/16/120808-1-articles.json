My question is how does changing the part orientation affect lift and drag now? It used to be a wing\u0027s leading edge produced the same lift if facing forward as the normal orientation would. This appears to still be the case. What isn\u0027t clear is if the wing provides any lift if facing the edge forward. It seems to in the current model whereas it would not produce any in the old model. Does anyone know exactly how the lift force is calculated now? I\u0027ll give three examples that would illustrate what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Delta wing rotated 90 degrees so that the tip of the wing faces forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Mk2 fuselage rotated 90 degrees so that the width is vertical, the flat side facing down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Mk2 fuselage rotated 90 degrees so that the width is horizontal, the flat edge facing forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would expect that in case #1 the old style delta produces the same lift as if in its normal orientation while the heavy delta would produce some fraction of lift compared to normal orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor case #2, I would expect that the fuselage would produce lift force perpendicular to the airstream and case #3 would not generate any lift although maybe it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone confirm or deny?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
