And since I had the Steam Version of KSP, starting the game took a while (and I\u0027m super lazy:P) . So I was going through the game files looking for KSP.exe, so I can make a desktop shourtcut. Then I found the launcher (Launcher.exe). So I opened that up but the options for play and update are grayed out. If there is one, can you help me find a way around it? Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
