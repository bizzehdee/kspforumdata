Some engines have this functionality, some do not; (d) Reaction Control System (RCS), which functions by directing thrust using monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In order for any of these guidance mechanisms to function, they depend on \u0022SAS\u0022 \u0022Stability Augmentation System.\u0022 As of 0.21.1 all command pod parts in the game have SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
