Useful for pushing the SRBs away from the core stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, make sure that your SRBs are positioned properly on the radial decoupler. If they tilt inward on separation, move the SRB downward. If they tilt too far outward on separation, move the SRB upward slightly.

I had some issues with boosters falling back in towards the spacecraft as well but I ended up putting sepratrons on the top of the booster facing up. If you adjust their thrust limiter and ammount of solid fuel you can set them up to provide just enough push to drag the nose of the booster away from the craft. Creates a nice Korolev Cross effect as well that way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also go for the more brute force method described by Wuphons though. Basically just yank the booster away once it\u0027s spent. Also... If you\u0027re using tt-70 radials, don\u0027t use the offset tool.

So no, you aren\u0027t going crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny of the above suggestions can work, depending on your preferred route. There is also some tweaking you can do inside the .cfg file that helps a bit. If you want to try that, I can give you details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to do the design/sepratron route, it\u0027s good to know this tip-in effect gets much worse as you approach 750 m/s. At 700-750 m/s, it can be bad enough that the decouplers can rip themselves off. Above 750 m/s, the game changes a bit and decouplers behave less bad. So if you are going to separate decouplers, it\u0027s best to be lower in speed, or faster than 750 m/s (mixed with the sepratron suggestions above).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might be a bit biased, but my add on fix will make the decouplers act as they did pre-v0.24.2.

I also find that stopping other engines prior to firing the decouplers provides extra safety (for some reasons) at the cost of some speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside from using that much force to decouple (outside the cost) is that anything attached to the part usually break from it.
