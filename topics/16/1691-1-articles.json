The first step was easy; the rest was a bit harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, a plane-change maneuver requires less delta-V when you\u0027re going slowly. Typically, the slowest point in your orbit is at apokee. A good procedure for rendezvousing with an orbital target, as I have learnt from playing Orbiter, is to launch at the right time so that your plane is nearly aligned, perform a prograde orbit-sync burn to let the target catch up to you, and while you\u0027re waiting, make the final plane-change correction at apogee. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as Kearth doesn\u0027t rotate, waiting for a launch window was not an option for me - I had to fly there and make a HUGE dogleg one way or another. Thus, I considered which trajectory would leave me nice and slow when the time came to change planes. Obviously, launching into an orbit such that apokee was near the descending node (where my maneuver would occur) would be the way to go; but then I realized, since I\u0027m making a 90-degree turn before I circle Kearth, I don\u0027t NEED my preliminary trajectory to be orbital, and a suborbital launch would both save fuel and leave me with less velocity at the descending node. I thus took off and launched into a steeply-climbing, high-altitude suborbital trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter waiting for the opportune moment, I finally turned Northwest and made my plane-change maneuver just after Apokee.

I\u0027ve landed on the little peninsula just North of the pad using this method, and that was without maneuvering within the atmosphere (save a bit just seconds before landing).

And if you\u0027re that low, it won\u0027t be that long/far of a drop after deorbit before you actually begin reentry, which certainly helps with the timing. Just note that the harder you deorbit, the faster you\u0027re going to fall into the atmosphere and the shorter your reentry will be.
