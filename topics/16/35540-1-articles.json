When I try slingshots it seems like I can get either the velocity I need, or the vector I need. Getting them both seems to require a PhD, or 100 retries with infinitesimal course changes, which I just don\u0027t have the patience for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal is to land on Tylo, Vall, and Laythe with one lander (refueling in between, of course). Has to start on Tylo because it uses two stages for that landing. After the second stage is recovered in orbit it has parachutes to land on Laythe and enough delta-v to get back to orbit, and enough delta-v to land and liftoff from Vall. If I can conserve enough fuel I may try taking it out to Bop or Pol as well, secondary mission objectives, if you will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried that rendezvous profile last night, worked pretty well. The only large burn was about 1100 m/s to circularize above Tylo, the Hohmann transfers were about 120 m/s, approach maneuvers ate up about 100 m/s. But all of the vehicles would have had to circularize no matter where they rendezvoused, so, the only slop was ~220 m/s for the transfer and approach of the fuel tanker and the KRV. Now the tanker is drained and abandoned, the KRV is sitting in high Jool orbit with Bob on board, and Jeb and Bill are in the lander orbiting Tylo awaiting their landing attempt this evening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ploxus","CreatedById":75977,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T18:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just started playing around in the Jool system this weekend so I\u0027m definitely not an expert on getting to it\u0027s moons.
