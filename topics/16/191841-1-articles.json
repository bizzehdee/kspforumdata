But i figured as this isn\u0027t really something that requires me firing up the game, and has a number of different approaches which would likely keep the thread going for a while . That makes it perfect for something to sit here and simmer while i slog thru graphs, functions and derivations of arcane formulas for the next few weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway; to the actual blasted point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rather enjoy building aircraft in my heavily modded install of KSP, and iv\u0027e always had some difficulty figuring out how to replicate how actual planes use control surfaces. Note we\u0027re not excluding stock, but i personally always use Procedural Wings \u0026amp; Control Surfaces along with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E in my installs. So anything specific to those is worth mentioning alongside other advice if you know of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance flaps; iv\u0027e never once built a plane in KSP with actual flaps. Not because i don\u0027t want to, but because i couldn\u0027t ever figure out how. Inverting the deployment direction doesn\u0027t seem to be enough since then they just become awkward airbreaks sticking up perpendicular to the edge of the wing, and actual flaps can usually deploy in multiple angles (For instance you almost always have settings for \u0022Landing\u0022 which create a wack ton more lift so you can go below stalling speeds on approach).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings like Split Flaps, Elevons and Spoilerons i can\u0027t even conceptualize how to do in KSP, and it doesn\u0027t seem that any tutorials go beyond very basic aircraft design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i ask of this wonderful community; please vanquish my ignorance and replace it with the knowledge i seek.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-22T18:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E does things, but the way the stock engine works flaps or spoilers just don\u0027t make any sense.
