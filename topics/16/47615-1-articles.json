If my ship can go pad to 80km around Kerbin and attain a speed of 9.5km/s while doing so, will it make Eve orbit? That is to say, does ~4700dV for Kerbin orbit (2200m/s) plus 7.3km/s = 11,500dV (with a bit of safety margin)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m coming down with a cold and I\u0027m a little feverish, so please don\u0027t laugh if this makes no sense.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T04:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say it sounds about right, myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yargnit","CreatedById":57535,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T04:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on what method you use to reach Eve, from Kerbin Orbit you can get there for anything from less than 1500 d/v, to around 3k or so (\u002B whatever you need to circularize your orbit, which can be a ton, or just a couple hundred depending on Aerobraking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis site is awesome for calculating that stuff if you want to have the math done for you: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T05:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if I wasn\u0027t clear.

Taking off from the surface of Eve you\u0027ll want a craft that has at least 9k d/v (from a 6km\u002B tall mountain) to 12k d/v (from sea level). Also you\u0027ll want a TWR of roughly 3.0 on Kerbin because of Eve\u0027s heavier gravity. A decent test I\u0027ve heard on the past is to test if your rocker can SSTO on Kerbin (that is if you can carry all your emptied stages to orbit after draining them) then you\u0027ve got a decent shot at at least a mountain top orbit from Eve. With Eve though it\u0027s hard to say for sure w/o seeing a good picture of the craft (design/staging/ d/v readouts etc) because it\u0027s so finicky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T12:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eclick \u0022fn\u0022 and numpad \u0022enter\u0022 or just go to start and type in \u0022calculator\u0022 ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T02:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t you have a calculator on whatever you posted this from or on your computer running kerbal space program?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T03:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo you know there is a calc.exe in your windows?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T03:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_Sheet\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord_Demon","CreatedById":77410,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T07:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know that most computers, like the one you use to type posts on forums, have some sort of calculator program, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T10:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoogle.
