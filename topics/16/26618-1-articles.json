But it would be longwinded. If you are in a slightly elliptical orbit, when you adjust the relative velocity to zero at one point in time, it might still drift off over time. You would have to correct and keep it that way for at least (propably much more) than one full orbit, which sounds annoying. After that, you would propably end up in a geostationary orbit after some time, yes. (Btw, you might not need a time keeper probe if you leave launch clamp debris behind at every launch, so you could target them...there\u0027s always some launch clamp debris at my pad until the next launch.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just use mechjeb (now I would use Kerbal Engineer as I have not much use for the autopilot features) to display my orbital period and just make this close to 6 hours with a tolerance of 0.1 s for my RemoteTech comsats. The point is that if the orbital period is right, drift over time is minimised. Being really exacly over KSC (geostationary) is not as important to me as that the sats don\u0027t drift relative to each other for a long time (geosynchronous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, why don\u0027t you try your method and tell us how it works?
