With fuel consumption the center of gravity moves relative to the center of lift. On real plane you balance your plane with a trim so as you have no effort to make on the flight control, the same way you trim when you add power because your aircraft noses up and nose down as well when your lower to iddle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s no so hard to arrange your plane so that the CG does not move when you make an airplane just for atmospheric flights, but if you make an orbital plane, adding 2 or 3 rockets, it\u0027s not the same thing. You don\u0027t use 2 or 3 T of fuel before landing, but 10 to 15 and the way the CG moves can leave the plane very hard to pilot in the lower atmosphere as there is no triming function.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T13:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can use alt \u002B your control keys to trim.
