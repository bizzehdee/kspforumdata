Whenever I plan a mission that involves leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI it normal involves a lot of timewarp while waiting for everything to line up, usually a large number of days. The only problem is that timewarp is pretty restrictive near Kerbin even above 240,000 and to go any higher is going to be burning extra fuel needlessly, despite having already done the same thing once to get past 100x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you guys plan your missions so that you don\u0027t need to wait around for hours or waste fuel getting a decent timewarp speed?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-03T15:07:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2013 03:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbonautical\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave4002000","CreatedById":41394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T14:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do all my timewarp while still on the launchpad. I\u0027ll warp to about 30mins before my required phase angle and then launch. If your ship is already in orbit, go back to the space center, put another rocket on the launchpad and timewarp with that one. When you get to where you need to be, end the flight on the rocket on the pad and switch back to your orbiting ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonautical","CreatedById":75532,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T15:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh I didn\u0027t realize you can access full timewarp from the surface!
