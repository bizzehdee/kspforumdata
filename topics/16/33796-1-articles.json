You will want a power supply, and with the newest version of kethane there is a new generator part available. It will work wonderfully for a small op. next you will need a liquid fuel and oxidizer tank and a kethane converter. This will get you going, but you\u0027ll probably want a method to take the fuel from your rig to another ship or vessel of some sort. You can use stock docking ports and dock the craft on the surface, or you can use kerbal attachment system to connect the two crafts with a cable and use standard fuel transfer methods via this link. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some big rigs and tiny rigs you can build, it all depends on what you want to fuel or where you want to do it.
