At this point I can either pull up hard to (around 30 degs pitch) and use the last bit of time on the jet engines to gain as much vertical speed as possible before flame out, so when I switch to the nukes I\u0027m higher up. Or increase pitch just a bit and push on in the lower atmo. The latter seems to be slightly better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way I can\u0027t maintain the climb and end up dropping a few km from around 40km up. \u00A0But I\u0027m still gaining horizontal speed and not overheating (well, everything\u0027s glowing but not at point of explosion) and eventually the craft starts climbing again. Also\u00A0the Pe has been raised a lot by that point (usually to around 10-15km by the time the Ap reaches\u00A0100km). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess the Q is; with a low TWR SSTO,\u00A0is it better to try and punch up into the higher atmo before the jets flame out, or keep pushing on in the lower/mid atmo and focus just on horizontal speed (climbing only enough to avoid dangerous overheating).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T01:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say both options are more or less the same in their results, barring extremes on either end. You probably already know this, but the way I see it and have noticed in my SSTO\u0027s is\u00A0going up quicker at a higher AoA will cause less fuel to be burned during air breathing engine cycle\u00A0and make the craft heavier for the rocket engines to deal with at a higher altitude,\u00A0then a lower AoA assent profile. However since your ascending faster in the former then then latter, you reach orbit and more fuel efficient altitudes quicker, thus, generally the 2 factors, in my experience, cancel each other out with a negligible difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T02:06:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/134571-fireblade274/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022134571\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/134571-fireblade274/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@fireblade274\u003C/a\u003E, that makes sense and does seem to match up to what I\u0027m finding. \u00A0I guess the decider between the two approaches is how much drag the craft has, and those with more drag would favour the higher AoA approach. \u00A0I\u0027m finding that for my current craft the lower AoA approach is slightly better, but we\u0027re only talking about a matter of ~50 dV difference.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMIC","CreatedById":138981,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T05:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/35181-katateochi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002235181\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/35181-katateochi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@katateochi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I\u0027d go with #2, pushing the limits of the jet engines as much as you can until you get as close as you can to the \u002B70km Ap. \u00A0Nukes engines are heavy, so it\u0027s a challenge to get a decent TWR and ascent profile using only liquid fuel.\u00A0 So as long as you make it and have enough to compleat your objective, you can throw efficiency out the window. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T06:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen are you lighting your nukes?

Reason I\u0027m asking is I just want to squeeze every last drop of dV out of them as possible!
