After I had achieved multiple orbits over Kerbin, I set my sights further afield and targeted the Mun... I then proceeded to try and land on the Mun and return 6 times!! Failing at various stages of the mission from Kerbin re-entry and even missing the Mun on one occasion and being stuck floating around Kerbin with no fuel. I have \u0022successfully\u0022 landed on the Mun twice and ran all of the possible science experiments (EVA, reports, Goo etc..) but have not transmitted anything other than crew reports but never made it back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this... If I do manage to visit the Mun and return safely, will I be looking at diminished science returns as I have collected, but not recovered the same experiments previously?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Botch","CreatedById":65135,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T14:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HMUK.Apollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HMUK.Apollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is this...

Lost data doesn\u0027t count against you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, you can transmit all of your experiments and get good science points out of them so unless you\u0027re doing it for RP or challenge reasons there is little reason not to transmit all your stuff and then attempt to take home one set of data too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven a connection to KSC (been using the remotetech mod so this is not a given) I typically xmit until I get bored or the returns are paltry and then run the experiments but save the results for the return trip home\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMUK.Apollo","CreatedById":93792,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T15:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much for your reply...
