If this is due to the updates i will be disappointed. To start this off before the 1.0 update i had well over 100 Fps on the game, Whilst having crazy amounts of graphics mods and now i cant go into the Vab or Sph without dropping down below 30 Fps. Is this how the game is or is there some secrete button on the options [language snipped]?\n\nAlso for the record i put all my settings on lowest and still got below 30 in vab/sph. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAlso its mainly when i look at the ground.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T04:36:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:53:22Z","Content":"Are you using any procedural parts in the VAB?

I hope you\u0027re asking out of curiosity and not truly kvetching about 30FPS."},{"CreatedByName":"Space.exe","CreatedById":132688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T00:25:38Z","Content":"Currently i only have one mod installed and its a ram/fps viewer. Also the reason for this is because i usually play at a high fps and going down to 30 an below is really sluggish for me.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nUpdate: Nvidia control panel helped a bit."}]}
