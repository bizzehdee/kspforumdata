And me being science greedy I figured \u0022Hey, let me do a quick EVA what can go wrong.\u0022 I hit the EVA button and my kerbal goes spiraling out of control away from my ship. Im frantically hitting R, Space, H, N, J, K, and L and all the other buttons I can think of, and NOTHING is happening. I have to hit R a few times before his EVA pack goes into the stabilization phase, but then none of my other controls work. Anybody have any idea what is going on. I officially have a rogue Kerbal and out of control ship on their way to a Minmus encounter, and then off to the depths of space! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohn\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T03:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejchad, your first thread didn\u0027t appear right away because your first few posts must be approved by a moderator in case you\u0027re a spambot.
