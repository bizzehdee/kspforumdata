But I don\u00B4t even know if with the actual configuration of my outpost I can even do it...

Just build whatever you need to add, put it on wheels, land nearby and drive up to the old base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe complicated and very difficult way - assuming there is a docking port on top of the existing base - is to recover the original craft file that you used for the base to start with, then put it on the ground in the VAB and build a crane-type affair with docking port at the right height facing downwards so that you can land next to the base and dock. It\u0027s lucky you need to include a ton of monoprop for the contract because you are sure to use a lot if you try this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you can combine the two methods - put a crane on wheels, roll it up and dock to the top of the existing base, and include a second docking port at a set height at the bottom of the crane so you can then roll up all the heavy stuff and dock (relatively) easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally the more elegant way - if you still have fuel on that base - take it up to orbit. Check its mass and calculate dry/wet mass (depending on how much fuel you intend to put back in the tanks, and how fast it gets used). Then attach all the new stuff you need to it, make sure engine thrust is balanced for the mass of each section (unless you can manage to keep all the parts in a vertical line, but that sounds unlikely since you\u0027re adding a lab, tanks and cabins), and land it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(edit - actually looking at the pic again I can\u0027t see a docking port on top - so whatever you do you\u0027ll need to use a Klaw to attach. If that\u0027s the case, you might as well just use the quick and easy method.\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S. to land, you might as well use the engine you used to get the base from Kerbin, landing vertically. If you have Vernors, they are powerful enough to let you drop a big base horizontally onto wheels without difficulty on Minmus)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-29T15:30:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2016 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodari","CreatedById":157578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T22:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, Klaw might be the only option there.\u00A0 You should always try to design bases/space stations to be modular so you can add or change things easily.\u00A0 Even aside from the contracts, you never know when you might decide that you need an extra drill so you can refuel faster or extra batteries to make it through the night(actually these will probably be needed shortly after you decide you need the extra drill...).\u00A0 Or for that matter, when Jeb will get distracted by an especially shiny Munrock at just the wrong moment while landing, resulting in the need to replace part of your base.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malich","CreatedById":152798,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T13:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is KIS/KAS a mod that lets you connect items together.
