It\u0027s a very demanding game, as is simulators in general - it\u0027s not about your graphics card or your RAM, but about how fast your processor is, and I\u0027m not sure an i3 cuts it. I\u0027m playing on an i5 3.4GHz and still I do not get smooth gameplay with larger crafts and rockets - it\u0027s simply just a thing you\u0027ll have to get used to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T11:37:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith specs like that you should be able to operate well over 100 parts. Try turning down the max frame-rate to 60 or lower (why would you want it above 60?) and set the lighting and shading to something below maximum. Textures can probably be at maximum but they also look pretty good with low settings. If that\u0027s not enough, then you might have too much stuff running in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you have Windows 7 or some other equivalent technology that\u0027s actually capable of using your processor.

The problem is as old as Train Simulator. Any other slowdown is due to the numerous calculations needed for lots of parts on a ship as well as rendering the surface of planets or moons. Much of that will be fixed in later versions of the game as more efficient code gets written and the final code gets compiled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
