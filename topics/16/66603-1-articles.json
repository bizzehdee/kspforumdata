From what I\u0027ve seen on a few tutorials and Youtube videos, I should be able to do this with 3 satellites, and the satellites should be able to communicate with each other with the Communotron32 antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it absolutely refuses to work for me. By the time I get the second satellite to about 120 degrees from the first one (position roughly over KSC), the second satellite has no communication with anything. I\u0027ve tried satellites using the Communotron32 antenna. I\u0027ve tried satellites using the dish with the 90Mm range (which should be overwhelmingly excessively long range for what I need). I\u0027ve tried everything I have. The probe/CPU I\u0027m using does work, because I know the first satellite works just fine. If it matters, though, it is using the \u0022RC-L01 Remote Guidance Unit)\u0022 for its probe module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat could I be doing wrong? Do I have to give up on limiting this to 3 satellites and make it 4? Do I need to redesign the satellite with a different probe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDave\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T20:06:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by StoneC0ld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T22:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using a dish to communicate with your satellites you need to make sure a dish on either end is pointed to it\u0027s respective satellite and activated, if you are using an omni-antenna you need to make sure the distance between the two satellites is less than the range of the shortest omni on the opposing satellite. It can be done with 3 if you put them up in KSO.
