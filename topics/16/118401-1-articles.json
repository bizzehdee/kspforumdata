Back up stuff (The craft files are in saves , whatever save you have it in , sph or vab.)\n\n2. Open using notepad (program from my computer - notepad)\n\n3. Scroll till you find your part.\n\n4. Swap part name (beware of the CAPS) Swap resource fuel\n\nThis might not work but its a guess. good luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha188","CreatedById":145723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T20:45:23Z","Content":"Happened something similar to me (forgot the parachute for Duna landing ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)).

Inside the .craft file you can often get away with changing the name. At least for similarly sized/shaped/defined parts like LF and LFO tanks. Other parts...results will vary.\n\nIn flight, however, is another story. Changing the name of something like an LF to LFO tank won\u0027t necessarily automatically add the desired resources and fill them up. I can\u0027t say for certain for LF/LFO, but a lot of parts won\u0027t work right by simply swapping names (in flight).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T10:01:42Z","Content":"This was an identical size and shape piece and still in the SPH. The resources were changed automatically for me. The only reason I needed to do it this way is due to not wanting to build the craft from scratch again. Almost every part was connected to this tank."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T13:37:02Z","Content":"If it\u0027s still in the SPH hangar, a fuel-switcher mod might also do the job.\n\n1: Save a back-up of the craft file\n\n2: Exit KSP and make a copy of the craft file in a safe place.\n\n3: Install the fuel switcher and sarbian\u0027s Module Manager if you don\u0027t have that.\n\n4: Restart the game. The craft should reload OK and, when you right-click on the fuel tank the pop-up menu will have extra options. It might be \u0022Open UI\u0022 and a new Window opens which allows you to change fuel types and quantities.\n\nThings are very different once you are in flight, but on several occasions I have seen new features on components loaded as saved craft. I\u0027ve also reverted to the SPH and shifted the balance between fuel and oxidizer on a spaceplane.\n\nThere is another approach. There\u0027s a tool to change the root part. Radial attachments such as wings, aerials, and undercarriage are still going to be a problem, but if you change the root part it becomes possible to remove and replace what was the root part. It\u0027s common for people to start with a cockpit or capsule Anything in the main stack will work"}]}
