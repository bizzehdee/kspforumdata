So far I\u0027ve just done low Kerbin orbit stuff. I wanted to see if I could figure out how to get into orbit by myself without reading any tutorials. Having only done the in-game tutorial, I set a goal for myself to get a satellite in orbit. I somehow managed to do it on my first try, but it ended up in a wild elliptical retrograde orbit and offset 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (it\u0027s on a heading of 245\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). Also once I put the satellite in orbit I was unable to get the rocket stage out of orbit. At the time I didn\u0027t realize I needed both battery power and a command pod/module to control the rocket stage after detaching the satellite. It took me three more attempts before I successfully put a satellite in orbit and de-orbited the rocket stage(s). After that first attempt I decided to read some guides on the wiki. As it turns out, the ship I built happened to stage exactly with the basic tutorial on getting to orbit. The first stage burned out right at 10km where I pitched over to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until I was at 70km, then burned prograde until I had an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat first attempt was sloppy, and I just got lucky. After reading the tutorial, I did the rest of my launches making my gravity turn to the east. As I said previously, it took me another three attempts to get a satellite in orbit and not leave the rocket stage up there too. By then I had accumulated three junk rocket stages and one non functional satellite (I forgot to deploy the solar panels before its battery ran out). I decided to build a craft to see if I could clean up my orbital junk rather than delete it from the Tracking Station because that felt like cheating. Initially I was going to see if I could do it consistently, then I would just delete it from the Tracking Station and pretend I sent up a \u0022deorbiter\u0022 to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turned out to be quite a challenge and each one was different, and since it wasn\u0027t that much junk I decided to go ahead and manually do them all. The first three craft were single use designs. For my \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/902134800753389937/5402286E671A84D31F0E9F95B6828948AE7221F1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst design\u003C/a\u003E, I decided to go after the non functional satellite. I put LT-1 lander legs on the tip of the craft thinking I would use the gear to snag the junk, and perform a deorbit burn. However there was a bug in them at the time. I had to quit before completing the mission, so I saved the game and quit. When I came back and continued, the landing legs broke off after loading it up. I was so close to intercepting the satellite, so I decided to continue and see if I could just bump into it and nudge it out of orbit. It worked, so my second design I just swapped out the lander legs with an upside down small to large adapter thinking the larger surface would make it easier to bump things. I think I just got lucky with that first one, because the second one was harder. I went for a junk rocket stage, and I had a tough time with it. The junk kept rolling off when I fired the engines, and I had to re-capture it three times before I slowed it down enough for it to deorbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902135452886468602/9FED26992B538FA8C2D5F6797AD9DA4CC8FACC10/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E3rd try\u003C/a\u003E I went back to using lander legs. This time I designed a kind of basket, and used the LT-2 lander legs as a lid. I went after another junk rocket, and it worked out great. After deorbiting the junk rocket, there was plenty of fuel, RCS and battery left to go after another piece. I decided to go ahead and deorbit one of the satellites since they aren\u0027t really doing anything useful. It was when going after the satellite that I realized there was a flaw in the design. The smaller satellite could slip out between the beams. I had to re-capture it a few times, but I was able to get it out of orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting two pieces of junk with that last design, I decided to build a permanent orbiting craft that I could just re-fuel and keep re-using. I decided to make it modular by putting a large clamp-o-tron on the end, so I could make different attachments and swap them out. I basically just made a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/846966879055181826/6E12E4E71D907D8C526A73ADFB98BC75655E44F9/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elarger version of the last design\u003C/a\u003E, but put a docking port for refueling and solar panels to recharge the battery. It had the same flaw as the previous design that would let small objects slip out since the struts don\u0027t collide with objects, they slip right through. I still used it to de-orbit all but two pieces of junk, the first satellite I launched and its rocket that are in the bad orbit. I made a new module, sent it up and attached it, then refueled, and now I need to match orbit with those last two pieces of junk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR\u003C/strong\u003E: To get the last two pieces of space junk I need to make a large orbital plane change of ~155\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I tried playing with maneuver nodes to see what would work the best, but I couldn\u0027t find a way to do it with them since I figured I would need to make several maneuvers instead of one big one. At first I thought I should be able to do it by burning 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 between the ascending and descending nodes, but I couldn\u0027t get that to work with a maneuver node. So instead I made smallish adjustments (about 1-2min burns) at each intercept node. I\u0027ve gone from a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0E orbit to almost a polar orbit of about 170\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and now I\u0027m out of fuel. I\u0027m going to send up a refueling ship and continue. At this rate I should get it matched to the orbital plane of the junk, but it will need another refueling once I get there before I can capture and deorbit the junk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere must be an easier, more efficient way than what I\u0027m doing. As much fuel as it\u0027s going to take to get there doing it the way I am, it would have been more efficient to just launch another ship directly into that orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a few ideas of what to do with it once I finished cleaning the junk. One was to just leave it where it is until I need it to clean up more junk. Also, since it\u0027s modular and with lots of fuel, I could always use it as a rescue vehicle in case I strand some Kerbals somewhere. All I would have to do is send up a crew module or lander module to attach to it depending on where they are stranded. Another idea I had was use it as the start of a space station. For either of the last two options I first need to return it to an equatorial orbit. But first I have to finish the job it was intended for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-23T07:47:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2013 07:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NJC2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMarked as Answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DevoidLight","CreatedById":60164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T04:09:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do is set the Mun as my target, because it\u0027s on the same plane as Kerbin\u0027s equator, and burn at the ascending/descending nodes that show up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T04:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESignificant inclination changes while in low orbit are always going to cost an insane amount of delta-V.
