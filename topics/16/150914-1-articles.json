Take Mk1 cockpit, slap tail cone on it. Add two swept wings and a tail fin (vertically) at the back. Attach two tail fins horizontally to the cockpit (so they act as canards). Add single LY-05 wheel under the nose. Than add two Mk0 liquid tanks under the wings (you might have to adjust the position of the tanks with offset tool). Place two air intakes to the front of the tanks and two Juno engines at the back. Add two Elevon 1 to the wings (rotate and offset tools are your friends) and finally add two LY-01 wheels under the tanks (make sure they are exactly 90 degrees to the surface). Now move your wings so that centre of lift is just behind centre of mass. Move engines on the wings so that rear wheels are behind centre of mass also. At the end use offset tool to lower the wings so that wheels are at the same hight to the front wheel. Still make sure wings are parallel to the ground. Now you have a very basic plane that should fly pretty stable. Go on from there. Add bigger engines, larger wings, more fuel tanks and learn as you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T23:16:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo clarify, are you trying to know how to make a spaceplane, or how to make a very specific plane that can go orbital?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceplanes are poorly lingo\u0027d around here as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, and there\u0027s a ton of viable videos out there about them, from building them to some of Thrimm\u0027s low tech designs that he\u0027s shown off.\u00A0 I recommend you poke around YouTube, there\u0027s tons of videos on it.\u00A0 I\u0027d point you at some of mine but none are valid in the new Aerodynamics.\u00A0 Anything from 1.1.2 or further should be overall useful to you, though some minor details may change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMark Thrimm though is very good.\u00A0 Find one of his vids here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhT6fJj7Yt8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhT6fJj7Yt8\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scaprod","CreatedById":166159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T18:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\noh, didn\u0027t notice this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222825086\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477519637\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168144\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gogi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/26/2016 at 5:07 PM, Gogi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say start slowly.
