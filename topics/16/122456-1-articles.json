I have a simple probe pod with a parachute on top and covered in fairings. I know how the gravity turn works in 1.0 but my rocket keeps flipping backwards. I\u0027ve tried different wings on different heights. I\u0027ve tried it with SAS and without it. I\u0027ve tried to throttle down more and all that stuff but it just keeps flipping over anytime I try to turn a bit when I\u0027m launched. This really pisses me off and I have spent hours trying to fix this. If someone could help me I would really appreciate that. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlammo","CreatedById":137834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T20:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread dealt with the same issue: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136039-Will-I-Ever-See-Space-Again-%28Rocket-Launch-Issues%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136039-Will-I-Ever-See-Space-Again-%28Rocket-Launch-Issues%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t try and pitch over too rapidly. At ~ 100m/s (some say around 50) do slight pitch over (maybe only a few degrees) and then follow the prograde maker. Reducing the amount of gimbal can help too. Some people swear by fins (I don\u0027t find them to be necessary) if you use them put them as far down as possible on the rocket body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T21:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to keep mostly on the prograde marker (in surface mode.) I tend to be at about 5 degrees by the time the rocket\u0027s at 100m/s. From there, it\u0027s about 65 degrees at 250, 45 degrees at 500, then mostly horizontal by 1000m/s. It will vary depending on the rocket you\u0027re building, but generally you want to gradually push the prograde marker one way or the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T22:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to what\u0027s been suggested already, you might try (if you\u0027ve got it available) switching from the LV-T30 to LV-T45. The T45 has gimballed thrust while the T30 doesn\u0027t; in my experience, rockets equipped with the T45 are \u003Cstrong\u003Eloads\u003C/strong\u003E easier to control. The other thing I could suggest is setting it up to where the top fuel tank drains last; you can manually pump fuel from the bottom tank to the top tank while the flight is ongoing, or get a mod such as TAC Fuel Balancer to handle that for you. Keeping the fuel pumped forward keeps your mass forward, which will tend to keep the right end pointed towards space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T22:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the Tutorial thread you will find this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117876-Why-Does-My-FLIPing-Rocket-Always-Flip-Over%21-%28Easy-Picture-Explanation%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexplanation\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnderPro","CreatedById":152054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T21:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank y\u0027all for the answers!
