is OK, as long as I can filter for asteroids that are a) Class E (huge) and b) as close to 0-deg as possible.\u00A0 My intention is to find an interplanetary transit station, in a convenient inclination.\u00A0 Moho obviously won\u0027t suffice for this since it is notoriously hard to get to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess an interesting Plan B would simply be to put a huge space station into a Moho-like orbit but with 0-degree incline, same period and synchronized so that Moho and this station arrive at the same point in space once per year, in order to transfer a year\u0027s supply of fuel from Moho to the station.\u00A0 (That\u0027s still a 7-degree inclination change though for that rendez-vous to occur.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
