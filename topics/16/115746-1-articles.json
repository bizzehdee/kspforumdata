Aerobraking is much less helpful now, as parts will explode well before you get a solid benefit in terms of slowing your velocity. If your speed is very high, make sure your sensitive bits are not exposed, lest they be kicked harder than they can withstand."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T01:56:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A quick google search reveals this post for 1.0.2:\n\u003E The sweet spot for aerocapture is usually (depending on the angle at which you intercept Duna and thus your speed when you get there) between 17-22km.

In 1.0.4, both the heat and the aero models changed significantly. So I would NOT rely on what I said above, which was for 1.0.2, in the 1.0.4 we have now."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T03:12:07Z","Content":"okay I forgot my Duna lander is equipped with airbrakes - it still works like charm (it slows you as long as you stay in atmosphere long enough, no matter how fast you are)\n\nHeat is not a concern. Duna atmosphere is still thin.\n\nHowever if I disable my airbrakes, I do find difficulties - 10km still gets me back to orbit (at least it captured)\n\ndoes seem it\u0027s time to wait for a systematic analysis.\n\nEDIT: tried some more. my observation is: with airbrakes, still shoot for 15~20km and pretty much anything would work. without it - your margin is determined by your entry velocity, and everything is pretty tight. conclusion: spam airbrakes!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T03:23:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T04:24:29Z","Content":"OK, I just did my 1st Duna aerocapture in 1.0.4 with 100% heat. The ship was a 2.5m probe with a puodle, the 2-section gray tank, and a fairing under which were to small probes. This hit Duna\u0027s atmosphere doing about 1500m/s and required a Pe of 16km to capture, which resulted in an Ap about twice as far out as Ike. Although there were some decent flames visible, nothing got hot. Higher altitudes resulted in no capture. Circularizing from the aerocapture Ap to a 100km orbit without any additional aerobraking required about 150m/s worth of burns.\n\nI\u0027ve got 2 more ships due to arrive at Duna in my next session of playing. Both of these are considerably larger and neither has a fairing. We\u0027ll see what happens."},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T05:07:10Z","Content":"25km was a safe height for me at about srf-velocity 1km/second"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T06:14:21Z","Content":"From a high-speed non-window planetary transfer, the atmosphere of Duna can rip you apart at 15000m."}]}
