I was flying a Laythe UAV quickly there but when I went out of timewarp and right into camera view, the wings made a puff noise and on one of them the tail just fell right off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I had just finished putting a probe in Munar orbit and I returned to the Space Shuttle in LKO that I had launched it from, and I heard the familiar \u0027puff\u0027 noise and literally a bit of smoke came up, then all the wings, and the elevons attatched to them, fell right off and went floating into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not acceptable and I would like to know why wings just go \u0027poof\u0027 in orbit. The log says they \u0027collided with launch pad\u0027 but it\u0027s in LKO..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T19:57:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a well known bug that no one knows the cause of and i don\u0027t know if there is a fix.
