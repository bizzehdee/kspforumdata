I considered using an empty fuel tank and filling it when i land on mun, too bad the whole \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E complex that would produce the fuel needs the crane to be assembled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis there a solution? do i have to send a crane with counterweights, or accept that the parts of my base will just stay wherever they are dropped, or can i do something smart about it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T11:23:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse ore tanks for ballast- if you\u2019re adding ISRUs to your base then you should already have drills to get ore, plus ore is very heavy and you can get a lot of mass in a pretty small tank. Launch them empty then fill them up when you\u2019re on the Mun and then your crane will be more balanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe robotic parts are pretty flimsy, but you should be able to build something resembling a forklift truck with a klaw on the front to grab and then lift the modules of your base and move them around to where they need to go. Use the rotation parts to make your wheels pivot rather than steer for more precise driving and stick a probe core on top that rotates to the same angle as the wheels which will make it easier to drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCranes will be flimsier and less useful even in lower gravity unless you plan to make something like those cranes that load and unload container ships with a huge and wide wheelbase for balance and where the grabber is right in the middle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
