Landed and returned on Laythe last week and have my eyes set on Eve now. That said, even after overcoming some big challenges I continue to be plagued by simple issues. Here\u0027s my list in no particular order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) In orbit around the star Kerbin when I have an encounter with another planet, the next rotation afterward is shown in purple (due to the slight shift in course from hitting the planet\u0027s SOI). However, in most cases it is VERY difficult to make a maneuver node on the blue line (which is my present orbit). It always wants to make the maneuver node on the purple line (subsequent orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) After I\u0027ve plotted an intercept I can\u0027t seem to focus it and get a close view so I can fine tune my encounter from a great distance (I know this is probably an easy one that I\u0027m foolishly missing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Is there a way to highlight all struts (or even just delete all struts)? On some complicated builds I know there is occasionally a strut or two that\u0027s probably embedded in the structure somewhere that\u0027s just wasting mass and probably will somehow cause my ship to suffer a catastrophic systems failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Why can\u0027t I see/change my keybinds while I\u0027m *in* a game? (this one is mostly rhetorical \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Another mostly rhetorical one, but it would be amazing if you could set some parts in your build as not active or translucent (at least temporarily) so you could work around them without interference. I\u0027m speaking namely about running fuel lines and struts after the fact. Sometimes I completely redo asparagas staging just because I don\u0027t like how I was forced to run the lines/struts due to line of sight issues with placing the nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) One final feature request.
