(higher orbits move slower than lower orbits, so you can close that 40km gap)\n\n(you can use maneuver nodes with the close encounters to plan more exactly)\n\nEDIT: you mention slowing her down for re-entry; the craft that the kerbal spawns in cannot survive re-entry (it doesn\u0027t have parachutes).

If your orbits are closely matched (nearly identical), burn prograde a little, to make your orbit slightly larger than your target\u0027s. Key word is slightly. Be patient while the target catches up to you.\n\nWhen you get within about 2km, you can set the ship as a target even if you haven\u0027t upgraded your TS (tracking station). You can do that by double-clicking the vessel once it\u0027s within visual range.\n\nYou can switch to the other ship when you are within 2.5km, by using the [ or ] keys. However, I really recommend getting within 100m, and zeroing your relative velocity before switching to the stranded kerbal, especially if you are new to EVA, and working with the jet pack. Because that\u0027s next.\n\nAs Reddeyfish mentioned, you will need to EVA the stranded kerbal, and maneuver him/her with the jet pack to the rescue ship. EVA controls can be tricky if you haven\u0027t done it before. Be patient and go slow.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"CorBlimey","CreatedById":134058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T09:50:47Z","Content":"welcome to the world of rendezvous ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I still remember my first one with horror. It gets so easy after a couple you can do it without thinking.\n\nAnother alternative to the proper approach mentioned above, when 40km away is, if you have oodles of dV, just burn straight towards your target to get about 50m/s in their direction. You will cover the distance in a few minutes so your changed orbit wont matter much (a bit like how to do EVA).\n\nNow, docking...that is another kettle of fish and still a PITA for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Chruschtschow","CreatedById":57785,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:39:16Z","Content":"Point at the other ship and accelerate.

When I did my first rendezvous there were no contracts, so it was with the purpose of docking. I remember taking about two hours to even get close. And I was like yay, almost done. Three hours later I was finally docked xD \n\nWhat the others have said is completely correct. By going higher you will increase your orbital period (the time you need for one full orbit) and hence your target will start catching up. If you need to catch up to your target you need to shorten your orbital period by making your orbit smaller. For a full rendezvous and docking tutorial take a look here, it is by scott manley who is something of a KSP-guru for me ^^ I have learnt a lot from watching all his videos.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/St515zjUZHY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:36:20Z","Content":"And that means: Burn away from the target ship, to make your orbital period longer. after one complete orbit, the target will have caught up with you a little. on the last orbit before your target overtakes you, you have to do another burn to put you exactly ontop of your target after completing one more orbit.\n\nThen it\u0027s just a matter of arresting all relative velocity when you meet the other craft. After that, start your direct approach by burning towards your target."},{"CreatedByName":"EricT43","CreatedById":142226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:19:54Z","Content":"Thanks all.

Successfully rescued on attempt #2. Got within 50m!\n\nCongrats! I still remember my first rendezvous. Boy was that exciting, seeing another spaceship just out there, at arm\u0027s reach, both free falling at ludicrous speeds in perfect synchrony. Now you have to try docking. Rendezvous is half the work, so you\u0027re almost there.\n\nHere\u0027s what Wally Schirra, the Gemini 6 astronaut who accomplished the first successful orbital rendezvous in 1965 (although the spacecraft did not dock), had to say about rendezvous:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Somebody said ... when you come to within three miles (5 km), you\u0027ve rendezvoused. If anybody thinks they\u0027ve pulled a rendezvous off at three miles (5 km), have fun! This is when we started doing our work. I don\u0027t think rendezvous is over until you are stopped \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC completely stopped \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC with no relative motion between the two vehicles, at a range of approximately 120 feet (37 m). That\u0027s rendezvous! From there on, it\u0027s stationkeeping. That\u0027s when you can go back and play the game of driving a car or driving an airplane or pushing a skateboard \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC it\u0027s about that simple.\u0022\n\nHappy flying!"}]}
