The costs can only be judged in terms of what they accomplished. \u0022Bang for the buck\u0022 as it were.\n\nIn my example, what I did was pretty cost effective for my particular needs, even though it had a substantial up-front cost. I got 80-90 landings out of the deal, obtained over 2 million in contract funds, completed the Mun as far as science goes, and have the core of a fuel base with 20k LF and 20k Ox space sitting in a low equatorial orbit - awaiting further attachments and fuel deliveries from my eventual highland crater mining operation (I can\u0027t mine Minmus - it\u0027s hard mode, and it only has small amounts of ore in the slopes). If it wasn\u0027t for the fuel depot requirement I could have opted for a polar orbit (I moved it in the end), and performed the same task (well - perhaps with less missions) with a single big red tank at a much reduced cost - or many, many more missions with what I decided on. \n\nIf your intent is only to complete missions, most can be done with probes. A simple one with a single experiment (therm, seis, etc), can last 4-5\u002B missions (that include surface data) easy for around 20-25k, and net you many hundreds in profit. If you need to do EVA and surface scans, well - to knock it out in one hit, you need a fairly substantial lander, as those require landing once and hopping 3-4 more times. If you\u0027re carrying any science equipment at all, this is usually more than double the cost of a good probe.\n\nIf your intent is to solely collect biome data, that\u0027s a sunk cost as you aren\u0027t getting a return on it. Nevertheless, a small polar fuel base option ends up being quite the bang for the buck if you want to go that route. All Munar science can be had for around 150k with a decent design - or around 10k per biome.\n\nBuilding an entire mission over landing a single time, just so you can be as cheap as possible, ends up being cost (and time) inefficient. Better to build a more robust solution, and get some returns on investment along the way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T15:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prepper-Jack**"}]}
