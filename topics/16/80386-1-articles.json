He then launches and enters an orbit of approx 105K above Kerbin. He then does a burn to leave Kerbin and enter an orbit around the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp to this point I can copy him almost exactly and everything is fine. I run into problems trying to do what he does exactly 20 minutes into the video. When Scott sets up a maneuver node so that he can escape the Mun\u0027s orbit he sets up a trajectory that not only escapes the Mun but also puts the Apoapsis of his new trajectory to within Kerbins atmosphere so that he can land on the planet without the need for another burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I place a maneuver node on my orbit around the Mun I cannot achieve the same trajectory regardless of where on the orbit I place it or how long I set to burn for. The closest I can get the Apoapsis of the new trajectory to Kerbis is about 500k. This means that I need to do another burn as I approach Kerbin in order to change my trajectory so I can land but then I always run out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to add more fuel but that also adds more mass which means I have to burn more fuel to achieve orbit in the first place so I still run out of fuel. Anyone have any ideas? I\u0027m stumped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T12:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would bet you entered in orbit around Mun at an angle (above or below the equatorial plane) so resulting in an inclined Munar orbit.

If your maneuver node is too early, or too late, your periapsis for Kerbin will be off. Once in Munar orbit, make a maneuver node of around 300dV. Now hold your mouse over the maneuver node circle and it should change to a more white color. When it does this, click and drag the maneuver node around the orbit of the Mun. You will see how where you burn affects your Kerbin orbit. Slide it until you get a periapsis that\u0027s inside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you do have you make sure that your orbit is near the Mun\u0027s equator for this to work well.

I didn\u0027t have the skill to correct inclination nor enough fuel to brute force my way home, so my only option was to wait until the Munar cycle brought Kerbin into my orbital plane.

If it isn\u0027t, move the node around until it is (as others have suggested). Moving the node might bring your periapsis inside the planet so just readjust your burn to get the desired altitude. It may also be that you\u0027re using too much fuel obtaining your initial orbit around Kerbin. I just flew the profile and had about half my fuel left when I got into Munar orbit and about 50 fuel left when I got back to Kerbin so there is a bit of excess fuel to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deseoso","CreatedById":117455,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T10:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I tried again a few times and I\u0027m getting the same result.
