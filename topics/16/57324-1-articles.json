There is coding for these on rail vessels to be removed from game when they would be at certain conditions. That is why when something gets low enough in orbit, it disappears. The on rail also is why a piece of debris beyond the physics calculation range can dip to say 30 km without it\u0027s orbit changing and why vessel orbits don\u0027t change when you transfer orbital bodies if you are controlling a different vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T20:39:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour craft \u0022North Pole Science!\u0022 got further than 2.5 km from the active object (\u0022North Pole Science!
