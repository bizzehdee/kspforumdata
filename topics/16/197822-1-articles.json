I think the answer is basically that you want to turn the satellite\u00A0into a subassembly, from being a merged craft. I\u0027m sure there are multiple ways of doing that, but my suggestion would be just to look for an open node on your generation ship\u0027s centerline. Merge the satellite, and attach it to the node. That will turn off \u0022merge\u0022mode. Then detach the satellite, and now it\u0027s a subassembly, and you should be able to attach it radially, onto any radial attachment point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-30T22:20:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe merging ship satellite\u00A0has no open nodes itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-30T23:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo merge a ship, the craft that is being merged *must* have an open node, and the part with the open node\u00A0must be set as the root of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobbly Av8r","CreatedById":206697,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-31T04:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a fair amount of success of using the Re-root tool \u003Cu\u003Eon the grayed-out merge part\u003C/u\u003E before it is attached, to create a more convenient node from what appears to be an assembly with non-existent node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, if the top of a \u0022Merge\u0022 assembly terminates in a nose-cone, select the part that the nose cone is attached to as the root - then it will attach and be manageable as \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E described above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-31T11:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry adding a temporary cubic strut to the big ship and to the satellite before merging.

Forget about merging anything.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFully build your generation ship minus the smaller ships and save it. Then clear the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and make your smaller craft. Now here\u2019s the sort of convoluted part, but it\u2019s a breeze when you get the hang of it. You need to make the entire thing a subassembly, complete with the appropriate\u00A0decoupler (radial or inline depending on\u00A0how that particular craft needs to mount to the generation ship) serving as the root part.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way you would do that is finish the smaller craft, then grab the appropriate decoupler and stick it on the craft precisely where it needs to be to successfully deploy from the mothership. Now stick something big and random on that decoupler, like a fuel tank, select the \u201CReroot\u201D tool, and make that thing the root part. Then grab the decoupler, you\u2019ll see this picks up the whole craft while leaving that thing that you just made the root part seperate.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake it a Subassembly by clicking the double arrow icon all the way in the top left of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E menu, when the filter column pops out hit the green subassembly button, and drag and drop that whole craft into the hashed box there at the bottom.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, clear the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E again and load your generation ship. Find the \u201Csubassembly\u201D you just made and attach it to the generation ship however you see fit. If its got a radial decoupler,\u00A0you can surface attach that small craft\u00A0pretty much anywhere you want, and in symmetry too. If it\u2019s an inline decoupler you can still freely put it wherever by placing a radial attach node on the ship first, but you could also attach it to the inside of a Mk.3 cargo bay for example.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
