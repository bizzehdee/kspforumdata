And besause of it, reactive force of RCS just breaks the docking port connection while joint turning or accelerating. Also, this connection depletes monopropellant on the rover while docked flight. So, how to disable its only on rover?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-29T19:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2014 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Uran_Wind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T16:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Right click on SAS and/or pods and click to (toggle) disable torque. You can set this up to use an action group in the VAB/SPH so you don\u0027t have to click each one individually. For RCS you can similarly disable thrusters (right-click and disable) but you will have to do each one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. To disable use of the monopropellant on the rover - right click the tank/pod that contains it and click the green symbol to the right of the current/total amount. It will change to a red symbol and indicates that nothing will be taken from this tank. Click again to re-enable flow. On fuel \u002B oxidiser tanks you need to do this for each resource separately. This is also a handy thing to do with a pod\u0027s battery as it means you will always have some charge stored to deploy solar panels or similar (if you forgot).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
