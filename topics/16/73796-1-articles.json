When I watch tutorial videos, nobody ever seems to have this problem-- their controlled descents always look pretty seamless. What am I doing wrong here? Is this a common rookie issue?

When eliminating horizontal speed, do I just keep my ship pointed retrograde? Right now I\u0027m just pointing it directly up towards the 360 during descent, but you guys are right, there\u0027s some very noticeable horizontal movement.

Initially you\u0027ll be pointing at the horizon, reducing horizontal speed. As that falls so will the ship, and you\u0027ll pitch-up more and more towards the zenith with proportionally more of the thrust slowing the descent. Ideally you\u0027ll be pointing straight up shortly before landing. The navball is by far the most useful instrument in stock KSP, the altimeter the least. It is slightly easier to land from the internal (IVA) cockpit view, which in most cases let you use the \u0027radar\u0027 altimeter\u0027 - your true height above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T17:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe way i eliminate lateral velocity is to place my marker below the retro marker and push it up to top dead center. then its just controlling decent speed (with minor adjustments to lateral) till landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Worst at Video Games NA","CreatedById":112021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T00:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!
