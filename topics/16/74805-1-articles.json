I think Scott Manley once did a video on how much dV it would took to deorbit the moon or something along those lines. It has often annoyed me how Minmus\u0027s orbit is slanted. I\u0027m just wondering how simple/hard it would be to calculate how much dV it would take to \u0022correct\u0022 it, and if that would be physical possible, even if it\u0027s unfeasible.

Let\u0027s assume we have infinite time and infinitely precise rocket science. We could probably use gravitational assists to get an orbit with the periapsis at Kerbin\u0027s periapsis and the apoapsis very very far away. The escape velocity of Kerbol at the height of Kerbin\u0027s periapsis, that is, the maximum speed we can be going at before we stop orbiting, is 37,420 m/s. At the apoapsis it would be very easy (Require almost no delta-v) to turn around and get the orbit to be at the right angle to hit minmus to knock it into a less inclined orbit. I\u0027m not sure what the angle would be, but for now I\u0027ll just assume it\u0027s perpendicular to Kerbin\u0027s orbit (Thus, the relative velocity is the entire velocity of the thing we\u0027re hitting minmus with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we did that, we would only need an object with a mass of only...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMmVmr/(Vmr\u002BVr)=\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E2.6457897\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D28.7\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E*37420/(28.7\u002B37420)=2*10^13 tons!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EExtremely elaborate plans shave off about .65*10^13 tons.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EOn the other hand, performing a similarly elaborate impact on Gilly would take less mass, and if we did that then we could (Using infinitely precise rocket science and infinite time) get Gilly into the right path, and then use Gilly to knock Minmus into a less inclined orbit.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T09:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022airelibre\u0022 data-cite=\u0022airelibre\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt has often annoyed me how Minmus\u0027s orbit is slanted.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sure has me NOT annoyed at all !
