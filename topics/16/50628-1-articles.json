I was trying to visit other planets when I noticed that the 2nd and 3rd \u0022closest approach\u0022 markers were no longer there, the game only shows the one orbit around. (The markers I am talking about are the two blue indicators that appear when your orbit crosses the path of the object you have targeted that are labeled \u0022Closest Approach : (distance)\u0022 and \u0022Target Position at Closest Approach\u0022). When I played earlier, there were markers for the first approach, as well as the second and third, allowing you to plan your rendezvous far more in advance. The lack of the further-predicting indicators results makes attempting to rendezvous slightly less Delta-V efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is this a game feature that was removed?
