I already use ATM on agressive AND LOD, plus I\u0027ve trimmed a full gigabyte out of my GameData folder, and, while these have done wonders for the playability and stability of the game, I\u0027m just about fed up with KSP\u0027s memory management issues. As a result I\u0027m really considering migrating over to KSP 64-bit running on Linux on a virtual machine so I can actually make use of the 16GB of RAM I have on my machine. Has anyone tried this and is it worth the effort?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cochonrambo31","CreatedById":104452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T16:51:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVirtual machine is like inception:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe deeper you go, the slower it\u0027ll be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment we can\u0027t run a virtual machine inside another one.

The only way to get more than 3.5Gb is the Windows 64bit, which UbioZur suggested. However it\u0027s only down to luck how well you get it running. From my experience it seems to be slower a lot of the time, there are occasional crashes due to writing in wrong memory location (or something like that), you may need to switch to OpenGL, which looks uglier, EVE, PlanetFactory and some other mods don\u0027t work in most cases (EVE and PF did work for me, though) and you need a Gb download just for two files (although if you talk really nicely and in PMs, I or some modder might be able to send you only the necessary files). I\u0027ll be honest here, my signature is outdated, I don\u0027t use 64bit anymore, but still it worked better than I expected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend you try it and see how well it works for you. If it doesn\u0027t work too well, just switch back to 32 and do a mod reduction pass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
