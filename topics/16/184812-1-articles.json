The earlier version of wheels used a different system entirely, which essentially boils down to the existence of wheel colliders which were not ignored by the rest of the vessel. Shoving this collider into another part would cause joints to bend (because they are bendy), resulting in the ability to build things like moving cargo bays and kraken drives.
