If the signal is still too weak at the destination, then you need to know why... which leads to the next point...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need a relay because the target is opposite the sun from you, then you need to get around the sun. Ship-borne relays being weaker than the Kerbin ground network unless you spam antennae, you want the relay to be close to the target. Therefore what you really want is a relay that is almost but not quite opposite Kerbin, but on the same orbit so it stays there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd with spammed antennae, this will let you reach Jool, Eeloo etc. when they are opposite the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trouble is that to get there, you need to go up or down first - either burn towards Moho, then recircularise along Kerbin\u0027s orbit an orbit or two later when Kerbin is the other side of the system (quickest, but expensive - can be complete in just over half a year), or you burn up towards Duna and then recircularise along Kerbin\u0027s orbit just under a year-and-a-half later (cheaper, but necessarily slower).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other solution is only going be useful at specific times, not necessarily when you need it, unless you produce a constellation of the things.
