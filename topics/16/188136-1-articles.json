don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you find it to be an annoying hassle rather than an interesting challenge, then you can simply turn off CommNet (it\u0027s in the game difficulty settings) so that you can do whatever you want wherever you want and never have to worry about LOS to Kerbin, or the range of your antennas, or anything like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E like the challenge and just want to know how to design around it, here\u0027s the deal:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to have a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecommunications route\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E back to Kerbin.\u00A0 The simplest such route is a direct link, i.e. when your probe has a direct LOS to Kerbin so it\u0027s a chain with just one link in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for cases where you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have LOS, then what you need is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Erelay\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Certain antennas in the game are designated as \u0022relay-capable\u0022.\u00A0 These include the HG-5, RA-2, RA-15, and RA-100.\u00A0 So you can still control your probe on the far side of the Mun (or wherever) if it has LOS to a a craft that has a relay antenna on it, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E craft either has LOS to Kerbin or has LOS to another relay-equipped craft that has a comms route back to Kerbin.\u00A0 (Note that your \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eprobe\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E doesn\u0027t need a relay antenna, it can have any antenna you want.\u00A0 It\u0027s just the craft in the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emiddle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the chain that need to be relay-equipped.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for example, you could loft a relay-equipped satellite into a high Kerbin orbit, positioned such that it can \u0022see\u0022 the back side of the Mun, so your craft can relay through that.\u00A0 Or you could put a relay in some high orbit over the Mun, to serve a similar purpose.\u00A0 There are a variety of ways you can set up the comms geometry, it\u0027s one of the fun creative challenges in the game.\u00A0 (Well, at least for people who like that sort of thing, which admittedly isn\u0027t everyone.)\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022

in the case of the Mun, its rotation is locked to Kerbin so you pretty much have to use a relay if you want something to explore the back side.\u00A0 But for other places, you can get away without it if you\u0027re okay with temporary control interruptions.\u00A0 For example, Minmus \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E rotate relative to Kerbin.\u00A0 So if you wanted to explore all over Minmus but a place you want to land is currently facing away from Kerbin, then you could simply wait a few hours for that spot to rotate until it\u0027s facing Kerbin, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do all your landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-12T00:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
