I use LOTS of parachutes on my Duna science lander...it seems much cheaper than the required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E for landing without them. One problem I have is that the parachute settings seem to be designed for a Kerbin landing only. For Duna I increase the minimum altitude to 10,000 meters and minimum pressure to less than 0.01. This works relatively well but it\u0027s a huge, involved and time consuming process...especially when you have 8 drogues and 16 full sized chutes! Currently I build my lander, save it and go into my saved ships, open the \u0022craft\u0022 file\u00A0and hunt for every instance of \u0022parachute\u0022 to change the above mentioned settings...for each and every one (24 instances, in this case!). Is it possible for me\u00A0to change the actual stock part config\u00A0to have a greater range on the minimum pressure and minimum altitude sliders? That way I have the ability to change the parachute settings \u0022in game\u0022 while building the craft and can base it on the celestial body I\u0027m landing on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2\u00A0more questions. What determines \u0022safe\u0022 \u0022risky\u0022 and \u0022unsafe\u0022 for parachute deployment. I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s based on speed? When looking at the \u0022staging\u0022 tree, on lower left, what do the various colors mean?

You can set the default air pressure and deploy altitude values that are set when you pull the part out of the parts list and place it on a craft. Additionally, you can change the lower end of the slider range for air pressure. Not the upper end, and neither of the ends for deploy altitude, I\u0027m afraid. However, you can specify a default value that\u0027s outside the slider range IIRC. So as long as you never touch the sliders, just setting the defaults to your liking may be enough for your purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re going to need Module Manager. If you run any mods at all, chances are you have it already; but if not, you can also download it separately. Then, put the following text into a text file somewhere in your GameData folder, and change the file extension to .cfg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n\u002BPART[parachuteRadial]:FINAL\n{\n\t@name = parachuteRadial-Duna\n\t@title = Mk2-R Radial-Mount Parachute (Duna Variant)\n\t@MODULE[ModuleParachute]\n\t{\n\t\t@minAirPressureToOpen = 0.001\n\t\t@clampMinAirPressure = 0.001\n\t\t@deployAltitude = 10000\n\t}\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will \u003Cem\u003Eclone\u003C/em\u003E the standard radial parachute, giving you a new part that is identical in all aspects except for its name, and the settings defined above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do the same for all other parachutes you want to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-22T08:11:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2018 08:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-22T19:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent!
