EVA is a separate entity (ship), you can see Kerbal on EVA as a separate entity in tracking station. That doesn\u0027t happen with a Kerbal in a seat. Also when you recover a ship with a Kerbal in command seat, you recover the Kerbal too. If you recover a ship with a Kerbal on ladder, the Kerbal will stay there and the ladder will disappear from his hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO the true reason is that this function was not implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to hack it and gave the seat crew capacity - it was possible to assign a Kerbal to it, but then it was \u0022inside\u0022 the seat, not sitting in it.
