This is especially true after strong course corrections, be it in atmosphere or in space. It seems that SAS just tries to cancel out a given course input by oversteering in the opposite direction. Like this, a very strong pendulum movements is induced.\n\nThe most annoying situation is when I lift my plane from 10 to 40 degrees ascend angle, already after liftoff @~200m/s. It starts to pendulum up and down, but never ever holds the 40 degrees which I steered it towards. I always have to counter-counter steer with multiple waves of manual input. At greater heights and speed, even then SAS cannot hold the new ascend angle and I have to press \u0022S\u0022 continuously in order to keep the heading (thus, risking a stall). \n\nA similar thing happens when you have relatively little torque on a vessel in space. Once you stop your steering input, SAS is supposed to stop the movement and hold position. What it actually seems to do is trying to get back to the position exactly where the steering impluse stopped. Like this, I can never achieve a stable change of course and always have to manually deal with the obligatory resulting, unnecessary, annoying pendulum movement.\n\nThis is terribly annoying and makes flight a chore to deal with. Does Squad knows about these annoyances and intend to do something about it? It is just about changing the way SAS \u0022is thinking\u0022, I believe.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T23:04:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T12:56:59Z","Content":"SAS sucks.

This causes the ship to shoot over the point. This effect is also increased by the weight of the vessel making it almost inpossible to slow the turn down.\n\nI don\u0027t know what the reason for undercompensating is but I think that it has something to do with that the available torque (or control surfaces) is to less for a reasonable turning rate."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:57:27Z","Content":"Reducing your control surfaces may help; SAS goes nuts if it has too much leverage to work with."},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:04:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Reducing your control surfaces may help; SAS goes nuts if it has too much leverage to work with.\n\nThis. SAS doesn\u0027t really engage in micro-movements as a whole, and frequently overshoots the target in a compensation. In lower atmosphere, you\u0027ll have to either tone down your control surfaces or remove gimbal and torque wheels to have a steady and controllable ascent. Aerodynamics causes issues at 150\u002B m/s there, and SAS will overcompensate.\n\nFor a number of recent (relatively smaller) rockets of mine, I\u0027ve been using small delta wings at the bottom - and it\u0027s much more stable than using tail fins. \n\nAlso - reduce drag as much as possible to maintain stability. A long and thin rocket with little hanging on the outside is less likely to need SAS correction at all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T15:08:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prepper-Jack**"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:10:46Z","Content":"The pendulum happens to me if I use both RCS and SAS, but if I disable RCS it generally holds course without overcompensating."},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:02:35Z","Content":"You can also try right clicking the engine and limiting engine gimbal."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:44:38Z","Content":"If the SAS is overcompensating (oscillating), reduce the control authority.

It was then changed that SAS would be automatically disengaged and reengaged when there was steering input. I don\u0027t have any sources other than vague memories, so if I\u0027m wrong someone please correct me. \n\nThe easiest way around this issue is to just tap the F key once you reach your desired heading, that resets the SAS so that it doesn\u0027t try to return to where steering input stopped."}]}
