I have a slightly better CPU and a little more RAM, but not much, and I lag pretty badly around 100 parts. I\u0027ve found that pausing frequently gives the game time to catch up, giving you 15-20 seconds of lag-free play. I\u0027ve also found that exiting all other programs helps as well. Also, go back to the space center whenever you change SoI. Something about SoI changes has a nasty effect on framerate, I\u0027m guessing its a memory leak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could get Cheat Engine and use it to slow down KSP. It will play slower, but it will be a stable speed, so you\u0027ll get much better framerate.
