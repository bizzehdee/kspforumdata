My question is how can I get the most intakes with keeping the craft light and small? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually use only one turbo jet that way when the air cuts off the craft doesent go spinning to one side or the other. And beside the jet is 2 small rocket motors to circularize the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T12:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 Use only Ram intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 You can attach two intakes to one octogonal strut and then place them radially on any surface (including wings, just need to rotate the cube)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T14:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might need to tweak your flight profile, too. Last time someone made a topic like this, turns out the craft was perfectly capable of getting into orbit (not much else, though!) if flown just the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPics of your craft would also be helpful for giving suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
