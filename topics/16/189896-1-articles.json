Not so much because you need to coast to apoapsis, but because by first going straight up and then tilting over by 45 deg you are not thrusting in the direction that you are already going, so you are fighting against the velocity that you already gained. The most efficient ascent is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egravity turn\u003C/a\u003E, where you tilt over a bit shortly after leaving the launchpad and then lock prograde, thus letting the gravity pull your velocity vector more and more horizontal. The exact parameters for an optimal gravity turn depend on your launch vehicle: its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and drag during the ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA typical gravity turn for me looks like this: when the I get to 20 - 30 m/s it tilt over by 10 - 20 deg, when I get to 120 - 150 m/s I lock to prograde, I\u0027ll stay there until the apoapsis is where I want it, and then I\u0027ll coast to apoapsis and circularize. If I have high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E I tilt over soon(er) and more and lock to prograde earlier, with low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E I tilt over less and later, and with high drag (but high-ish \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E) I first go up quite a bit before I tilt over. I kind of try to keep the coast phase, i.e. the time to apoapsis when my apoapsis gets out of the atmosphere, at about 1 - 2 min: if the time to apoapsis increases too fast then I need to tilt over more (or reduce thrust), if the time to apoapsis decreases during ascent, then I tilted over too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223707296\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189896\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221574186251\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002292717\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GungaDin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, GungaDin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy target is in my exact orbit and inclination 1 Km in front of me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 1 km distance I usually go for the direct approach (even if it isn\u0027t the most efficient).

Generally speaking, the most efficient ascents will balance between minimizing gravity losses, minimizing drag, and minimizing mass (not carrying too many engines). An efficient ascent has you thrusting at full power for most of the burn (if you\u0027re not at 100%, you might as well take fewer engines or more fuel). You also want to point at prograde as much as possible to minimize steering losses. So the ideal ascent would look like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nLaunch,\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n50 m/s or so, tilt slightly to the east\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLock to prograde, continue to burn. Your nose will come down naturally (gravity turn)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAt some point, you want your time-to-AP to start decreasing, even as you burn at 100%.

If the difference is much greater, there are a number of approaches, all with different fuel costs and time to intercept. What you described would indeed work -- by thrusting down (radial in), you\u0027re \u0022rotating\u0022 your orbit so that you\u0027ll traverse\u00A0the next part of your orbit at a lower altitude\u00A0and faster before slowing down.

This put you in an orbit with\u00A0a shorter period, and when you make a full orbit and come back around to where you are now, you\u0027ll be slightly closer to your target. After enough orbits you\u0027ll be right on top of your target, and you\u0027ll only need to burn the same amount to match velocities. In practice, I tend to use this method most often, though I will burn more so that I can get an encounter more quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-19T21:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223707296\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189896\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221574186251\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002292717\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GungaDin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, GungaDin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this an inefficient\u00A0procedure?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, very.\u00A0 It\u0027s not the coasting to apoapsis that\u0027s the problem, it\u0027s the \u0022going straight up\u0022 part.\u00A0 As \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197939-ahhans/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022197939\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/197939-ahhans/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@AHHans\u003C/a\u003E points out, it\u0027s a lot more efficient to do a \u003Cstrong\u003Egravity turn\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Basically, what you do is to start your eastward turn practically \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eright off the launch pad\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Just a smidgeon-- how much is \u0022right\u0022 will depend on what your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is.\u00A0 If you have a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (e.g.1.5 or below), you only want a degree or two.\u00A0 If it\u0027s high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, like 2.0 or close to it, you\u0027ll want a bigger angle, like 5-10 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving done the initial eastward nudge right off the pad, you then just follow \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:prograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/prograde3.png\u0022 title=\u0022:prograde:\u0022\u003E all the way up.\u00A0 No steering needed.\u00A0 Keep burning full throttle, staging when needed, until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E gets up to where you want it.\u00A0 Then coast up to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and circularize.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJudging the \u0022correct\u0022 angle to nudge it off the pad takes a bit of practice, but you\u0027ll find that you quickly develop a feel for it (especially if you tend to build your rockets with a consistent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u00A0 A good way to judge whether you\u0027ve nailed it is, look at what angle from the vertical you are when you reach 300 m/s.\u00A0 At that point, you should be tipped probably about 45 degrees from the vertical.\u00A0 If you\u0027re much more vertical than that, your initial nudge wasn\u0027t big enough; if you\u0027re much more horizontal than that, it was too much.
