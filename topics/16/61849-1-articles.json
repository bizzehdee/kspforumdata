I started a new career and built simple ship which I used to shoot Jebediah into orbit however no fuel was left to go back. I considered getting him back a challenge and hav not reverted the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I built a ship with two command pods and recovered Jebediah from his ship (which was difficult as hell and went all right on the 7th try ;_\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E. When I was building the last version of my recovery ship I thought that it should have these two command modules split before they hit the ground so that each will have its own parachute. When I successfuly landed on kerbin with two command pods with my little green people inside of them (I was able to use \u0022[]\u0022 to switch between them so I thought that game treats them as two separate ships) I recovered the main command pod but when I tried to recover the other I found that it disappeared. Status of Jebediah is for now \u0022Lost in action\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now I\u0027m really frustrated because I spent some time on learning how to make two ships meet on orbit and building a ship that will achieve that and when i achieved all of that the game treated my like this... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the question is: \u003Cstrong\u003EDo I have to start a new game to get Jebediah back?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.

While in the atmosphere, any ships that are more than 2.5km away from the ship are currently controlling will disappear, resulting in any crew in the pod being lost. It\u0027s probably better to just keep the two pods as one piece, and add more parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T05:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf both command pods were landed at the moment you recovered one of them, the other one should have not disappear - the game only deletes ships which are still in the air (and under 23 km and not within physics range). So if they were both on the ground already the only reason I can see is that the other one was still rolling on surface or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut whatever happened, the time you spent on learning how to rendezvous with two ships is not lost. Jeb will return and this skill you acquired will come handy when you\u0027ll start building orbital stations, or sending refuelling missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matiki1231","CreatedById":102433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank for all responses. You build here a very nice community :3 I\u0027m actually developing a space station right now. Jebediah is back but I think that creator of the game should make it so that any kind of vessel that still contains a kerbal is not getting deleted.
