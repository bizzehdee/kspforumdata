The last stage of the launcher has a fairing. The Payload is attached with a assistance probe that has 4 engines up top. The fairing only covers up to the probes nosecone. Essentially I\u0027m trying to make something like a petal adapter from KW. However, I cant seem to make sure the payload can separate without the fairings decoupling (stock fairings). This leads to my problem, I cant undock the payload through action groups (I cant afford a right click in a video) without the game not allowing me to activate the probes engine. If this seems confusing then here\u0027s a picture of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Cpd5X9Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Cpd5X9Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T05:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe can\u0027t activate engines while stowed bug is a known issue.

You have to build the booster stage with a probe core (one protected by a cone or fairing), and sufficient batteries, and it has to be designed so that after it stages and you fly the main vehicle, it will still be above 25km after you\u0027ve built the orbit with the main vehicle (because otherwise its likely to disappear). After you\u0027ve built the orbit with the main vehicle, switch to the booster, which should still be gliding along somewhere above 25km from the surface. With your probe core attached, it\u0027s just like a vehicle now, re-enter and splashdown. I\u0027ve cut my launch costs in half with this. I usually have 1 radial parachute per 2t empty weight, with some drogues for good measure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
