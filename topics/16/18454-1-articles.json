What are those purple and green circles in it? And where is this green X everyone talks about?

Brown/orange is down (planet), blue is up (sky). Orange -v- represents your vehicle. Green marks are prograde and retrograde markers. They show the direction your rocket is flying (the one with four lines) and the direction opposite to it (the one with three lines). Purple marks show the target, whatever that might be (not sure).

It comes from airplane instruments, and so is easiest to explain in terms of airplanes. The blue side represents the sky, and so is \u0022up\u0022 relative to the world that is currently the center of your frame of reference, or in game terms, the Sphere of Influence (SOI). The brown side is dirt, and so represents \u0022down.\u0022 The symbol that is always in the middle and looks like this -v- is a little picture of an airplane-from-behind, and represents your ship. It tells you which way your ship is pointed. If that symbol is over blue your nose is up (away from the planet), if the right wing is down you are tilted to the right, and so on. However, unlike an airplane, a spaceship is not always travelling in the direction the nose is pointing, so the navball has two other symbols. This one: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-o- is called the prograde marker, and that is the direction your ship is currently moving. If it is over brown, for example, you are heading down, even if your nose is pointed in another direction. The other marker that looks like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/ \\ Is called the retrograde marker, and it tells you which way you\u0027ve come from. (It\u0027s most useful when you want to point your engine ahead of you to slow down.) One of them is supposed to be green and the other yellow, but the prograde and retrograde both look yellow to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purple marks are supposed to always point to KSC and away from KSC (they are opposites like prograde/retrograde), but there\u0027s a little mistake in the game and they actually point to something else right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also useful to know where planet-north and planet-south are, but they don\u0027t have their own symbols on the navball. Instead, there\u0027s that one gold meridian line that goes from the north pole to the south pole. Where it touches the horizon (brown/blue transition) at compass heading 0 is north, and where it touches the other horizon at heading 180 is south. The little numbers around the navball indicate degrees up, degrees to the south, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endeavour","CreatedById":21125,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T18:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Beaten to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out the thread called Orbital Mechanics 101 in the How-To section if you still are confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-02T18:17:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2012 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Endeavour\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBeaten to it\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-02T18:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be the navball.
