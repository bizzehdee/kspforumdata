Also, KI translate up/down, JL translate left/right, HN translate forward/backward. Those are the default controls, if you want to change them they\u0027re under Settings - Input - Staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESettings - Input - Docking refers to docking mode, translation and rotation are on WASD and you swap between them with Spacebar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest trying to get accustomed to using both WASDQE and IJKLHN at the same time, in staging mode.
