When you use a strategy to convert funds to science, it is roughly something like $35 for 1 science. Now 30% of a $70k reward at that conversion rate is 600 science, which is a very hefty reward (just wait until you get over 7k science from one mission and unlock the whole tech tree). In fact, I find it to be so absurdly powerful that I refuse to use it unless it gets rebalanced to make it much more costly. However, going the other way, 50% of a 100 science reward at the much lesser conversion rate is....peanuts, in relation to the already present cash reward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T05:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make good money in Career, you need to cover both ends of the budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou bring up the rear by recovering spent stages.

A few mods will help in this regard. Standard contracts are for the most part pretty frugal and not all that exciting. Test part X at Y altitude doing Z m/s. Yawn. Fine Print gives a rich selection of tasks to perform - string a few together in a single mission and the cash will start rolling in. To further boost selection of contracts and keep the cash-flow minty green, get DMagic Orbital Science mod. If you\u0027re into building Space Stations look into Station Science mod as well. Station Science gives great cash rewards, but you have to do a bit of work to get at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T10:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the higher difficulty of career, especially with the updated NovaPunch and KW Rocketry mods, research only the parts you plan to use or you will quickly go bankrupt.
