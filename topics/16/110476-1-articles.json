So I thought I\u0027d make a distinction between the regular wheels and the new ones by making a new wheel, but I have no idea how to edit the textures as the new 1.0 system uses .dds files to store the textures. So far the tutorials for changing these only apply to much older versions of KSP, which used different filetypes to store the textures. \n\nAny help on how to edit textures with the new system?\n\n~ thatBeatsguy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T12:54:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 12:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thatBeatsguy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T12:50:18Z","Content":"Use a program like paint.net (I know that paint.net can edit .DDS files)"},{"CreatedByName":"thatBeatsguy","CreatedById":139743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T12:54:28Z","Content":"Oh. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWell, at least this time it\u0027s much much easier now (no need to deal with hex editors and such).
