The SAS and ASAS modules do not work for detached or unmanned modules. I would encourage you to watch the Szyzyg(Scott Manley) videos posted in this thread as he goes through a number of iterations trying to launch unmanned rockets into orbit. That should help give you ideas. Bear in mind that this guy is an actual rocket scientist. It pays to listen to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is a good choice, as it does just about everything but wash the kitchen sink. Bear in mind it is a user made mod and therefore isn\u0027t kept up to date as quickly as the updates. Any little change in an official update can create hiccups. With the new forum design, finding where it is might be a bit tricky. Just explore the Add-ons portion a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad has already mentioned ideas on a stock autopilot for unmanned missions, so save your energy on suggesting it to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"illectro","CreatedById":763,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T16:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, sorry I (Scott Manley/szyzyg) have to step in and correct a myth, I\u0027m not a rocket scientist. I studied astrophysics for a decade and worked in the field of small body dynamics, so I learned a lot of orbital mechanics. I also specifically studied the problem of intercepting asteroids with spacecraft so that\u0027s my background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still work with astronomy part time, but my day job is in data mining social networks.
