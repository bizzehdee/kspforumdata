If I click on it, I get this unexpected option to decouple the node. Exercising this option causes the docking port to detach from the command module. Does this mean it won\u0027t function? So far my docking attempts are just bouncing off and not connecting.

It has two nodes, top and bottom, where the bottom one is that one, where the vessel goes and the top one is to dock. It seems you clipped to top one for attaching it to the vessel, which seems to count as \u0022docked\u0022.
