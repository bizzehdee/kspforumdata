I give the client plenty of time to load this monstrosity of a ship and send her off on her way pleasantly, but only a few of the SRB\u0027s actually fire when I hit space. I triple checked my staging in the VAB and it all adds up. When I send the rocket to the launch pad, it takes some time rearranging staging into mostly individuals, then fails to fire them all off. Is this known, or am I just breaking the bounds of very large rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages attached.

The best way to fix this is to use the launch stability enhancers to stop it from colliding with the terrain (but just make sure to use enough that the load is spread a bit between several clamps/several SRBs, or some SRBs will explode from trying to support everything at once). The other way is to put decouplers below the SRBs to stop the collision, but that isn\u0027t necessary here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T05:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think TheDarkStar is right.
