Judging by your responses here I\u0027m not even sure that that would satisfy you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it is, we have probably all had a \u0022fly-by\u0022 contract which has been checked off on entering the SOI of the body in question. \u0022It should work\u0022 is therefore a perfectly acceptable answer. Case in point - I had a \u0022fly-by Moho\u0022 contract which was ticked off the instant I entered Moho\u0027s SOI just a couple of hours ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, most of us have had the experience that a \u0022fly-by\u0022 isn\u0027t registered when the vessel was not active when it entered an SOI. Combined experience and shared wisdom therefore says - quite clearly - that if you enter an SOI while in control of a vessel, then that vessel should be marked as having completed a \u0022fly-by\u0022 of that body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat much is known, and apparently you know it too.

I doubted this, tested it with a save shortly before arrival for that Moho contract I mentioned, and can confirm that the game makes absolutely no test to see whether your trajectory is actually possible: it can go clean through the planet and will register as a \u0022fly-by\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, some people make assertions that aren\u0027t correct, some people leave hugely successful youtube videos up without letting newcomers know that the info is just plain wrong.
