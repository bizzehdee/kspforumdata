The idea is to get a copy of every experiment I do, 1 for recovery \u0026amp; 1 for a Mobile Processing Lab on the orbiter. I know I can\u0027t get the same experiment twice in the same storage, but is it possible with separate storage?

They\u0027ll send their data back and forth to each other as you hit \u0022collect all data\u0022 or whatever the button is, but I think it tries to pull from experiments first, so if you run everything, collect it all, then run it again, and collect with the other, you should end up with the same number of stored experiments in both. Many of my missions have several places to store data (the main capsule usually counts, you just have to collect the data with a Kerbal on EVA then reboard), so that I can try and get full completion in a given biome with a single mission, or only needing a single followup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-07-22T15:52:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2024 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 22\u0022\u003EJuly 22\u003C/time\u003E by Krakatoa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
