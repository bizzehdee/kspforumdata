I\u0027ve got both Kerbin and Mun station contracts available, And the Mun one needs 9 kerbals aboard. As it happens there\u0027s also contracts for flyby/orbit for as many tourists. Can I fill seats with them to complete the contract? I\u0027ll need some actual crew, but not that many.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDocking - I may or may not have anything but the Clamp-o-tron jr. available for a docking port. Since that won\u0027t transfer crew and tourists can\u0027t EVA can the contracts be completed by just docking the tourist-carrier to a station that otherwise meets requirements? The contracts are for two different companies and I\u0027d like to use the same bunch of tourists to complete both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable width=\u0022173\u0022 style=\u0022height:46px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T20:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure it\u0027s actually asking for kerbals to be aboard? \u00A0Generally the space station contracts just require capacity to hold the specified number of kerbals, whether or not they are actually onboard. \u00A0So you can potentially fulfill these contracts even with an unmanned craft, as long as it has passengers on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes it does ask for a specific type of kerbal to be onboard, like an engineer. \u00A0Obviously a tourist would not work for another class, but that doesn\u0027t appear to be the contract you have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that if you dock two craft, the capacities are combined for these contracts. \u00A0It counts the combination as a single craft. \u00A0So there is no need to actually transfer or any kerbals, even on contracts that require engineers or whatnot. \u00A0This even works if you dock with the Claw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T21:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other note. \u00A0If a contract asks you to build a NEW station, you might not be able to complete it by docking craft built before the contract is accepted. \u00A0But for contracts asking to EXPAND an existing station, you can generally use older stuff. \u00A0I can often complete these expansion contracts just by docking a shuttle at the station in question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_Pi","CreatedById":108099,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T21:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222665683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143323\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467923317\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aegolius13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Aegolius13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure it\u0027s actually asking for kerbals to be aboard? \u00A0Generally the space station contracts just require capacity to hold the specified number of kerbals, whether or not they are actually onboard. \u00A0So you can potentially fulfill these contracts even with an unmanned craft, as long as it has passengers on board\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight from the contract: \u0022Have a facility supporting at least six kerbals\u0022 Exact same phrasing in both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReads to me like they\u0027re counting actual occupants.

If you launched it beforehand, then it cannot ever be construed as being \u0022for\u0022 the contract. In a sense, this is lawyerly correct since it comes down to a question of proof. The flag is irrelevant (since it could, in real life, be repainted). The only proof that is possible is negative proof: the impossibility of intent by launching something before the contract was accepted. Therefore the thing that determines your intent is when you launched the ship, therefore the thing that the game looks at is the incremental number of the launch. If you accept the contract after 20 launches, then launch number 21 and up can be interpreted as being \u0022for\u0022 that contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease note that this is an unofficial interpretation of KSP contract law.
