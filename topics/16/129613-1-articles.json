Following tutorials and YouTube videos, I have succeeded in managing a number of rendezvous in orbit. (Yay!) I have watched my targeted item come into view and go out of view, and have approached withing a few meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in all of these tutorials and videos that I see, the targeted object (in Staging) shows a yellow readout of its name and its distance. For example, see here at the time-tick 04:54 in this Scott Manley tutorial:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srsiLZLPiv0#t=4m54s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srsiLZLPiv0#t=4m54s\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the objects that I target, and with which I rendezvous, do not show this yellow display! To check my distance while approaching, I keep having to switch to Orbit Map and mouse over the targeted object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have indeed set the object as a target (\u0022Set Target\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas? I am using version 1.x on Mac (Yosemite). Let me know if I can add any information.
