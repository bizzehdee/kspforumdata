I have already made 3 or 4 successfully. I always use MechJeb autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is that sometimes, my planes do not have enough roll stability. Meaning that even a slight roll movement will make it roll from side to side, and MechJeb autopilot is unable to \u0022calm down\u0022 these roll oscillations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually have a big wing aft will ailerons (that control roll and nothing more), smaller elevators at the front of the spaceplane (control only pitch), and and rudder at the tail that controls yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve tried already:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Some particular things to notice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with level flight, if a small roll angle tends to steepen in one direction that\u0027s an unstable \u0022spiral mode\u0022, or what you\u0027d normally think of as instability in roll. This is caused by too \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E dihedral effect. Now a slightly unstable spiral mode that only slowly steepens the bank isn\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf on the other hand a small roll angle tends to wobble back and forth, and becomes difficult to handle, that\u0027s probably \u0022Dutch roll\u0022 and is caused by too \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E dihedral effect. Again a mild Dutch roll that dampens out isn\u0027t really an issue, it\u0027s a problem when it\u0027s unstable and gets bigger and bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstanding which problem you have will obviously help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides the things you mentioned, vertical placement of the wings and the wing sweep can have an effect. I had one tailless, canardless delta spaceplane with problematic roll stability that I corrected by increasing the wing sweep a little, meaning the trailing edge was slightly swept back. That was in old FAR though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T03:04:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the problem become worse as your speed increases? If so, reducing the size of roll control surfaces may help. In other words, use smaller or less ailerons.
