I know that laythe is almost completely water, And i haven\u0027t landed on laythe before except for an emergency crash landing but that was a save back in .21 so i deleted it. So i\u0027d like not to crash land into water this time. We\u0027re going to probably have alot of kerbals onboard so there\u0027s NO room for mistakes or casualties. So the landing spot i\u0027d like to be landing on is not a small island, The colonists would like a big country like island so they can inspect it, Have all kinds of fun do science etc, They\u0027re prepared to be in space for a long time. But i\u0027m thinking of an ETA Like... I don\u0027t know maybe 100 or less days in space. (I\u0027m not good at estimating how long) So i\u0027d like to know what is a perfect landing spot on Laythe? I chose laythe because it\u0027s the most like kerbin and the colonists will feel more at home. So whats a good landing spot for laythe? Also if you know can you tell me how big laythe\u0027s atmosphere is? Is it thin or big?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-25T22:24:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2014 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bearsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T21:45:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalmaps.com \u003C/a\u003Eyour best bet is an island located on the equator, There is also a cluster of larger islands just below the equator.
