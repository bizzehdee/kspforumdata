The higher the specific impulse, the greater the efficiency. So basically a lower specific impulse means the rocket uses more fuel, but does not make more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost rockets have different specific impulse values at one atmosphere and in a vacuum. For example, an engine might have a specific impulse in one atmosphere of 320, and in vacuum of 370. Specific impulse depends on air pressure outside the engine. The air pressure outside the engine at sea level is called \u0022one atmosphere\u0022 because you have one whole atmosphere above you pushing down and creating that pressure. As you go higher in the atmosphere, the air pressure gradually drops, until eventually there is no air at all, so it is called a vacuum. Your engines will be more efficient (use less fuel to produce the same thrust) in the vacuum of space than they are at sea level, where there is one atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the \u0022Toroidal Aerospike Rocket\u0022 has a constant specific impulse, no matter how much atmosphere it\u0027s in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this isn\u0027t detailed enough for you I could go further into the physics of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bluejayek","CreatedById":18471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T15:39:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecific impulse is basically the thrust / fuel burn rate. Therefore, if you had two craft that both had 1000 thrust, but one used 50L/s of fuel and the other 100L/s of fuel, the first would have twice the specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis represents the efficiency of the engine, and gives you the relative amount of delta V you can get out of the engine for a given amount of fuel, as compared to other engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you take one engine with an ISP of 390, and one with an ISP of 350, you will get ~11% more delta V out of the first engine for a given amount of fuel. This is typically most important for orbital maneurvers, where you don\u0027t need a lot of thrust, and can do long period burns instead (thick of the probes with ion engines). Therefore, for orbital transfer maneurvers such as trans munar injection burns, or later on burns between planetary orbits, you want to use a high ISP engine, not a high thrust engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn atmosphere, or when taking/off and landing this is slightly more complicated, as you need a certain amount of thrust to take off, so the low thrust high ISP engines cannot help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: ISP = specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"silent_prtoagonist","CreatedById":1927,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T15:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way of looking at it, specific impulse is the amount of time, in seconds, that an engine producing 1 kgf (kilogram of force) would take to burn 1 kg of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T16:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022silent_prtoagonist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022silent_prtoagonist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother way of looking at it, specific impulse is the amount of time, in seconds, that an engine producing 1 kgf (kilogram of force) would take to burn 1 kg of fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs one fuel unit in game equal to 1kg?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you calculate actual usage then?

We want to know how many units of fuel we use per second. We can\u0027t do that directly, but we can work out the mass flow rate per second. There is a formula for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em=F/Ve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere m is the mass flow rate of propellant, F is the thrust force produced by the engine, and Ve is the exhaust velocity of the rocket engine. Exhaust velocity can actually be found by multiplying specific impulse by the acceleration due to earth\u0027s (or kerbin\u0027s) gravity), which is about 9.81. So our exhaust velocity is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E390*9.81=3825.9m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we can plug in all the numbers to find out the mass flow rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em=250/3825.9=0.0653 (to four decimal places)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is 0.0653 kerbal units of mass of propellant being used per second. This however still does not tell us how many units of fuel we use per second. Before we can do that we need to know the mass of one unit of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s work out the mass of one unit of fuel. Choose any tank. I\u0027ll take the smallest one, the FLT-200. Take away the dry mass from the total mass to get the mass of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.125-0.125=1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all the fuel in the tank weighs 1 kerbal unit of mass. The tank has a capacity of 200 units of fuel. We can find the mass of one unit by dividing the mass of the total fuel by the number of units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/200=0.005\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, now we know the mass of one unit of fuel and the mass flow per second, we can work out the fuel consumption per second. We can do this by dividing the mass flow per second by the mass of one unit of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.0653/0.005=13.068\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it, your engine (Toroidal Aerospike Rocket, I see) uses 13.068 units of fuel per second. That is to a certain degree of accuracy; I suppose this calculation could be made more precise.

Just know that higher numbers mean better fuel efficiency and you\u0027re set to choose one engine over the other based on the needs of that stage. (It\u0027s easy to infer, for example, that an engine that gives 1550 thrust with a specific impulse of x will burn more fuel/sec than an engine with 400 thrust and a specific impulse of x. Perhaps the latter version is significantly lighter, and thus it\u0027s a clear trade-off between more delta-v quickly, which is good for launch stages, or less but a lighter engine, good for reducing mass in higher stages.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
