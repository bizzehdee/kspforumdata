I can\u0027t remember ever suffering much heat from LKO, but setting a return from the Mun or Minmus too high (i.e. 35-38km or so) can leave you spending a long, long time at that altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that doesn\u0027t help much if you\u0027re limited to using a 100km orbit. The trouble is that heating increases a lot further down, but you\u0027ll never spend much time there. On the way up I have often overheated catastrophically at around 18-28km, but only because the rocket is still increasing speed. If you cut the engines at that height the heating tends to fall off very quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-23T16:39:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2016 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evileye.x","CreatedById":153755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T16:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think shallow reentry will do, where heat gain \u0026gt; drag\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T16:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm, more boosters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you want heat go around 20 to 28km reentry and burn Programe to increase and maintain speed and altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
