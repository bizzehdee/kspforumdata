It says i have to make an entry level purchase in R\u002BD. This is annoying as i now can\u0027t use the heavy rocketry anymore due to the latest update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I do this please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T08:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes, when a part is added after a tech node is researched, you have to go back and click on that part and make an entry purchase, which costs nothing extra. For the mobile processing lab, just go back into the research and development center, click on the space exploration node, then check to see if it says that it\u0027s \u0022owned\u0022. If not, click on it and you should see an option to purchase.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T09:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is that these settings were intended for use with money - you need certain amount to \u0022buy license\u0022 for manufacturing that part, and a different amount to manufacture the actual part. But I don\u0027t think devs have confirmed anything about it yet so it\u0027s just a guess. It may or may not be used when we finally get money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T16:41:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this happens a lot too if you are carrying over old save games. Like Otis said, I\u0027ve seen most of this cleared up by going back into the R\u0026amp;D center and repurchasing the part at the node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
