Unfortunately i am using mobile connection and can\u0027t show you pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, first way. you just intercept the orbit somewhere. you want to go back to kerbin? well, kerbin orbits at 13.5 Gm from kerbol, so you make an orbit with an apoapsis there, and 0 inclination. you will reach your apoapsis when kerbol will be somewhere else, but it\u0027s ok... orbit after orbit, sooner or later you will meet kerbin. eventually. Not a great idea. You can help this encounter by burning at apoapsis: lower periapsis for a faster orbit, raise it for slower orbit, this way you can syncronize your time for a future encounter. in any case, it will take multiple orbits, and it will be slightly more expensive than a direct transfer, but there are reasons to use that; most common when you are doing gravity assists, so you don\u0027t have the luxury of having planets aligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond way, force a fast intercept. Ok, so again the thing to know is that if you raise your apoapsis, the orbit will be slower. so, kerbin is behind you and you will miss it? but for a high solar apoapsis, you will slow down, and you can meet kerbin on the way back. this manuever is VERY expensive; expect a kerbin intercept speed of many km/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is even a third way, a variation of this, when you want to really spend a ridiculous amount of deltaV: point your navball to the target, and burn like there\u0027s no tomorrow. eventually you\u0027ll go so fast, kerbol\u0027s gravity will be negligible. it doesn\u0027t have many practical applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wizard Kerbal","CreatedById":209063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-22T17:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223943653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616429796\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is even a third way, a variation of this, when you want to really spend a ridiculous amount of deltaV: point your navball to the target, and burn like there\u0027s no tomorrow. eventually you\u0027ll go so fast, kerbol\u0027s gravity will be negligible. it doesn\u0027t have many practical applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealizing what you meant, I said, \u0022Dear god\u0022 out loud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223943653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616429796\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond way, force a fast intercept.

I wanted to reach Duna after a kerbin flyby, but the two planets were in the wrong positions. So I spend one or two orbits in a parking orbit (purple) before raising apoapsis for a Duna capture. this is a slightly modified version, i had to pick the right periapsis to get the timing right.

It costed 7 km/s. I burned mostly radially to achieve it, with just some slight corrections based on where kerbin would be. since the trajectory brushes past kerbin\u0027s orbit, the intercept speed is actually quite sane given the circumstances: roughly 3 km/s, bringing the total deltaV for the trip at 10 km/s. To find this trajectory I burned retrograde to lower periapsis, and radial to reduce time to periapsis, until i was crossing kerbin\u0027s orbit at periapsis in more or less the desired time. then i adjusted inclination until i could find a close approach. then i refined the close approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022syeDoPD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/syeDoPD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere I am returning from Dres. Kerbin is in the totally wrong position to return in less than one year, so to catch it i\u0027d have to take a very close slingshot near the sun to be faster. 7.5 km/s ejection from Dres, 10 km/s Kerbin intercept. But return from Dres in 230 days outside of a transfer window; a normal travel time is a couple years. To find this trajectory I burned radially and retrograde to make a close slingshot past the sun, and i adjusted the inclination to find a close approach marker. if i was behind the planet, i needed to go faster, so i added more retrograde and radial. repeat until approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022xLB4Zsc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/xLB4Zsc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, this is a slightly more sane version of the previous trajectory. it gives up on intercepting Kerbin on the other side of the sun, and it just crosses its orbit when it is passing in a convenient point. It only costed 3 km/s to get the intercept, but because I\u0027m crossing kerbin\u0027s orbit at almost a right angle, intercept speed is 11 km/s. the dolphin capsule can survive reentry at 9 km/s, i had to slow it down a bit. I covered the minmus-kerbin distance in less than one hour. To find this trajectory, i burned retrograde until i was reaching kerbin\u0027s orbit in less than one year. then i roughly eyeballed where kerbin would be by that time, and i used prograde/retrograde to adjust my position to get more or less close to there. fixing inclination got me a close approach marker, then i just had to refine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, i hope that helps in case you have to find trajectories outside of regular transfer windows. but it is unlikely to appease to your current situation, as a type 1 trajectory will lose you more time than just waiting the transfer window, and a type 2/3 trajectory... well, i somehow doubt you packed so much deltaV unless you were planning in advance to do something like this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-22T19:55:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2021 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-23T10:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb\u2019s pork chop planner is useful for this. Basically you get a coloured \u2018heat\u2019\u00A0graph which compares \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, time to burn and transit time into a single selection option. As king of nowhere says you can usually trade time for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and vice versa.
