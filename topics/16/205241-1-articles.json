For example, last night I set up an asteroid intercept that should\u0027ve gotten me to within about 5km of my target. It used a single Mainsail engine, and ran for nearly 4 minutes. Once I started the burn, I set a timer for 3 minutes at the 3 min/4 sec mark . When my timer went off there was still more than 20 seconds of burn time to go, rather than the expected 4 seconds. When the burn completed, I was more than 11,000 km off from my target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried it a few more times, using both MJ2 maneuver utility and manually, with the same result. I was able to see that the seconds on the burn time indicator at some point began ticking down much slower than the other timers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw this in earlier attempts to make planetary xfers using nuclear engines and thought it was my imagination, or something I\u0027d set incorrectly, but now I\u0027m not so sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts from the hive mind?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-13T16:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecial relativity doesn\u0027t really kick in till you are around 1/2c and even then the clocks run at about 85% of normal to the outside viewer.

Rocket science is mathematically hard.\u00A0 You thought high school calculus was hard, this stuff makes HS Calc look like a cake walk. There are very few closed form equations in rocket science. unless you are dealing with spherical cows in a vacuum on a frictionless plane. Things get really ugly when dealing with varying masses and curving space-time. Pretty much one of the reasons that the Good Lord Math! asked the Good Lord Electronics! for the miracle of electronic analog computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to keep things simple some approximations are made. The majority of what you are seeing the accumulated errors from the approximations. They are much more visible with longer burns than short ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe errors are kind of ignored since usually the burns are live monitored rather, than in a set and forget chain, so they can be extended as required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-13T16:52:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224042662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205241\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221634142930\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277368\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steuben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, steuben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecial relativity doesn\u0027t really kick in till you are around 1/2c and even then the clocks run at about 85% of normal to the outside viewer.
