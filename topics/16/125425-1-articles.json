Right now craft will disappear after 2.7km ( I think it\u0027s 25km in atmosphere, but... Once you leave with the other craft its gone ) The only way to do it I can see is a very powerful space plane that can shoot up to an apoapsis high enough above 70km to give you enough coast time to decouple its payload and then fly that seperate craft to orbit. Then before the plane falls too far back down ( I think you have until like 35km of altitude before it\u0027ll dissapear on the way back down ) switch to the plane, hope it\u0027s stable and then fly it back and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is the plane needed is so radical your better just making a simple rocket stage that can be recovered in the same manner.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-14T16:10:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T16:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a basic feature of the game design.
