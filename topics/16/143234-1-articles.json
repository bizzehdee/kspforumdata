But if you have three MK1 Command Modules, then you are still left to guess between them. Sadly, clicking on a particular crew member does not jump the focus to that module. Actually, maybe I should suggest that in the\u00A0bugtracker as an upgrade feature feedback, if nobody else does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah, I have exactly the same problem keeping track of the little suckers when I load up more than a handful of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, if you turn on the cutaway view (the little circular dot next to the crew pix), you can see inside all the modules at once -- which allows you to spot orange suits and females vs. males, if that helps. It also helps you spot empty seats, which is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E helpful in other circumstances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(... or maybe clicking on a crew portrait should highlight their module purple or something ....
