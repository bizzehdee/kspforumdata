I could only make blind guesses at performance - game startup speed will likely be negatively affected unless it\u0027s a high quality stick - but there is nothing about the game that prevents it from a technical standpoint.

Quick Q. How do I decide what version\u00A0I want\u00A0to run ksp in? In the past its defaulted to 64bit, and I thought that was the only version. (also, what\u0027s the difference between 64 and 32?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T15:14:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nascarlaser1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T15:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say \u0022it defaulted\u0022, then I presume you bought the game via Steam, and started it via Steam until now. (I personally don\u0027t know how the Squad launcher works...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you put it on a thumbdrive, you can\u0027t start it that way. Instead, you\u0027ll have to run the executable directly. KSP nowadays comes with two: KSP.exe, and KSP_x64.exe. You can probably guess which does what. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference between 32bit and 64bit is, as far as stock KSP is concerned, close to zero. The big differences show up when you get into modding. In 64bit mode, KSP can address more RAM while it is running. The stock game never runs out of RAM on its own, but by adding mods, you can push it past the threshold up to which 32bit works. If that happens, the game crashes instantly. Unless, of course, you were running 64bit, because in that case, RAM limitations don\u0027t exist (provided you physically have enough in the computer). The downside of 64bit mode is that it requires you to have a 64bit operating system, as well as a 64bit CPU underneath. But mind you: that kind of hardware has existed for so long, any computer that is physically capable of running KSP will automatically have it. 64bit Windows operating systems have existed since the Windows XP days (Linux/Unix for much longer). But it was uncommon for consumers in those days to use it, because it wasn\u0027t the most stable or compatible. By the time Windows 7 rolled around, it was fully stable and the majority of users went for it. Not sure if something newer than Windows 7 even exists in 32bit form.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as far as KSP is concerned? Historically, 32bit was standard. 64bit never ran well, because Unity was buggy. When KSP ported to a new Unity version in 1.1, this problem disappeared, and now pretty much everyone is using 64bit all the time. As long as your computer supports it, there is zero downside, and when using mods, all the upside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T20:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... except for the very odd\u00A0fact that an unmodded KSP 32bit seems to load and run a fair bit faster than the 64b version on my system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
