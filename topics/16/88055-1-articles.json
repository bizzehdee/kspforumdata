Before branching into rockets as the new thing for geting into space most of these companies were working on developing independent versions of a stealth catapult. At some point they could launch kerbals onto a suborbital trajectory and then tried silly things like sending them up with fire extinguishers for propulsion once at AP. Sadly these improvised methods of orbital maneuvering left many poor test dum... er pilots stranded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T00:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/54fDJKgjUrs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E \u003Cp\u003EJeb can\u0027t wait for the space program; he\u0027s got his own crap to do!
