Then undock the land and go down again. On the station you would want a lab and a ISRU if that\u0027s the way you want to go. So yes with some work you might be able to do something with a Mun station but doing it somewhere like Dres of Moho might be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T18:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Science Mode it\u0027s very, very useful, you can get a thousand or more bonus science out of one. In Career it\u0027s also useful but your research may be slower thanks to low level scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what I put on mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobile Processing Lab, the whole reason for the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand pod. The lab isn\u0027t a command module, a pod will let a Kerbal control it. Don\u0027t rely on just a probe core or you\u0027ll have problems if the batteries run out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels. The lab is quite power hungry. Eight extending panels or a couple of Gigantors will run it. If you only have OX-STATs you\u0027ll have to spam them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn antenna, and a fast one at that. Transmitting the science can take some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatteries. The science transmission will use up quite a bit of Ec and you don\u0027t want to run out. 1000-2000 units should suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel, to refill the operating spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines, so the station can conduct orbital manoeuvres as desired. Use a cluster so you can balance out thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this can be a single monolithic station, like Salyut or Skylab. There\u0027s no need to do a module station like Mir or the ISS unless you particularly want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then paired it with two types of spacecraft. A single stage Mun lander with lots of science gear would be fuelled up from the station, undock, land, and return to the station with the science. Orbiters took crew between Kerbin and the station, as well as returning the science results to Kerbin after they have been processed by the lab. In career you should probably add probe cores to both so that non-pilot Kerbals can go out and get experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend a 30-40 degree inclination for the station, high enough to cover many biomes but low enough to not cause issues for transfers. If you\u0027re less experienced with orbital rendezvous an equatorial orbit is a viable alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-27T18:06:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2015 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
