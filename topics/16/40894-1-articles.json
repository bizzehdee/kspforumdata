While they don\u0027t produce a high amount of thrust, the lsp of the stock ion thruster gives you over 2200m/s of delta-v over 1h36m of the thruster being activated. compare that with a stock linear rcs port which gets a piddly lsp of 290, your going to go through monopropellant way before you approach what an ion engine can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T09:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zxczxczbfg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zxczxczbfg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHonestly I prefer the Oscar B and Ant, but if you\u0027re not going to do complex maneuvering, get an ion engine, it\u0027ll last for a bajillion years.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts exactly.
