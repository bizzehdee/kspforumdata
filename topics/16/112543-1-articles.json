A little too big for any reasonable number of parachutes; the ramjets would provide most of atmospheric braking in the final descent/touchdown phase, but their air intakes are oriented upwards, against the direction of descent, and shielded by the elements they are mounted above. How would they perform?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T14:36:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T11:09:15Z","Content":"Just to make sure and get it out of the way: the only place that\u0027d work is Kerbin itself or Laythe, those are the only atmospheres jets will operate..\n\nAir intakes pointing retrograde don\u0027t work, though.. or.. are exceedingly limited in their effectiveness... anyone who\u0027s ever had a spaceplane tumbling out of control at high speed and altitude can attest to the engines cutting out and coming back on as it spins retro- and prograde.\n\nFor your purposes though.. remember that the intakes and engines are totally separate parts and need not be connected. Intakeair is a global resource provided to the craft as a whole, and consumed from that whole by the engines. There\u0027s no reason you couldn\u0027t mount an air intake to one node of a bi-coupler and an engine to the other to use for braking if you wanted to.\n\nI can\u0027t imagine a scenario where you\u0027d actually want to use that, though. Even without airbrakes, you should be able to aerobrake with your lifting surfaces to a pretty huge degree, and in your final descent, parachutes are absolutely going to outperform engines for that purpose weight by weight.."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T12:20:59Z","Content":"Backwards-facing intakes will suck less air than properly oriented ones, but it\u0027s not really a problem in this application; you\u0027ll only be needing them at relatively low altitudes, anyway.

Use rapier engine and place a shock cone at the back of the rapier. Now this will normally block the rapier engine thrust. What you need to do is to clip the shock cone untill you can\u0027t see the white part at the side of shockcone. Do not clip more, there is a really small window of error. Now what this will do is to reduce your tail drag and at the same time give you a bit more air while increasing the stability of your plane. Now i know what you are thinking. You are adding more mass how can it increase performance. Try it with the 2 rocket launch test if you like to and you will see the huge diffrence even with the added mass the rapierspike engine one will go alot faster. \n\nJust so you know if you are planning on efficieny use rapiers. Rapiers are much more effcient than turboram. Rapier can reach higher than turboram = less drag and give more thrust at higher speeds 1400m/s\u002B making it more efficient for long flights.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T14:08:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T14:47:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just so you know if you are planning on efficieny use rapiers.

To this point \u00C3\u201E\u00C2\u00B1 reached 6 circumnavigations and found out that it is impossible to do this with the turboramjet simply because you cannot reach really high altitudes and still be able to go fast enough to be efficient.

You want to imitate the Silbervogel; a ballistic climb to the edge of space followed by a succession of \u0022bounces\u0022 off the lower atmosphere, with the engine completely throttled off 90% of the time.\n\nThat\u0027s another one that works better in FAR than stock, though."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T15:59:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re trying to do a fuel-efficient jet circumnavigation of Kerbin, you don\u0027t do it by flying level at Mach 5.

I know that atmosphere hopping is alot more efficient but the thing is rule says i can\u0027t pass 30k altitude.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How does higher speed make it more efficient? Drag increasing with the square of velocity would seem to imply that slower planes are more fuel efficient, but maybe I\u0027m missing something.\n\nI have no idea how but rapier becomes more efficient as you gain speed at very high altitudes. There is like more than %100 fuel consumption change between going at 25k against going at 27k altitude for rapier. On top of this you don\u0027t even loose much speed going from 25k to 27k. If i was going with 1550m/s at 25k i can go 1450m/s at 27k but use maybe less than half the fuel i am using at 25k altitude. \n\nYou get more air as you go faster. Sure you are going to tell me that you get more drag as you go faster on top of more air but i just feel like drag and air gained from intakes are not changing accordingly to each other at different altitudes. It doesn\u0027t feel scaled. Maybe its how the rapier reacts to pressure. Maybe its just KSP drag model that still needs fixing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T16:20:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"}]}
