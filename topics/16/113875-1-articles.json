My Kerbals are back home safe and I left the lander in orbit around the moon. I had plans to refuel the lander and use it again later. I did however leave some science on board the lander. If I transmit the data I loose about 70% of the science points. I did dock to the orbiting science lab to process the data, but was unable to add in this one last report as I have reached the data limit for the lab.\n\nI would like to have all of those science points. Is there a way to do that without bringing the lander back down to Kerbal? Can I transfer the report to another command module? Is there a flow chart that explains how to handle reports? I like flow charts.\n\nIf I have to bring the lander back, I am guessing that I could add parachutes by using the docking port and try a powered reentry. The lander has no heat shield, or decouplers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T18:24:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by teatime**\n  \nanswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T17:41:41Z","Content":"Yes, you can pull it out with a Kerbal on EVA.

First mission to a body is a fly by if explore has not yet been triggered. 2nd mission involves an orbital rendezvous lander and enough fuel for every one to make landfall. It is tedious to find reports to transmit if I put them in the main cabin first. Ooh yes, there will be science!"},{"CreatedByName":"teatime","CreatedById":146762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T18:21:53Z","Content":"Thanks for the help."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:55:13Z","Content":"The manual transfer of science is useful in other ways, too, even when \u0022I want to come home in a different craft\u0022 isn\u0027t an issue:\n\nFirst and foremost, you can re-use science instruments. Let\u0027s say you land on the Mun in one biome, grab science, then hop to another biome or two before heading home. You want to pull science out of every biome. One option would be to have multiple copies of each science experiment, of course, but that gets expensive (those instruments are pricey) and also can be bulky/awkward for the large ones (I\u0027m looking at *you*, Materials Bay). By sending out the Kerbal on EVA to pull data out of the instruments and then deposit them in the command pod, the instruments become ready for use again.\n\nAlso: I\u0027ve gotten in the habit of moving all the data from the instruments into the command pod even when I don\u0027t have to (e.g. even if I\u0027m heading home and taking the instruments with me). Rationale: Command pods tend to be pretty tough (high temperature and impact tolerance). Suppose something goes wrong during reentry or landing and the instruments go up in smoke? Doing this keeps the data where it\u0027s safest: nestled right alongside the crew."}]}
