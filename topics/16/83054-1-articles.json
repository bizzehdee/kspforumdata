Also, as the asteroids are much less dense than real-life ones in addition to being small, I don\u0027t think even a class-E would have enough gravity to be noticed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could be wrong about gravity absolutely requiring SOIs though- thinking in terms of what I know from making realistic(ish) gravity in Scratch, N-body stuff shouldn\u0027t be too hard for 2 dimensions, so I don\u0027t imagine three would be any harder than essentially adding another axis. Of course, it might be less an issue of code and more an issue of the majority of KSP players not owning a supercomputer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WyDavies","CreatedById":116800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T20:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry to go to map view, switch to Ike, check if there isn\u0027t any object orbiting it.
