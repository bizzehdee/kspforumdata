I launched the same rocket with a different pilots assigned to fly it. It seemed to that the more experinced pilots made it easier to control. I am not really sure if I just happened to fly better and kept everything like my speed closer to optimal or pilots actually make it easier to control the more experience they have."},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:07:08Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027ve got a slight suspicion that this is actually the case. I made a craft for a Mun flyby in career and practiced with it several times in sandbox (as I do with all career craft) and it flew just fine. I was quite confident I could control it most any time during ascent, but when I tried it in career it flipped over in 3 consecutive launches (the first one killing Valentina ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)) until I upgraded the fins. By that point I\u0027d made it consistently to orbit over several attempts. I\u0027m still not sure it wasn\u0027t just me messing up though, the margin of error on that one was quite small."},{"CreatedByName":"The Collector","CreatedById":143154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:09:57Z","Content":"They should just gain the ability to target prograde / retrograde then at a higher level they get radial / anti-radial and normal / anti-normal. Even higher still they get target tracking and maneuver node tracking. But i\u0027ve never heard of them actually making the craft more stable to fly."},{"CreatedByName":"Poofer","CreatedById":110117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:18:44Z","Content":"i doubt this is the case. for them to make the ship \u0022easier\u0022 to control, they\u0027d have to add torque to the total available, which isn\u0027t the case."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:50:18Z","Content":"Yup, all pilot experience adds it the ability to have the ship auto-point and hold in more different directions, none of which is vital to your ability to control the ship."}]}
