I have been wondering about this for a while and thought I\u0027d finally ask it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs all of you know, the start up screen is a Kerbal, a crashed rocket, and a beautiful M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar landscape. My question is this: Where is that beautiful background on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn? I would love to land there.

When going back and forth between those two menus, it looks like the sky is painted on walls just behind the hills and little Kerbin is floating in the corner. I have even found a star which is covered by Kerbin in one menu and not covered in the other menu (I had to enhance contrast of the image to see that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut assuming I\u0027m wrong, it could be anywhere on the circle on the Mun where Kerbin is just at the right height above the horizon.
