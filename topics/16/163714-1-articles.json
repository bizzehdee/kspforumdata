Note that the amount per day will decrease as the available data decreases. You get a higher rate with more data on board. So always try to keep it as full as you can. A good idea is to set the alarm on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E (you can choose to be alerted when you reach a certain amount of science; I would normally set it to the max, 500) and, after you transmit your science home, load more data from experiments to keep the lab full. This will ensure you keep your highest rate. Also, you should always have two scientists with the highest number of stars you have available.

Soon (if you aren\u0027t already), you\u0027ll be running multiple missions with maneuver nodes set up and future \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E changes, so you\u0027ll find it impossible to keep track of.

However, since you\u0027d need the extra scientists to stock it, not sure if it\u0027d be worth it. I think what I would do is build a simple ship (the core being an Mk1 command pod and a passenger module), load a pilot and two scientists, and burn from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E until you\u0027re orbit goes beyond Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (you could also do the burn from Minmus, if you have a ship out there). Stop the burn as soon as you have a Kerbin escape. Then warp until you leave Kerbin and enter the sun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (running science experiments at this point certainly wouldn\u0027t hurt; and especially EVAing your Kerbals: you\u0027d have to EVA the pilot first, then the scientists, since passenger compartments don\u0027t have hatches). Now immediately burn retrograde to be recaptured by Kerbin. When you bring your Kerbals home they\u0027ll be promoted to 3-stars. In fact, you could take them directly to your station, EVA across, and promote them inside the lab. You\u0027ll see immediately how having ore experienced scientists effects your lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-26T14:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223131558\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022163714\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501068573\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178829\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NewtSoup\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, NewtSoup said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I gather that only Scientists in the lab itself contribute to the conversion rate ( I forgot to add a scientist to the lab and now it\u0027s producing 9.8 sci/day ), Is it worth having a second lab on the station and two more Kerbals?

Do this until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E is between 70-75km. Execute the burn. Then, set a maneuver at your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. Just a simple prograde burn. You\u0027ll see that your orbit rises very quickly. This is because you built up momentum dropping down from Mun, so you\u0027re moving much faster. The entire burn, I think, should be around 400m/s. That\u0027s including the drop down from Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s important to note in which direction you leave Kerbin, as well.
