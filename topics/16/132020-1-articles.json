You know, those ones where you have to transport tourists to where they want to go.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI let these pile up until they got to about four, and then I just threw them all onto one big ship I call the Commuter Train. Its job was to transport all the kerbals to Minmus, then to the Mun where it would dock with a lander I had there. The kerbals who wanted to land on the Mun would transfer to the lander, go down and come back up again and then redock with Commuter Train which would take all of them back home to Kerbin.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething so perfect sounded really good in my head, but in reality quite hard. I got them all to Minmus alright, but now something\u0027s happened to the complicated maneuver nodes I had saved with Kerbal Alarm Clock and I\u0027m not sure what to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is why I came here to ask you guys this: do the boxes I\u0027ve already ticked in their contracts get saved when I land so I can send them up again? Or do they just disappear and I have to start over again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T16:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know parts of a tourist contract that has been complete stays completed even when you return them to KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut to be sure why not make a named quicksave [Alt]\u002B[F5]?
