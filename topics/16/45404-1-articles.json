LONG time ago I sent a rocket up into orbit - With Jebediah in it... Hoping to return I ran out of fuel when I was trying to re-enter and I\u0027m stuck in orbit around kerbin with a periapsis of about 120km. Here\u0027s the issue, the only thing left of the rocket is the capsule and the parachute. I was hoping that I could send a rocket up there, change it\u0027s orbit so that it can get cought in the atmosphere by it\u0027s self, and parachute home to safety! But... My problem is... How? It has no docking clamps, and I am NOT killing Jebediah. How am I going to get it to re enter? Can I nudge it with a rocket enough times so that it can re enter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevermind, I solved the problem. With a very tough cost. I had flipped landing struts upside down and used it as a temporary claw. However when I cought up to the capsule, I realised the claw would not grab on properly. I had to abort the mission. However one of my kerbals had a great idea, he would exit the rescue ship to make room for Jebediah, and have Jebediah board the ship. The plan went through perfectly. I\u0027m planning to send another rescue mission to retrieve the kerbal orbiting Kerbin.
