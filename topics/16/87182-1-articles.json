Your problem is your flying or your construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world you can\u0027t do a 45 degree pitch in a few seconds while traveling 300 m/s. FAR simulates this by breaking the aircraft if you try, which is what would happen. You have to move slow and smooth or the sudden air pressure change becomes too much for the craft to handle. If your craft tumbles out of control, that could be too much force on the craft as well, just not enough to break it. Think of it this way, your plane is traveling forward with the wind going over it and suddenly you want to turn east, you roll and pull back hard but your going so fast that now your traveling with the bottom side of the plane facing the direction of travel because even though the plane turned, it turned too fast to change direction and it\u0027s still traveling the direction you were before, the plane wasn\u0027t build to do that and you lose control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your controls are \u0022frozen\u0022 you may not have your ailerons configured correctly, though that would be strange because their default is to control everything (also fairly bad but will kinda work).

Of course I hadn\u0027t actually built one since the wobbly days 0f 0.21, so I couldn\u0027t comment on how it compares to 0.24. The first one I built used Mark 2 components with 2 RAPIER engines. It could almost make orbit on jet fuel alone and took only a few minutes to get to a 1500\u002B m/s flameout at 27km or so. Control was smooth as silk the whole way. Of course when I tried to add parachutes, cargo bay, VTOL capability, and science instrumentation it was another story, but I eventually got all of that working too on a plane that could make orbit in something like 14 minutes on about 300 units of jet fuel. I don\u0027t think I could have managed that with what was available in 0.21. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, when a plane wants to fly backwards, it\u0027s usually because the center of lift has gotten in front of the center of mass. This often happens as your fuel gets consumed, since the tanks get emptied from the front to the back. the best remedies for this I have found are to put the bulk of the fuel load as close to the center of mass as you can, and also to run a fuel line from the rearmost tank forward to the one closest to the center of mass. This will cause the fuel to drain from both ends towards the center rather than from front to back. Failing to do this for me always ended up producing planes that were nose-heavy at takeoff and then pitched up uncontrollably after burning half their fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T16:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to mis-aligned landing gear, too much weight on the front wheel will also often produce veering behavior.
