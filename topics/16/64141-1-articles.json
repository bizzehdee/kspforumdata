I currently have an awesome roving lab design that can land with just parachutes with the full lab in the middle and living quarters on both ends for a total crew capacity of about 8. The problem I\u0027m grappling with now is how to efficiently shuttle kerbals from the orbiting space station and the mobile lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I bother designing a an aircraft like design using an LV-N to reach orbit or would it be easier to just do the typical small lander to shuttle Kerbals up and down?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the main question is the qualities that make an SSTO so good on Kerbin (High ISP engines\u002BLift=Low Delta V) not carry over to Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-24T20:11:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2014 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cheeseit\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T07:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout the ability to use air breathing engines there is no advantage to a space plane on the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you are landing with enough fuel to go back up, then you would need a lot of wing to gain any advantage on the descent through Dunas thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would stick to a lander, with maybe some parachutes to assist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T07:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor details on what it takes to fly on Duna, see the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50619-Flying-Duna-AGAIN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlying Duna AGAIN\u003C/a\u003E challenge, and how few folks have succeeded at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice is to go with a conventional lander, not a spaceplane. First off, there\u0027s on oxygen so the high-ISP jets don\u0027t work at all (and even the Kethane jet has problems). This means you\u0027re going to be flying the thing like a rocket anyway, using just thrust to get to orbit. Second, the air on Duna is so thin that getting any real lift out of it is impossible without an extremely huge wing combined with an extremely low weight. This rules out carrying much in the way of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the real difficulty in flying on Duna is landing. The average terrain elevation over about 80% of the planet is around 3000m, which in Duna\u0027s thin air equates to about 16000m on Kerbin. And all this ground is extremely hilly, except in the bottoms of a few depressions, where it\u0027s only moderately hilly. Thus, no long landing strips. This means that for about 80% of the surface, the only way to survive a horizontal landing is to have such a huge wing you can fly as slowly as 30m/s at 3000m (on Duna, 16km on Kerbin). If you land in a depression, you have both thicker air and flatter ground so can usually get by with 60m/s or a bit more. But if that\u0027s the only place you can land, your choice of base locations is very limited.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T08:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna\u0027s atmo is so thin that it wouldn\u0027t provide you with much useful lift, so you can blast up through it so quickly that there\u0027s no advantage to lingering there and prolonging your exposure to drag. On landing, wings can help you pick your landing site, though landing speed is quite high and locations flat enough to be suitable can be hard to find. The bottom of the Mariner-trench-analog is quite smooth, though. On the whole, flight there is more of a technical feat than a useful method of travel, so try it if you feel like giving yourself a challenge. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stevism","CreatedById":90744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T08:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo the typical small lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut have fun and make it has minimalistic as you can. probe core, 3-4 rover seats , etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat would be the best way to conserve fuel i think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T13:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you can always stick a bunch of drogues and normal chute to slow down then cut them before landing..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T13:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo a lightweight mini lander that has capacity for at least 2 Kerbals and can be remotely operated with a probe core.

Its more efficient and easier to build a small lander but if you feel it would be awesome to do a space plane then go ahead - its not impossible to get one working judging from some of the comments.
