I clocked up about 2 weeks of in game time. A probe mission to Duna added almost 100 days to that due to travel time. Now I am faced with more then 100-150 days before any realistic launch windows open up. I\u0027ve done a few other tasks and housekeeping but that adds only a day or so to the in game clock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any thing that I can do that will eat up time, or should I just time warp through 3-6 months?

Use a log to keep track of when launch windows become available, when to do course corrections, and capture maneuvers. Have the ability to change targets if the opportunity presents itself. I sent two Jool probes to Eeloo when it aligned itself with Jool orbit. (one was lost due to a maneuvering node error.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have to wait for a solar orbit or two before intercept windows are available. Therefore, have probes in solar orbit to find them and have your manned missions ready for launch when those intercept windows are close by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will launch several rockets to the same target in short order. It will not be unusual for them to arrive several days apart depending on how the maneuvers to intercept set up. I then park them in high orbit until they all arrive, then send one at a time down for close encounter or capture around a moon.., a braking slingshot to reach inner moons or a planet, or use them for major orbiting plane changes. Eve and Jool missions can be launched in short order. Usually, an Eve window will open up in short order with much shorter intercept time then a Jool one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, do your Mun, Minmus, and orbiting station missions in between times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T21:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI set up geosynchronous satellites.
