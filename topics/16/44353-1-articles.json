Ideally, you must time your one full-thrust burn exactly so that your velocity hits zero a meter or two from the ground. That\u0027s ideally. In practice, you are unlikely to time it that well, so do a quick experiment and see how much acceleration you are capable of. 1G is around 10 m/s per second. If you can pull 1G, you will cancel 100m/s of velocity in 10 seconds, and travel around 600m down - meaning around 650m is a good time to start slowing down if your speed is 100m/s. So the exact point of where you start that burn is dependent on the exact rocket and trajectory, but it\u0027s usually best to start earlier than later. Just remember how fast you can slow down, and how soon you\u0027ll be hitting the ground, and try to not make the latter be sooner than the former.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T14:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuicide (i.e. retrograde all the way down) burns are NOT the most efficient burn.

You have to burn for a long long time to reduce your speed at that thrust no matter how you do it. If you use a suicide burn, you have to start burning at something like 29 km of altitude, otherwise you\u0027re lithobraking. The constant altitude method showcased in the video allows you to burn near the surface, minimizing the amount of thrust you\u0027re going to be using descending. He burns at that 45 degree angle specifically to counteract gravity and no more. If your altitude doesn\u0027t change, you\u0027re using just enough thrust to resist gravity. Likewise when you\u0027re taking off from a non-atmospheric body, you want to first gain enough altitude to keep from hitting mountains, then thrust horizontal as much as possible while maintaining your altitude constant: you\u0027d rather gain speed then waste energy fighting gravity to gain altitude. It is far more efficient to gain altitude by burning prograde when you\u0027re at orbital speeds than by burning radially during a sub-orbital ascent. The constant altitude landing method is exactly the same thing in reverse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T21:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have to burn for a long long time to reduce your speed at that thrust no matter how you do it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it difficult to estimate when to start burning.
