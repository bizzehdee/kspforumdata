If I bounce to each satellite quickly enough their sidereal longitude values are now all ~120 degrees from each other.

It calculates the distance to the neighbor satellite. With that as a guide i would launch the 4th satellite roughly in a spot it will eventually go. Use one existing satellite as an anchor and move the other two to the proper average distance, then nudge the 4th around so it too is equidistant. Then use longitude to confirm their degree of separation is right -- hard to use that to do the actual maneuvers since it is a moving target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could use the rotation of the planet to predict what your longitude should be at a certain point? seems more complex than figuring out what your distance should be and extending/shorting your orbit as needed for a lap or two to line things up..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpreadsheet mentioned above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52132-Spreadsheet-to-Calculate-Orbit-Orbit-Darkness-and-Recommended-Battery-Capacity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52132-Spreadsheet-to-Calculate-Orbit-Orbit-Darkness-and-Recommended-Battery-Capacity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
