Thank you very much!\n\nThe ISp of the decoupler propulsion seems to be a bit above 100s. Not very good, but the good part is that the dry mass is 100% payload. 24.5N of thrust per one stack of fuel, but this can be expanded in parallel. Now to find optimal profile of the rocket (when to double the stack width for consistent TWR...)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Scott Manley did this he was able to launch a probe core from the launchpad to the water near the KSC using stack seperators.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldF2oSotd9Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nOh, yes, except stack separators provide 60000Ns of impulse per 450kg of weight, meaning exhaust speed of 133m/s. That\u0027s a pitiful 13.56s of ISp. \n\nRadial decouplers provide 25000Ns of impulse per 25kg - 1000m/s of exhaust speed, for a whole 102s of ISp, and allow for easy multiplication of thrust as you can attach more decouplers below to a single decoupler above.\n\nTo keep a payload of 0.5kg at TWR\u003E=2 on Kerbin, I\u0027d need a stack of\n\n10 layers of 5 decouplers\n\n13 layers of 4 decouplers\n\n16 layers of 3 decouplers\n\n25 layers of 2 decouplers\n\n30 layers of 1 decoupler.\n\nThat makes for 94 stages, assuming 1s per stage, 94s of acceleration, 922m/s lost to gravity, at the very least second that much gained to acceleration. I\u0027ll see how staging that many goes, but orbit is definitely possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T14:02:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T14:42:32Z","Content":"The forum demands video."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:50:38Z","Content":"Uh, bummer.
