But on the opposite face of Kerbal. This should not a big deal because it has an antenna (a Communitron DTS-M1, deployed)\u00A0and I have a satellite orbitting around Mun which communicate with Kerbal. But my rover refuse to link with the satellite and the result is that I cannot move my rover because of the absence of communication.

As the names suggest, direct type antennae can only transmit a signal to something else- Kerbin\u00A0or another craft- but relay dishes can also receive a signal from another craft and then forward it on. Orbiting the Mun, a relay with a few HG-5 deployable dishes would be sufficient, but further out you\u2019ll need the RA-class fixed dishes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good relay network will not only prevent loss of signal and loss of control but also means your individual rovers, landers etc. only need small direct antennae to reach the relays above, rather than carrying a big, heavy one to communicate all the way back to Kerbin. I suggest you build a simple relay with either a few HG-5s or a single RA-2 and put several of those in orbit around the Mun (and Minmus too) to ensure that you get complete coverage of the surface: put them in sets of 3 in a high polar orbit, regularly spaced, so they can communicate with each other and will cover almost every part of the Mun/Minmus\u2019 surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VonDriguen","CreatedById":211244,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-20T11:50:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys!
