Before it even has any serious speed, it veers off to the right strongly and is almost impossible to stabilize. So that\u0027s all before take off. I haven\u0027t been able to have a single plane take off properly yet. What am I doing wrong? Is there any guide on how to build a plane with just the basic plane parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ojmDi54\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ojmDi54\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-05T12:50:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2016 12:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Reinoud\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T13:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVeering off on the runway is quite a common problem.\u00A0 Sometimes having the front wheel attached to the cockpit can cause it so try moving it back to just behind the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve also go your rear wheels quite a long way behind the Center of Mass, this will make it quite hard to unstick from the runway unless you have it in a nose up attitude already, as the tailplane has to try and lever the CoM around the wheels, plus it means there\u0027s a lot of weight on the front wheel, moving the rear wheels forward and leaving the front wheel where it is would reduce the weight on the front and might solve the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-05T13:23:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2016 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RizzoTheRat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T13:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s almost certainly caused by your rear wheels not being perfectly straight.\u00A0 If you attach the wheels to a curved surface, they will be slightly angled one way or the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix the problem go into the SPH and select the rotation gizmo, then select the rear landing gear.\u00A0 Pressing F will toggle the rotation to absolute mode.\u00A0 Adjust the rotation of the gear slightly and it will snap into absolute alignment.\u00A0 Make sure you have it snapped straight forward and straight up and down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour plane should now roll straight down the runway.\u00A0 There are other problems that can affect this, but the one described seems to be the culprit in almost every case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T13:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the above doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027d try attaching the lower gears to the fuselage.
