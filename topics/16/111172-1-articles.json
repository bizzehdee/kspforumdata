I even went back to the tutorial and found the default vessel used starts to spin anti-clockwise as well.\n\nSurely the game can\u0027t be designed to work like this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:38:33Z","Content":"check your engine gimbal.

Otherwise, they can flip out of control.\n\nWith the new atmospheric and parts modeling of KSP 1.x, there is a range of speed where the center of pressure gets higher on the nose then during lower speed flight. This, along with the changing center of mass as fuel gets burned, can cause your rocket to swap ends, usually when you are starting your orbital turn. That critical speed is as you approach the sound barrier evident by the white lines forming around your nose and fins. The cure, a combination of careful design, fins, vectoring engines, keeping your speed below that critical level while below 25,000 meters, and doing the turn slowly.\n\nAnd, the more powerful model rockets will do the same thing.

Never give up!\n\nNot to be pedantic, but flipping vs. spinning are very different problems. Flipping involves rotation along the horizontal axis, while spinning involves rotation along the vertical axis. Granted, one thing can induce the other, but I don\u0027t think OP\u0027s problem has anything to do with flipping in this case."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:53:44Z","Content":"He\u0027s talking about spinning about the long axis of the rocket, while still pointing prograde. As in, the \u0022roll\u0022 axis. I get that too, and it\u0027s very similar to the behavior I experienced in older versions of FAR. Except in the FAR situations small attitude changes didn\u0027t cause much effect, and I only saw it in 3-way symmetry. In nuStock I get it in 3- and 4-way symmetry.\n\nI think it has something to do with the occlusion models and small angles of attack on the fins. Gnomechompsky, I get it when I apply control, does it fly straight for you under neutral input? And does it happen with no fins?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T02:15:31Z","Content":"This used to be caused by parts flexing, allowing engines to be thrusting at a slight angle.
