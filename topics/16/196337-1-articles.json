To make the fins mirror across all the boosters, attach the booster to the core of the rocket via a stack node, then attach the fins using the mirror mode of your choice, then take the booster and attach it radially in the mirror mode of your choice; all the boosters are mirrored around the centre, and all the fins are mirrored around each booster- just don\u0027t touch the fins with the move or rotate tools or it breaks the layers of symmetry and they\u0027ll switch to being the same symmetry as their parent (the booster in this example) and you\u0027ll end up with one fin per booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this is clear, if not let me know and I\u0027ll try to explain it better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
