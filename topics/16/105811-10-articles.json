Not without mods.\n\nThe real problem, IMO, is the babysitting. With level-3 scientists, you have to drop everything you\u0027re doing and look after the lab approximately twice a year. Then sit and watch as science gets uploaded (takes a while even with the best antenna) and new data is processed into the lab. The latter depends on type of experiment, not science value: gravimeter readings, probably the most common data, take ~30 seconds each. Atmosphere Analysis? More than a minute. And in this case, time warp won\u0027t help you.\n\nThough personally, I\u0027m not sure that the amount of time spent watching a progress meter really matters very much.
