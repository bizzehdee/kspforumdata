Target the station, set your navball mode to target by clicking on your velocity indicator, and burn retrograde until your relative velocity is 0 m/s. You are then at a dead stop relative to the station and should be in the exact same orbit. Use RCS from there to move yourself where you need to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LILGIT90","CreatedById":58791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T18:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip ThatBum, I have docked several times in orbit from launch. twice in unlimited fuel for practice and once with no cheats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
