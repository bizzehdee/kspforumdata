The problem is when I actually do this for keeps and all the stages are out of fuel when they get decoupled, a pair of sepratrons disconnects from the srbs they are attached to and simply charge off somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry SRBs, throttle-limited so they burn out when I want them gone anyways, mounted on the wire-standoff radial decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/kVaGwmw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/kVaGwmw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 1 is the first set dropped, and those work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 2 marks the ones that simply fall off. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried placing the sepratrons on the sides where Figure 3 is, and across the SRBs that makes them ALL fall off... I originally thought this might be from damage, and I\u0027ve tried varying their height, different angles etc. In every case I\u0027ve tried to make sure the thrust from one sepratron is not hitting another one. While the setup pictured comes very very close, I don\u0027t think they are hitting?
