It weighs around 400 tonnes and can currently hold 112 Kerbals in cockpits and Hitchhiker modules. It flies fine and can get to takeoff speed from the runway. The problem is that either the heavily reinforced landing gears break or the plane falls off the runway. Trying to steer it hard can break the gears. Any tips for taking off gargantuan planes like this one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: it is in FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom memory, it\u0027s primary wing surface is a trapezoid 10.5 metres long, 21 meters at the front, and 42 at the rear. This is 330 m^2, but it has an additional wing so it should have enough of a wing surface considering the speeds it reaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words. It isn\u0027t going off the end of the runway. It is collapsing before or during takeoff. Sometimes it manages to take off and fly a few hundred meters, minus some engines and wing parts and landing gears. It just breaks first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANOTHER EDIT: I\u0027m trying to avoid solid fuel because I intend it to be an SSTO and the nose starts raised by a structural fuselage, 1.25 meters. Also, The most significant problem seems to be that the front landing gears are bending over and parts of it are breaking off of them, causing their structure to compromise and the plane to try and steer off the runway and them to break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally!

I\u0027d give you the standard \u0022Turbojets have lower mass and higher Isp\u0022 argument for Turbojet/Rocket vs. RAPIER, but I imagine you\u0027ve heard it before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, looking at your screenie, I think you\u0027re putting too much mass on the back wheels when you go to lift your nose. Try reinforcing the wheels first, then adding more wheels if that doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething you may consider (and I\u0027ve done before) is actually having three sets of landing wheels - nose gear, a rear set close to the center of mass, and a tail set that responds to an action group command (this is the set that supports the tail of the plane when it\u0027s stopped). On take off, when you get close to takeoff speed, use the action group to raise the tail set. You should be going fast enough at that point that, if all is well, the rear end of the plane will stay off the ground. You then just have to pitch up; the plane pivots on the middle set (the ones close to the center of mass), and you\u0027re off to the races.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T23:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pds314\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pds314\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.

I could only clearly see one in that picture so I wasn\u0027t sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking about the front gear, the other thing I have noticed is that if you attach them to components that are radially attached, the joint sometimes flexes. I guess what I mean by that is that it isn\u0027t always the landing gear the problem. In your case, I\u0027ve seen problems with the connection between that structural fuselage and the aircraft fuselage. Sometimes moving the joint up or down a little bit changes the way the forces are applied to the joint and it flexes a lot less. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s happening here, because it\u0027s sort of a \u0022maybe/maybe not\u0022 thing I\u0027ve seen with similar landing gear designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot to add... Sometimes even if it\u0027s just a little wing flex, having your landing gear attached to the wings can cause wobbling and steering problems with the plane (gear attached to the wings). For instance, the plane below was very unstable on the runway, veering to the right every time. And if it did manage to get airborne, the wings would flex so much that it would yaw and roll. I added two key struts, and it flew solid as a rock because I eliminated wing flex to the rear gear (even without a vertical tail).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not nearly as heavy as yours (only 90ish tons), but it only has one pair of landing gear at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BSZf4JX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BSZf4JX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-05T00:26:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2014 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T04:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe gears Are only attached to the wings at the back.
