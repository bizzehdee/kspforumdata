Start a career save, hit Alt\u002BF12. Cheat yourself large amounts of money and science. Upgrade all the buildings. Go into R\u0026amp;D, and unlock all tech nodes. Voila: all parts and all building features are available right from the get-go, as is practically infinite money. And yet, you have all the career trappings. There\u0027s tourist contracts, all the buildings are accessible and functional, and so on and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing that is different is that Kerbals don\u0027t have level 5 in all three professions by default.
