The problem is that I am trying to change out(upgrade) a docking port from a jr to a regular using KIS and it keeps telling me that there are parts attached to it. I suspect this is because after undocking it was changed to the root part of the ship. I tried to edit the save file and I have had no luck editing the right numbers so far. I have searched all over the forums and haven\u0027t found what I am looking for. In the KIS thread someone was asking about the same thing to no avail. Since this is because of how KSP handles decoupling I am asking here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T19:46:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blnk2007**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T02:30:48Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663-1-0-Magico13-s-Modlets-%28Field-Experience-Sensible-Screenshot-etc-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107663-1-0-Magico13-s-Modlets-%28Field-Experience-Sensible-Screenshot-etc-%29)\n\nCheck out Re3 in the list."},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T03:24:58Z","Content":"1.
