Covers a lot of the basics of orbital mechanics. Struts are your friend. If something is wobbling, add some struts to it stop it. And learn gravity turning to launch loads. It will allow you to lift much more than going straight up. And don\u0027t be afraid to fail. Just keep going, the learning curve is extremely steep. If all else fails, then go watch some youtube videos such as HOC gaming or scott manley and copy some of their designs. That\u0027s all I can say for now.

Are you looking for help designing the modules to interconnect? or are you just trying to join them in space? My RCS tutorial (in my signature) might help you with both, though one thing to note about the former is only like docking ports can connect with each other. Make sure both parts have the same type docking port, and are clear enough around the docking port that the ships won\u0027t collide while docking or docked, or you\u0027ll run into spontaneous explosion issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Sorry I misread your intial post and thought you said \u0022I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E build a rocket to get to orbit.\u0022 For help with actual rocket design, take a look at my other tutorial on rocket design (also in signature). It\u0027s a bit long winded but should answer any questions you have about that.
