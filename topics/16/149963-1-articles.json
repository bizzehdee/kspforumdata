I didn\u0027t know there were any set formulae for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, there are the formulae for orbital mechanics, and the drag equation, so if you combine them you end up with a set of rules telling you whether you\u0027ll reenter or just sail though the atmosphere and emerge the other side (assuming no lift). Or they\u0027ll tell you the maximum g-forces or heating effects experienced during reentry. And if you integrate lift into the equations for orbital mechanics, you\u0027ll also be able to know whether a \u0022skipping\u0022 reentry is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, those formulae are necessarily based on the density of air at different altitudes, so I think what your question comes down to is \u0022how well is the Earth\u0027s atmosphere modelled on Kerbin\u0022, and \u0022how lifelike is the game\u0027s drag model\u0022, since the game is essentially simulating all that in real time.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I suppose the answer to both those questions is \u0022getting better with each release\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere cannot be equivalent to Earth\u0027s because the planet is so much smaller. On Kerbin, you can dive into the atmosphere and come out the other side in a couple of minutes. The planet is smaller and the atmosphere is much more \u0022round\u0022. Therefore you have a lot more room to maneuvre (missing your target altitude by 0.5% of the orbit\u0027s radius is probably not going to be fatal on Kerbin, but would very definitely be fatal on Earth).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I don\u0027t know whether this answers your question, because I don\u0027t know what the reentry formulae are to start with. As for \u0022has anybody run them\u0022, well the game is essentially running the relevant equations all the time. As to whether they do so faithfully to real life, I couldn\u0027t say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
