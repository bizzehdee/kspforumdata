I tried KSP on normal difficulty but found it far to easy (had the entire tech tree unlocked in 3 days) so I\u0027m running my career in Hard Mode. Money doesn\u0027t seem to be a huge issue yet. I have 290k in the bank which I\u0027m hopping is enough to build a space station and satellite network. I would prefer to launch pieces of the station up remotely to avoid having a cluster F of pods all over the place (happened to me last time, probably just me being dumb again?). Now that I think about it, I could probably just launch the whole station up in one go?

Your satellites have an omni antenna. This means that it will connnect with anything in range of that antenna, with a dish, both dishes have to be in range and pointed at each other. Cones are for pointing at planets or moons. If you point at a planet or moon a satellite will only connect with things that are within the cone, the smaller the cone angle the further out you have to be to connect to things orbiting the planetary body you are pointed at. Your satellite design is a good start, you could probably put a small dish on top so that you can take it out to KSO and then just point the dish at Kerbin.
