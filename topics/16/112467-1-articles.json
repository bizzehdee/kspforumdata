Do a proper gravity turn (i.e. not \u0022climb to 10km, then wrench the nose to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u0022) and keep the nose close to prograde. That\u0027s all there is to it, really.\n\nSo, if you\u0027re flipping: tailfins. And gimbal. Strapping a quartet of Thuds to your core booster is an easy way to substantially boost your gimballing ability. You\u0027ll also gain a large benefit from onion or asparagus staging; run fuel lines from the radial boosters to the core, so that the core is still fully fuelled when you drop the boosters.\n\nSomething like a Skipper/Thud core surrounded by onion-staged Mainsail LFBs should do the job fairly easily. But, yes, it\u0027s going to be a bit heavy; a 36 ton payload is not a small lift."},{"CreatedByName":"Delta_scientist","CreatedById":145713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:06:52Z","Content":"I\u0027m using Mechjeb."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:07:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u003Csnip /\u003E But, yes, it\u0027s going to be a bit heavy; a 36 ton payload is not a small lift.\n\nYep. Very much this - let\u0027s see what we can do with https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026viewfull=1#post346702\u0027\u003ETemstar\u0027s guidelines to help you out. 36 tonne paywad = 240 tonne rocket. 1.5 TWR on the pad = 3528 kN thrust. 22% thrust in the core = 776.16 kN (a Mainsail set to 56% thrust). Three booster pairs = 458.64 kn (Skippers set at 81% thrust). Mainsail weighs six tonnes, Skippers weigh three = 24 tonnes of engines. 240 tonnes total - 36 tonnes paywad - 24 tonnes engines = 180 tonnes remaining. Three tonnes (conservatively) for decouplers, FINS, and nosecones = 177 tonnes left, divide that into seven stacks for fuel = 25.28 tonnes per stack. You could do that with an X200-32 and partially drained X200-16 tank.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m using Mechjeb.\n\nMakes absolutely no lick of difference. Set your Mechjeb up such that you begin turning at 5 kilometers and you\u0027re at 45 degrees at 15,000 kilometers. If you\u0027ve added fins and still have problems, try adding a Large ASAS module or two. And MOAR FINS. Finny finny fins...might suggest fins on the core too, not just the boosters; no telling where you\u0027ll be when Mechjeb decides to cut loose that last booster pair. If you\u0027re high enough, great; if not, you\u0027ll want them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T15:12:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 03:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:17:59Z","Content":"I\u0027ve built some SSTO rockets : [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123195-Cygnus-family-Recoverable-SSTO-Rockets-from-12-to-236-tons](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123195-Cygnus-family-Recoverable-SSTO-Rockets-from-12-to-236-tons)\n\nTry the M3-39 model.
