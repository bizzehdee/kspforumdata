Temperature requires 50 charge and gravity 600. If the power runs out then the process doesn\u0027t slow, it stops completely even if power is restored. So, you have to be sure to have enough battery capacity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo permanently run research to convert the data into science requires more than 6 PB-NUKs and less than 7, so somewhere between 4.5 and 5.25 charge per sec. So, 4 smaller extendable panels will do it with good light exposure or one gigantor is over-kill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
