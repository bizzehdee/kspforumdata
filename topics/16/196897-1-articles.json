At this point the only thing you can do is grab the target ship with a Claw part (if you have them) and transfer the Kerbal to the rescue ship. Or you can try to land with the target clutched by the Claw, but that is unlikely to go well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-13T22:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a second kind of \u0022recovery\u0022 contract, that applies here.

It requires a bit of save file hacking. If you can find the craft in the list of VESSELs (It shouldn\u0027t be too hard, it\u0027s the only one with a single part after all) and change that part to a Mk1 command pod, your Kerbal can then get out of it.
