I haven\u0027t been on KSP in a long while, and before I left I remember being really frustrated with trying to build spaceplanes or even fixed-wing aircraft of any variety. When I tried Kliper-style vertical launch something would always spin out of control, or snap off, or I\u0027d get a bad stage separation that ripped off my engines. I tried horizontal take-offs, but those were even more disastrous, as everything I made just listed lazily to the left until it wingtip caught pavement and the whole thing cartwheeled itself to death. At least one I know COULD fly, I managed a weird hybrid take-off from the runway involving stabilizing clamps and it flew all the way to 60000m before running out of fuel. I even got the same results when using premade ships from mods and the vanilla game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I\u0027m trying again, and guess what? The results are the same. I just don\u0027t get what\u0027s wrong. I have symmetry on everything as close as I can possibly get it. The center of lift and center of gravity line up; AND center of thrust in the case of rocket-assisted launches. I even installed FAR for the first time thinking it might change at least something, but all that\u0027s changed is the addition of a stall warning to show me just how much I\u0027m failing as my not-Kliper tumbles out of control from the sky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m missing here? I mean, obviously this is something that can be done as I see awesome spaceplanes and other aircraft all over the forums, but I just can\u0027t figure it out for the life of me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T12:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look into the tutorial library:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here especially:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39141-Tutorial-How-to-make-your-first-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39141-Tutorial-How-to-make-your-first-SSTO\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/fAn0Ul8u5gs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/fAn0Ul8u5gs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T13:23:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TerLoki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TerLoki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe center of lift and center of gravity line up; \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft are tricky, and there\u0027s a lot of little things you need to do to get them to fly right, so definitely read the tutorials KerbMav posted.

So hopefully something makes sense to you. When you read it, try not to get too bogged down in the details, but get a general idea overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA picture of what you are designing would help, then we could give you guidance on how to continue on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical launches with space planes is difficult because they are generally, by design, asymmetric from top to bottom. Even if they aren\u0027t too asymmetric, the lift they generate is a lot for a vertical launch. (Unless you\u0027re referring to VTOL.) Is this your goal? Are you planning vertical or horizontal takeoffs? When you say space plane, taking off horizontal is what most people do, but it isn\u0027t required. On takeoff roll, activate the SAS and try not to do any steering adjustments at high speed. That will often cause you to sway leading to a wingtip catching the dirt. However, once most space plane you usually have to accelerate fairly level, usually something less than 20 degrees nose high at higher altitudes. If you\u0027re still pointing straight up, you can get reasonably high altitude but won\u0027t stay in orbit very easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re getting to 60,000m on turbojets level then you\u0027re actually doing really well. After that, it\u0027s a matter of transitioning to jet engines. As for design, make sure your Center of Lift (CoL) is behind your Center of Mass (CoM) by a little bit. Keep the bubbles touching, but behind is a good starting point. The CoL should also be slightly high to the CoM, but that isn\u0027t strictly required. Keep the Center of Thrust (CoT) inline with the CoM. This isn\u0027t all there is to design, but without it your plane will be difficult to control. After that, there are a lot of different ways you can approach your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t used FAR at all yet. I\u0027m saving that till I get bored with stock space planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if any of that as a starter helps.
