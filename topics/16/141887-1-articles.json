Forget the non-retractable wheels exist, don\u0027t fly until T3 runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Use the right wheels for the expected weight, and don\u0027t be afraid to throw in more wheels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Lock steering across the board (if using the small/medium wheels), make sure you\u0027re rudders are adequate for your craft. With the in-ability to limit the steering authority, you\u0027ll be hard pressed to get steering to not throw you off course. THere is a point where it isn\u0027t stupid, but its a very fine line and depends on the mass the wheel is carrying and where its placed. With good rudders, you shouldn\u0027t need wheel steering anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Forget landing is a thing unless you have both a joystick and time to spend creating a plane that can slow itself down to sub 70m/s and still maintain glideslope. Use parachutes instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Don\u0027t attach rear wheels directly to wings. Instead, attach them to your fuselage and then offset them. This will prevent wing flexing (thats caused by your wheels anyway) which can also contribute to you running off the runway. It will look strange if you lose a wing, but at that point looks shouldn\u0027t matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Use the friction override. Rear wheels should be higher than nose wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Don\u0027t be afraid to just drop wheels altogether. On the shuttle type craft I\u0027ve been toying with lately, I don\u0027t use wheels, one because they\u0027re useless on landing anyway, and also because they just look bad when attached to a heat-shielded underbelly. Instead, I use the Space X legs tweakscaled down as landing skids. Looks neat and doesn\u0027t stick out on the heatshielding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AmK7Lxe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022AmK7Lxe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Znath","CreatedById":38611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T06:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hope is 1.1.3\u00A0 or, as I\u0027d like to call it, 1.1.1.1.1 fixes it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, it\u0027s basically \u0022don\u0027t use things with wheels for a while\u0022 since landing gear barely work and rover wheels are made of plastic now.\u00A0 It\u0027s kind of ruined my game experience for a while, but they\u0027ll get it working I\u0027m sure.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T07:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDial back all dampening and suspension..or try full rock hard suspension with no dampening\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above both work on land trains perfectly..
