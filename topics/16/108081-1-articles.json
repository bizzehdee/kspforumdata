I was wondering if I could just take 3 of the rockomax x200-8 tanks which have 360 liquid and 440 oxidiser to begin with and just fill it all with liquid fuel on my next Mun stop?\n\nSo the question is, Can I fill a tank with only liquid or oxidiser if I so wish?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:46:11Z","Content":"Yes you can fill it with only LF but only the specified amount, ie: if your tank is 360 LF and 440 Ox, then you can only fill 360 LF, not more."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelvf","CreatedById":21146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:47:34Z","Content":"ah bugga... thanks for the answer. I was hoping to save dragging a big ass tank up there..."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:48:40Z","Content":"Why not use a Mk3 tank, which only holds LF to begin with? Makes for a more compact rocket.\n\nThe big question is, whether it\u0027s cheaper to fly the fuel out from the ground on Kerbin or fly out a drill and ISRU to make the fuel once you get there?"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelvf","CreatedById":21146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:54:24Z","Content":"I dont have the tech for either a MK3 or a drill yet...

But I learned a lot. Like having an assymetrical mun station with its center of mass way off is really really really impossible to land...\n\nInvader Jim any hints on how to get a connected base down to the ground? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). Or do you just land seperated modules? Does that still count in that contract?"}]}
