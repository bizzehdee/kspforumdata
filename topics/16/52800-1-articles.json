I use AV-R8 winglets for medium rocket stacks. I find that the pivotable winglets are easily the best control source for rockets launched from Kerbin, beating reaction wheels significantly and RCS dramatically. The winglets start to lose control around 30,000 to 40,000 meters, depending on your ascent velocity, and will lose control rather suddenly because of the way the air thins exponentially faster and faster as your rocket accelerates. Sometimes I discover at 35,000 meters that my winglets were holding my rocket together--while watching the thing perform sudden unplanned disassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T04:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe passive ones will also reduce roll, but yes, I was thinking primarily of the active ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T04:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWinglets is a weird term because it\u0027s usually small surfaces at the end of airplane wings.
