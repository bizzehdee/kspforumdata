Add a set of four landing legs and enough ladders for you guy to get all the way down. Then add a stack decoupler, followed by two of the T-800 tanks and an LV-45. Put on a set of 6 radial decouplers and attach two T-800s, a winglet and an LV-30 to each. Make sure to strut that sunuvabitch up tight, add add RCS thrusters as you see fit. Finally, on the bottom of both the LV-45 and the LV-30s, attach stack decouplers and a set of 7 RT-10s. Strut them up and add another set of winglets, and you\u0027ve got yourself a rocket that will make it there, down, up and back.

Don\u0027t try suicide burns until you get good at actually landing.

Other techniques about how you enter the mun\u0027s SOI can have it help slow you down as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are falling toward the mun as it is moving away from you then you will be falling for a longer period of time because of the distance it is moving while you are falling. This gives you extra dV. If you are falling toward the mun as it is moving towards you then you are falling (being sped up) for a shorter period of time, if you then use its gravity to turn your craft 180 degrees then you will be moving in the same direction as the mun and you will be slowed down for a longer period of time as the mun is still moving toward you as you are coasting away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T16:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I ment one can get to the Sphere of Influance and then sit back and wait for the Mun to pass by and pull you closer and what I posted was how close one needed to be inorder to be affected by it. By knowing that. One does not really need to launch when Mun is over head, even though it does help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd from what I remember. The demo allows you 3 active missions.
