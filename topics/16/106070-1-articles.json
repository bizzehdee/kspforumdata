Or have they and I just haven\u0027t heard about it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:09:12Z","Content":"I thought Squad fixed the tendency of the boosters to nose inward on separation.\n\nI certainly know that when I tried an old ship (which had sepatrons placed to counter the nose-in effect) in 1.0 those boosters came off violently flipping nose-out (because of the action of the sepatrons).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThey added new nose cones that are angled. Normally people would put those on the side booster with the point on the inward side (to look like a Proton rocket)... but if you put them on with the nose pointing outward, is the new aero clever enough to push the nose of the booster outward upon separation? (like you see on the British Thunderbird missile.)"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:09:26Z","Content":"[Stock Bug Fix Modules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v0-90-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v0-1-7e-28-Feb-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29) (Claw), updated for 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:12:26Z","Content":"You could try to put a parachute on the lower outer side of the booster and activate decoupler and chute at the same time."},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:23:31Z","Content":"I ran into a similar problem with one particular design.

Of course my 0.9 designs don\u0027t work, because then I often had to lower the decoupler relative to the CoM to prevent the off axis forces from spinning the stack into my engines. Even in 1.0, my stacks often still hit the rocket at first! For some frustrating reason stacks always seem to sit offset on the radial decoupler by default, but I can fix it if I carefully center the booster using offset mode. After doing that, and aligning the CoM of the booster to the radial decoupler center, it all works wonderfully."}]}
