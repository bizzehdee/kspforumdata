It has centre of gravity towards rear, a lot of drag at the front, and is without fins.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe trouble is , if you add fins, you will just mess up the centre of lift on the first stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo , you need to be at higher altitude when going to second stage, where the air is so thin aerodynamic problems won\u0026#39;t matter, and the thrust vectoring from your engine can overcome bad aerodynamics.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis might be tough to do with a single stack of mark 1 engines and fuel tanks, either your first stage will become too tall, and suffer from centre of gravity shifting to the rear as the fuel burns, or the whole rocket will become too tall and wobbly. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is why i suggest putting another column of engines and fuel tanks on the left and right side of the main stack, to give the first stage more power without making everything too tall.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nALSO - If you want to keep your Thuds, put them on radial decouplers like I did.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey are good for getting you up to 240 m/sec as fast as possible, to minimise gravity losses.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter that, you will throttle back anyway, to keep below mach 1 below 10km (wastes fuel fighting drag).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the Thuds are just extra weight and aero drag you are carrying upwards at this point.

Be gentle when maneuvering! This includes thrust control. If you throttle down too much your engines might not be able to keep your rocket on course.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Build an aerodynamic rocket! That means: Center of lift* should be far down, center of mass should be above the CoL sphere during all times (empty tanks in the VAB to see how the CoL will change). This is not mandatory but it helps a lot! The further away the CoL is behind the CoM the more stable the rocket will be and the less likely it flips. But that also means than it will react less on your steering inputs. An easy way to archieve this is to attach wings or winglets at the bottom.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- You want to get out of the lower atmosphere as smooth and efficient as possible. That means the first stage should be large enough to push you at least 30 km high. To be more efficient you should have a TWR of 1.2 to 1.5 during that time.** Also don\u0026#39;t fly too fast or you\u0026#39;ll burn up, disintegrate from aerodynamic forces or needlessly burn your fuel fighting drag. It\u0026#39;s okay if your rocket only flies \u0026lt;300 m/s below 10 km. At 30 km altitude should have a speed of about ~750-1500 m/s (depends on what you can handle) and point to about 30-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- SAS and RCS usually aren\u0026#39;t strong enough to fight atmospheric forces, use gimballed engines and wings/winglets for steering instead.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If it\u0026#39;s too difficult, don\u0026#39;t make a gravity turn and simply go straight up. Of course this is inefficient but at least you\u0026#39;ll get high enough to start orbital insertion without too much interference from the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Center of lift (CoL, blue sphere) and center of mass (CoM, yellow sphere) can be toogled in the VAB in the lower left.\u003Cbr\u003E\n** TWR or thrust to weight ratio is an indicator how fast your rocket can accelerate. At TWR = 1 you hover because you compensate for 1 g of gravitational force. At TWR \u0026gt; 1 you\u0026#39;ll accelerate, at TWR \u0026lt; 1 Kerbin will pull you back to ground. In flight your have an accelerometer at the right of the navball. The acceleration range of 0 to 2 g is marked green. Keep the acceleration at about 1.2 to 1.5 g. As you fly your tanks empty and your rocket becomes lighter. That means your TWR will rise, so keep an eye on that and lower throttle as needed. Don\u0026#39;t forget to increase throttle again when staging.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Beating the upper atmosphere[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Activate your second stage here if you don\u0026#39;t have a SSTO (single stage to orbit).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Your rocket doesn\u0026#39;t need to be as aerodynamic as before. You usually can decouple your fairings at an altitue of ~50 km.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- At the end of the atmosphere (70 km is the border between space and atmosphere on Kerbin) you should point exactly to the horizon. Your speed should be around 2000 m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Note that wings and winglets are become more and more ineffective. Above 40-45 km they become almost useless, rely on SAS, RCS and gimballed engines from that point on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Switch to the map (key [M]) from time to time to make sure your AP isn\u0026#39;t getting too high. Aim for about 90-100 km altitude until you\u0026#39;ll get the hang of this. Throttle the engines or turn them off to do it. Then wait until you\u0026#39;re in space (music will start playing).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Achieving orbit[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n- For a low orbit you\u0026#39;ll need your AP and PE to be within 70-120 km.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Usually your PE is underground when you just reached space because you are not fast enough. Quickly make a maneuver node at the AP in the map view and change it so that the PE is raised \u0026gt; 70 km. The orbit doesn\u0026#39;t need to be perfectly circular, just make sure you don\u0026#39;t end up in the atmosphere again. At the right of your navball there\u0026#39;ll be two times displayed. One is the time to the maneuver point the other one is the time you need to perform that maneuver. Take the later, divide it by 2 and you\u0026#39;ll have the start time to perform that maneuver. Example: Your maneuver point is 10 minutes away. That maneuver takes 3 minutes to complete. 3 minutes dived by 2 is 1.5 minutes. =\u0026gt; You start your maneuver when the maneuver point is only 1.5 minutes away and you\u0026#39;ll end it 1.5 minutes after passing the maneuver point.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Don\u0026#39;t forget to extend your solar and radiator panel(s) and antenna(s).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Also be aware that when you enter the shadow of Kerbin your solar panels won\u0026#39;t generate electricity but your probe will [U]keep draining[/U] it continuously. You\u0026#39;ll have to rely on batteries, engines with an alternator (generates electricity when the engine is firing) or an RTG during that period. [U]If your batteries are empty you\u0026#39;ll lose control of your craft so make sure you archieved a stable orbit before.[/U] When you get back into the sun your solar panels will generate electricity and your probe will power up again. Seriously, that\u0026#39;s an important point! I lost an uncountable number of rockets to this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Maneuvering in space[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When raising your PE be near your AP to do it more efficiently.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When lowering your AP be near the PE to do it more efficiently.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When changing your inclination be near the ascending node (the point where your orbital plane intersects the equatorial plane going \u0026#39;north\u0026#39;) or descending node (the points where your orbital plane intersects the equatorial plane going \u0026#39;south\u0026#39;).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote: Most of the numbers are estimates. I usually follow the approach \u0022If it goes up without going boom it\u0026#39;s fine\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn tech I usually go the lower route where the science experiements and the solar panels are. Once I got solar panels I\u0026#39;ll invest more in new engines and tanks.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T13:32:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by *Aqua*\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
