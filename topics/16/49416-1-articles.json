I think there is a key to toggle between that and the mode where he translates without regard for the camera. So basically if you tilt the camera up/down and then thrust forward/backward (W/S) he should change orientation to match.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is in the Wiki under controls, and also in-game in Settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matteeeo","CreatedById":89209,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T16:22:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI read the wiki guide, but i sill can\u0027t do it. i\u0027ll try to toggle the camera mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
