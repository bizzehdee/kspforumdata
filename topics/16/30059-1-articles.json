The Train got really bad maneuvering as all the RCS is on the Tail, the Space Station is still in its early phase so it can move fairly well, but the docking port is on the side so the only way to see if its aligned is if i switch my control to it but then moving this thing becomes crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sheppard","CreatedById":93282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T21:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame thing happened to me today. I tried to dock another module to my space station using Sr. docking ports, but the magnetic lock won\u0027t engage. Yesterday everything was fine and working. The module was previously attached to a rocket (at 100m from the space station now) using the same Sr. docking port. Also tried to dock the module to another docking port of the space station and the magnetic lock won\u0027t engage. I have a rocket attached to the side of the space station, I undocked it and tried to dock it again in the same place: magnetic lock won\u0027t engage. Not even after quicksaving, reloading, restarting the game. Deactivated ASAS and RCS. Still nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: The modules at the extremes are identical copies. Yesterday I docked the middle section to the first module. All Sr. docking ports are positioned correctly. I have MechJeb and Protractor installed. Docking with MechJeb went just fine yesterday. Today it won\u0027t engage the magnetic lock.
