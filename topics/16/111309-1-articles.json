Thanks to the community here I finally made it to orbit, and after 4 in-game hours, I am ready to come home. It was all a blast, until I just noticed something..I have 30 Liquid Fuel and 35 oxidizer left in my tank, is this enough to get me back? ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png) The engine is a Terrier engine. I hope it is, I know it\u0027s a little..

Just give us the Apoapsis and the Periapsis values. You also need to tell us what the mass of your ship is (ship icon on the right in map view) or what parts it is made of.\n\nOtherwise it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s pretty impossible to tell."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:05:17Z","Content":"Thanks, I hope I can make it.

Coast to Apoapsis and there burn retrograde (slowly) until your periapsis goes down to about 25-30km. Dont be afraid to bring the periapsis very low or even inside the surface if you have a heatshield !\n\npretty sure 30 units of fuel will do the job, and with a margin"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:12:24Z","Content":"Awesome, that is great.
