Now I\u0027ve done my research and I know that EVA \u0027ejection\u0027 at high speed is a bug in the game. I\u0027ve gone and installed the Stock Bug Fixes mod, and it seems to help, but there are still times when I hit that button and my kerbal goes spinning off into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027ve mentioned that I have low vision. I can see well enough to play the game most of the time, and I have even gotten fairly decent at EVA maneuvering, but ONLY when I have a chance to see my kerbal\u0027s position in relation to the ship. With the ejection bug, I have no chance to rotate the camera or get my bearings before I\u0027m god knows how far away, moving god knows how fast. It\u0027s been getting me down lately as I\u0027m trying to do a poor man\u0027s Apollo style rendezvous. It\u0027s \u0027poor man\u0027s\u0027 because I haven\u0027t unlocked docking tech yet, so I have to EVA between the two modules once I\u0027ve got them close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering if anyone\u0027s come up with some techniques or workarounds to deal with EVA ejection. What\u0027s the best way to locate my ship in EVA mode? If I target it in map mode, are there any visual indicators in the regular view that would guide me in? Any other mods I might try in order to fix the bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-10T03:58:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2015 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NFunky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T17:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour best bet is to ensure that there is nothing around the hatch that your kerbal can collide with.
