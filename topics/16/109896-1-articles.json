I probably should have just launched with less Kerbals in the pod, but I elected to have a lander can attached. Looked like this for re-entry\n\n![screenshot1_zpsculydzzd.png](http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m608/Rynjmcd/screenshot1_zpsculydzzd.png)\n\nDirectly attached can with parachute on top.\n\nlanded in the ocean just fine about 8m/s. I was watching from the can, and saw the water splash against the view port, and everything looked fine. When I changed to external camera, however, Jeb was no longer listed as an occupant of my craft. When I went to the space facility to call for a recovery, it only listed just the pod (1 part). Why did I lose the can part? It didn\u0027t break apart on splash down, and I landed ass-first, not on the side. Did it go too \u0027deep\u0027 in the water, and was considered \u0027lost\u0027?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T02:58:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T03:04:36Z","Content":"The crash tolerance for the Hitchhiker is only 6m/s.

If you have anything more than the pod to land, you\u0027ll need a number of radial parachutes and/or engine braking as well.\n\nIn terms of impact, 8m/s is fast. Ideally you should be aiming for 5m/s or less. Visualise a normal modern room, it is probably a little over 2m floor to ceiling. Now think of 4 times that height (8m). Now consider how long a second is. Put all that together, and you can hopefully see that it\u0027s a fast and violent impact."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T07:21:35Z","Content":"You indeed were going too fast. If you can\u0027t visualise how fast 8ms actually is it accounts to 30kmh. And that storage container is a thin and lightweight compartment unlike the command module."}]}
