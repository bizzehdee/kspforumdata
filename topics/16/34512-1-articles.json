That all works out just fine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when i want to close it up with 4 vertical panels, i cant get them to allign decently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm i missign something ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s13.postimg.org/gzqdk20mv/sattalite.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sattalite.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas you can see, i try to close the construction, but this is the furthest i get.
