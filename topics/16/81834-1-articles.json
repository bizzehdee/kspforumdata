It gets to orbit without issues (without cargo, 1.5km/s of dV left at orbital insertion) and while I\u0027m still working out exactly how I want to deorbit (I keep overshooting KSP or coming down too fast and exploding) it normally makes it through alright. As I designed it, it stays extremely stable during the ascent, while during reentry it becomes a super-maneuverable machine (i\u0027m talking pulling out of a 65 degree dive during my last reentry test.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, I want to see if there\u0027s anything I can do that can make it even better! Now the obvious thing is going to be the massive amount of cargo space (Note: I edited the cargo bays to carry fuel internally. This was to save me a headache and because it makes sense. However, I do have a smaller cargo/passenger version in the works that can use a non-fueled b9 cargo bay and still have most of the same performance) that I might not always use, but I\u0027d rather have it, mostly because my docking and utilities structure takes up half of a 6m cargo bay as it is so I\u0027d rather have some empty space rather than cramped conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TkGxC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Shape, size, the placement and number of my intakes, my elevon and rudder settings, etc etc. While what I have certainly works, any tweaks here and there that might help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have a side question regarding the b9 S2 cockpit and RPM. Isn\u0027t it supposed to have more than one RPM screen? Mine only has one and I\u0027m almost certain it shouldn\u0027t. (considering there\u0027s the old b9 screens all over the place) This is a fresh install from a couple days ago, so nothing should be out of date.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk this is what I see with that craft.

Most folks find that very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following is probably going to sound harsher than it\u0027s meant; I wouldn\u0027t be posting this if you hadn\u0027t specifically asked for critique. Just at a first glance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You have more intakes than you need. Also, from a realism POV, the placement means that they would lose their airflow as soon as the wing stalls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You have more sets of landing gear than you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* You have a large displacement between CoM and dCoM. Try to keep it below 1m if you can. Spread your fuel load laterally and keep it close to CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* All of your control surfaces are rear-mounted and conventional (as opposed to all-moving). This may give you pitch authority problems at supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Set your rudders to affect yaw and nothing else. Set your elevons to not affect yaw. Tune max control to personal taste; one person\u0027s \u0022responsive\u0022 is another person\u0027s \u0022unflyably oversensitive\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Are you keeping aerodynamic failures turned on? Your wings appear to be unreinforced; I\u0027d expect them to be easily torn off during over-vigorous manoeuvring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Do you have an abort system (e.g. decoupler behind cockpit, parachutes on the cockpit, both triggered by the abort action group) for when things go wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Do you have any lights aimed at the docking port so you can see what you\u0027re doing during docking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Do you have any downwards-facing solar panels? Single-direction solar is a recipe for disaster on long space flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Have you checked your RCS balancing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Have you unlocked the steering on your front gear?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T23:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk this is what I see with that craft.

By the time I hit mach 3, I take my hands of the controls for the most part. When I need to pitch, its only just to pull my velocity vector above the horizon, in which case I don\u0027t need much authority. The engines are the non-Karbonite fueled jet engines from Karbonite. They\u0027re more powerful that the stock turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWanderfounds post\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo worries, I like criticism when its constructive! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntakes - I could definitely go with less. I just remember reading somewhere that 3 intakes per engine was recommended so thats what I went with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gear was kinda-sorta necessary. Without them, the plane does not like to stay straight going down the runway. I could probably find a sweet spot that stops this, but considering the mass isn\u0027t all that significant I\u0027m not all that worried. It also supports self-taxiing (the motors on the b9 gear are awesome) so I don\u0027t have to wait 5 minutes to get it on and off the runway. I do have the steering set up for the front gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have aerodynamic failures off at the moment, but this was because I had not yet decided on a wing configuration that I liked and supported the craft, so I didn\u0027t want to waste time reinforcing a design if I wasn\u0027t going to keep it. I do plan to turn them back on and then brace the entire craft once the design is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn abort system would be a good idea, i\u0027ll have to look into that. I can dock in the dark, so lights aren\u0027t all that necessary. The solar panels are more just there for aesthetic purposes, as I use two RTG\u0027s as the main power source.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T00:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming the fuel is jammed between the cargo bay and the engine block. It\u0027s better to put your fuel down the sides of your cargo bay with the same CoM as your cargo. That will give you complete payload flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would push your rear gear assembly back and go with a canard on the front. More flexible take-off, landing and ascent profile with less tail strike danger.

Put an I-beam out from the fuselage centerline(level with the wing), mount the gears on that and strut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally prefer to have my CoM/CoL about 2/3 the way down the body of the plane. You get more of the lawn dart effect.

As the plane accelerates down the runway, the wing flexes. As the wing flexes, the steering geometry changes. Fuselage mounting is always preferable if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they\u0027re on the wings to make the nose higher, consider mounting partway up the sides of the fuselage and rotating until they point straight down. Angled gear is as troublesome as wing gear, for similar reasons (suspension flex instead of wing flex, but the effect is the same).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d second the canard recommendation; as well as easing takeoff, it will help in pulling the nose up at extreme speeds and altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may wish to set some of your control surfaces as spoilers.
