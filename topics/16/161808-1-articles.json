Usually, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E players have some of these mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFerram Aerospace Research: Makes aerodynamics more realistic, and in particular gives reentry vehicles more drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb or Kerbal Engineer Redux to help design vehicles\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedural Parts and Procedural Fairings: helps make very large, very small, and oddly shaped parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of these three:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSMURFF: Brings stock propellant tanks and engines more in line with reality, but without all the complexity of Real Fuels\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealism Overhaul: Includes Real Fuels and a wide variety of real-world engines, along with a truckload of other tweaks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReal Fuels-Stockalike: Brings stock parts into line with reality, using Real Fuels, and all the complexity that comes with (ullage, cryogenic boiloff, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for the last three is simple. Because Kerbin is so much smaller than reality, Squad balanced things by making fuel tanks extremely heavy (9:1 full:empty, versus real-world tanks that can exceed 30:1), and by making engines very heavy relative to their thrust output. They also pegged engine specific impulse at approximately the level of the common hypergolic propellants (hydrazine/MMH/UDMH as fuel, NTO as oxidizer), whereas you can get slightly better performance with cryogenics like kerosene-oxygen, and much better performance with hydrogen-oxygen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three of these correct these much closer to real-world values, which helps partially with getting to orbit. In particular, you\u0027ll generally find real-fuels stages will often have more delta-V and burn longer, because with lighter-weight tanks and engines, there\u0027s less incentive to stage off fuel tanks and engines. Also because the delta-V requirements are so much greater, but that\u0027s what you\u0027re trying to address.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Irfzwan","CreatedById":178685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-09T02:58:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlright, thanks for the tips guys, I will be trying to get to LEO this time in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T21:00:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry this \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FAAGJvD1.png\u0026amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fspace%2Fcomments%2F29cxi6%2Fi_made_a_deltav_subway_map_of_the_solar_system%2F\u0026amp;docid=p21JZ6qe_GK59M\u0026amp;tbnid=tOfBkVrjnUOz1M%3A\u0026amp;vet=10ahUKEwj5op70lbTUAhURJ1AKHRJhAaQQMwgxKAEwAQ..i\u0026amp;w=2239\u0026amp;h=2725\u0026amp;client=ms-android-samsung\u0026amp;bih=560\u0026amp;biw=360\u0026amp;q=ksp%20rss%20map\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5op70lbTUAhURJ1AKHRJhAaQQMwgxKAEwAQ\u0026amp;iact=mrc\u0026amp;uact=8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FAAGJvD1.png\u0026amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fspace%2Fcomments%2F29cxi6%2Fi_made_a_deltav_subway_map_of_the_solar_system%2F\u0026amp;docid=p21JZ6qe_GK59M\u0026amp;tbnid=tOfBkVrjnUOz1M%3A\u0026amp;vet=10ahUKEwj5op70lbTUAhURJ1AKHRJhAaQQMwgxKAEwAQ..i\u0026amp;w=2239\u0026amp;h=2725\u0026amp;client=ms-android-samsung\u0026amp;bih=560\u0026amp;biw=360\u0026amp;q=ksp \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E map\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5op70lbTUAhURJ1AKHRJhAaQQMwgxKAEwAQ\u0026amp;iact=mrc\u0026amp;uact=8\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
