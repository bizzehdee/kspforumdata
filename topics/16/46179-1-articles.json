Recently, I wanted to make the rover wheels faster, as the max speed of the fastest wheel is only about 50 mph (23 m/s) which is sort of kind of unrealistic. I scouted in the cfg for the wheel max speed thing, but I could not find it. Does anyone know which parameter to edit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brevillance","CreatedById":78774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T04:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E23 ms is actually pretty fast as most tend to lose control going much faster. Your better off adding engines to the rover. or using time accel. I have looked for the param myself though (i wanted to see if i could make a rover go super fast \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) but never found it. My guess is youd have to look for a specific wheel though, and not all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeffrey Overclock","CreatedById":98505,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T07:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been looking in to this and I have had success but I just figured it out and am still working on it. It is the second number in the groups of numbers under torque curve in the c.f.g. file. I added about 800 to each of these numbers I copied it so I can paste it for you.
