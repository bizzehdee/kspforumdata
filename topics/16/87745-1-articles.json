The stock Display cuts off at a certain point ( the (-1234) number turns to (-2345... and cuts off ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClicking on Solar panels directly reveals the output rate, but differently aligned and placed panels have different outputs and if you have 20\u002B panels making screenshots of all of them is not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to measure this? Like some Gauge that tells you the current charge rate, maybe included in a mod (KER sadly doesn\u0027t display this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr does anybody have another idea to get a good measurement of the current energy production of a craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stringyquark","CreatedById":74565,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T11:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50077-0-24-2-Fusebox-electric-charge-tracker-and-build-helper-1-0a-released-24-08-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50077-0-24-2-Fusebox-electric-charge-tracker-and-build-helper-1-0a-released-24-08-14\u003C/a\u003E maybe this will help\n"}]}
