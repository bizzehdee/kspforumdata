They do work most of the time, but at least for some rockets I\u0027ve built they are way off. I don\u0027t have useful logs/ships to hand though. Somewhat related: these commands also hog far too much electric charge, even compared to regular SAS (up to 50x in some cases)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T01:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmm, haven\u0027t had this issue.
