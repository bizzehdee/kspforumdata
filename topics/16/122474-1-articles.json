It is a class C astroid. I\u0027ve never done this before. Would aerobraking a few orbits help with the decrease reentry speed in this case? I haven\u0027t tried it yet, because that will make it an awful lot harder to pick a landing spot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen plenty of pictures of people landing astroids around KSC on this forum.

Aside from just burning a ton of fuel to slow down the asteroid adequately, my best bet would be to use air brakes to help bleed off as much speed as possible before hitting those lethal altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T09:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReducing the speed by aerobraking into a low orbit first might be a good idea.
