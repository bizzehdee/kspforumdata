You would get an object that always stays in the same position relative to Kerbin, which is sort of the same as having an orbit around Kerbin of the same period as Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T10:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, okay thanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-22T10:05:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2016 10:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RA3236\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T15:51:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain thing to be careful of, if you take that approach, is that unless your orbit\u0027s period perfectly matches Kerbin\u0027s, it will slowly drift towards or away from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022towards\u0022 case is more problematic, because if it eventually gets too close and blunders into Kerbin\u0027s SoI, it will do so with nearly zero velocity relative to Kerbin. That, in turn, will result in falling nearly straight at the planet, with a high chance of doom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would happen \u0022silently\u0022 in the background, with no warning to you; then later you have a \u0022hey, where did my ship go?\u0022 moment.
