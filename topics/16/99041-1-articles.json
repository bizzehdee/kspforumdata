Because aircraft in KSP are so much heavier than their real counterparts, I just match the TWRs rather than thrust. This however causes problems as the aircraft are far too slow. I realise that even if I triple the TWR, the aircraft are still too slow. For example, the real Gloster E.28 has a TWR ratio of 0.21. In KSP my Gloster has a TWR of 0.65 but for some reason can\u0027t get above 95m/s (185kts) at 10,000ft (3050m), and at sea level I can only get a pesky 85m/s max, even though my wings sustain enough lift so that the angle of attack is 0.0* at this speed and altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs FAR still \u0027far\u0027 off from real physics?
