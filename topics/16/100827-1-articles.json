Rover instability is a myth. People see their rover rolling and assume that it needs a wider/longer wheelbase; what it actually needs is for them to not use an input method that\u0027s *telling* it to roll. Reaction wheels are your friend! My tiny rover pictured above is taller than it is wide (when crewed) and yet does not flip.\n\nDriving in docking mode is a good starting point, or assigning the rover keys to something other than WASDQE. Docking mode (LIN, not ROT) has the advantage of the SAS actively trying to keep the rover\u0027s upside pointing upwards ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd I like skycrane delivery as a thing, but it\u0027s not very FAR friendly unless you already have very large rocket parts and fairings to fit the whole kaboodle inside; hence all mine are packed in cargo bays and delivered by plane/drone."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T11:18:13Z","Content":"This is one of my earlier rover designs, and a fairly poor one.
