I built this massive ship in orbit (EDIT: pic is mid-build: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ttErZ7B\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ttErZ7B\u003C/a\u003E)...pretty epic and it has all the trimmings. Anyway, I have this sucker loaded up with all kinds of missions for when I get to Jool (landers, sats, station core, etc) but I am having a hard time escaping Kerbin and calculating when and where to start such a long burn. Mechjeb says it will be a 27 minute burn, and it has me starting so far behind prograde that of course my peri drops below the deck...I am currently trying to do multiple smaller burns at prograde to slowly increase apoasis but my new Mechjeb calculations have my DV for the jump increasing to nearly 3,000 or more! This ship is such a pain to turn! Does anyone have excessively large ship transit experience and can offer me some helpful trinkets of advice so that Jeb and his crew can complete mission(s) on Jool?

However, what you can\u0027t do is split the maneuver node across orbits. You\u0027ll need to do a 7 minute burn, cancel the maneuver node, and create a new maneuver node, then do another 7 minute burn, and keep going until you\u0027re done. Maybe some of the other folks here have a trick they like to use, but doing this this way has always worked OK for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"workerbee","CreatedById":131450,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T23:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Empiro, that\u0027s actually exactly what I am doing...I figured out pretty quickly that if I orbit again with the same node, the DV calculations increase. So to \u0022trick\u0022 it, you have to cancel and create nodes every time you come around for a burn.
