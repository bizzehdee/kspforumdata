Judging from how little the trajectory is deviated by the gravity, it looks like 1-2 km/s of intercept speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand of course you can\u0027t aerobrake; if you go too fast, you melt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, learning to make better transfers will both reduce your insertion deltaV, and make it more likely that you could aerobrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the key to a low intercept is that your trajectory must be as similar as possible to that of the target body. the planet is moving very fast. your ship is moving very fast. when you intercept, you have to pay the difference in speed. but think if it was two cars instead. two cars moving at 100 km/h. if they are going in opposite direction, the speed of a frontal crash would be 200 km/h. that would also be the amount of deltaV needed for them to equalize their speed. if they are hitting at 90 degree instead, it means one car has to slow down by 100 km/h in the Y direction, and gain 100 km/h in the X direction; by pitagora\u0027s theorem, it\u0027s an intercept speed of 142 km/h. but if they are moving in the same direction, they are standing still compared to each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe best way to transfer is called hohmann transfer. here you get an example\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Mars\u0022 data-ratio=\u002293.68\u0022 style=\u0022max-width:570px;width:570px;height:534px;margin:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022570\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.ottisoft.com/Activities/Hohmann_orbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can see, the transfer orbit is an ellipse having earth(kerbin) on the closer point to the sun, and mars(duna) in the highest point. this way, when you reach duna, both the planet and your ship are moving in the exact same direction. duna is moving faster than you, and you have to compensate for that, but it doesn\u0027t take much. instead, if your solar apoapsis would extend way beyond, you\u0027re moving across duna\u0027s orbit, and you\u0027re going to have a horribly high intercept speed. which is your case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na transfer window is the time when the planets are aligned so that you can leave kerbin on a hohmann transfer orbit, and reach duna at apoapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\norbital inclination makes things more difficult; for duna you can just make a plane change at a node, but if the difference in inclination is high, a plane change is hellishly expensive (can be as high as 2 km/s for moho) and there can be better strategies. but that\u0027s not a concern right now. at the moment, your objective is to get a hohmann transfer right. try one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother thing to consider is the Oberth effect; it basically means that a prograde/retrograde burn is more efficient if you make it closer to a source of gravity. so going from kerbin to duna is cheaper if you launch from low orbit than if you launch from a higher orbit. And a capture burn is cheaper if you perform it closer to the planet. try to plan the maneuver, you should see that your capture deltaV should lower considerably if you lower your apoapsis from 500 to 50 km. though not enough to salvage the mission, probably, in your case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you have low thrust, and your capture burn lasts several minutes, you\u0027re going to get less benefits from oberth effect - because you\u0027re performing part of your burn far from the planet. oberth is bigger on bigger planets, so it\u0027s important to get close for a capture at duna, and even more at eve or kerbin, while on a minmus intercept it makes very little difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-06T17:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerobraking at Duna can be helpful but also nerve-wracking because the air is so thin you may have to get down as low as 13kms to have much effect.
