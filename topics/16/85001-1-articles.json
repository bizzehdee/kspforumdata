I have a ion-based probe that can go anywhere for just under 31000 funds (including launcher and transfer stage, and it can almost certainly be done more cheaply), sit in low orbit and transmit temperature readings every time a contract asks for science data. Every time that happens I make far more funds than the probe cost in the first place.
