The physics takes a bit of time to explain but it is cheapest to get your periapsis as low as you dare via small correction burns and then burn retrograde when you hit periapsis. It is cheapest to do those correction burns as far out as possible (before even entering the SOI) but it requires you to be more accurate and time warp tends to shuffle it up a bit. I tend to try and get the periapsis as close to 0 as possible right after my exit burn from Kerbin, again about halfway through the trip and then some fine adjustments as I enter the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T12:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea really, really useful thing to do is to open up the games settings.cfg file, and find the line that says\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd change it to say\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you do this, instead of getting weird squiggly lines of dubious value when your future path passes through a world\u0027s SOI, the patch will be drawn in the frame of reference of the object (So it looks like a normal hyperbola) and at the current position of the object (So you can hit Tab a few times and center on it for a really close view.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.18/Screenshots/screenshot259.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot259.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result being that, weeks or months before you reach your destination, you can pop a maneuver node a few hours ahead of your ship, run your time accel up to 5x so things stop jumping around, center the map screen on your destination, and spend a few minutes finessing the maneuver node that will move your periapse and arrival trajectory close to where you want them, and spend maybe a 10-15 m/s of delta-V doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also makes it a hell of a lot easier to plot circularization nodes inside the SOI before you reach it, if that\u0027s something you want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use Mechjeb, the Maneuver Node editor allows you to change CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE in-game, and there are a couple other mods that do the same thing, but personally, I change it in the settings.cfg as soon as I install a new version, as I have no use for any other mode than Mode 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you /have/ waited until you just crossed the SOI boundary, and your periapse is reasonably close to the planetary surface, Then the thing to do is to perform a Radial- burn to put your periapse where you want it to be, and do your aerobraking or engine braking there. If your periapse was reasonably close to the surface to begin with, in most cases where you\u0027ve just crossed the SOI boundary, the angular distance you have to move it will be small, and the cost of the burn will be low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning retrograde when near the SOI boundary on a hyperbolic trajectory to reduce periapse gets expensive quickly.
