I landed on Minmus today and was pretty happy about it. Had a lot more fuel left over than I thought I would so I puttered around a bit collecting lots of EVAs, temps, seismic readings, etc. Had a boatload of science reports stored in the capsule and then I went to store some more and suddenly they were all gone. All of it. I re-took what I could but didn\u0027t have enough fuel to gather what I had before. When I returned home, I had even less science reports than I left with. I assume that part is a bug (hell the whole thing could be a bug) but it\u0027s a bit frustrating to return from Minmus and only have 70 science to show for it (when I collected well over 500 I\u0027d reckon).
