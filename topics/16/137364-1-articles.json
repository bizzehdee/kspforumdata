I believe that in \u003Cstrong\u003Eany of the big craters \u003C/strong\u003Eyou will find plenty of relatively flat area (if you avoid these smaller kid-craters), so both landing and connecting (docking) modules should be easy (relatively, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ore concentration also seems to be quite good in these craters, but I recall from the last scan that that other crater, slightly on the southern part (of course, I do not remember its name ;)) has the biggest on the globe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout connecting modules, if you use docking ports, you need precision. But you might want to experiment with the Claw instead - the slope or angle does not matter in that case. You could connect the modules with your eyes closed. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T20:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeploy a rover to find the best place!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
