Ship design as in building enough fuel for the round trip into the thing, piloting as in being able to land safely. Landing on Minmus is technically easy and forgiving because the gravity is very low, and as a result even inefficient landing trajectories don\u0026#39;t cost much fuel. Or at least, not enough to worry about if you\u0026#39;ve designed enough into the ship to make the round trip in the 1st place :).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs to actually landing on Minmus, at least to start with, the EASIEST (but far from the most efficient) way is to get into a circular orbit at about 15km. Your ship will be moving about 250m/s. As you start to pass over a nice, flat area, [b]make sure your navball is in surface mode, not orbit[/b] then burn full throttle retrograde until you kill off your horizontal velocity. You\u0026#39;ll know when you\u0026#39;ve done that because the retrograde marker will be at the center of the blue end of the navball. And you can tweak it there by putting your nose on the opposite side of the retrograde marker from the center of the navball and burning a little. So now your ship is falling straight down. Rotate so its pointing straight up so it will hit on its feet and burn gently now and then to keep your speed between 30-50m/s. As you get close to the ground, burn a bit harder and more often to slow down to about 10m/s, then just above the ground burn some more to touch down as gently as possible. Welcome to Minmus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for getting home, that depends on how much use you make of Kerbin\u0026#39;s atmosphere. We will assume you landed near Minmus\u0026#39; equator so have minimal need for a plane change on the way home and make several aerobraking passes. So, the return trip will need about 250m/s to get back into low orbit around Minmus, then about 250m/s to transfer back to Kerbin with a Pe there of about 37km. That Pe will make you land on your 2nd time around Kerbin, although you have very little control over where you come down, and you\u0026#39;ll be fire on reentry heat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, when your lander is on the surface of Minmus, it needs an average of about 500m/s still in the tanks to be able to get home the quick and easy way. with a bit or reserve. It will need a bit more if it\u0026#39;s far from Minmus\u0026#39; equator, and it will need a few hundred more if you want to circularize your orbit at Kerbin, then de-orbit at a spot you choose to land in a specific area (near KSC or at least not in mountains). And you might also want some margin for error. So design it for something between 500-1000m/s depending on how confident you feel and how exactly you want to come home.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOK, that\u0026#39;s getting home. Then, if you do the very inefficient landing profile outlined above, you need about 350-450m/s for the landing itself (providing some reserve). Thus, your lander design needs a total of about 1000m/s (if you\u0026#39;re confident in your abilities) to 1500m/s if you\u0026#39;re not. So that\u0026#39;s the lander. Next step back in the mission is getting from Kerbin into orbit at Minmus. It\u0026#39;s about 1000m/s for the transfer burn to get there and about 300m/s to achieve orbit on arrival. Call it 1500 to be safe, in case the inclination causes problems, and put the lander on top of a transfer stage with that amount of fuel. All that\u0026#39;s left is getting this off the ground, which takes a lifter with about 3300-3700m/s these days, depending on ascent profile.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T16:51:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrOsterman","CreatedById":153514,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T17:00:41Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Kerbart\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy advice would be to start in Sandbox mode instead, and practice the [ ] out of KSP with building ships, orbiting them, docking, making transfers to Mun, Minmus, dock there, land there, maybe go even to Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCareer, in my eyes, is a challenge, not a way getting eased into the game.

You still need a rescue ship, but it only needs enough dV to get to LKO, plus another 920 m/s or thereabouts to match orbit with Jeb as he\u0026#39;s incoming. Therefore the rescue ship doesn\u0026#39;t have to pack the dV to enter Minmus orbit, land, take off, and head home. Thus, Jeb\u0026#39;s ability to head home on his own shaves a good 500-600 m/s off the dV requirements for the rescue ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027eddiew\u0027]Turn off heating and it\u0026#39;s probably viable, especially with the new water...
