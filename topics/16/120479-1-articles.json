That said, its quite alot of dV if you happen to do the transfer during one of the less efficient times, so it kinda requires you to wait until dres is closer to the An or Dn which seems to make it easier to get capture for me. Also, even with maximum efficiency, you are looking at ~3000 dV to pull it off, since it is ~1500 to eject to dres, then ~1000 to get in orbit, and then anywhere from under 300 to over 500 for the plane correction burn (i never do plane changes right on An/Dn, i always do it after as its less dV wasted and if i insist on a circular clean orbit with no inclination, ist cheaper to alter it once in dres orbit then before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
