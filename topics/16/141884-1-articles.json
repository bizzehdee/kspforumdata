If you raise your apoapsis to Duna\u0027s orbit you can make a small adjustment there to adjust your orbit so that in a few orbits time you\u0027ll get another intercept with Duna. This will take a lot of time but use very little delta-v. On the other hand you can raise your apoapsis well beyond Duna\u0027s orbit in order to slow down and let Duna catch up. This will take more fuel on the way out and more fuel when you capture at Duna as well. The third option is to raise the apoapsis to roughly the same as Duna and then circularize and adjust to get an intercept further around the orbit. This will take a fair amount of delta-v for the circularization but your capture burn at Duna will be fairly cheap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T00:51:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPictures!

If this makes Duna go toward you, great. Keep pulling until it gets close enough to get an encounter, unless that burn will take a LOT of dV. You don\u0027t want your Sun orbit to go higher than Duna\u0027s, either.
