Basically, for any particular burn (strictly whenever the engines being used are changed or non-propellant mass is decoupled) the formula boils down to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeltaV = Isp * g * ln(m0 / m1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere m0 is the total mass at the start of the burn, m1 is the mass at the end of the burn, Isp is the effective Isp of the engine(s) in seconds and g is 9.80665 m/s^2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to calculate the deltaV that stage 2 should have we just plug in the numbers (assuming the engine is an LV-T45 and there is 2t of fuel to be burned):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeltaV = 320 * 9.80665 * ln(6.833 / 4.833)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeltaV = 1086.72 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the 612 m/s from stage 3 this gives a total of 1698 m/s. As I said on the previous page, adding in the kerbal\u0027s EVA backpack of approx. 600 m/s gives 2298 m/s which should be just enough if you can do the EVA burn accurately (and quickly) enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for doing it in your head, yes, natural log is harder to estimate than log in base 10 but you can still get a ballpark figure using these rough values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=width: 500]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Mass ratio (m0 / m1)[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]Approx. deltaV[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]1.65[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]5 x Isp[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]2.7[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]10 x Isp[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]4.5[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]15 x Isp[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]7.4[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]20 x Isp[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might find it easier to generate your own list based on percentage of mass of fuel, e.g. 10% would mean the burn is using 10% of the whole mass, so m0 / m1 = 1/0.9 = 1.111, 20% =\u0026gt; m0/m1 = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25, etc. You can stop at 90% as the wet/dry tank mass ratios in KSP never get much better than that (except when using RF/RO).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T12:57:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 12:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T12:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve been caught out by KER doing that, assuming I\u0027ll decouple parts of my ship before I actually will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point your best solution is probably to fly off Tylo then bail out and jetpack to orbit.

Quick math shows it takes a dV of about 200m/s to reach 10km in Tylo\u0027s gravity and it takes around 2030 dV to orbit Tylo at 10km so an orbital dV of 2070 is really close to an idealized engine (infinite TWR).
