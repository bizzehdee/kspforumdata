ways:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAs free-wheeling bearings due to being acted on by forces applied to parts attached to the rotor.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs electric motors which can be started/stopped, throttled, and reversed\u00A0manually by the player.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs electric motors running in a pattern as\u00A0part of an animation

eliminate) the rotor\u0027s motor in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E, then attach the parts that will cause the bearing to rotate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2 is used for helicopter rotors, airplane props, etc.\u00A0 To do this, 1st you need adequate power to run the motor.\u00A0 Then you need to set up action groups for the various things the rotor can do.\u00A0 Motor on/off, motor RPM, motor torque, motor direction.\u00A0 For helicopters, generally RPM is constant and torque is mapped to a control axis so can be set at intermediate values depending on need.\u00A0 So you\u0027d have a single button for on/off, then a control axis for the torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3 is used for strange contraptions, such as epicyclic amusement park rides :).\u00A0 Here, you need both power and a KAL1000 animation controller.\u00A0 To program the animation sequence, you go to the action group menu and put the various rotor control functions on the KAL1000.\u00A0 Then you open the KAL1000\u0027s display and set up the sequence there on the timeline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-13T16:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAddition: For #2, you will either need a free
