For a while ihad it taking 5% of funds to convert to science. My question is - does it stack? Say take a contract and lose 4000 funds, but i need 12,000 to get a science point. Would it stack so that when i did my next mission and say i lost 6000 funds, i now would have 10,000 funds towards science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T14:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience points are not whole numbers. They appear as whole number most of the places, but it\u00A0really can have a fraction. Hypothetically if a 5% strategy has conversion rate 10k-\u0026gt;1sci, then a 20k fund contract will just become \u002B19k fund, \u002B0.1sci, which may still show up as \u002B0 sci.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jakeb1993","CreatedById":125340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T14:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it doesn\u0027t show but it still adds it then.
