For the future, though, it\u0027s possible to get by with almost no debris if you plan your launch with that in mind. For most of my launches, I try to put as much energy as possible into my orbit BEFORE my periapsis leaves the atmosphere, and at that point I jettison any stage I don\u0027t still need; thus, I almost never leave debris in Kerbin orbit, because almost all of it falls back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tommygunyeah","CreatedById":57083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T10:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of people who play by the no littering rule, a lot of the main ideas have been posted but try to think about how you can get all your parts to de-orbit when you\u0027re testing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
