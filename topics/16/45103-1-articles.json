I think the throttle is stuck on at a low amount, as my rover just starts off rolling and picks up some speed and actually rolls up some hills. I have been unable to stop it from moving (I just end up rolling it and exploding). I can even disable the motor for all 4 wheels and it keeps on going... I am in some hilly terrain which makes it hard to see the horizontal, but I drove for a while in one direction and did a 180 and drove all the way back, so I don\u0027t think I\u0027m rolling downhill!
