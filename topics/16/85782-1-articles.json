But here\u0027s the way I think of it, which keeps things blindingly simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn almost all practical cases, your craft will be operating at its most efficient when it\u0027s going the fastest. That\u0027s because fuel consumption is proportional to time (assuming constant throttle), and going faster makes you cover more distance per unit of time. And how do you go fastest? You go fastest by getting up where the air is very very thin and there\u0027s not much air resistance to slow you down. So the most efficient altitude in KSP is generally the highest altitude your craft can sustain, and going as fast as you can there. This is true whether you\u0027re playing with stock aerodynamics or FAR/NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it\u0027s true that a KSP jet engine\u0027s Isp changes with altitude, in practice the speed pickup significantly more than compensates for that under practically all circumstances. I\u0027d actually be curious to see an example of an aircraft where this isn\u0027t the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA spacecraft in orbit above the atmosphere has infinite \u0022fuel efficiency\u0022 (if you want to think about it that way)... it will go as many miles as you like with no thrust at all.
