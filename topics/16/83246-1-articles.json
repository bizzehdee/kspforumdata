The basic landing sequence consists of the opposite maneuvers in reverse sequence: a \u0022deorbit\u0022 burn to convert your circular orbit into a suborbital trajectory, and a \u0022landing\u0022 burn to set your rocket gently down on the surface.\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Landing\u0022 burns, if they are performed as the EXACT opposite of the \u0022takeoff\u0022 burn, are known as \u0022suicide\u0022 burns.

Because the ideal \u0022suicide\u0022 burn involves your rocket firing its engines in one full-power blast that starts just early enough to bring the rocket to a halt just as its landing gear touches the ground.

Ultimately you will need a combination knowledge and experience to get them just right with maximum efficiency and accuracy every time. In my experience, as stated above, line up and lower your orbit through your desired landing site, then set up a node right at the point where the orbit line intersects the surface. This is the first point where you need experience over knowledge because the map screen planet models don\u0027t match perfectly with the actual terrain so you must make an educated guess based on past experiences. Then, as Dematt said, pull retrograde until the node flicks back \u0026amp; forth to null your velocity. Now if you want a suicide burn that is safe and fairly accurate, start your burn when burn length and time to node are equal. This will give you plenty of leeway but also bring you to a halt before you reach the landing site, and still a little ways up above the surface. To get as close as you can you have to wait a length of time after your burn time and time to node match. Exactly how long depends on your thrust to weight and the difference between the map terrain and the real terrain and only experience can tell you(and it can often be wrong as well). It is a nerve wracking couple of seconds I can tell you. Good luck \u0026amp; Happy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebNeedsHelp","CreatedById":117002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T06:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeMatt, I just tried what you said for a Mun landing, and still chickened out a bit, starting the burn early just because it looked like I was picking up a lot of speed falling.
