The rockets are just a means to this end, getting the payload to where it needs to be to perform its mission. The bigger the payload and the longer the trip (including return if desired), the bigger the rocket (EDIT or the MUCH greater time of flight) you need. So basically, rocket size is solely a function of mission parameters as embodied by the payload. Sometimes you need a big rocket, sometimes you don\u0027t. A small rocket won\u0027t work where you need a big rocket, so in that case, bigger isn\u0027t just better, it\u0027s required.

I read that you mentioned using solid rocket boosters to get to 8 KM, you haven\u0027t mentioned if you are using single stage rocket, multiple staged rocket, serial staging. Or bad asparagus stage method or efficient asparagus stage method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I know a lot of people have said, including yourself that bigger is worse. I actually believe bigger is better in principle. The most important technology in rocket design, in both kerbal and real life technology, is how thin can you build a fuel tank before it the pressure of the fuel bursts it like a balloon. In kerbal majority of fuel tanks share the same mass ratio. This mass ratio can never be exceeded, why we use staging. Since we don\u0027t get new more efficient fuel tanks, we rely on staging techniques to get better results. In real life they build bigger and better fuel tanks with greater volume. In the real world it is actually true that bigger is better, the fuel tanks in real life are custom fit to one size as needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may have noticed that after a certain point in serial staging the delta V u get for your fuel mass decreases substantially. This is to do with that fuel tank mass ratio. if you already have a mass ratio up to around 2, including the Ln segment, you could add 2000 more tanks, still get no more delta V. I generally do not build any serial stage rocket beyond a mass ratio including Ln of 1.1. That\u0027s just for efficiency. An asparagus staged rocket works differently. It actually does use the principle bigger is better, serial does not. In asparagus because of the fuel lines, u can think of the craft as being a Single stage rocket that is dismantling itself during flight, rather than serial stage which is two or more small rockets lifting eachother. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you described is actually how I do my rockets as well, I use a serial bottom stage to lift to 8km or above, to give my liquid engines higher isp count.Then Do aspragus for those engines to push it into the atmosphere. I have lately been experimenting with doing solid booster rockets up to around 20km. Reason for this is solid booster rockets have a great mass ratio, perfect for lifting. ALso really cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough this is different to what others say, bigger is better as long as you know how to build it efficiently. Same with human body and fitness. If you think about it logically, all those 100m sprint runners who add muscle to there upper body are adding weight creating drag, they also run straight up creating more drag than running aerodynamically. Technically speaking we run like idiots. makes sense that our ancestors could run so much faster than us. Also waste energy by moving our arms while running, don\u0027t believe me try standing still moving your arms , see if u get anywhere.
