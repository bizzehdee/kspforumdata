I calculated this ratio using the statistics presented by the parts list in the VAB/SPH but the numbers didn\u0027t line up with the discussion between other players, most noticeably for the nuclear engine which is the most efficient engine on the forums, but the least efficient in the VAB.\n\nI understand that high gravity and air drag would massively reduce the fuel efficiency of a rocket, but this effect would be dependent on the lift vehicle as a whole and not which kind of engine you\u0027re using. However the wiki lists the numbers as being different and even lists the fuel consumption rates as being different for atmosphere and vacuum.\n\nWhat is the relationship between atmospheric ISP, specific impulse in vacuum, thrust and fuel consumption?\n\nHow do you calculate Specific Impulse?\n\nDoes the fuel consumption rate for a given rocket change depending on the environment? What, it simply changes?\n\nIs the atmospheric ISP different for different planets?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T08:08:47Z","Content":"The answers to the same question you asked yesterday are here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112495-Calculating-Specific-Impulse-in-Atmospheric-and-Vacuum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112495-Calculating-Specific-Impulse-in-Atmospheric-and-Vacuum)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T14:45:29Z","Content":"Locking this duplicate thread, see the responses in the original thread Pecan so helpfully linked."}]}
