So Recently i downloaded KSP dV map and started building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy new project. The project is Ike rover (Leonardo 1). According to dV map i need 3400 m/s vac. to LKO (80km), etc. 1600 m/s vac. to Duna \u0022hoffman style\u0022 and around\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 500 m/s vac. to catch, orbit, and land on Ike. I know these are harch numbers, but just for reference. Using both KER and Mechjeb to calculate my dV i built something like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pixhost.org/show/3459/29108429_leonardo-1-vab.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://t6.pixhost.org/thumbs/3459/29108429_leonardo-1-vab.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002229108429_leonardo-1-vab.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is ok until i get to lunch pad.
