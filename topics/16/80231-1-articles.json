The easy part is working out your straight-line thrust and acceleration - calculus will let you go straight up and back down, even with gravity and drag.

Oh - and if you stage, jettison anything or reveal/conceal parts that affect your drag you\u0027ll have to work everything out independently for each of those events as well.

It doesn\u0027t give the coasted AP height but rather the dV needed to get to that altitude at Vt. I built this for testing, and it\u0027s typically at some speed above zero. I then calculate actual dV needs by adding or subtracting the differential between test speed and terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I need to test a component at 20,000m (\u002B/- some tolerance), then I need roughly 2,500 m/s of dV to get there. I\u0027m in the flatter range of gravity loss, so not much change in loss there (remember, the slope relates to loss rate). The atmospheric loss is still a bit steep, so I might need to think about adding some dV pad if my test requires a speed a lot higher than terminal velocity. But I don\u0027t want to remove too much dV if my speed is less than terminal velocity because the atmosphere will still drag it off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular chart is done with a what I would consider a fairly standard \u0022basic\u0022 profile without regard to doing one long continuous burn to altitude (I\u0027m not necessarily worried about getting to orbit). I chose this one because it seems to be a reaonably common launch profile for most mid level users who would ask this question, and it seems to work pretty well for me. So this isn\u0027t quite an \u0022optimum\u0022 climb to orbit, but one that follows close to terminal velocity (so maybe not too sub-optimum either). The reason the burn stops is that the craft reaches a point where the apoapsis is in orbit, so you coast to AP and complete insertion (again, assuming you were aiming for orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a chart that is one continuous burn, then this won\u0027t be it.

Not the best, but it works well enough for what I need.
