Also, ring stations would probably end-up in the same situation (the last docking port pair to attached would be located on the same ship)"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:23:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E yes it is possible, though stock parts aren\u0027t extremely bendy to begin with and I\u0027m not sure that there\u0027s a function a vessel docked to itself.\n\nCircular stations."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T13:47:58Z","Content":"Definitely possible.

Making an ascetically pleasing, modular, Mk2 ring station in the SPH was a goal of mine, but I could never get the joints as I wanted. I can abandon it completely now that I know any implementation would be doomed in practice.
