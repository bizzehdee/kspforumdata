Im also quite new to the game but I\u0027m doing okay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question (and context). I\u0027m planning on landing on the mun with a kerbal scientist (first manned landing) however, to keep the weight of the lander down and therefore make for an easier return to the mun orbiter, I am wondering if sending a second lander packed with science parts (which will not return) may be useful? By this I mean land both landers, have the scientist eva to the science lander, gather the data from the science parts, return to other lander, return home. Is this possible without a loss of science points? Can scientists \u0027harvest\u0027 data in this fashion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.s I realise having a single lander would probably be more economical and efficient however, I do not have adequate parts unlocked to do this with a high chance of success.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T16:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t really see the need to make two separate landers. Apart the intrinsic difficulty to land both in the same spot, the small difference in payload would be totally outweighted by the mass of additional required parts (at least a probe core, battery, possibly some solar panel, landing legs, plus propulsion for the science parts lander).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that some parts are not required to be lifted in orbit again (landing legs, spent tanks...) I generally have such landers detach the unneeded parts at take off. All science parts can stay landed, so they are connected to the detached stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T16:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your question, yes, you can do that.

Adding a second lander, even a light one, also makes the whole vessel larger. That said, I have done both. Both have their relative advantages, but both are less efficient than a single minimal lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could just make the lander heavier by adding all the science parts on it and then necessary fuel to land and return to orbit. As Diomedea said, you don\u0027t have to bring everything back up with you, just the the science data that your kebal can pull out of the science parts, meaning you could make a two-stage vehicle for this purpose. I tend to stick with a single stage as they are less complicated and lighter, but either way works. This method results in a bigger lander, which means you need a bigger transfer and return vessel, therefore requiring a larger rocket altogether. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been times I\u0027ve sent probe landers to the surface (mostly dealing with that damned science jr), but I sent multiple probes up on a single launch and landed them at various points around the Mun. This does require landing close to them afterwards, but also allows a smaller manned lander. If you were to send a single probe up you could probably do it on the cheap, but it\u0027d be more economical to send up a few at a time. A single 60k launch is better than 5 25k launches (derp).
