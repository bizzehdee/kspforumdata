So far most of my rockets use asparagus staging and mainsails to do most of the lifting. Is is feasible to use several smaller engines with higher ISP in place of a single large engine? Will the added weight negate the benefits of high ISP? Do I have to use mods to create a rocket that works well with a semi-realistic design?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T01:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing multiple smaller engines is a common KSP practice, and the weight tradeoff depends on the particular engines involved. Remember, though, that mounting multiple engines will require additional parts and their mass, such as this tricoupler arrangement. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fL7SPql.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fL7SPql.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teirusu","CreatedById":65301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T04:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETypically, as long as the mass of the extra hardware and engines is not a significant percentage of your payload mass, (Which it usually isn\u0027t if your making a 2.5m rocket) then you do gain a bit more Delta-V by clustering the smaller, higher ISP engines instead of using the Mainsail. The trick is, however, being able to cluster enough motors to equal, or better, the power of the Mainsail on the bottom of a 2.5m tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re wanting to stay stock many people use the tiny cubic-struts on the bottom of the tank, or the BZ-52 Radial Attachment point, and then there\u0027s the bi/tri-couplers as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re willing to try out mods, then there\u0027s my cluster mount parts.

Performance was so much improved that I got the second stage into Mun orbit with fuel to spare. On that rocker, Mainsails were too much thrust and Skippers not enough thrust for launch efficiency. Disadvantage is that you will get frame rate issues from having four times as many engines firing upon launch, in my case, 28 of them. You will also need separatrons on top of the boosters to protect the second stage from separation damage to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-14T12:16:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2013 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
