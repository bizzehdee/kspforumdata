The other avenues are power consumption and the time it takes to transmit. But the communotron would have to take a lot longer and suck a lot more juice before it became impractical, and then it would be hard to use in the early game. Perhaps the transmission time and power requirements could be tied to the distance from KSC (so a communotron at Duna will take a lot more time/energy than one at the Mun), but that\u0027s getting pretty complex.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
