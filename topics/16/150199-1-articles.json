That\u0027s why it\u0027s a 3-star contract. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I do it is to be in a medium-altitude nearly circular orbit. You calculate (by eye) approximately how many degrees you are gaining per orbit on the ground station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you are half that many degrees behind the station, you burn to put your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E at the right final altitude. That should get you very close to the right spot -- then you circularize. To complete the contract, you have to be just a little\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eahead\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the ground station. So when you get there, if the contract says you are not \u0022above\u0022 yet,\u00A0you have to judge whether you are still a tiny bit too far ahead, or too far behind. Then make your orbit be just a little too big or too small so you slow down or catch up that last little bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
