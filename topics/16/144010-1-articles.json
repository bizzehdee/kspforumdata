I found in v1.0.x, the difference between the orbital calculation for a loaded vessel and that when on rails (the former is done by Unity and less precise) was big enough to cause major problems trying to get to Minmus. I\u0027d get a perfect intercept that would vanish on hitting time warp, while back in real-time it\u0027d constantly flicker between two different orbits, one good one bad.

Your speed when you are out at Minmus\u0027 orbit is so slow that it\u0027s very easy to make minor corrections. So go with your gut, and your first burn. If it said you have a 20km \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you almost certainly do have a 20km \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. Wait until you are out close to Minmus\u0027 orbit. Watch Minmus come closer and closer. Figure out how far 2 million meters is on your screen and measure with your fingers. If it looks like you are going to hit it, then you\u0027re good.
