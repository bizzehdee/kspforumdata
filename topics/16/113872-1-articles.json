Occasionally I\u0027ve seen parts overheat a bit, but mostly in reentry. In game the UI gives no clue as to how much heat is being radiated by the vents, if any, or why they might be used. Can anyone explain to me? I would like to be able to start using them in my new craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:34:10Z","Content":"Radiators pull internal heat from the hottest parts on the craft and radiate it off into space. They are useful for cooling things like LV-Ns during sustained burns, where they will get very hot.\n\nIt should be noted that radiators do NOT affect a parts skin temperature, which is what you build up during reentry.\n\nIf you too are fed up with the arcane magic of the heat system, go into your debug menu (ALT\u002BF12), click the physics tab, and then the thermal sub-tab. THere will be a checkbox option to enable thermal debug data in part GUI. This will then display a ton of numbers as to what\u0027s going on in your right-click menu. There is also a mod to auto-enable this feature whenever you launch your first vessel of a session."},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:38:46Z","Content":"They are intended to be used on very hot engines (Nukes for instance) or power generators (Space station or Moon Base power supplies) or Converter plants that convert the minerals on your Moon bases to Fuel/Oxy/water/food, etc.\n\nThese types of things tend to run for very long times and get very hot. So the raidators would be used to let them bleed off heat into space, or the atmosphere.\n\nThey would NOT work for reentry heating as far as I know, as I believe they are light and delecate like solar panels and would quickly break off if deployed during reentry."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T19:45:43Z","Content":"Quick question folks - what are the stock parts to be aware of when it comes to generating heat?\n\nLV-N presumably, although I gather it\u0027s been toned back in 1.03. Any others?\n\nI ask because I\u0027m midway through a science game at the moment and everything was working fine, although I haven\u0027t unlocked the LV-N yet. Just wanted to check whether I need to redesign any of my ships and or send a hasty radiator module up to my space stations.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:23:19Z","Content":"Historically, big rocket motors like the Mainsail tended to overheat and explode.

A deployed radiator draws heat from and quickly matches temperature with the hottest parts on the craft, no matter their location."},{"CreatedByName":"dresoccer4","CreatedById":141944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T14:08:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No direct connection is necessary.
