\u0022I\u0027m hitting the ground while still going too fast to deploy parachutes.\u0022\u00A0 As far as I can tell, what matters is mainly just the aerodynamics of the ship (i.e. its ballistic coefficient, how draggy it is relative to its mass).\u00A0 So the thing to focus on is the shape, mass, and orientation of your reentering ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(Don\u0027t get me wrong, reentry angle is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esuper\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E important in terms of managing the \u0022hot\u0022 part of reentry, and making sure you can slow down enough without burning up or exploding.\u00A0 For that problem, yes it matters not to be too steep, and yes you want to be going mostly sideways for as long as possible in order to bleed off lots of speed before you get down into the barbecue zone.\u00A0 But that\u0027s a different issue from faceplanting-at-higher-than-parachute-speed, which is what I\u0027m talking about here.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are two main reasons why aero matters so much more than descent angle for this problem:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe air gets exponentially (read: \u0022really quickly\u0022) thicker as your altitude drops, which drastically lowers your terminal velocity, especially when you get below 10 km or so.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag goes up \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efast\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E with speed (it\u0027s the square of your velocity).\u00A0 Craft that are falling much faster than terminal velocity slow down in a hurry.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe practical upshot of this is that by the time you hit the ground, you\u0027re going to be going around terminal velocity.\u00A0 Maybe a little higher than it, but not much higher than it, no matter what your descent angle from space was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, if you\u0027re having faceplanting problems, the thing to do is to manage the design of your reentering ship so that it has a reasonably low terminal velocity (i.e. significantly less than 200 m/s at sea level).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are various ways to do that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nlower

one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some examples of \u0022good\u0022 and \u0022bad\u0022 designs (from the standpoint of \u0022faceplanting

parachute and maybe a heat shield.\u00A0 It\u0027s naturally stable in the draggy (i.e. butt-first) direction, which helps for slowing down.\u00A0 And it has very low mass hiding behind that 1.25m footprint.\u00A0 These reenter like a dream.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA Mk1 pod, on top of an empty (or mostly-empty) 2-ton LFO tank, on top of a Terrier.\u00A0 (Note, no heatshield needed-- this ship can reenter just fine without a heatshield from LKO, as long as you do so engine-first.\u00A0 The Terrier is pretty heat-resistant.)\u00A0 This design works because you can get \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egreat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E help from body lift.\u00A0 Fly it engine-first all the way down.\u00A0 As soon as you\u0027re finished with the hot part of reentry, use the torque from the command pod to angle it with the engine leading \u0022high\u0022 and the command pod in the rear pointing down at about 30 degrees below retrograde.\u00A0 Angling it like this will generate a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of body lift.\u00A0 So much, in fact, that you can actually stop your descent and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eclimb\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a kilometer or two when you get down to 12km or so altitude!\u00A0 Keeping that body-lift attitude will bleed your speed down so low that you\u0027re going a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E slower than 200 m/s by the time you get down to parachute-deployment altitude.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA long

and, again, make lots of body lift.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPretty much any ship that has fins or wings near the middle, ideally slightly behind the CoM.\u00A0 Not too far behind, or you\u0027ll lawn-dart it.\u00A0 Not ahead, or you\u0027ll flip over backwards.\u00A0 But with wings/fins just slightly behind the CoM, you can generate tons of lift to slow

is a Mk1 command pod sitting on top of something light and fluffy, for example a stack of two Science Jr. material bays.\u00A0 The problem there is that it wants to fly pod-first because that\u0027s where the CoM is, and the command pod is too aerodynamic when it\u0027s flying pointy-end-first, and if your ship is too aerodynamically stable, you get locked in that nose-first attitude and
