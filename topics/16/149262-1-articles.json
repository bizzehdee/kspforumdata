Neither the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Advanced Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003EASAS\u003C/abbr\u003E nor the flight computer can actually align to the node - they just circle around it always over-correcting and wasting precious monoprop. I\u0027ve checked in both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E buildaid and as the manouvers are conducted and there\u0027s no errant \u0027spin\u0027 imparted by unbalanced \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
