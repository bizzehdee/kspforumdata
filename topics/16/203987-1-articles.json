When I move controller 4 it just sets controller 1 to the same time as 4 instead of setting the time to what I have set in the graph. You can see that 4 is set to the max position, and 1 has followed 4 perfectly instead of following the value set in the \u0022Play Position\u0022 field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222lbopoo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2lbopoo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what I\u0027m missing?
