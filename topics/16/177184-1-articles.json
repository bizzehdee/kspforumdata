also called \u003Cem\u003Elinear\u003C/em\u003E) controls available as separate key bindings, so a PC player can use both at the same time.\u00A0 On consoles, you have to choose between one and the other by using docking mode.\u00A0 For docking mode, you hold\u00A0either the left or right bumper\u00A0and tap Y, and then you can switch between rotational and translational controls by tapping A, though I have not done this for myself to know for certain (I\u0027m not actually a console player; I\u0027m just trying to help).\u00A0 Since apparently tapping A is also how you stage in flight mode, be careful--though I suppose you\u0027ll figure out very quickly whether you successfully got into docking mode when you try it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf you want to practise docking, then I suggest that you build a set of docking drones.\u00A0 A docking drone is literally a flying \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel tank with a probe core, thrusters, docking port, and whatever electrical and communication equipment you need to operate it.\u00A0 They\u0027re compact and responsive, so they\u0027re easy to fly if you use a light touch; they\u0027re cheap and\u00A0expendable, so you don\u0027t need to worry about losing Kerbals or anything terribly expensive if you make a mistake;\u00A0and they\u0027re lightweight, so\u00A0you can stack two and send them up on the same lifter, which is how we solved the rendezvous issue before the Debug-Menu \u0027Set Orbit\u0027 command existed.\u00A0 They also have a second life:\u00A0\u00A0if you like, you can use them as assembly tugs to build a space station after you\u0027re good at docking, though for that you probably ought to include a reaction wheel in the design.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf you\u0027re asking\u00A0how\u00A0to \u003Cem\u003Eaccomplish \u003C/em\u003Edocking, then please let us know because that is practically its own topic.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EHowever, I will say that while high orbit is easy for learning how to dock, I\u00A0recommend that you work on low-orbit docking as soon as you think you can do it.\u00A0 Most orbital docking is going to occur in low orbit, so understanding the high speeds and shifting angles is important.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-01T14:41:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2018 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-01T18:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking your approach along the normal axis can also help with the shifting angles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-01T19:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only ever dock in \u0027normal/anti-normal\u0027 angles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I still have all my hair!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually, I\u0027ll have the \u0027dockee\u0027 (ship/tanker to be docked to) in anti-normal (facing directly South) and sneak up from the bottom just because that seems the most natural angle for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-02T10:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont know if this is true for all presets but in cursor u dont need to go in dockingmode for translate x,y,z.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn ps4 u hold r1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nr1\u002Bl2/r2 forward/backwards\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nr1\u002Bleftstick up/down/left/right\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave to be the same buttons on the xbox Controller, sorry i dont have the buttonlayout in my head for xbox\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
