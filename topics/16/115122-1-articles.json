With a veeery shallow reentry path and Airbrakes, it survives the new reentry heat relatively safe, maybe even at 110%. But every time, when I\u0027m already quite slow and the ship is cooling down again, the \u0022bottom right\u0022 of my Aerospikes explodes due to overheating and destroys everything.\n\n![k0irodP.png](http://i.imgur.com/k0irodP.png)\n\nAs this happens every time with this setup and is easy to recreate, I could track down that it is not even the atmospheric heating, but absurd Radiation values even with already 1600K Skin temp, so I\u0027m absolutely sure this is a bug.\n\nDid I miss something? Is this a known issue? Any workaround known, or do I just have to disable Convective Flux as well as Radiation in the debug menu to land Jeb safely?"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T19:20:07Z","Content":"Got more pictures, say one on the pad or VAB?"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T19:56:29Z","Content":"It looks like you\u0027re flying too low and/or too fast.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Added a factor to simulate the switch from laminar to turbulent flow (in layman\u0027s terms, if you\u0027re going too fast too low, you get a massive boost to heating).
