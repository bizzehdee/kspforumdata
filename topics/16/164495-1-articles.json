I say easy because it\u0027s in an equatorial orbit, so you won\u0027t need an inclination change. For a very simple rundown: launch your rocket and turn due east (90 degrees). Once you\u0027re in a stable, equatorial orbit, setup a maneuver node. Spin the prograde dial until your projected orbit (the yellow line) reaches the Mun\u0027s orbit (about 11,000km). Now left-click and hold on the maneuver node itself and drag it around your orbit until you encounter the Mun (you\u0027ll know when you do). This will get you a very simple encounter. I\u0027m not sure how much else you want to know right now.
