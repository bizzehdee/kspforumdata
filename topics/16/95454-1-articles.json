I had Jeb piloting and I had just gotten him up to the level where he can hold \u0022prograde\u0022. I had SAS on and he was holding in stable mode just fine. Then I switched to prograde mode and he change the ship orientation correctly (it was a minor adjustment), but while holding prograde, he was using electric charge up very quickly (approx. 3-5 units per second). The ship was in ~80km Kerbin orbit, so atmosphere was not a factor. When I switched back to \u0022stable\u0022 mode, electric power consumption returned to \u0022normal\u0022 (a few hundredths of a unit per second).

If you\u0027re a long way from the marker it\u0027s trying to follow, it\u0027ll almost always massively overdo the rotation. The solution to that is just to make it take account of how fast you\u0027re already rotating as well as how far away from the correct orientation you are. The game only seems to do the second one of those.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wibou","CreatedById":134135,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T21:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if that\u0027s your problem, but I always find that the \u0022pilot hold\u0022 functions are WAY too aggressive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of using small torque correction and wait until the node aligns, it tends to apply the maximum torque it can give all the way there. It almost always ends up overshooting and try to correct applying again way too much torque... in the end, the pilot hold oscillates around the node for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it might be what you experiment; instead of applying tiny torque to keep the node aligned, Jeb is probably applying HUGE one, then immediattely compensate with another huge push, and on and on... The result is a stable hold (torque pushes are made very close altogether), but cost way more energy than it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the issue is especially apparent for very heavy spacecraft, as it needs huge torque to move them around, but also huge torque to STOP moving around. That\u0027s something the hold functions are just totally unable to take into account. For heavy ship, you better do use SAS just for stability and to hold the prograde/rettrograde node yourself (sorry Jeb!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same issue apply on very long and thin ship. Those tend to giggle a little due to the distance between the command pod and the center of mass. In that case the hold functions try to keep stable a ship that (thanks to the physic engine) just won\u0027t, wasting huge amount of energy in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, by trying to compensate a little giggling, it mays very well start building up gigangtic \u0022wobble waves\u0022 that eventually tear appart the ship... For that reason, it\u0027s best to keep any SAS turned off on those long and thin ship and to operate manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
