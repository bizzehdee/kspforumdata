Or activate the chute on the stricken pod via right-click, then let go (hopefully without pulling all your craft apart). But then you\u0027re at the mercy of drag, and there\u0027s a high probability you\u0027ll have them fall at different speeds and one will exit the simulation bubble and despawn. You\u0027re better off letting them fall attached all the way down, or to set the one sub-orbital, let go, then re-circularize your rescue craft until you can land the falling pod safely, or transfer the crew and science before you de-orbit. The first option is probably pretty iffy; the second one costs you time; and the third one costs you any science return from the craft itself (the \u0022recover a craft which had an orbital...blah blah blah\u0022 type). remember that chutes can be activated in space, then they\u0027ll deploy once they reach proper atmospheric pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T22:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ROXunreal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ROXunreal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to do a rescue mission with the grabbing unit, basically grab a stranded pod, put us both on a descent trajectory, release the pod and put a bit of distance and then activate chutes on both pods.

It\u0027s possible you put too much distance between the pods and that is the reason you can\u0027t switch between them. I don\u0027t know what the number is, but I do know that there\u0027s a maximum separation beyond which you can now longer toggle between the ships. I waited until very late in the descent (shortly before parachute deployment) before I separated the pods and had no problem switching back and forth between them all the way to landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROXunreal","CreatedById":133129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T22:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.
