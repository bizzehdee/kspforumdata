There is a lot of wiggle in the engine-to-decoupler joins in the upper part of your rocket. That\u0027s going to allow the mass to bob around and force your guidance to fight a lot of transient deviations. 2. As other have noted, the length of the rocket allows the mass to swing around far from the parts that are attempting to exert control. 3. Fins in the middle of the ship have very little leverage to help steer the ship. 4. And SRBs are static and cannot contribute to steering, so you have a heavy, long rocket, and just about he only thing trying to keep it under control is the single Mainsail.
