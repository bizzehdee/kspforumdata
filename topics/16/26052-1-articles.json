Transfer windows for Moho opens up something like every 30 days and it can take as little as 25 days to reach. So one option for manned Moho landing is just to send tanker after tanker to Moho to build up a stockpile of fuel as well as a lander. Then once you\u0027re ready just send a ship to Moho with enough delta-V (say 7000m/s) to get into Moho orbit and then reach the Moho propellant depot.
