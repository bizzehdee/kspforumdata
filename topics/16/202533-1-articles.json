(Pls don\u0027t ask me to land on land) I can\u0027t take off with a glorious top speed of 5 m/s, so I must taxi to land and the take off there with my super small landing gear. The issue is that I only landed once(with cheat menu), and that failed b/c the battery ran out, and I forgot solar. All the others failed because the Kerbo-dyne ATDP splashed down and broke, destroying the majority of the thing.(It was on the front and even if I go slow as possible, it splashes down. And the landing gear is not deployed, b/c the drag from an activated gear could flip the plane over.)I used Mechjeb to slow to 1m/s descent and even stayed just above stall speed, of 36m/s, I don\u0027t want to redo the cursed thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-21T18:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using parachutes?

That\u0027s not enough. But I\u0027ll give you this golden tip. It helps quite a lot to have your main gear only attached to the core stack, and offset them as far apart as you originally intend via holding \u003Cstrong\u003EShift\u003C/strong\u003E while dragging them. Surface attached things have weak joint strength, and wheels break off easier when attached to the secondary stacks or especially the wings of your plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223976686\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202533\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621639349\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlanding small planes on water is generally easier because it is a perfectly flat surface, but i\u0027m not sure about big ones. to land on water you are supposed to have your landing gear extended, hit the water with the landing gear, and that should slow you down. with a larger vehicle, that may not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSplashdowns can be either easier, or harder and more terrifying depending on your design. In any case, you want you vertical speed to be under 6m/s and your horizontal speed to be 60 ~ 90m/s. If you need to pitched up over, say 5deg, to do your splashdown then you\u0027re likely to have the nose or cockpit smack down and risk breaking off. Having your landing gear open or closed makes no difference to me.
