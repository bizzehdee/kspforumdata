I thought if I fast forward the game would decide I want to get stuck in the moon orbit but suddenly after doing that, I get pulled away into the suns orbit drifting away from my target! ... ?_? I have no idea what went wrong, but I would really want to know for I can take that precaution next time. I haven\u0027t played KSC since then \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T22:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game is still in an unfinished state, and speed and trajectory can flutter a little even when there are no forces acting on the ship. If it happens that you are right on the margin for an orbital capture to begin with, that flutter can cause it to miss entirely. A little engine burn in the right direction should be enough to over-power the fuzziness in the simulation, but the \u0022right\u0022 direction kind of depends on the exact circumstances. If you\u0027re not sure, hit F5 to quicksave and burn in what you think is the right direction. If that doesn\u0027t fix it, F9 to load the quicksave and burn in another direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ItsB0DE","CreatedById":48250,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-16T22:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot!
