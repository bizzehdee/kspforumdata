There should be tooltips that show up to tell you that it\u0027s the landing gear action that you are selecting. Additionally, if I recall correctly, in radial preset you can use Left Bumper \u002B X, I think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
