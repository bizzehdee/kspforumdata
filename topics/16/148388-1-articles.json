I can get to the Mun\u00A0off a 2 stage burn into my initial Kerbal orbit and leave myself with an entry stage that gets me slowed below 100 m/s and I can keep that from around 50000m to 10000m. I have enough fuel to likely do what\u0027s needed in that stage, but its around this point that I can\u0027t seem to find a balance between coming down at a survivable speed and sending myself back out again. I\u0027ve dropped that stage in an attempt to use the 4 engines on my landing shuttle to form a wider base of propulsion(no idea what I\u0027m talking about, but grasping for straws at this point) but the same problem exists. Either I let it drop and can only slow it to 50 or 60m/s or I get it to around that descent rate and it starts burning back up again. Because it seems to all go south around the 50 or 60m/s mark, I\u0027ve wondered if my lander is just too heavy and have no issue rebuilding, but it\u0027s also made me wonder about the science of it that I may not be grasping. Is there a height where I should be starting the burns to achieve some form of plateaus in speed reduction? Something else I\u0027m oblivious to? Do I need a mod? Of all the frustrating, turned rewarding hours I\u0027ve put into this game, slowly yo-yoing around the Mun in vain attempts to land while I could be going to other places, is killing me. Of course, I don\u0027t feel like I can move on until I\u0027ve conquered the Mun landing, like the stubborn man I am. First time I\u0027ve ever been on a forum, lol.

In\u00A0the meantime, a friend suggested mechjeb2 very strongly, suggesting I learned enough and it\u0027s time to make things more functional.

I installed it and it\u0027s in my inventory and I\u0027ve even attached it, but I have no idea how to make it function. Needless to say my very persistent friend had never used it himself because he got frustrated early and quit playing...could have told me that before I went for it!! Anyways, I searched around with my limited skills and found out (I think) that I needed some toolbar mod and everything was pointing to a very specific one and I placed the file where it said to place it. Problem being that it says I have a non supported version as it loads up the game and I see no toolbar upon entry. I\u0027m playing 1.2 prerelease version of the game and I even figured out that I could go back to a previous stable version of the game, but that\u0027s too far back I think?? To even figure out what\u00A0I have so far is a huge advancement in gaming,\u00A0computer and internet usage for me, but at this point the discussions seemingly relevant to my issue get so muddled in version and numbers that my lack of experience is giving me a migraine. Any help or suggestions on this one?\u00A0Again, sorry if this is not the right place for the question, but I\u00A0was answered so well last time, that I feel like I may get the most direct and applicable response here.
