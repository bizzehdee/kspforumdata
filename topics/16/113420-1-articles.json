More fuel per engine and nukes will probably be mass efficient, less and you may want to explore a chemical design.\n\nNote this is to optimize mass. If you make a multi-mission reusable tug. NEVA economics comes ahead quicker. The economics of reusable craft is dominated by consumables.\n\nMy plan for Duna is to repurpose a crew liner I\u0027m building for Minmus station and tourist contacts. It\u0027s first mission will be to tug tourists and a lab station to Minmus, skirt Kerbin SOI for experience, fly by Mun for a tourist contact, and return to LKO for refuel, crew cycle, and attachment of the Duna mission module.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T18:01:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"}]}
