I have successfully put a kerbed lander on Duna, however my previous design was limited and my lander doesn\u0027t have enough fuel to return back home or even get back into Duna Orbit. So I am designing a new interplanetary mothership that will not only rescue the crew from Duna, will also serve on other interplanetary explorations to other worlds. \n\nHere are a couple of photos, attached to the post. (Note, I have yet to assemble the first and second stages...for now please focus on what I have.) As you can see below the payload I am trying to take into orbit is composed of two parts. One the powerful \u0022mammoth\u0022 engine block which will give the final push into orbit and perhaps give some delta-v for the Duna burn assuming enough fuel is left. The other half, which is the one I\u0027d like to focus on is the \u0022Endurance Module\u0022. It is two be powered by 6 nuclear rockets, with 1 jumbo x64 orange fuel tank, a smaller x16 white fuel tank, a equipment storage container, a \u0022hitchhike\u0022 contanier for possible crew, two large batteries, 6 fins, 12 1x6 solar pannels and two dockports(one on the top and one on the bottom.) Also note I plan to attach a fuel lander that will go to the surface and rescue the boys. The Module weighs about 100 tons and total configuration(with the rocket stage below) is about 225 tons. \n\nI\u0027ve previously tried to design a mothership using mainsail rockets and that failed catastrophically. I realize now that nuclear rockets provide the best bang for the buck(they have the best efficiency), however I\u0027m a little uncertain how they will preform due to their low-thrust so I might have to rethink my burn strategy. \n\nSo for all those who are pros at getting to other planets can you spare some advice on my design as it is. Should I add more tanks, add more rockets, get rid of some containers, scrap it completely, keep it as it is? Anything I should do? \n\nAlso I would greatly appreciate advice for nuclear rockets because I have never used them before and I don\u0027t know what maneuvers I should do because I know they will behave differently then the conventional rockets. Please spare any constructive criticism or advice you have to helping me get of the launch pad, and rescue my guys stranded on Duna currently. Thank you so much!!\n\n![93AC58D21786EE85DE292996143891DF452F7024](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/548656039819918221/93AC58D21786EE85DE292996143891DF452F7024/)\n\n![CB1C2A002CCFE5FE57A7192E7B49E47259F17B5C](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/548656039819917247/CB1C2A002CCFE5FE57A7192E7B49E47259F17B5C/)\n\n![61889A01988EC89BDA48D703C435C4C240D1E220](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/548656039819917779/61889A01988EC89BDA48D703C435C4C240D1E220/)"},{"CreatedByName":"everything-is-nominal","CreatedById":141339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T00:54:19Z","Content":"Well i think that 6 nuclear engines are a bit too much for this spacecraft, 2 or 3 should give you a TWR greater than 1 and will be more efficient.\n\nSecond thing, you need to install at least one mod : [http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/222685-kerbal-engineer-redux](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/222685-kerbal-engineer-redux)\n\nIt\u0027s kerbal engineer and it will give you 2 usefull information for your travel : your Thrust to Weight Ratio and your Delta V.\n\nTo get in orbit of Kerbin, you need in 1.0 at least 3500 m/s, to make an injection from kerbin to Duna you need 1100 m/s, from there, you can aerobreak or make a retro burn (wich will cost you then 400 m/s).

You should use 2 stage booster. Interplanetary ship have unnecessarily many engines. LV-Ns are heavy. TWR of about 0.3 is enough to interplanetary burns. It depends on initial orbit and dv, but if you use 250 km orbit and burn to Duna even 0.15-0.2 may be enough. Of course if you transport massive landers, stations or fuel/ore tanks with your interplanetary ship you may want to more force to avoid annoyingly long maneuvers. You should really get some engineering mod for interplanetary trips. It is not fun (IMO) to make them with eyeballs.\n\nLV-Ns are like any engines except they does not consume oxidizer (you should take it away from tanks (except what your lander needs)) and they produce heat. Heat should not be problem in your design if you use normal transfer orbits (about 1000 m/s burns).\n\nNerfing of LV-Ns encourage to use local resources. There are plenty of ore in Ike. I sent a refinery ship there before manned operations. Now I can get return fuel from Duna system.

For example, you could have engine \u002B fuel in one part and everything else (hitchiker \u002B lander \u002B some fuel?) in the other.

That second stage can finish your orbital burn and probably still give you a kick towards your destination. \n\nFor my own part, I generally create dedicated interplanetary tugs now. My current design is pretty simple. I use one or two of the big Mk3 5000 fuel tanks and one or two LV-Ns along with a bit of control (probe core \u002B big reaction wheel \u002B battery \u002B RTG) and a docking port. Anything I plan to send to another planet will have a matching shielded docking port at the top. Then I\u0027ll just dock the LV-N tug up with it for the journey and drop it when we\u0027re in orbit at the destination. With mining, the tug can be refueled for a return trip and used for the next mission.
