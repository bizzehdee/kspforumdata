Overall I started to explore the oceans. (not much to explore) and the north pole. The thing about the north pole is that it is difficult to get to with large mass\u0027s Ex- my base. I have\u00A0flied an orbital mission to land there but nothing other than that. The only way I can think of transporting the base there is to drive it there. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlz Help me and the KSP scientists \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T12:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might have more luck in Gameplay Questions \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T15:13:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics of what you are trying to build as a base would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the parts to drive it there, you must have unlocked quite a lot of the tech tree (if you\u0027re on career) so both flying and suborbital should be a possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuge planes are difficult since (like in real life) the wings tend to want to break off, and pilot boredom is an issue.

So landing a plane there is as easy as you can ever get. But as Plusck says, it rather depends on just how large you want this base to be, and whether you can build it in pieces that can be connected together with docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T03:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222839569\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151515\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478358793\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npilot boredom is an issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s a lot less of an issue than it used to be.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E in 1.2\u002B is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E much better than it\u0027s been since, well, forever, that it\u0027s now perfectly stable and useful to fly at 4x physics warp (as long as you drop down to normal when you need to make steering adjustments now and again).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMakes those long flights go a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E quicker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(I used to hardly fly planes at all, but now I\u0027m experimenting with a career in which I\u0027ve got \u0022extra ground stations\u0022 turned off, to see what network-building is like when it has to terminate at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 One thing I\u0027ve been playing with is building a ground-based network with relay stations perched on mountaintops, spaced as far apart as they can go while maintaining LOS-- and I\u0027ve got the occlusion factor cranked up to 1.0.\u00A0 It works surprisingly well, but it means I have to fly a lot of these relays out to various locations, which means much more plane flying than I\u0027m used to.\u00A0 But with a simple, low-tech drone that can fly at 900 m/s with a single Panther, and 4x physics warp, they can get anywhere on the planet with just a very few minutes of flying.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
