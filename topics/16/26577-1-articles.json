I have protractor and MechJeb 2. I want to set it up so that my final exit burn is very short.

How do I judge where the ejection angle will be when the planet is in phase using the tools I have listed? Do I just burn when Theta is near zero?

Start periapsis kicking a few days before your phase angles line up, and if you don\u0027t get a close encounter right away, put a maneuver node immediately after you exit Kerbin\u0027s SoI and play with that until you have an encounter at your desired altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T20:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe window for a near-optimal Jool transfer is about a week wide, so you don\u0027t need to worry overly much about hiring a precise target on departure time going there.

(In other words, if you have for instance five probes, set them up so that one puts you at periapsis on the ideal orbit right on the tick, then one each something like three and six hours before and after that point.) It\u0027s likely that you\u0027d have to perform some midcourse corrections anyway, so it shouldn\u0027t be too much trouble to correct for if you get your final escape burn in the neighborhood of your destination.
