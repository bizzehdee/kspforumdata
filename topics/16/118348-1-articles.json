Heatmap green, Blue, monochrome? Inverse?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ripper2900","CreatedById":146418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T06:08:13Z","Content":"The overlays all mean the same, they\u0027re just different visuals. \n\nThe \u0022heat\u0022 represent different concentrations of ore but I\u0027m not sure relative to what. Also note the setting the cutoff to eg. 60% doesn\u0027t show actual concentrations of 60%, but 60%of the max. (not sure what max is), and it\u0027s really inaccurate. \n\nOre is located by biome, and with large variations within biomes. You really need to use the narrowband scanner and the surface scanner to get good results. Or just plain luck. \n\nOne rule of thumb that seems to hold from my experience is that sloping ground generally have more ore then nearby flat ground."},{"CreatedByName":"Finox","CreatedById":138088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T02:31:15Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think each overlay is meant to show anything different. They\u0027re just a different way of showing ore concentrations, kind of like how you can put the same data set into a bar graph or a pie chart, but its still the same information. They\u0027re just there so you can pick the one that stands out best against whatever body you\u0027re surveying. For instance; using a purple overlay on Eve would be a bad idea since Eve is purple and it would be almost impossible to see."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T06:38:08Z","Content":"I would like to think it also provides accessibility for folks who suffer from color vision deficiency."}]}
