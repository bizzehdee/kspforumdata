The delta symbol stands for \u0027change\u0027 so the symbol can be used to describe a change in a value, in this case delta v is the total remaining change in velocity a ship can make given the fuel in the ship and the efficiency of the engines. And as you\u0027ll have worked out you need a little velocity to go anywhere in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T13:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edelta V is the change in velocity.
