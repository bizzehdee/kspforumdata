The canyon area of the mun is a hotbed of sci. However, i place my lab in LMO and conducted numerous docking/Mun and a couple of refueling missions and basically filled out the entire tech tree in 0.25.\n\nBTW i unlock all the lower sci tiers before leaving low kerbin orbit. There is a lot of science on the ground in KSC.\n\nIn response to NikkyD, I typically do no recycle a crew on Kerbin system orbits more than 4 landing missions. You can make the game more realistic by switching out crews on refueling missions an send your spent crews back with sci data. One effective way to do this is to collect them in LKE and then return them back as one group, this way you don\u0027t have to carry chutes and HS to the science objectives. In addition you can carry extra fuel and use this to retrograde break on reentry (at very low entry angle) with a complete science package and conduct science on th ground on Kerbin. \n\nI generally keep enough retro fuel on reentry to at least slow my craft down to a speed that its SAS keeps it from tumbling. Also, I also add one crew capacity for each crewman year in orbit. This means for a 5 year mission would set a baseline of one capsule and one storage container. If a minimal Gilly mission takes 2 years then you Since a minimal science mission wants a MPL you need to have on pilot and one sci; the cap has 3, MPL has 2 and so i add one storage container. \n\nThe eve landing mission is basically suicide so 1 year of supply per crew i all that is needed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well *something* needs to be an overpowered source of Science, or we wouldn\u0027t get anything done!\n\nScience is 1% inspiration \u0026 99% inspiration. \n\nYou can however get \u0022Science\u0022 on the cheap from the american association for the advancement of science and place it on your coffee table for the admiration of the uninformed. :^)"},{"CreatedByName":"strigon","CreatedById":123021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:16:42Z","Content":"\u003E Science is 1% inspiration \u0026 99% inspiration.\n\nerm..."},{"CreatedByName":"NikkyD","CreatedById":97466,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:31:11Z","Content":"Original from Thomas Edison \u0022Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:32:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well *something* needs to be an overpowered source of Science, or we wouldn\u0027t get anything done!\n\nI still think you can get way to much Sciencepoints early on before you leave the Kerbin System ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T16:39:01Z","Content":"Any time based mechanic is OP if you timewarp forward 200 days..."},{"CreatedByName":"Two","CreatedById":144535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:33:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s because you don\u0027t have cost per month, so time is free.
