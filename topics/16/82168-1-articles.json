So I try to design my rockets that the TWR stays lower at lower altitudes, but is this really more efficient? Or is the difference negligible?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more efficient in the sense that you\u0027re not carrying excess mass in the form of unused engines. I\u0027ve found my best payload fraction designs have an initial TWR of 1.2-1.3. Higher TWR designs will use less dV but more fuel (seems like a contradiction but it isn\u0027t).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T16:36:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged awkward phrasing.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T16:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with Red Iron Crown. throttling back to say 50% of a mainsail is 50% of a mainsail your not using but still dragging along, why not use a Skipper?

Vertical speed on the other hand is eaten away by gravity so that is not preferred. The problem is it\u0027s hard to turn... or turn on time... going too fast in low atmosphere. This is true in stock but even more true if you use an atmosphere mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At really fast speeds you end up at your target apoapsis before you\u0027ve extended your periapsis and so you have to burn for minutes instead of seconds to circularize your orbit, which eats a lot more fuel than the atmosphere does. Furthermore, using FAR, your craft just plain falls apart. So yes, lingering in the low atmosphere is less fuel efficient, but a better gravity turn is massively more fuel efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T17:27:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T17:48:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...3.
