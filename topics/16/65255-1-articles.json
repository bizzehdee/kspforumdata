Decorative elements, such as cupola modules, labs, and big solar panels look nice, but they really just increase the part count for nothing. Some capacity for electricity generation is useful, but don\u0027t overdo it. RTGs or the smallest solar panels are the most practical choice, as the extendable panels are just mistakes waiting to happen. Add some batteries too, because reorienting a space station requires a lot of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an interesting challenge, consider adding engines and RCS. While decorative space stations are often easy to move, practical space stations that have evolved over months of real time can end up being horribly imbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T03:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spragoo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spragoo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI recently launched the base of my first space station.

You can search around for threads about this, but it mostly has to do with SAS fighting itself and where you place reaction wheels. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70897-Guidelines-for-placings-reaction-wheels-in-multisection-stations\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is one example thread.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring it up because it seems people who are into building space stations eventually hit this point and it becomes pretty catastrophic.

Turning it into a refueling outpost is a practical thing you can do with it. I wouldn\u0027t necessarily suggest a sci lab there if it\u0027s over Kerbin but one might make sense for a station around another world. If it\u0027s decorative, I\u0027d go to town on it (though mind your part count).

Fuel for anything coming and going, or just for the odd station-keeping maneuver, so the amount you need varies. Power is a no-brainer, you want lots of battery capacity, but I\u0027ve always felt that it just isn\u0027t a space station without at least a couple of gigantor arrays coming off it, even if your power demands could be met with a couple of RTGs. Life support can be just a simple role-play thing like adding a hitchhiker for your crew, or a full-blown specialized module if you\u0027re using something like TAC or ECLSS, but I still put a module or two on for that most times regardless. Science isn\u0027t really a must like the others, but it can be very useful, over muns and other planets especially. Plus, space for two extra Kerbals. The only other things would be docking ports, which you should already have, and maybe refinery module for kethane, but then not everyone uses kethane so that\u0027s a situational recommendation, it would only work well if your station is over Minmus or the Mun anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spragoo","CreatedById":104796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T06:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice.
