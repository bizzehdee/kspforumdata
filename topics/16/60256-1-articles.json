I\u0027d like to understand infiniglide well enough to harness its power in a controlled manner, like a nuclear power plant. In other words, build a spacecraft with a lab module; take off from Kerbin; use rockets to get me to Eve; land on Eve; then take off again; return to Kerbin; land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve worked out so far is why you get forward thrust from lifting surfaces:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe lift of a control surface is a vector perpendicular to the surface velocity. If you\u0027re climbing, you get parasitic drag. If you\u0027re falling, you get parasitic thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen you use a control surface, with respect to calculating the lift vector for that control surface, you\u0027re bending the velocity vector rather than bending the control surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBend it enough, and the velocity vector will look like you\u0027re falling, so you get parasitic thrust, even though actually you\u0027re climbing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, an example. Say you\u0027re flying level (i.e. prograde is tangent to the surface) at an angle of attack of \u002B5 degrees. KSP lift is perpendicular to the prograde direction, so the lift vector is straight up. Its magnitude is related to sin(angle of attack), but the direction isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow hit \u0027q\u0027 to roll counterclockwise. Fairly quickly your ailerons will tilt by 20 degrees. Visually, your left aileron tilts up so that it\u0027s now at an angle of attack of -15 degrees, whereas your right aileron tips down to be at \u002B25 degrees. If that\u0027s what happened internally, lift would still be straight up, and there would be no infiniglide. But that\u0027s not how KSP works: by bending the velocity vector, it bends the direction of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe left aileron tilts prograde down 20 degrees, and computes its lift. The lift vector is 20 degrees off vertical towards the back, so we get parasitic drag of sin(20 degrees). The magnitude takes into account a 15 degree AoA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe right aileron tilts prograde up 20 degrees, and computes its lift. The lift vector is 20 degrees off vertical towards the front, so we get parasitic drag of sin(-20 degrees), or in other words, we get thrust. The magnitude takes into account a 25 degree AoA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parasitic components of the two lift direction vectors are the same size, but sin(25) is bigger than sin(15): the right aileron gets more lift force overall, which means we get more thrust than drag. Infiniglide! And a yaw moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pBtuQH3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pBtuQH3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so that\u0027s the theory of it all -- now, I need help putting it in practice. Two main issues: how to control my direction when infinigliding; and how to turn off that fake thrust and manage to land.
