But it seems like solar panels should need some kind of materials. The new evolution of KAS (KIS, which looks like it will be out shortly) might add that function, or they might want to by letting you take up a solar panel repair kit and repair with that."},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T03:14:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can you place them on snapped angles with KAS?
