With a 19.9 t payload you don\u0027t have much margin for error, but you should be able to get into a 75 km orbit. I typically start the pitch over just after passing 5000 m altitude. I execute a slow gradual turn, always trying to keep the level indicator on the Navball within a few degrees of the prograde indicator. Avoid sudden sharp turns. As the prograde indicator approaches the horizon, I level off my vehicle horizontally. If all has gone well, I should be able to accelerate up to about 2300 m/s at a cutoff altitude of about 50 km. I cut the engine just as the apoapsis passes 75 km. Ideally the prograde indicator should be about \u002B3 degrees at engine shutdown. The orbit circularization burn should be less than 100 m/s. The thing that takes practice is getting the prograde indicator to drop at the right rate to get an efficient turn. If the rate is too fast or too slow you have to correct by producing a fairly large separation between the level indicator and prograde marker, and that wastes \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV.

With a 19.9 t payload you don\u0027t have much margin for error, but you should be able to get into a 75 km orbit. I typically start the pitch over just after passing 5000 m altitude. I execute a slow gradual turn, always trying to keep the level indicator on the Navball within a few degrees of the prograde indicator. Avoid sudden sharp turns. As the prograde indicator approaches the horizon, I level off my vehicle horizontally. If all has gone well, I should be able to accelerate up to about 2300 m/s at a cutoff altitude of about 50 km. I cut the engine just as the apoapsis passes 75 km. Ideally the prograde indicator should be about \u002B3 degrees at engine shutdown. The orbit circularization burn should be less than 100 m/s.

I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got nearly 20 designs ranging from 1-tonne launchers all the way up to an 80-tonne launcher.

The propellant feeds from the center tank to the outer tanks. When the center tank goes dry, the center engine cuts off to lower the TWR.
