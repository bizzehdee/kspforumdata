I\u0027m still pretty new to ksp. I have no problem making ships that can reach the 2 moons around Kerbin, I can make rockets that can reach just about any planet as well. But this was mostly off of figuring out what worked and what didn\u0027t. If you were to ask me alot about any of the stats or meanings in ksp I\u0027d be pretty lost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think its time to at least somewhat learn, as like I said, I\u0027ve been having a dilemma with my rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, I have a ship that can reach and orbit other planets. When try to make it slightly bigger by adding new stuff onto it that I\u0027ve unlocked science wise (Using the Interplanetary mod trying to get the science lab to the Mun). It\u0027s grossly over weight now. Which is understandable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since my rocket as a whole was more than enough before, I try double it. Or rather, making 2 of my ships into 1.. Figure, twice the size, twice the lifting power... But no.. It\u0027s barely able to get into Orbit around Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I sit, everytime I try to upgrade my ships, I can\u0027t, as they start to suddenly get overweight. When I try to add more rockets, it seems like the rockets I built, and engines I put on have only enough power to get it to the same point in space.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: I build a ship with 6 engines and it can get me only to 350km orbit over Kerbin. I then take that same ship, add 6 more engines, but that also can only get to 350km despite the engines being exactly the same, with the same amount of fuel for each, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s frustrating to say the least. More engines = more power = farther distance you\u0027d think.. but that\u0027s not how it is working for sure... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want a cheat sheet, or people to look at my ship and say ahhh do this and put that there, and wala you can go anywhere.. I\u0027d like to be able to figure this out myself but.. What do I look at? How can I be sure I am getting ample lift, and minimizing the weight, while still having enough fuel to actually get to my destination? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a trick to the engine types?

In short, you build other rockets parallel to your main rocket and transfer fuel from the outside rockets towards the core all the while burning with all your first stage engines. When the outside stages are empty, you dump them. It is like using boosters to start your main rocket at a higher altitude, but while using all your engines so your thrust is still high.
