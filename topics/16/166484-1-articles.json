That\u2019s what they do in real life. The shuttle now flies \u201Cproperly\u201D without becoming unresponsive halfway through ascent like most of my earlier designs. However, at launch the shuttle does not fly directly upwards but rather sideways because the tilted Vectors generate perpendicular thrust. This means that I have to do an ugly correction maneuver in the first seconds of flight and lose a lot of fuel.\u00A0I have thought of tilting the whole shuttle on the launchpad, but that would be quite unrealistic. I\u2019ll have to see how it behaves when there is a payload in the cargo bay, maybe it could serve as some sort of a counterweight. But how can I negate this perpendicular thrust? I have already tilted the boosters themselves by 2-3 degrees. Maybe I could move them further \u201Cdownward\u201D on the tank to move the\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0and change the DoT?
