Check. Gear are 90 deg to ground, pointing straight down the flight axis of the vehicle.\n\n2) Landing gear overloaded? Nope. Multiple gear and braced with struts. Smallish craft with multiple landing gear.\n\n3) SAS causing overcorrect? Nope. SAS turned off.\n\n4) Unbalanced lift? Nope. Editor shows lift correctly aligned to the axis of the craft.\n\nSo what the hell is going on here? Is it really so hard to get a plane to go straight down a runway?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T02:12:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T23:29:39Z","Content":"Is your landing gear aligned with your center of mass?

Also, any mods installed or stock?\n\nOther than that, common causes of this effect are: \n\n- Imbalanced craft, make double sure that CoM is exactly in the middle, with CoL aligned aswell.\n\n- Too many landing gears. Using more than two pairs tend to make craft very unstable if not absolutely accordingly aligned. Use two bigger ones instead of four small.\n\n- Steering. Make sure that steering on (steerable, of course) wheels is inverted if they are placed backwards. Some wheels also have to be inverted if placed behind CoM as tail drager (like LY05).\n\nYou might also try to enable Aerodynamic forces overlay (F11) to see if there are any unwanted air dragging elements when speeding up."},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T01:08:49Z","Content":"I have KAX installed, but (most) of my planes are not using those parts at the moment.\n\nHere\u0027s a pastebin of the .craft file for one of many craft that go wild on the runway.

The center of friction should be aligned with the center of mass.

Disabling brakes from front wheels and enabling a little bit at rear, then barking during start can help. You can tweak breaks for landing in flight, but this method is also a bit tricky, better go with simply trike.\n\n\u003E Here\u0027s a pastebin of the .craft file for one of many craft that go wild on the runway.

Turns out that makes roll maneuvers super slow. The wheels help if you come in anything other than super level so you don\u0027t lose an engine nacelle or something and get REALLY off-balance (and un-flyable) as a result.\n\nHowever! If the wing wheels touch during takeoff, they can and will cause your plane to swerve. Not enough to foul up a landing, but enough to send you off the side of the runway on takeoff, depending on design. Something to look out for."}]}
