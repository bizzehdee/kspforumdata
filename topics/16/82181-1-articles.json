Orbital rendezvous is the bane of my kerbal existence. i should probably note that i have not unlocked RCS thrusters as yet.What would you guys recommend watching to help nail this bit of KSP. oh and i tried Scott manley\u0027s orbital rendezvous tutorial but he can get too technical too fast for new players like me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T05:48:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by illuscion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T06:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think i\u0027ve learned that part without tutorials, it is really not that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first part is about getting close to the target (5 km - later you can do 0.5 km as well). The trick for this is that if you have a lower orbit, you go faster, if you have bigger, you go slower. It is good if you have a periapsis/apoapsis close to the orbit of the target, and you only lower/raise the other side of your orbit. Then you wait until you get close, and make a maneuver node so you get close to the target at some point. I recommend a maximum of 10km difference between your initial orbit and the target\u0027s orbit at first, and use a lot of time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part is when you are close (5km, preferably 2km) to lower your velocity relative to the target then get closer. You click on the navball where it says orbit, until you see it says target. Now the green circle with the x means you can lower your relative velocity. You dont want to kill it all. You want to go relatively fast towards the target. If you dont go fast enough, the target\u0027s position will change while you are orbiting. You also have a purple or pink target pointing towards the target, and pointing away from the target. You want your velocity vector (green circle) at the same position as your target\u0027s position (purple circular target), and/or your negative velocity (green x in circle) where the purple triangle-like target is. You will probably see this last one more. To make this happen, experiment: kill almost all your relative velocity (1m/s), then see how it changes as you burn in different directions. The green circle will follow your compass, and the green x will go away from it. The furthest you are from them, the faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T07:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry some of HOCgaming\u0027s early videos, I remember they were very instructive and simple to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr try tutorials mentioned on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Drawing Board\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot much has changed on rendezvous recently, even very old tutorials can tell you how to do that.
