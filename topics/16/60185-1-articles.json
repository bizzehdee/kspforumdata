Fly out to my new apoapsis, do the plane-change maneuver (tug on one of the magenta colored nodes on the maneuver node, you may need to pull on the retrograde node as well to keep your periapsis from moving). Fly back to periapsis and lower your apoapsis again.

You can have a polar orbit that sees the sun at all times, and you can have a polar orbit that spends almost 50% of its time in the shadow of the orbited body. Clearly the former is better if you happen to have power-hungry devices attached and/or are far away from the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as the body orbits the sun (or the body\u0027s parent, in the case of a moon), your orbit won\u0027t turn along with its path, and therefore will slowly rotate relative to the sun. If your craft is reliant on always needing sunlight, prepare to adjust the orbit every so often.

But if you set it slightly below/above 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (depending if you are going north or south) your orbit will rotate around kerbin, which in turn is turning around the sun. Such an Orbit is called \u0027Sun-synchronus\u0027, in your case you are looking for a dusk/dawn orbit (your object in space is always above the terminator). The inclination you are looking for is defined by your orbital period and the length of a kerbal year. Sry, don\u0027t have the formula at hand. But here with earth \u0026amp; sol the inclinations are typically between 96\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and 98\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 for earth-observing satellites; such orbits are used for getting \u0027same time of day\u0027 for using shadow-length for height determination and radar-sats (and maybe much more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the necessary calculations, I\u0027m pretty sure googling for \u0027sun-synchronous orbit\u0027 turns something up.
