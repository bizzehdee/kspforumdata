Tall and narrow is fine if you\u0027re good at landing and at finding flat ground. If you\u0027ll need to land on a slope consider instead a lander that lands \u0022sideways\u0022, but balance can take a bit of work.\n\nEither way keep in mind the cargo bay is somewhat wider than a 1.25m part but not a lot higher. This means that you can have things stuck on in two-way symmetry but not three or four-way. Don\u0027t be afraid to narrow parts of the lander to fit things on. The Mk1 pod will fit comfortably if you don\u0027t want to use lawn chairs."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T03:27:36Z","Content":"A trick I picked up from Wanderfound is to use Oscar-B tanks for mounting the landing gear to keep them within the 1.25m diameter when retracted.

The Mk2 bay limits you to a 1.25m stack and small lander legs, with external chairs port and starboard instead of a can (which is fine for Duna), and you don\u0027t want the lander too long or it will tip over on Duna\u0027s hilly ground, given the narrow spread of the landing legs.

Use a girder segment as \u0022landing legs\u0022: It has a high crash tolerance and it is perfect for containing small engines, e.g. Spark or Twitch. Attach the engine to the bottom, then offset it into the girder (can go all the way up without problems). This makes for a very compact and sturdy lander. A small reaction wheel is more than enough to make it very stable and controllable.\n\nHere is an example, one of the rocket chairs I used to hop around Minmus and Mun (removed solar panels to make engine visible). This should easily fit into a mk2 bay. Attaching it to the main craft can sometimes be a bit tricky so you might need to add a small octo strut or similar to get an attachment point (or attach the engine via such means). I\u0027m currently playing with colony and life support mods so I haven\u0027t done any manned flighty beyond Minmus yet but I\u0027ll soon send a colony to Duna or Dres and I\u0027ll use comparable designs there.\n\n![TJ6AEHJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TJ6AEHJ.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T21:52:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"jackboy900","CreatedById":113949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T22:17:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you don\u0027t mind the lack of a command pod, an ECS lander can be tiny; two of these guys fit into a full length mk2 bay ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/XrfjssD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XrfjssD.jpg)\n\nDo you have a craft file for this?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Someone could try packing a chopped-up lander with the pieces lined up along the bay, and then taking them out and docking the lander back together in orbit.
