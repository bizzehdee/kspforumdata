I recommend building them in the Spaceplane Hangar as the symmetry mode there is better for surface vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to have wheels symmetrically places on the sides of a main axis or body and all at the same height. Mind you you can have a front pair of wheels higher or lower than the back one but having them equal makes it a bit more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also want to have the rover\u0027s center of mass be as low as possible so it doesn\u0027t flip as much during sharp turns, also I recommend making it a bit wide so it doesn\u0027t start rolling. Personally I place batteries under the body of rover to lower the center of mass, placing RTGs there (if you know they won\u0027t hit the ground during driving) is another good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem is landing the rover. If you\u0027re landing somewhere with a sufficient amount of atmosphere you can just put parachutes on it somewhere, dcouple it from the carrier rocket after putting it on a descent trajectory. But if you need engines for a powered descent, well then you have two options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is placing the tanks and engines below the rover, the problem with this is that you need to drive off the descent stage without wrecking the rover. It\u0027s doable but requires clever thinking so the decoupler below the rover doesn\u0027t hold you in place even after decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second one is placing them above the rover, this one is far easier because you just need to space out the engines above so they don\u0027t burn the rover. Sometimes people place them hanging on the bottom side of landers dropping them below so they drive out easily. Others build skycranes on top of them and detach them after they land so the rover can drive around without excess weigh on top of it (which is bad as you want your center of mass low on a rover).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good idea is to design the rover in the SPH first and then copy the file to the VAB and there add a carrier rocket and the lander/descent stage which gets it safely down to the surface. Because the VAB is better for building rockets (obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T16:25:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Pulstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S\u1D04\u026A\u0274\u1D1B\u026A\u029F\u029F\u1D00\u1D1B\u1D0F\u0280","CreatedById":69027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T22:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EAs Pulstar said its important to keep the centre of mass low.
