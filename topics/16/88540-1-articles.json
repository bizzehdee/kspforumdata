Where you go EVA and find your kerbal hurtling away from the airlock. This problem is a combination of kerbal clipping and kerbal\u0027s not actually grabbing the ladder upon EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The second EVA problem is ladder sliding. If you wait too long, the end result is the kerbal sliding off the ladder (either up or down), but without much \u0022flinging\u0022 involved. The direction seems more to do with orientation of the ship, rather than always \u0022up\u0022 or \u0022down\u0022 the ladder. My EVAEjectionFix fixes this very slightly, but only upon initial EVA. I am looking further to see if I can prevent this, but I think it has to do with floating point errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey may seem related, but they are definitely different bugs. You can\u0027t really do anything to prevent the Ejection bug (without my fix), and with the ladder slide you just have to constantly watch your kerbal to make sure he doesn\u0027t slide off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James_Eh","CreatedById":95163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T20:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Srpadget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Srpadget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHuh.

As soon as I click EVA, I have to hit the S control, and more often than not the Kerbal does not get ejected away. As mentioned above, it helps to have a ladder underneath the pod rungs so that you can back him down that ladder somewhat - this gains you time. They tend to drift in the \u0022W\u0022 direction (typically to the top of the ship) in all of my experiences. Seems independent of whether you are in a low orbit around Kerbin, or somewhere interplanetary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat actually helps is Claw\u0027s fix.
