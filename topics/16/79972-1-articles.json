We\u0027re assuming the rescue vessel has enough fuel to return to Kerbin, while the vessel on Laythe does not. So you will use less fuel by bringing the lighter ship to the heavier one, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, getting the ships together would be \u003Cem\u003Eeasier\u003C/em\u003E in Laythe orbit.
