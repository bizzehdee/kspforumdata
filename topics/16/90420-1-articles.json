DocMoriarty\u0027s guide focuses on use of the RAPIER engine. It\u0027s slightly out of date (by slightly I mean it was designed for 0.24.2 and he hasn\u0027t yet updated it for the changes in 0.25), but so far the only thing I\u0027ve seen that\u0027s major is that the new Wing Connectors are functionally equivalent to Delta Wings.

I\u0027d tweak it to the point I got the most performance out of it in the atmosphere, then I would save it as a new craft file and start retrofitting it. RAPIER engines (my preference), oxidizer, adjusting the wings slightly to compensate for any shift in Center-of-Gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new spaceplane parts are in an indirect way, helpful in this manner. If you want to use the streamlined Mk2-1.25m adapters, they only exist in LFO versions, forcing you to defuel the oxidizer portion if you want to use them for just airbreathers. When you switch to the full spaceplane model from the straight-airbreather, you already have the oxidizer tanks on board. The most invasive things I had to do to my spaceplane derivative is swap out two MK1 Fuselage fuel tanks for two FL-T400 and add canards to help with the initial takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother useful tip I recommend is adjust the fuel sliders in the SPH editor and watch where the Center-of-Gravity and Center-of-Lift indicators are when your spaceplane (or any plane) is empty on fuel. If the CoG is aft of the CoL, you\u0027ll spaceplane will topple during reentry and at best be unstable in aerodynamic flight in the lower atmosphere. A plane that handles great on takeoff might not handle great later on as you burn off fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyre311","CreatedById":125446,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T20:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96406-The-Arcadia-series-and-the-Zeus-Ships?highlight=Arcadia\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96406-The-Arcadia-series-and-the-Zeus-Ships?highlight=Arcadia\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T20:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enevermind wrong thread srry\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alpha tech","CreatedById":84978,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T18:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edocking and cargo transport and other stuff like that like i have a space plane that works has docking but i have little to no fuel left and it uses the rapier engine and i cant keep refueling it all the time also what i am having trouble with is fitting an engine to a Mk 2 space plane and having enough fuel to keep it afloat\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"megatiger78","CreatedById":114940,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T18:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust throw it together in a way that looks like a picture you saw.

The crucial thing is to get as much speed as possible before you run out of air, because when that happens you need much, much more fuel to make the same change in velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to use 3-engine arrangements for LKO planes, usually a pair of RAPIERs and either a Toroidal Aerospike or a Turbojet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the jet, I aim to get up to about 1400-1500m/s (surface) before I need to switch the RAPIERs to closed mode, usually this is at an altitude between about 20-25km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Aerospike, I keep it turned off until I\u0027m around 20km up doing about 1000-1200m/s (faster if I can). Then I turn it on before the RAPIERs need to switch and pull up hard to climb as steeply as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should put you in orbit. Once there you can use RCS thrusters to make any docking maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re wanting to reach higher altitude orbits, consider adding a rocket-booster stage behind the RAPIERs and launching vertically to orbit (as you would with a rocket). I used this technique to get my Remote-Tech relay satellite into GSO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor inter-planetary spaceplanes, you\u0027re going to need to use LV-N engines, which are a lot heavier and will need more supplementary engines to reach orbit, but once there will be able to get to other bodies on much less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
