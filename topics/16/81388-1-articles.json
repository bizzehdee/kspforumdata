That will reset the trim on all the craft.

The North/South axis is the axis the East/West/Up/Down plane rotates around, so the ship will remain facing the way you pointed it and simply rotate around. When you go to dock with it, just point the controlled craft toward the other direction and voila, alignment achieved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
