Only mod I am using is Kerbal alarms. It felt like I was controlling from the red circle while looking in the green circles orientation(green circle was what I wanted). however for lining up docking ports this was of little use. I have also had this issue using docking ports.\n\n![313t193.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/313t193.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T18:30:21Z","Content":"If your docking ports are not in alignment with the center of mass \u0022Control from here\u0022 can seem quite a bit off.

The 2 pieces were launched separately and the green line should have given me a perfect view for docking however if I followed the target in the nav ball the probe core at the top would end up hitting the docking port i was aiming for and I would be no were close to docking successfully. I will try some docking ports lined up with the COM and see if that is better."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T18:37:18Z","Content":"Yes, that\u0027s a KSP bug that has been around since forever. \u0022Control From Here\u0022 affects the *orientation* of the nav ball, but not the position. So if you ever do a \u0022control from here\u0022 for a docking port whose axis doesn\u0027t pass through your ship\u0027s center of mass, then it\u0027s pretty useless.\n\nReally wish they\u0027d fix it. You just have to fall back on playing games with the camera and aligning things visually."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T18:41:20Z","Content":"BAH that is what I figured.
