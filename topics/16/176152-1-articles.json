exact colinearity requires that you travel\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the assistant).\u00A0 The ideal assist also comes in along a line parallel to the prograde or retrograde, but moving in the opposite direction.\u00A0 I assume that you know this much; I\u0027m simply reiterating for thoroughness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that sometimes, you don\u0027t want (or cannot get) all of the assist possible.\u00A0 Cases where you don\u0027t want it would be, for example, when you have a specific destination in mind and don\u0027t want to overshoot it.\u00A0 In the stock system, this is usually more of a problem with transfers between moons than between planets.\u00A0 Cases where you cannot get it would be the Mun, for example:\u00A0 the Mun can provide\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0assist, but it doesn\u0027t have enough mass to warp your trajectory all the way round unless you have such a low-energy trajectory that you cannot get anywhere in the first place.\u00A0 You need to approach from a different vector to use the Mun; this is half of why \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110461-laie/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022110461\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/110461-laie/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Laie\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s picture above shows the assist the way it does (the other half is that when you\u0027re starting from low Kerbin orbit, you\u0027re always going to have a radial component to your Mun encounter velocity unless it\u0027s a perfect Hohmann transfer anyway).\u00A0 Other cases where you cannot get it would be high-velocity intercepts:\u00A0 the higher your initial velocity, the less assist you can get because the assistant cannot warp your trajectory so much regardless of its mass.\u00A0\u00A0In the picture above, the Mun is providing an assist to leave Kerbin\u0027s space on an interplanetary trip, so it\u0027s more important to leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence in the correct direction for an efficient Hohmann transfer; leaving the Mun\u0027s sphere in the Mun\u0027s prograde would provide more assist, but in the wrong direction, and encountering the Mun at a point where its prograde and Kerbin\u0027s prograde align requires a trajectory that is too low-energy to make it to another planet if you\u0027re approaching the Mun from low Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side point, if you look closely, the Mun assist pictured above is perfectly positioned for what it is.\u00A0 The angle between approach and departure is bisected by the Mun\u0027s prograde vector, so the assist gets everything it can within the rather severe limitations imposed upon it by the Mun\u0027s status as a low-gravity body and the trajectory\u0027s status as a (relatively) high-energy interplanetary departure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your case, you are coming in from the outer system, which limits your options for an apoapsis-boosting assist because your orbital velocity at your craft\u0027s periapsis is going to be higher than Kerbin\u0027s velocity (it has to be, or you wouldn\u0027t be able to return to the outer system).\u00A0 That means that you cannot let Kerbin catch up to you, and that\u0027s a problem, because the ideal assist in this case is one where you enter and leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere from the prograde direction--and getting that direction requires that Kerbin catch up to you.\u00A0 Therefore, the solution is a less-than-ideal assist where you approach Kerbin from an angle.\u00A0 The preferred angle in this case is one where you meet Kerbin from sunward and use it to throw you out in its prograde direction; in other words, from Duna, you need to burn to lower your solar periapsis below Kerbin\u0027s orbit and catch Kerbin on the outbound leg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, burning to go below Kerbin\u0027s orbit wastes fuel, so you\u0027d need to be certain that the amount of assist you get from using that fuel is greater than you\u0027d get from a direct burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my part, I think it is going to be difficult to get what you want.\u00A0 Duna-Jool windows are relatively rare (transfer window frequency drops the farther from the sun you go, naturally), and Duna-Kerbin-Jool windows would need to be even rarer than that.\u00A0 Given that it\u0027s a less-than-ideal assist, as well, I don\u0027t think you can get enough from Kerbin to go all the way to Jool in one pass.\u00A0 There may be a D-K-K-J or maybe a D-K-D-D-(D-D-D-D?)-J assist in there somewhere, but you will need to find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-25T16:08:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2018 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ol\u2019 Musky Boi","CreatedById":186973,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-26T07:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125721-zhetaan/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125721\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125721-zhetaan/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Zhetaan\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I actually managed to get my apoapsis to Jool in 2 Kerbin gravity assists where I waited about 20 years for an encounter (no problem with time control 2.0).
