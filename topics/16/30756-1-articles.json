It\u0027s powered by 19 Rockomax \u0022Mainsail\u0022 Liquid Engines. 12 of the engines are staged. The staged engines have two large fuel tanks each and the 7 main engines have 9 large fuel tanks. All of the fuel tanks are daisy chained together. There are about 50 RCS thrusters supported by 6 large RCS fuel tanks. In total there are 1200\u002B parts. I saw a similar ship posted, but it was photoshoped into orbit, powered by ion drives and looked a bit small... So i made mine three times bigger and i intend to get it up there under it\u0027s own power. I typically get her out to 100km where there in no atmosphere and start a turn for orbit; it\u0027s obviously a slow process. Any atmosphere and i lose control. Then I start my burn, but I can only push it to about 1/3 throttle, otherwise she spins out of control and the RCS ports cant keep up. The slow burn drains the rest of the fuel while I coast out to 300km and then gravity pulls me back down to re-entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70118866/2013-05-28_00005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-28_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70118866/2013-05-28_00008.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-28_00008.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70118866/2013-05-28_00009.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-28_00009.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70118866/2013-05-29_00008.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-29_00008.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70118866/Star%20Destroyer%20View%202.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Star%20Destroyer%20View%202.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying not just \u0022add more fuel\u0022 so if any one have any bright ideas on how to keep it afloat or have more questions, please share!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T22:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I usually tend to stick SRB\u0027s everywhere.

Your ship is huge, and to send this you must be ready to test your computer\u0027s CPU speed. You\u0027re gonna need a hell of a lot of parts. SRBs burn too slowly for the amount of thrust they give and will probably be more of a weight on this. As for the tail idea, it breaks a bit the fun and the point of launching this and you will have part generation problems. I don\u0027t recommend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see you already have outer boosters. I say try making two complete loops around your destroyer. I know skipper engines are more efficient but here you need a good TWR, so go with the mainsails. And for the in space control... You can try adding more RCS thrusters, it\u0027s really all you can do. Can you post a pick of the destroyer only in the VAB with the CoT and CoM showing?
