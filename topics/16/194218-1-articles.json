Now I have a bunch of crew cabins to carry space tourists (thanks to those who told me how to) and a payload bay. I have filled up the payload bay and I don\u0027t want to add another one. So I put the rest of my science experiments and batteries on the command pod. It was so crowded that I couldn\u0027t add all five parachutes that I used to have. I did add symmetry, but I was wondering if parachutes break (if I just use two for a whole bunch of weight). I use the radical parachutes. If they do break, how much tons can they hold?

Otherwise they will not break. But if you have too much weight compared to how many parachutes you have, they may not slow you down enough!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-27T20:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

will happen, instead, is that they simply \u003Cstrong\u003Ewon\u0027t slow you down as much\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 For example, if you put a Mk16 parachute on a Mk1 command pod and that\u0027s basically your whole craft-- i.e. under 1 ton weight-- then when you\u0027re coming in for a landing on the parachute, your descent speed will be something under 10 m/s and is quite safe.\u00A0 But if you had, say, a 100-ton craft, and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Estill\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E only had a single Mk1 parachute, it wouldn\u0027t break the parachute-- but you\u0027d be falling a lot more than 10 m/s, since you\u0027ve got so much more weight pulling it down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you shouldn\u0027t need to worry about breaking the parachutes, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebut\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you might be descending on them faster than you\u0027d like.\u00A0 If it\u0027s too fast, you could have a destructive crash instead of a safe \u0022soft\u0022 landing.\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(If you have any engine thrust available as you come in for a landing, you could use that to cushion it right before landing-- that\u0027s what I usually do on Duna, where the air is thin enough that ships tend to fall fairly quickly unless they spam a whole bunch of parachutes.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E technically possible to break a parachute, if they fully deploy when the vehicle is going too fast.\u00A0 However, in practice this is generally not a problem, because many KSP versions ago, they added a feature where parachutes have a built-in safety feature by default:\u00A0 they know when the ship is going slow enough to safely open, and will wait until then to open all the way.\u00A0 So that\u0027s generally not something you need to worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoninFrog","CreatedById":203049,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-28T03:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve ripped them off once.\u00A0 It was while
