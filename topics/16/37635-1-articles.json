To try to answer your questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe program takes into account the general layout of your craft to determine what it is by default, but I don\u0027t know how it works. You can change the designations though, by right-clicking on the control capsule and clicking Rename Vessel. You can change the name and type in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for building a space station, that\u0027s going to be all about docking. I recommend launching a couple of very small ships into orbit and getting comfortable with rendezvous and docking before attempting to build a station. For some ideas on how it\u0027s done, look at the video series from Scott Manley on YouTube.

I myself have launched whole bases and dropped them on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, both bases and stations look better when built from multiple launches, since you can build asymmetrical designs. When launching from Kerbin they pretty much have to be symmetrical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game decides what a ship is based on the root part. If it is a probe core, it becomes a probe. If it is a lander can 1 or 3 man and I think Cupola also counts, it becomes a lander, any other capsule counts as a ship. For Rovers, Bases and Stations, you have to set that yourself. Debris is debris when there is no control part on the thing, after separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the VAB, moving up and down you can use page up and page down.
