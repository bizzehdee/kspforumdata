Even after aligning the panel with the sun, going to the space center for a few hours then coming back to the ship, it has rotated so the ship no longer gets the energy it needs, and give it enough time, it will have depleted its batteries. Of course, this is only an issue with static panels and can be sorted by using self aligning panels but they are heavier and\u00A0costlier than the static ones, and they are only available later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to make sure the on-rails-ships keep their orientation?
