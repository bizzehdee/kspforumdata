That huge fairing has a large cross section. When you tilt a little away from prograde, the drag force increases a lot (due to a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E) and since that drag is applied forward of your center of mass, your rocket will flip.

In that case, the drag force causes a torque which OPPOSES the initial disturbance, stabilizing your rocket. You are on the right track with the fins on the SRBs - I have a couple ideas to help you get that to orbit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Put the SRBs on longer decouplers or on the end of a structural part.

Use liquid fueled boosters - the control authority from engine gimbals might counteract the fairing drag by brute force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Use vector engines (insane gimballing)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.

The whole thing is very stable (and yet still fairly responsive to control) through the liftoff. It\u0027s only when it wants to gravity turn way too fast that we run into problems. \u00A0Once you\u0027ve started the gravity turn it will readily yaw itself at an ever-increasing rate. \u00A0I\u0027ve tried to slow it as much as I can by hanging out in the westward edge of the prograde marker.
