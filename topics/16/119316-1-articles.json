To balance the other ones you could try to match them up by mass and put equal mass parts or groups of parts on opposite sides of the ship. You can also maybe balance by partially filling some fuel tanks. Lastly, I have not tried this myself but if the problem is your balance when ascending, you could put the heavier parts on the side that will be the top as you do your gravity turn to make your ship pitch down slower, or on what will be the bottom to make it pitch down faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKER (Kerbal Engineer) is really useful when trying to balance things because it will tell you the \u0022thrust angle\u0022 that your engine must gimbal to try and make your ship go in a straight line.

I\u0027ve had plenty of designs that kept going unstable and flipping above those speeds and it turned out there was nothing wrong with the balance, it was just too much speed. Usually around 12-15 km up or so you can safely go full thrust again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Speaking of aerodynamics, some of your imbalance may come from lopsided aerodynamics rather than mass, put up fairings to get rid of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Another reason I found for my rockets rolling out of control is putting up fins in triple symmetry with one fin pointing straight north or south, and then doing a gravity turn (east). The imbalance in lift on the wings meant my rocket kept rolling out of the direction I wanted it to go (and often out of control). Put fins up so they\u0027re symmetrical over your east-west axis (or with triple radial symmetry rotate about 30 degrees either way before your gravity turn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One trick I use is that, as long as the bulk of my fuel is in consumed in a balanced way, its pretty easy to balance payload that\u0027s a bit lopsided by putting one or two small radially attachable liquid fuel engines (like a twitch or spider) on the heavy side on the bottom of your rocket, and play with the trust limiter slider till the torque readout on Kerbal Engineer reads just a few tenths of a kNm. It\u0027ll free up reaction wheels capacity that may have been fighting at full strength just to keep pointing straight during ascent and restore some reactiveness to your controls (and steadying to your SAS). Mostly for when you\u0027re already up in space to prevent being pushed just slightly off course during burns, as those tiny engines don\u0027t do much for really big rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Even beter sometimes, some Vernors well away from your CoM, and turning RCS \u002B SAS on during accent helps too, and is more dynamic than the above as it\u0027ll push back at the actual torque, not just output a fixed amount on the opposite side as the trick with the radially attached engines, and it doesn\u0027t require kerbal engineer, but I think it\u0027s wasting a tiny bit more fuel as it\u0027s pushing at a right angle instead of straight down, and unless you disable the RCS fuel tanks during ascent, the regular RCS thrusters are consuming that as well on your way up and you find you\u0027re dry when you want to dock in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Edit: d\u0027oh ninja\u0027d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T14:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FyunchClick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eninja\u0026#039;d\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T13:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Warzouz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Warzouz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany engines and reactions wheels can compensate for that, but only if SAS is on.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen SAS is off you can use the trim controls (Alt\u002BWASDQE to set, Alt\u002BX to cancel) to use gimbals, reaction wheels, and control surfaces to compensate for thrust offset.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FungusForge","CreatedById":148313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T13:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to balancing rockets without redundancy, you put the heaviest thing (in this case a drill) on one side, and everything else on the other.
