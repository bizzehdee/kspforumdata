Is there a sure fire way to ensure that components are connected other than having to go to the launch pad an watch your design flip over? My understanding if you got the audible \u0022click\u0022 sound that the component connected. Is that not the case?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T18:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the component isn\u0027t connected to anything it doesn\u0027t count as being on your craft and won\u0027t appear on the launchpad, so it\u0027s pretty self evident.

The rocket is sitting at the pad, it does have launch clamps, but at the second stage it just bends over 90 degrees, breaks, KABOOM... you know the drill.
