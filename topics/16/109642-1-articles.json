Mun and Minmus will give you tons of science, and you need solar panels to get there. You already have enough tech to build a successful (if inelegant) Mun or Minmus lander, as long as you can maintain electrical power. Go, land, get your 4 instruments \u002B EVA, come back, tons of science. Repeat on different biomes for more science. Mmmm, science.\n\nAlso, don\u0027t forget that in munar (or Minmus) low orbit, you can repeatedly EVA over the various biomes, of which there are a lot."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:37:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, any tips on generating science at this point in the game?

Nowadays we need fairings and heatshields and they\u0027re inconveniently located in the airplane section of the tree instead of with the other rocket parts. This means you could well end up with the parts needed to make a simple airplane whether you really want them or not, perhaps even early enough in the game where Kerbin biomes are still worth doing a few of. So you can then make a wingless airplane (aka jet rover) and get alll the biomes at KSC (there are nearly 30 of them, for each building, antenna, tank farm, monument, flagpole, etc.) And maybe make a bit of money on low-altitude survey contracts close to KSC. But that\u0027s about the limit of their usefulness in the early-mid game."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T05:27:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E He can get thermometer, mystery goo, and materials study, including returning it for full value if he so chooses, for high and low space around the Mun, Minmus, and high for the Sun without even mentioning interplanetary.

Either one is like 90~100 per biome (so add up to ~200 per biome) on Mun.

Although just looking at it now, the electrics node also gets you an SAS capable probe pod thing which is really handy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T15:11:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrklaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T02:59:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Although just looking at it now, the electrics node also gets you an SAS capable probe pod thing which is really handy.\n\nEspecially in the early game, when you get a lot of your science from materials bay \u002B goo and are making those Mun landings. It\u0027s really nice to be able to send a little 1-kerbal craft crewed by a scientist, since 1.0.2 added the ability for scientists to reset those instruments (no more need to lug around that heavy lab with you). But if you have a scientist flying the craft, it\u0027s nigh impossible to steer right unless you have an SAS-capable command module to stabilize it for you.\n\nHaving a scientist fly the thing is a major win. You can get 3 takes on those instruments on a single mission (high orbit, low orbit, surface). 4, if you\u0027re clever about it and land close to a biome boundary so you can do a little hop to 2nd biome before heading home.\n\nBut you gotta have that OKTO to do it."}]}
