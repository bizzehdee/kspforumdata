Calculating the movement of objects and their interaction with the air and ground takes an immense number of calculations. The game cannot do all those calculations for multiple ships and still do the simulation in near real time. So in the stock game, the first solution chosen for this problem is that only a region about 25km in radius\u00A0is fully modeled (depending on your location, it could be smaller). Craft outside this range are either stored \u0022on rails\u0022, or are autodeleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the second concept is autodeletion. Calculating objects crashing into terrain also takes an immense number of calculations. So to simplify that calculation, each celestial body has an \u0022autodeletion altitude\u0022. Any craft that is outside the physics bubble\u00A0and is below the autodeletion altitude is assumed to have crashed into the terrain, and will be marked \u0022destroyed\u0022. On Kerbin, the autodeletion altitude is 25km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn stock, the only way around this is to watch the craft land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are other mods to the game that will allow you to stop time for one craft while you pilot another craft, and then switch back. Or mods that will just assume that any parts that are\u00A0reentering the atmosphere with enough\u00A0parachutes will land themselves -- and give you refunds for those parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-12T16:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust one thing, the last time I looked it was 23 km, not 25 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-12T16:49:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223293168\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170801\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518452230\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022102688\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryxal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Kryxal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust one thing, the last time I looked it was 23 km, not 25 km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the actual criterion for auto-deletion (on \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E planet with an atmosphere) is the altitude at which the atmosphere reaches 1% of Kerbin sea-level pressure.\u00A0 On Kerbin, that happens to be at approximately 23 km IIRC.\u00A0 On other planets, it would be at other altitudes (a lot lower on Duna, a lot higher on Eve, for example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-12T22:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAirless bodies also have autodeletion, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-12T23:17:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah unfortunately crafts that are sub-orbital will get deleted once you get far enough away from them (unless it\u0027s traveling away from the planet, in which case it will remain loaded. Only crafts moving towards the planet will get deleted). The best way to get your boosters landed is to take your craft into a high suborbital trajectory and then switch to your booster. While your craft continues to apoapsis, you can land your booster. Once booster is on the ground, switch back to your craft and burn for orbit.
