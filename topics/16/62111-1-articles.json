And so the game considers your ship as being in motion. Sometimes you just have to wait it out for 5-10 seconds, or sometimes longer before you can attempt a normal time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T05:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedCowboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedCowboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for replying so quickly.

I suspect what is happening, like FenrirWolf mentioned, is that when physics kicks in your ship is wobbling as the joints work themselves out. you can either wait for it to stop, or you can put more clamps on. Or, if you are really adventurous, you can save the whole thing as a sub assembly and then launch it from the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T21:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, you guys were right! The ship was slightly sagging between the clamps, causing a bit of motion. Duh. Thanks for your help guys, and Taki I like your sub assembly idea and gonna\u0027 try it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
