You just need to burn until your \u0022orbit\u0022 around Sun is not an ellipse anymore, and then turn around and with VERY light taps, burn back until it\u0027s an ellipse. Once your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is past Jool it takes less and less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (at your Sun \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E which is hopefully also in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you DO want to do a flyby of Jool then yes lower is better, and if the encounter itself doesn\u0027t give you a hyperbolic Sun orbit then you should do the burn at Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.
