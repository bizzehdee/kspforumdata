On the opposite side of Minmus from the landing site, burn retrograde until the periapsis is about 3500m.

Your periapsis should now be above the equator, directly south or north of the landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Create a maneuver node halfway between apo- and periapsis, and plan for a normal or anti-normal burn that will bring your orbit directly over the landing site.

You can help with either NavHud and/or Waypoint Manager. NavHud will put all of your navball markers on the hud, they also move as your ship moves so it is easier to track destinations.
