Slashy pretty much summarized it for you, but there\u0027s two things I\u0027d like to add:\n\n1) the reason why you suddenly had more success with RAPIERS is probably due to the fact that even though they are slightly less efficient than the combo, they are a lot more user friendly. You *can* be a lot more efficient with the combo, but you need to design and use it properly,using all the tips and tricks to squeeze every single bit of thrust out of those turbojets. If you don\u0027t do it right, you\u0027ll end up losing more efficiency than you would potentially gain due to aerodynamic losses, gravity losses, etc. RAPIERs are simple and user friendly. They might not be as efficient, but you probably won\u0027t end up losing a metric ton of delta-v due to inefficient flight profiles or sub-optimal design.\n\n2) one other reason is the thrust: airbreathers don\u0027t produce that much thrust in comparison to rocket engines of similar size. So you\u0027ll need a LOT of them on heavy planes and often pack 2 to 3 times as much airbreathing engines than rocket engines. That means you need a LOT of 1,25m hardpoints to put all those engines, but only a couple of rocket engines. If you replace all of those engines with RAPIERs, suddenly you\u0027ve got double or even triple the thrust in your rocket phase, but with slightly more weight and less engine efficiency. That means you\u0027ll suddenly have a lot less gravity losses than you might have had with the turbojet/rocket combo, but you don\u0027t want to be using that craft for long burns.\n\nSo in short: the Turbojet/rocket engine combo is potentially much more efficient, but less user friendly and forgiving: if you don\u0027t design and fly it correctly, you\u0027re likely to accrue more losses than gains. RAPIERs are easy to use, especially to get to LKO.\n\nGood example is interplanetary travel: if you can get a spaceplane in orbit with turbojets and one or two LVN nuclear engines, you can get it to another planet easy-peasy.

And anyone who tries to tell you extra thrust doesn\u0027t do you any good is full of jetwash. Increasing TWR (to a point) has been demonstrated to reduce dV requirements, both in theory and in practice. And the point where the diminishing returns from increased TWR becomes an issue is typically way above where most SSTO spaceplanes\u0027 TWR hangout. \n\nI\u0027m personally not a fan of SSTO spaceplanes with nukes, though. It\u0027s trying to do to much with a single vessel. IMO, spaceplanes excel at ferrying resources, kerbals, and small payloads between the surface and low orbit of Kerbin (and too a lesser degree Laythe).

Particularly in the latest version of FAR with the increased drag, you cap out at around 1300-1400 m/s, and adding extra jet engines doesn\u0027t get you that much. Because of the extra drag, you also want to climb quickly and get out of the atmosphere fast, which means that you\u0027ll still want a decent TWR when you switch to rockets, which means that tiny Rockomax engines might not cut it.

But that requires you to have something that can climb to about 30km and something near 3 km/s (or more) horizontal velocity without an asymmetric flameout. And that in turn requires knowledge of airflow and in what order to place your engines and intakes.\n\nI personally know how to do this, my point is that people new to building spaceplanes often don\u0027t know that and will have their turbojet/LOX combo craft do an asymmetric flameout at about 23km and 2.2-2.3 km/s, forcing them to go to rocket stage before that happens. At that point you \\*do\\* need a lot of thrust to get your plane up into orbit. Igniting from that point, your RAPIER\u0027s suddenly \\*seem\\* to be a lot more efficient because you can overcome the gravity losses. That was what I was trying to explain: why new players often think that RAPIER engines are super-efficient, ever though they\u0027re actually not, they\u0027re more user-friendly and forgiving.\n\nBut again, I wholeheartedly agree that if you avoid an asymmletric flameout, turbojets are vastly superior to RAPIERs. Now, if memory serves me correctly, SQUAD will fix the whole airflow leading to asymmetric flameout thing in 1.0. If that is indeed the case and asymetric flameout will no longer be a thing, then I do agree that Turbojets could do with a serious nerf.\n\nNow in response to the post just above mine: My advice is all stock.

What is your launch profile exactly? From experience and forum-browsing, I think that the best way is to go steep (45 to even 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 if your engines can handle it) up to about 15-20km, then level out and slowly climb to 25-27. Once you pass 27 km (roughly) you level out almost completely and squeeze whatever delta-V you can out of your turbojets. At flameout (around 30-32 km) you switch to rockets and pitch up hard to 45-60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in order to boost yourself out of atmo as quickly as possible. after that just coast to apoaps (giving small boosts to compensate for drag when neccesary) and circularize as usual."}]}
