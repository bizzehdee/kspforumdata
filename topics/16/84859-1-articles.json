For example nukes are really heavy (compared to other engines) but if your ssto is really heavy anyway this might not affect you too much. On the other hand if your craft is heavy then nukes may be too weak, or the layout of your ship may limit your engine configuration.

If you try to fly a spaceplane as if it were a vertical rocket, all you get is an inefficient overweight rocket. Flown like a spaceplane, however...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to fly a spaceplane to orbit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get to 20,000m however you like. Around a 45 degree climb is probably most fuel efficient, but jet engines use so little fuel that it doesn\u0027t matter much. If the plane has enough power, I usually climb at 75 degrees or so just to get it done quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When you get to 20,000m, level off and build some speed. You want to pile on as much horizontal velocity as possible while you make a slow ascent to 30,000m. Keep your angle of attack (the angle between where your nose is pointing and the direction in which the plane is actually moving, shown by the prograde marker when in surface mode) and climb rate low; by the time you hit 30,000m, they should both be around 10 or so. A low angle of attack reduces drag and helps your intakes work better. The low angle makes you climb slower, but that\u0027s okay; you need that time to get up to speed. As you go faster, the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate reduces, but as you go higher, the thinner air means that the angle of attack required to maintain a given climb rate increases. If you do it right, these two factors will roughly balance each other out and you should gain the necessary speed and altitude in a single smooth climb. However, a plane with some aerodynamic or piloting flaws may need to bounce up and down between 20,000 and 30,000m a couple of times while building speed before the final push.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Somewhere between 20,000m and 35,000m (exactly when depends on both plane and piloting), you\u0027ll start to run short of air. Don\u0027t switch to rockets immediately. If you\u0027ve got multiple engines going, shut some down to concentrate the available oxygen into the ones you keep running. If you\u0027ve already shut down as many as you can, throttle back a bit. You can dramatically increase your jet-only altitude by doing this, and once you get up to serious height the thin atmosphere means that you only need a tiny amount of thrust to accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Keep this going for as long as your plane and your patience can tolerate. A well-built and -flown plane should be able to get over Mach 4.5 and 30,000m in a single attempt on jets alone. Once you\u0027ve wrung as much speed and altitude out of the jets as possible (you want at least Mach 4 and 30,000m), force the nose up to 45 degrees and light the rockets. If you have both jets and rockets, don\u0027t shut down the jets immediately; the thrust of the rockets will drive a ram-air effect that kicks the jets back into life for a while. Keep the rockets burning until your apoapsis exceeds 70,000m, then shut off and coast until it\u0027s time to circularise. Point prograde and close your intakes while coasting to minimise drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good plane and pilot should be able to get the apoapsis to 70,000m with less than a minute of rocket power. Done properly, it requires very little fuel. But if you try to brute-force it from lower speeds and altitudes, the atmospheric drag is going to drain your oxidiser tanks before you get anywhere near orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T23:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022endl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022endl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso its the ascent path by the sound of it then, im using mechjeb is there a way to automate a none rocket ascent?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is nowhere near smart enough to fly a spaceplane on its own.

Let it fall to where you\u0027re almost back to full power on the engines, and resume your climb to speed-run height. Repeat 3 or 4 times, and each bounce will be higher and faster than the last (not just due to burning fuel, either). You should be able to squeeze another 200-300 m/s horizontal speed and a couple thousand meters of altitude out of this.

What really matters is climb rate; just pitch to set your climb rate to whatever you want it to be. Things start to get interesting at about 18-22km; you don\u0027t want to climb too fast by the time you get there. This probably means that you need to start clobbering down on your climb rate at 12-15km and maybe even much earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a brief phase when a lot happens all at once. Turbojets and Rapiers have their maximum thrust at an airspeed of 1000m/s, and half their rated thrust at zero and 2000m/s; when plotted, that function looks somewhat bell-curvish. This means that during most of the flight you have only 50-60% of their nominal thrust at your hands. But while you approach (and quickly pass) an airspeed of 1000m/s, your craft will be comparatively overpowered. Steer that power in the right direction, or at least keep it reined in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re playing in the stock atmosphere, you\u0027re ruled by terminal velocity. Not THE terminal velocity, but that of your plane: at any given altitude, there\u0027s an airspeed where your engines\u0027 thrust and your vessel\u0027s drag would even out. If you don\u0027t climb, you will slowly approach (but never quite reach) that speed. You want your climb rate to be \u0022just right\u0022 so that your vessel can accelerate at about the same rate as the terminal velocity increases. For most of my planes, this means about 100m/s climb when the engines begin starving, and ~40m/s by the time I get my first flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T12:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not convinced that it\u0027s better in *any* way.

With some of my planes, if I use a flat enough approach from launch to be hitting max speed and altitude at the same time, I end up losing my canards to Deadly Reentry on the way up. So with those ones, I deliberately use an overly-steep approach to start with, flatten out at 30,000m, \u0022bounce\u0022 off the thicker stuff at 25,000m and then climb again once I\u0027m up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 30,000m/Mach1, trying to pitch up enough to hold altitude while accelerating often puts the plane into a stall, increasing drag; better to let it drop and build speed and resume climbing once I\u0027m fast enough to do it with minimal angle of attack. Instead of trying to hold climb rate or pitch constant, I try to hold angle of attack as constant (and low) as possible. So long as your plane is right and you aren\u0027t actively diving, you\u0027ll start climbing again eventually once you get fast enough without having to touch the controls.

I am assuming stock physics and aerodynamics here so I\u0027m not sure if it applies to OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA/ build your plane right. Rules for intake air distribution have already been linked so I don\u0027t have to do that. Use enough engines for the plane mass, the more engines the less time and fuel will you need. Optimal engine numbers for planes, minimizing problems with asymmetric flameout are 1 and 4. 1 engine is obvious, 4 engines need to be interleaved with intakes properly and placed in order outer-inner-outer-inner. For instance: (1)-(2)-(4)-(3). Why? Because when first stage flameout occurs, both your outer engines will flameout at once and inner engines will keep running. No asymmetry, and giving you enough time to lower the throttle. One RAM intake per engine is enough to reach orbital speeds, but two or three make it more comfortable. Don\u0027t make the plane too heavy, have 2 intakes per 10 tons at least (some will call that airhogging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB/ flying\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ reach 10 km as fast as possible. Use maximum pitch that allows you to keep your speed. 70 m/s is fine as long as you\u0027re getting out of the soup fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ above 10 km concentrate on building your speed. Switch to map view and watch your apoapsis. Switch navball to orbital mode. Raise your apoapsis to 20-25 km, not higher until you reach at least 1000 m/s. Regulate the apoapsis with pitch, don\u0027t be afraid to burn below prograde if your apoapsis is too high. Then raise it to 30 km and build your speed to about 1800 m/s. Then raise the apoapsis to 36 km and burn strictly prograde. If you have enough power, your orbit will grow out of atmosphere at this point. If you don\u0027t have enough power and reach the apoapsis, pitch up and keep the plane at the apoapsis (or rather the apoapsis below the plane) by changing pitch slightly up and down, continue burning until the apoapsis jumps to the other side of planet. After that, burn prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/ build orbital speed by burning prograde. As you lose air, your engines will start decreasing their thrust. When you get a flameout, decrease thrust to 2/3, then 1/3, and then go to just one tick above zero thrust.
