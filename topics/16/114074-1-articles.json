After aligning everything properly I found out that I used the mk3 Fuselage with liquid fuel and oxidizer instead of the liquidfuel one. \n\nIf I have to take her apart to replace this part I will lose many hours of tweaking and testing so it would be really great if you guys can explain how to properly swap out the parts trough savefile editing. A simple find\u0026replace notepad job didn\u0027t do the trick."},{"CreatedByName":"robertlong13","CreatedById":146954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T14:55:54Z","Content":"I did a test with find/replace and it worked for me.
