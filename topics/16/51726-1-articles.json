The amount of delta-V you can get from that depends on the mass of the payload you\u0027re attempting to move with it and the efficiency (specific impulse) of the engine - and to calculate it, use the Rocket Equation that both previous posters have generously provided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a specific value, we need to know the payload mass and what engine you\u0027re using.
