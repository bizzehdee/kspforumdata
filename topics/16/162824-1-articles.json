So it makes the game harder. You need to be in range to be able to transmit experiments through an antenna. You need to have at least a tiny amount of signal in order to be able to fully control unmanned ships. If you go out of range, your control level for the ship may be decreased or eliminated (depending on your settings). So it makes a need for pilots on ships (who can always keep the ship in full control), or for relay antennas. However, setting up a relay network is complicated because you need to understand the mathematics of antenna ranges (see the wiki).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
