At first I thought maybe a circular orbit at 250km. But am now more inclined to run it in an elliptical orbit of 150km-350km. I\u0027m not efficient enough in my launches to reliably get to a 150km station in one shot. Is a circular orbit more preferable than the elliptical? Should I aim more towards a 250km or 350km circular or is elliptical ok?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther notes: career play on normal/moderate setting with Comms Net enabled.

For sure you\u0027ll get mining contracts for both. These often have the requirement to put the ore in orbit of Kerbin and although just having the ore already on a Kerbin station is enough to satisfy this requirement you can use the opportunity to ferry ore to an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E on a Kerbin station from both the Mun and Minmus. To be able to reach Kerbin station from the surface of the Mun with my standard ore hauler - carries 4590 liquid fuel and 6000 ore - I need to put the station in a circular 650km orbit around Kerbin. An elliptical orbit with the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E might suffice I guess but would be harder and more time consuming to set up a rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStations around both Mun and Minmus serve as useful collection points for rescues using ships based at these stations.

However, it takes a long time to get from Minmus to Kerbin. So the advantage to mining on the Mun and returning the fuel from there to Kerbin is that it\u0027s a 1-day trip.
