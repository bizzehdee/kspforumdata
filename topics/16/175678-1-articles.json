Latitude and longitude are shown in the KerbNet map. Just move the curser around the map until you are close to the coordinates you are looking for. To be 100% accurate, your probe needs to cross the spot you are looking for, or at least need to be close to that spot. As soon you are close, reduce the FOV to be more precise when setting a target marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods like ScanSat are really helpful if you need to find coordinates, because you can create a zoomable map of a whole planet/moon and you can look around the map for your coordinates, independet of the position of your probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-06T17:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181256-klapaucius/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022181256\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181256-klapaucius/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Klapaucius\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods are the easy way for most.\u00A0 SCANSat is very good for that, but I will caution you that you need to have maps and the right tech in order to get precise coordinates.\u00A0 You also need to find the coordinates; so far as I know, you cannot use coordinates as an input.\u00A0 MechJeb can do accurate coordinates (and out of the box, too, if you set it that way), but it is a somewhat more difficult task because, if I\u0027m not completely forgetful, its main purpose with coordinates was to take a chosen landing target and find the coordinates for it, not take coordinates and use them\u00A0to find a target.\u00A0 Hyperedit will also do the job, but it will take a vessel to the location, not so much set a marker for the location.\u00A0 Of course, you can use the vessel as the marker\u00A0or plant a flag once you get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find personally that the best mod to find a place from a set of coordinates is \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022119307\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nightingale\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94432-14x-waypoint-manager-v272-2018-03-10/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EWaypoint Manager\u003C/a\u003E, hence the link.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWithout mods, you can use Kerbnet as \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187982-4x4cheesecake/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022187982\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/187982-4x4cheesecake/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@4x4cheesecake\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0suggested (I don\u0027t, but my thought is to question whether it\u0027s necessary to have a probe in orbit to find coordinates; can you not install a KerbNet-capable part on a rover or a plane?), or you can go with the age-old method of planting a series of flags.\u00A0 It won\u0027t help you find a location from the coordinates, but it can help you find the coordinates of a location.\u00A0 Once you set a few flags, you can use those coordinates to interpolate a desired destination.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-06T17:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223394284\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175678\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221528305974\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zhetaan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Zhetaan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncan you not install a KerbNet-capable part on a rover or a plane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can, but your map will display just a small part of the surface.
