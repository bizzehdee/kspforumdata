When you enter physics warp, if the timer is red, it means that the engine is skipping physics calculations in order to maintain physics warp. If at 1x speed the timer is yellow, it means time is being scaled so that the computer has enough time to calculate physics and you really should not enter time warp. So bottom line: don\u0027t use physics warp if the timer goes red unless you\u0027re really sure you know what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T23:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh physics warp makes the physics engine do very weird things.
