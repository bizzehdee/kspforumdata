Watch your inclination! Really, if you don\u0027t do it right at launch, it\u0027ll eat up half you dV before you can even think about a rendezvous. Changing inclination is bloody expensive IRL, and RSS simulates that. If you\u0027ve got more than 0.1 degree of inclination to correct, you might have trouble (about 0.5 degrees and it\u0027s a scrub if you\u0027re using a Soyuz). I\u0027ve ran afoul of this a few times. Otherwise, it\u0027s just like in normal-scale KSP, just that it takes longer due to dVs involved (you really want to watch your fuel in RSS).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
