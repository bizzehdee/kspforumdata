Unfortunately, it has been a long while since I last played KSP, and I lost my flight abilities. I designed a rocket that seems to look aerodynamically stable, but every damn time it suddenly flips over and flies on its butt at around 6km altitude, no matter how fast I am going. I am not doing the \u0022head straight up and then turn 45\u00B0 at 10km\u0022 strategy as I am aware it does not apply anymore - I am slowly doing the gravity turn as soon as I take off.
