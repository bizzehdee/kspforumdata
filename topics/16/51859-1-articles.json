In the SPH your ONLY symmetry option is bilateral, i.e. two mirrored sides; in the VAB you ONLY have radial symmetry, i.e. parts get rotated around to balance out. Think of how a cat or dog is \u0022built\u0022 (bilaterally symmetric) vs. a jellyfish or flower (radially symmetric).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
