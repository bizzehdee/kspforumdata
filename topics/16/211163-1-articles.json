I\u0027ve already got most of the craft back where they need to be, but there\u0027s one main difference. In my non-modded save, I have a Class I (Gargantuan) comet situated in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. How would one go about manifesting a new one without having to launch a bunch of SENTINELs and waiting thousands of years? I\u0027ve heard about adding a new vessel through save file editing, but I don\u0027t know how to do that. Can anyone help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
