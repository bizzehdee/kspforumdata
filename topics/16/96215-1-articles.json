My orbit of one spacecraft is getting lower, although Periapsis and Apoapsis is above 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile trying to achieve a path to Minmus (I spent a lot of time to this), suddenly my spacecraft was in an orbit within the atmosphere of Kerbin and decreasing fast, which confuses me. I was trying to find any way to Minmus, which costs less fuel as possible, therefore I made some screenshots during gaming, please see attached. You can see, that within a few seconds (the time between creating the screenshots), the Apoapsis was getting from 72,797m to 72790m.

This is due to a combination of two causes -- one, the calculations use 32-bit floating-point numbers, which are inherently inaccurate as a result of the difficulty of storing exponents in binary (the detailed reason on that is fairly involved, even for me, but feel free to go look it up if you\u0027re curious. Be prepared to re-read things here and there, though, it can take a bit to get what\u0027s going on, sometimes!); and two, the craft\u0027s position is calculated using the root part (often a command pod) as the \u0027center\u0027 of the craft.

As you can see the Periapsis is now 60m lower and the Apoapsis 40m higher (latest update: PE 220m lower, AP still \u002B40m). So, this vessel would have an PE of 69000m after 200 orbits. I am sure, the values would be greater if I would be in a lower orbit. The third picture has been taken after the second orbit, which I have warped... and, compared to the first picture, not much has happened... isn\u0027t it interesting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, and btw, the orbital period is also getting faster...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my TWR changing because of the differents hights I have during one orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not yet changed the configuration to test if something will be different...

Than I was thinking: relative to Kerbal, the craft is always pointing into a different direction (if SAS is on; if it is off, the craft shall not rotate) on one orbit and the mysterious force should lift the orbit on one side of the Kerbal and lower the orbit on the other side of Kerbal... am I right?
