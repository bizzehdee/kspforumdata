I\u0027ll be on the final apporach, within a couple kilometers of the other craft, and for no reason at all, the prograde and retrograde markers will just start moving on their own, and the target-relative speed will go slowly change. I\u0027m not doing any thing while it happens, sometimes it happens while i\u0027m in time warp, it all happens on its own!

The other craft is simply on a slightly different orbit, therefore going to end up somewhere else than you are.\n\nThe only place where you can be so that your relative velocity will stay 0 is directly ahead/behind a craft, on the same orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T01:28:20Z","Content":"Without knowing the magnitude of the change, it\u0027s hard to say. The typical answer is \u0022Unless two objects in orbit are either physically fixed together, or in /exactly/ the same /truly circular/ orbit, they cannot maintain zero relative velocity to one another without thrusting.\u0022 in every other situation, normal orbital mechanics means that they\u0027ll pick up relative velocity to one another."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T01:28:58Z","Content":"Unless you\u0027re perfectly within the exact same orbit as your target, you\u0027re going to drift apart after a period of time. To correct this, you\u0027ll want to use your RCS to move the prograde marker so that it continues to overlap with your target so you keep closing in.\n\nIn addition, if you\u0027re even a little off target, then as you get closer your relative velocity is going to point further and further away from your target. Think about it this way: you\u0027re aiming a dart at a small circle 2 miles away. You\u0027re off by 10 inches to the right. When you\u0027re first closing in, it looks like you\u0027re headed straight for it, but as you get closer, you\u0027ll notice that your velocity isn\u0027t exactly on target. Then as you fly past it, your velocity will start pointing away from your target.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-19T01:31:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T03:00:29Z","Content":"As a side note, if your approach is along the radial/anti-radial axis, your difference in orbits is going to cause you to approach the docking target instead of drifting to the side."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T05:49:50Z","Content":"The only way you will not drift away is if you are PRECISELY the same orbit.

The closer you are to the other ship when you match, the less noticeable the difference will be, and at 100m it really shouldn\u0027t interfere much with the docking manoeuvre.
