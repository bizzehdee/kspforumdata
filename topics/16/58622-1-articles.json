All these answers apply to the latter. For the former, you don\u0027t actually have to, that was a mistake early on on one explanitory page that never got completely cleaned up. For highest efficiency, you can still launch into a prograde orbit of Kerbin, you just do your ejection burn early on the day side of Kerbin instead of early on the night side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T17:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to orbit retrograde (that would mean turning west instead of east during takeoff), you just have to burn retrograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA retrograde orbit is easy to get into, either by launching into one, or making the transfer to set it up that way.
