On the other hand, it\u0027s more difficult to plan your transfers because you\u0027re limited to times when the moon is in the correct position with respect to Kerbin AND Kerbin is in the optimal position as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI end\u00A0up putting my fueling stations in Kerbin orbit instead. It gives me a lot more flexibility in planning my transfer burns. If you\u0027re mining a moon a nuclear tug makes a great fuel tanker. Another option is to capture a nice juicy asteroid and mine that for fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-08T20:15:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2019 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Tyko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-08T22:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Q\u0027s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-09T15:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223554469\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182732\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221552070364\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195760\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sweetnsaltyish\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Sweetnsaltyish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nto the station on minus that i built\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt shouldn\u0027t take much fuel to transfer from Mun orbit to Minmus orbit... you\u0027d likely use a non-trivial fraction of that requirement just to rendezvous with the Mun fuel depot.\u00A0 So if you\u0027re not at great risk of running out of fuel at that point, it might not be worth it.\u00A0 And if you build it for this purpose, it could be relatively small.\u00A0 But without knowing the size of the ships you\u0027re planning on refueling, I don\u0027t think we can suggest a specific size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you doing some kind of Mun-Minmus grand tour to level up crew or complete tourist contracts?\u00A0 If you already have a Minmus station, it could make sense to just go there first, so that you can replenish what you used transferring from Kerbin.\u00A0 Also, if your ship is single-stage / reusable, it can be nice to do the Mun second when your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is higher.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
