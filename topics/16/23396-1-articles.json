I\u0027ve tried to find the answer to this, the closest thing I found was the wiki:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Apollo_11\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Apollo_11\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to do the Mun Orbit scenario. I start out by moving two of my Kerbals to the lander can. I then right click the clamp-o-tron docking port (on the lander can side) and click \u0022control from here\u0022 and then \u0022decouple node\u0022. However, every time I do that the control transfers to the command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, am I doing the undocking wrong? I want to undock and control the lander for descent. I know in the Station One scenario, there is a specific part where I can select \u0027undock\u0027 instead of \u0027decouple\u0027. Is there a part like that on the lander can that I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond of all, is there a way to switch control between ships after undocking? Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rryy","CreatedById":57357,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T22:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re undocking it right.

It might be random and I\u0027m just seeing a pattern that doesn\u0027t exist, but I\u0027m pretty sure that you can\u0027t manage to control the part you want by the way you undock.

For example, if you select \u0027control from here\u0027 on a docking port, it changes your \u0027forward\u0027 to straight out from the port, instead of wherever the front of your command pod is. It flips around your navball accordingly, so it makes lining up with another docking port easier. Remember that orientations are very weird and relative in space. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jemofthewest","CreatedById":59547,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T00:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much everyone!

The trick is getting them aligned as always; both the Command Pod and the Lander Can have enough torque to do that, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
