It was supposed to land on Minimus or the Mun in my science save, but each time I take it up to 3.4 - 3.6 kilometers, it flips out! I tried taking out anything that would make the problem worse with my limited tech. Still there. I cheated in the visuals for the aerodynamics in alt-f12. I saw nothing. I didn\u0027t see my speed, but I might have been around 120 m/s. So WHY?\n\n.craft file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJobFNvNzgxanlPejA/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6kMiFN2UFJobFNvNzgxanlPejA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nEDIT: Sorry for not including pic, and thanks for the info. Will try piloting now.\n\nEDIT2: A few minutes after the first edit, and I\u0027m in space! I put the fins in the right places and crammed everything I could into the service bay. It was still one heck of a ride (because my core stage was a noodle rocket), but I\u0027m in space! Thanks, and I will turn this thread to answered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T18:20:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 06:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:10:08Z","Content":"Do you have a picture of it in the VAB/prelaunch?

Just a picture of the craft and more information. What is your thrust to weight ratio? You want no more then 1.7 roughly. When do you start pitching? And how hard do you pitch? Start the turn early around 60m/s and pitch 5-10 degrees. The higher the TWR the earlier the turn and more you can initially pitch. Then don\u0027t go any more then a few degrees off prograde. Let gravity make your prograde vector fall and follow it. \n\nGood rule of thumb I find is you want to be 25 degrees at 250m/s , 50 at 500, 75 at 750 and by time you hit 1000m/s you want to be almost horizontal. \n\nNow you can\u0027t force your craft to hit those marks. You have to perform your pitch maneuver right so that your prograde vector hits them naturally.\n\nToo much input is a bad thing. If your fingers are working too hard somethings not right."},{"CreatedByName":"Landge","CreatedById":57671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:21:08Z","Content":"Have you tried adding SAS and fins that pivot? Not the stiff ones. At launch go straight up until about 10,000m. The atmosphere will begin to thin out enough where you can start turning your craft. Gentle taps on the keyboard at first. Don\u0027t stray too far from the prograde circle until clear of the thickest part. There is supposed to be gravity assist turning but I have to keep SAS on or my rockets will gravity assist themselves into a new crater."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:22:43Z","Content":"A picture is worth 1000 craft files ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBut I loaded it anyway. You are lacking fins on the rear. I\u0027d put 4 of them around the swivel engine.\n\nAlso, those physicsless parts might still cause drag. The goo pods surely do. Drag at the top of your craft = bad. Put them all in a service bay.\n\nAlso, do a slow gradual turn to orbit, don\u0027t crank it over at 10km like in the old days."},{"CreatedByName":"NevilX","CreatedById":142777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:31:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, do a slow gradual turn to orbit, don\u0027t crank it over at 10km like in the old days.\n\nThis.\n\nSince 1.0, when you turn your rocket very fast while below ~16km, air pushing on front of the rocket (because you are still moving up) will cause the rocket to flip. Either do it more slowly, or higher up."}]}
