Kerbal alternative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you happen to not want ailerons, you can still decouple yaw from roll by having tail fins both above and below the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E, whose yaw moments counteract eachother during roll (and vice-versa). The easy way would be just putting a symmetric tail fin pointing down, but to increase ground clearance asymetric versions can be made with the lower control surfaces raised up. As it turns out, when yaw and roll are decoupled in this way, flight feels a lot more crisp and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E can keep you better on point during hard maneuvers!
