I\u0027ve found there are 2 ways you can intercept in this scenario, you can do a burn to adjust your inclination to match what your trying to dock with and then do an intercept burn, or you can wait several orbits until you can get an intercept directly at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E, which was the way I did it this time. The distance at Intercept was just under 5k so not the closest I\u0027ve ever done, but I successfully intercepted and docked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it got me thinking, which method (apart from launching directly into the correct orbit) is more fuel efficient? Adjusting the inclination to match the target vessel 1st or the direct intercept? Assuming your inclination is off by no more than 5 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJohn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-29T22:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, theoretically you always end up having to do both. That is, by the time you dock vessel 2 to vessel 1 -- vessel 2 has to be in exactly the same orbit as vessel 1, and they have to be at the same location. Which means you had to do both an inclination change, and a rendezvous maneuver. But often, combining two maneuvers so that you do them both at the same time can save you a little bit. On the other hand, the way most people do inclination changes is slightly inefficient -- so to some extent it depends on your piloting skills. But my guess is that most pilots would save at least 0.7\u00A0m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E by doing a careful high-speed direct intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TanDeeJay","CreatedById":188578,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-30T01:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship I was flying was my fuel transporter, transporting fuel to a science ship waiting to transfer to minimus.
