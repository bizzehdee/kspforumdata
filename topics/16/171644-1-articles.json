The first is a \u0022haul part to X situation\u0022 contract, in which case all you need is to have it onboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you likely have is the \u0022test part in X situation\u0022 contract. For this, you either need to right-click and click \u0022test part\u0022, or use staging to activate the engine, mostly likely the latter for engines. And yes, this means hauling the Twin Boar, an engine clearly intended for booster work, all the way to orbit before activating it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T05:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn add-on to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/122674-starman4308/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022122674\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/122674-starman4308/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Starman4308\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s post.
