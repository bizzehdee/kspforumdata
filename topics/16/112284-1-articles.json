Help a fellow out with some design and fly hints, will you? The thing is: our space program prospered really well under the aegis of the policy \u0027*Math is for sissies, manly kerbals add moar boosters!*\u0027 But lately the manager\u0027s wife moved onto our prospect, since she wanted to see the glaring lights of vast science. That she loved very much. But for some reason she couldn\u0027t extend her admiration to the sonic waves that rapid combustion of the inevitable \u0027*moar boosters*\u0027 happen.\n\nSo she insited on asphalting the potatoe field where we test our rovers and presonally led the undusting of the SPH. She wants a rocket that doesn\u0027t have exploding parts. Blasphemy! But what could we do, she\u0027s the bosses wife afterall. So we started testing of such craft. Geting to space on these is haaard. Well, harder than it was in Jeb\u0027s early days he says. Anyways, let me show you the most succesful variant. Or at least the best looking one.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Fj17m)\n\nYeah, I know, we could have uploaded the plans, but here at the Recreational Deaeronautics, we believe in eyeballing stuff. Anyways, having trouble gettin\u0027 to orbit... or, um... even out to space for a quick sip of vacuum. Regardless how *-right-* it looks (and handles). Not sure if it\u0027s a design flaw or flight error.\n\nWe tried adding more boosters or bigger engines with less success. Mind you, we don\u0027t have the really advanced kinda\u0027 stuff - you can see our options on the above screens. Am I just dreaming too high with our capabilities? That payload is only like 3 tonnes... well, that sounds much now that I better think of it. *\\*note: do an empty testing too\\**\n\nAnyways, Jeb says that all is well until he goes fast or goes high. He heard somewhere that one sould be able to get to 25k on such with like 1200 m/s. Well, he tried fast ascension, but stuff started to explode, and the point was to avert that. It seemed better to do the acceleration above 18k but Jeb couldn\u0027t gain speed and altitude at the same time. Air is too thin I feel, but adding moar... umm, of those small intakes didn\u0027t help. Boss\u0027s wife is furious.\n\nSo, fellow Kermans... what are we doing so seriously wrong?\n\nPS.: How fast is Mach-3?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T06:57:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T19:48:40Z","Content":"Mach 3 is 340 \\* 3 = 1020 m/s\n\nFor your plane, whats the TWR of the 3 909s when you first switch to rocket mode?

That happens in the stock atmo around 10k, so the whole Isp argument is moot.

At least until they get Advanced Aerodynamics (and the Mk2 to 2.5 meter adapter that comes with it); for now they could replace the tri-adapter with an emptied Mk2 to 1.25 adapter and mount the Swivel to that.

Wings still are useful for the 10-30 km range where you build speed since they allow more efficient flight profile there. (where you do 40% of your orbital acceleration) Granted a high TWR jet needs less wing, but it still wants some. The only time jets don\u0027t need wings is when you enter the wasteful 1.8 TWR range where they behave as aspirated rockets. Wings also improve margins for landing.\n\nFor orbital ops space planes, TWR of the anaerobic engine is the prime consideration. With the extra mass they take, they will never be an economic choice for operation beyond LKO. So you only need a few hundred dV. However a TWR above .7 at the start of anaerobic mode is very important to a successful accent to 40 km where drag falls off and an efficient gravity turn doing so. The smaller the engine to do so, the more efficient because of mass and drag. Too much engine surface at the back is surprisingly draggy.\n\nThese factors are why the aerospike is such a good space plane engine. It has good TWR, minimal drag, and top tier efficiency.\n\nLow TWR (.3-.6) designs either need to fly at 30-36 km for extra lift while building horizontal speed for an accent like .90 (wasting dV to the reduced but still present drag), or waste a lot of dV in radial thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T20:38:21Z","Content":"Thanks for all the answers again!

A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S. are your friends - I\u0027d suggest getting them unlocked at the earliest opportunity - but so is having plenty of pitch authority. If you can control your pitch, you can control your temperature - just slow down your rate of descent if it looks like something\u0027s trying to overheat.\n\nYour CoM position will also have changed on account of your plane having used up its rocket fuel to get into orbit. Now, it looks to me like you\u0027ve got more mass ahead of your tanks than behind them, so the CoM should shift towards the nose; your plane will probably be slightly less maneuverable than it was on the way up but still controllable, and that\u0027s good as long as it doesn\u0027t shift forward **too** far (and then you get lawn dart behavior - which is bad on entry since you can\u0027t effectively slow sown your descent if you need to). The CoM going forward is a damn sight better than the alternative - the CoM shifts aft and winds up aft of the CoL, which is bad since at that point you\u0027re dynamically unstable and if you overwork the controls in the slightest, you\u0027re going to head into a spin and likely a crash. If in the future you want to be sure which direction your CoM will go (or if you want to set things up so it doesn\u0027t move much at all), try out a mod called RCS Build Aid - among its useful features is a \u0022dry center of mass\u0022 indicator, which will show you where the CoM will be when your plane is out of fuel.\n\nOne other mod I\u0027ll throw out there is NavUtilities. It\u0027s an integrated ILS, which will make a Runway landing much easier to accomplish. Barring that, there\u0027s the old \u0022flags on either end of the Runway\u0022 trick, which I\u0027d be happy to elaborate on further if it\u0027s something you\u0027re interested in."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T21:56:05Z","Content":"Congrats on getting to space.

A little dihedral (angling your wings upward 5 degrees or so) wouldn\u0027t hurt either.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My comp is from the last decade, so I tend to skip mods that I can workaround in stock. Think I got a pretty accurate dryCoM readout by removing the payload and the fuel. I didn\u0027t know about the flags trick - anything more to it than putting them there so my runaway is marked?\n\nSame boat on the CPU - on the chip it says \u0022Made in Byzantium\u0022.\n\nThere\u0027s not much more to the flags trick than that. I usually use rovers instead of flags because my flags have a tendency to vanish or spontaneously combust on me - and once they\u0027re in place, I set the parking brake and re-label them as bases; this gives you the bonus of being able to see where they are A) from orbit and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) a hundred klicks out, which is reaaaaly handy when you want to get aligned well in advance. I usually also add one or two more rovers on the inland side of the runway (the west side) at 1 kilometer and 5 kilometers out; you can continue adding them at five kilometer increments if you like - the most I had at one time went out to 30 kilometers (that was in 0.21 or so and with the next version of the game the Runway shifted over, rendering my ILS useless for alignment - otherwise I might still be using that one). The more markers you\u0027ve got, the more points you have to align, the more you can be assured that your alignment is good from further away.\n\nAnd then, if you label them judiciously, you can use the same ground markers to help you find a good glide slope (I did the math once and it came out to something like a 5.7 degree slope, a tad steep but it does help you avoid the mountains west of KSC pretty effectively). Here\u0027s how that works - label your ground markers (regardless of if it\u0027s a flag, rover, whatever) by the distance they are to the Runway (I label the ones on the Runway as KSC 09 and KSC 27, and the ones inland as \u0022Meatball - 1 km\u0022, \u0022Meatball - 5 km\u0022, etc.). When you\u0027re looking at your markers, note the distance you are from the marker, and add to that the distance the marker is from the Runway (for example, let\u0027s say I\u0027m 4.7 kilometers from Meatball - 10 km; 4.7 \u002B 10 = 14.7). You multiply that total by 100, and then add 100. The result is what you want your altimeter to read (so in the aforementioned example, (14.7 \\* 100) \u002B 100 = 1570); if your altimeter reading is higher, you\u0027re too high and if it\u0027s lower, you\u0027re too low, simple as that. You have to be able to do the math in your head pretty quickly (or just hit pause frequently), but it\u0027s a pretty effective system. I used to use it before I installed NavUtilities, and even to this day I\u0027ll still set rover/bases on either end of the Runway pretty early on.\n\nNote that if you\u0027re trying to land on KSC 27, the system still works (you can still align with the inland ground markers), but you\u0027ll only be able to use the KSC 27 marker to judge your glide slope.\n\nNo rover tech? No problem - you\u0027ve already at least unlocked Aviation, otherwise you wouldn\u0027t be asking about planes in the first place. Unlock Basic Science (for 45 sci) if you haven\u0027t already so you\u0027ve got the Stayputnik. Then build an assembly consisting of a Stayputnik, a battery pack or two, a Mk1 Fuselage, a Wheesley engine, a Radial Intake, and add a set of tricycle bush-plane landing gear. Add a radial chute for good measure. Limit the thrust of the Wheesley to about 10%. For the KSC 09 and inland markers, start off slowly - just enough thrust to get going, get turned around, and drive it just off the edge of the Runway. Kill the thrust, pop the chute, set the brake, relabel as needed. For the KSC 27 marker, you can open up the thrust a bit but pay attention to the piano keys - you don\u0027t want to be going too fast when you get to the end of the ski-jump ramp, otherwise your little pseudo-rover is probably going in the drink. Same as before - get off the raised green area, kill the thrust, pop the chute, set the brake, relabel.\n\nAnd of course, you can always use flags if your Kerbals can plant them; just because they commit random acts of magic for me doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027ll do the same for you.\n\nI hope that\u0027s helpful to you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T14:19:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T15:10:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And of course, you can always use flags if your Kerbals can plant them; just because they commit random acts of magic for me doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027ll do the same for you.\n\nDon\u0027t think I ever had a disappearing flag - though I don\u0027t think I ever zoomed above them at supersonic speeds either. Anyways, placing various markers at set distances with any technology is an easy enough task - compared to landing an SSTO. Tech-tree is almost done by the way - and I never even left Kerbin\u0027s SoI. I also think computer performance will be a bigger limiting factor than finances. That \u0027normal\u0027 difficulty is too easy.\n\nAhh, going off topic here... Thanks again, see ya out there!"}]}
