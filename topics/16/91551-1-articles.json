A plane would normally only use flaps for taking off or landing, not to be confused with \u003Cstrong\u003Eair brakes\u003C/strong\u003E which are designed to maximise drag and are necessarily much stronger than flaps. Air brakes are used by carrier-based aircraft and dive bombers, amongst others, where sudden reductions in airspeed are necessary for certain manoeuvres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock KSP doesn\u0027t have any parts that perform these functions, but mods are available that do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-29T12:26:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2014 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T14:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t mess with the tweakables at all, a control surface will try to respond to all control inputs as best it can according to its location. Sometimes you can get away with this, but most often this results in undesired rolling and yawing. For better results, you can map specific control surfaces to specific inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of control surfaces as the ends of levers attached to your craft\u0027s center of mass: the longer the lever is, the more torque your control surfaces can apply. Thus, for maximum control you want your surfaces as far from the CoM as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the pitch axis, set the horizontal surfaces near the front and back of the aircraft to \u0022pitch\u0022. These surfaces are usually called elevators and canards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the yaw axis, set the vertical surfaces on the tailplane to \u0022yaw\u0022 only. This is your rudder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the roll axis, set the horizontal surfaces that are farthest out on the wings to \u0022roll\u0022 only. These are your ailerons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you understand the basics, you can mix and match as needed. Maybe rolling is a little sluggish, so you can enable \u0022roll\u0022 on your elevators to turn them into elevons. Or you have a V-tail, so you enable both pitch and yaw to turn your surfaces into ruddervators.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T20:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo see how well each surface will do at each job, turn on your CoM in the SPH. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitch is turning the plane on a side-to-side line through the CoM, thus the front or back placement.
