Naturally, drag forces will flip it over. I\\\u0027ve had this problem countless times. It could also be that your center of gravity is not in line with the center of lift.\n\nMy go-to plane would be this: \n\n\u003E ![CPyet.png](http://i.imgur.com/CPyet.png)\n\nIt uses Tosh\\\u0027s cart plugin for landing gear, which works marvelously. I\\\u0027ve never had a problem, and it has a decent range of about ~40km\n\nHope I helped."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T00:55:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E whenever i construct a spaceplane, it usally likes to pitch up to 90 degrees and stall.\n\nSounds like your plane\\\u0027s center of gravity is waay behind the wings.
