Mostly about rendez-vous as I\u0027m finishing to build Mir and I\u0027ll begin building the ISS. So I thought it would be good to ask the community because some people are nearly astrophysicians \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhat is the best way to reach a really high orbit ?

For rendezvous it depends on what orbit it\u0027s at, if it\u0027s at 100,000 direct ascent, if it\u0027s at 500,000, then yeah, go into a lower orbit. And for the gravity turn, just start at 10,000, it saves fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T19:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. I think if you punch it for a really high Ap, you\u0027ll have less gravity to deal with when raising Pe. That said, the orbit would have to be really high, i don\u0027t think it\u0027s any good for a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It should be more efficient to do a direct ascent, but if you miss you\u0027ll waste more fuel correcting. Using maneuver nodes is also easier if you already have an established orbit. But if you know the angle then go direct and complete the rendezvous normally once you close in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Hmm, tough. Usually it depends on the weight and thrust of the thing. Slow rockets are better off doing it after 10km as the air thins considerably and velocity picks up more easily. You really don\u0027t need to lose fuel to gravity. Another factor is staging. It may be better to delay the turn if you\u0027ll be dropping tanks very soon. Generally grabbing horizontal velocity between 5-10km is not worth it as the gain is too small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T19:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t made any practical experiments with it, but normally (at least for the standard 100km orbit) I prefer a rather steep ascent ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith a gravity turn to ~20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 10km and another to ~40-45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 20-25km (and additional turns at higher altitudes as i see fit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy reasoning is that a high vertical speed component ensures, that I quickly pass the lower atmospheric regions and therefore minimize losses due to drag\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
