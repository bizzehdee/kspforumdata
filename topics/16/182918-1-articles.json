The only reason to use panthers in dry mode is if your plane has low-enough drag that those two engines will make it go supersonic anyway and get to 650 m/s, or if your trip is so short that the cost of climbing to 20km altitude is wasted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, I can\u0027t imagine any plane where this engine tradeoff is going to work.

Which means you are down there with all the nasty drag. So the Isp boost from 4000 to 9000 for panther dry mode doesn\u0027t help you a bit, since you are fighting all those nasty air molecules the whole time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, to fly very long distances with excellent\u00A0fuel efficiency with a whiplash -- you want to be flying somewhere between 24km and 28km altitude, at 1400 m/s if you can manage it. Just be careful not to blow up your plane\u0027s nose from overheating. When you are getting close to your landing zone, turn off your engines and glide as high as you can for as long as you can.
