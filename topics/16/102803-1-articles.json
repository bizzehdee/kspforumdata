I have this thing I try to do when I have a contract to test something sub-orbitally, that I will not use a decoupler between the command module and the last fuel tank/engine, and pack on a pair of radial chutes along with the main chute to try to get more recovery money. Once I was landing a nuclear engine and the module was descending too fast and the engine was going to be destroyed even with the chutes open, so when I got close to the ground I fired up the engine, with a single tick of the shift key, my finger slipped and hit z, and even though I hit x immediately, my ship went from descending to ascending for a moment, and when I crossed 0 m/s, my chutes went away. Could something like that be happening to you?"},{"CreatedByName":"eonmoon","CreatedById":137279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T20:56:22Z","Content":"i believe you warped past the opening threshold for the shutes, thats possible, or too much strain on them"},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T21:09:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E or too much strain on them\n\nCould it be that the parachutes are just below the threshold at 1x time speed and physik accelarion pushes them over the edge?\n\nHave you tried that with other (simpler) crafts?
