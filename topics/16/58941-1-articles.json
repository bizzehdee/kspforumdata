I started today working on rocket sleds to launch small sats into LKO, a bit like the german silberv\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6gel, that launched using a sled powered by rockets and got enough speed to take off. I was wondering, is it really worth it, to have a detachable SRB sled to launch your rockets and would it cut down on the Delta-V requirements? It uses KW Separatrons to make sure it doen\u0027t just falls down and makes jeb smile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: FAR and the amber warning light \u002B KW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think about this method.
