The problem I have is that fuel consumption is not happening in a logical order.

The ship is built around a central fuel tank with an engine attached thought for munar ascent after landing. It has four decoupler pylons attached, each with 2 fuel tanks and one engine. There are also 4 other pylons with one fuel tank and landing gear attached through fuel pipes to the four engines. As per the logic I had applied (could be completely wrong), each engine should be fed by their corresponding fuel tanks and one side tank. But they are all feeding from the same lateral fuel tank at the start, and after that is empty, then they feed homogenous from the rest.

Double check your fuel lines and their directional arrows. I had a similar issue in one of my launch stages once. A backwards fuel line was causing one of my internal radial stages to empty too fast, and when the external stage decoupled the next internal tanks were already drained causing an engine to shutdown and the entire ship to tilt to one side as if a drunken Kerbal was piloting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I usually do is I connect my external tanks to the internal one, even if there are multiple radial stages. That way the external tanks get used to fuel both the external and internal engines, so that the external tanks drain quickly and can be decoupled while leaving the internal tanks full of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dielos","CreatedById":28547,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-11T14:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, here is the ship file.

I see a few easy to fix issues with your rocket. The first is your fuel lines. I\\\u0027m not sure why, but the game sometimes has issues when you connect fuel lines around from 1 tank to the next in a circle. So instead, just connect each of your fuel supply stacks to one of the engines next to it. (So it would be 4 fuel lines total, instead of the 8 you have now.) This way the fuel will get used up on equal sides at the same rate so it should fix the tipping problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can save some weight by dropping those outer ADVSaS units. You only need the one under the command module, the others don\\\u0027t help in any way shape or form. You could effectively remove those, and maybe lower those stacks down a little bit so the landing legs can still reach the munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dielos","CreatedById":28547,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-13T22:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot Ziff,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try with the four fuel lines as you said. I was sure it was a design problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the SAS... I thought that the more SAS you used, the more strength they applied at the cost of more weight. Am I totally wrong here? Just one is more than enough for any rocket size? I really had the feeling that the more SAS I put on a big rocket, the more stable it was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about the landing legs, I usually have trouble finding good combinations with the engines, as the engines are mostly longer and lower than the landing legs. The landing legs are also quite unstable, so I\\\u0027ve learned to secure them with strengthening struts in the meanwhile and use fixed landing gear instead of the deployable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, thank you very much for your time and help and I will try right now your suggestions!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T02:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that is true, but there is a difference between SAS and AdvSAS. With the AdvSAS (which is what you have) you only need 1, as it will actively use the yaw/pitch/roll controls to counter the ships movement if it drifts off course. SAS is useful for ships that tend to spin like a top on takeoff. Your craft is pretty stable as its small and built with symmetry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly,I had the same sort of problem with the landing legs that led me to a redesign. I now use a launch stage that detaches in orbit leaving behind the Munar stage. The Munar stage only has 1 LVT-45 on a center fuel tank, the 3 outer tanks attached are mounted lower, with the small LVT-909 engines. This allows me to use the large engine if I run into some sort of trouble, but once actually in orbit I only need the 3 LV-909\\\u0027s for a trans injection burn and for landing. Theyre short enough to allow landing legs to work well on them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dielos","CreatedById":28547,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-14T12:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to know about the SAS...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my fear of fuel shortage, I always tend to overload the ship with fuel tanks, making the designs quite heavy.
