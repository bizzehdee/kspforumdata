This may be a stupid question, but is there any downside to that? I\u0027m inclined to always set that to \u0022Auto\u0022 when putting a probe core on a ship, since it\u0027s not like the core is doing anything during warp anyway. I sometimes have bald spots on my ships\u0027 solar panel coverage, and it seems like this is a life-saver for that circumstance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-30T01:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223072794\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496092898\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297986\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZeroG\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, ZeroG said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may be a stupid question, but is there any downside to that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only downside I\u0027ve found is that for unmanned craft, being in hibernation means you can\u0027t create or edit maneuver nodes, even if it has a connection to Kerbin. Which means that any time you want to mess with a node you either have to turn that option off or drop out of time warp.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what it\u0027s worth, I have hibernate when in warp turned on almost always.
