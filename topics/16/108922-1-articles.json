Fairly cheap to set up the infrastructure, assuming you have the appropriate tech nodes unlocked (maybe a half million to set up a fuel depot in orbit, a miner/ore carrier for the ore, and a fuel tanker to move fuel wherever you need it). Drawback of course would be the time to set it up and the time it takes to mine and move the ore - but the dV savings over time is frankly enormous. You only spend a few hundred dV to get the ore (and therefore fuel) to the Minmus fuel depot, and then (assuming you aerobrake properly) another few hundred dV for the fuel transfer vehicle to get to LKO to actually do the refuel, and aside from the initial launches to put those craft in orbit, no further wastage as those craft will never need to return to Kerbin. Essentially at that point, it\u0027s free fuel forever for anything that has made it to LKO. Given that you\u0027re looking at 5 orange tanks, the savings will be huge, and it\u0027s likely cheaper to set up a Minmus fuelling operation than to find a way to launch 5 full orange tanks worth of fuel into orbit (my 40t launches to LKO, which is roughly equivalent to 1 orange tank, are typically well over 100K/launch).\n\nHowever, if you\u0027re dead set on lifting that much mass from Kerbin, you\u0027re right, it\u0027s not an easy answer. What you\u0027re looking for is the payload that you can lift to LKO expressed as tons, then divided by the cost of the total spacecraft to get a kerbal kredit/ton cost. While I haven\u0027t done any math on this, simply based on my own designs I think the \u0022cheapest\u0022 way to do it is with a ton of relatively small launches - I can get 5t into orbit at well under 10% of the cost for a 40t launch, even though my payload fraction for a 40t launch to LKO is definitely higher.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T17:12:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SDEngineer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T17:22:29Z","Content":"If you\u0027re sending up fuel from Kerbin, the answer relies entirely on your designs.

Build a set of maximum boosters instead (max 1.25, max 2.5, max 3.75 etc). Use the one that makes sense for your primary payload and drop off extra fuel at the tanker- helps keep it topped up for very little extra funds. Get good at landing boosters for huge savings (this is where you really make it big). By maximum I don\u0027t mean adding twenty radially attached solid boosters- just build a good solid core stage. A lot of my launches use 2.5m boosters which are just a core SSTO and can launch anywhere from 5-20 tons all the way to a circularized orbit and still have enough fuel to land back at the KSC. If I\u0027m just tossing a small satellite or two up into orbit I can usually add a 10-ton fuel tank to it\u0027s payload and deliver that fuel to the tanker/station.\n\n2) bring back fuel from a low gravity environment such as Mun or Minmus. For me, I use a dedicated orbital transfer vehicle (this is what needs fuel) and a cargo lander for Mun and Minmus. These bring up spare fuel for the transfer vehicle that was gathered on site just like I do from Kerbin with the boosters.\n\n3) if fueling from Kerbin, consider launching a fueling mission directly to the ship needing to be fueled (in a kerbin parking orbit). You save any fuel you would have spent doing the tanker rendezvous twice (once from the vessel needing fuel and once from the incoming fuel delivery).\n\n4) ships that spend their time in space moving between kerbin and wherever should all be nuclear powered for fuel efficiency. They go a loong way on very little.\n\nI think my last .90 mission put two satellites into orbit which fulfilled a total of 6 missions and a fuel tank for my station. The satellites earned over 100k per contract and the booster landed back at the KSC. My profit was something like 600k, and I delivered a lot of fuel to a thirsty ship at the station. =)\n\n-Bryan\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T21:11:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 09:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bmyers831**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:01:08Z","Content":"You can use a SSTO rocket \n\nThe 4 orange fuel tank are dead weight in that example, but adding some RCS would only add few tons. 140T of fuel to LKO. first stage is reusable.

Any design that requires hours of repetitive gameplay to achieve something is not fun to play. My cents to the problem:\n\nTanking in LKO is a must. It allows simpler interplanetary designs. Bigger interplanetary vehicles may be launched into orbit with empty fuel tanks or the last ascending stage (that inserts the vahicle into stable orbit) can be reused for interplanetary burn after refuel.\n\nTanking interplanetary ships by Mun or Minmus is not good for interplanetary missions because Oberth effect dows not work out well there. Even launch window timing is worse on a bigger orbit.\n\nMun or Minmus mining would be the most efficient but takes too much player time. Because the fuel must be ascended brought back to LKO and tanker must return and land on Mun each time. I would only mine satellites of remote planets for fuel (Bop mining rig is already set up).\n\nSSTO spaceship is also efficient but too tedious to bring meaningful amount to LKO.\n\nFor me the best option is rocketing fuel to LKO, fueling the target vehicle directly and return the tanker to Kerbin surface for refunds. I use a 7 Mammoth driven 7\\*3 (or 7\\*4 dont remember exactly) S3-14400 tanks as the tanker. The ascent is helped by some SRB-s that are jettysoned and the stabilizer wings break on Kerbin reentry but otherwise the craft is reusable. The 7 Mammoth engines and the huge Kerbodyne fuel tanks return to Kerbin surface braking with parachutes and the main engines and can be recovered for funds.\n\nA single set of the S3-14400 can be used to fuel the target the others are emptied during the ascent and return. That is 288 or 216 net tonnes of LFO. A single launch costs about 1M funds and about 420000 is returned after recovery. But I havent checked the numbers I just write them from my memory. A single launch refuels multiple interplanetary missions for me (I aim low weight for my designs)."},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T18:48:29Z","Content":"My refuelling craft are typically just a control/propulsion module that docks to tanks and pushes them around.
