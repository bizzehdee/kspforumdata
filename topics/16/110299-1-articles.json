However, with the new aerodynamics things are looking a little different and there is this debug menu that shows graphs concerning drag profiles. What do all the numbers mean? What is on the x and y axis\u0027 of both graphs? What does everything mean? How do I calculate exactly or at least roughly what forces KSP applies at any given altitude/speed/craftorientation?\n\nMy craft, going at 303.3m/s at 2000m altitude experiences 2Gs of drag, a few moments later at the same altitude it experiences 1G at 253m/s. At both points the craft had no fuel and its mass was constant nor were any engines producing any thrust. The velocity ^ 2 proportion seems not to be everything there is to KSP drag anymore and I\u0027d like to understand it."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:56:18Z","Content":"Some more systematic observations from a reddit poster:\n\n![08L57cY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/08L57cY.jpg)\n\nI was a little surprised that the higher drag region is actually wider than it \u0022feels\u0022 with rapiers.
