I am trying to see if i can reduce that significantly with gravity assists\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe problem with gravity assists is that they work well if you reach the planet relatively slowly. this way, the gravity and momentum of the planet have the time to give you a nice big push. if you zip past your planet super fast, you\u0027re not even going to feel it. you can also make a manuever at periapsis to take advantage of oberth effect, but then again, you also take advantage of oberth effect if you burn in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. and if you reach the target planet slowly, it means you burn less on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I am coming to realize \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is actually a great place to start, because while you have to pay a steep price to get out of a gravity well, you get a powerful oberth effect from a fairly big planet. on a big enough burn, this outweights the cost of getting out of kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, i\u0027ve been trying to use Mun for gravity assists. mun is a good source of assists if you don\u0027t need to go far. with 860 m/s you can get out of kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and already on intercept with Eve. however, even just for going to duna you\u0027d have to make an additional burn at mun apoapsis. and you get less benefit from obert effect, because mun is less massive. it is more expensive to go to duna with a gravity assist from Mun than it is to just go straight there. For my purpose, the 2300 m/s that i\u0027d need to get past eeloo\u0027s orbit won\u0027t even get me to jool. Of course, you can just make all your burn in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and zip past mun super fast, but it\u0027s not worth doing. i experimented, and i only gained a couple million kilometers of apoapsis. maybe 100 m/s of deltaV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngravity assists on the outer planets all suffer the same problem. those planets are smaller than kerbin, and if their gravity assist is not enough to get me where i want (which is not) then i\u0027d lose efficiency by burning close to them. and if i zip past at full speed i get a negligible benefit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\njool is the only planet suited for the purpose. so (barring some unlikely alignment of planets that would allow me to get to duna and from it get an assist to jool), it seems my best bet is to make a single manuever on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to get a jool flyby, then complete the rest of the burn on jool apoapsis. unfortunately, getting to jool from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is 2000 m/s, so even if the gravity assist get me already in the target trajectory (which is likely) i would not gain much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I had a refueling station on duna, i could get to jool with 1500 m/s from low duna orbit.so i\u0027d have saved 800 m/s, although it is a bigger hassle as i would have to set up a refueling station and get a hohmann transfer window twice, not sure it\u0027s worth the effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis there anything better i could do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-09T01:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple points.
