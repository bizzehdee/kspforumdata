Just make sure to try and plan your maneuvers as early as possible, and don\u0027t warp through SOI changes, as there\u0027s a bug that can massively change your apoapsis and periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T21:14:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENumber I\u0027ve got is 1,680 m/s for Kerbin intercept from Moho orbit. So yeah, you should have enough delta-V. Brings up the question of how you\u0027re piloting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put Moho at 3:00 while looking at the system map top down, Kerbin oughta be somewhere around 12:30 before you try to head back. The ejection angle will be about 95 degrees toward\u0027s Moho\u0027s prograde. Once you have your Kerbin intercept, adjust your path to bring your Kerbin periapsis to about 50,000 or so; do this on approach if you can, otherwise do it as soon as you enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigdad84","CreatedById":49379,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T23:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor anybody that cares I got a direct contact intercept with Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E only 1900 Delta-V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/110487080/KSP%20Forum/Moho%20Orbit%20Delta-V/screenshsot27%20copy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshsot27%20copy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T02:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done many of these, I usually get around 2000 -2200 m/s for a good intercept, one that doesn\u0027t need much other than a prograde burn. And around 2500 m/s for not-quite ideal burns. But I usually try to have about 3000 m/s, with this much I can always get back to Kerbin and back into Minmus orbit, which is where my refueling station is. I also don\u0027t worry about the inclination change, you\u0027ll come back to Kerbin in an inclined orbit, but it usually doesn\u0027t make much of a difference and I find it easier not to worry about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t really a good one, but even then I only needed 2300 m/s for it.
