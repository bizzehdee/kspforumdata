I\\\u0027ve been experimenting, playing around abit and I\\\u0027ve come up with a decent design for a mun lander using NovaPunch and Slisko pack I believe. Though there are no fairings that go from a 3m to outwards stage, check the picture lol. My mun lander is so wide that 3m fairings can\\\u0027t cover it up so before deleting it and doing it over I just want to know if there are any fairings that can cover this up in any mod if so please link to it I\\\u0027ve been searching around for fairings mods. Also feel free to contribute with tips on making a mun lander.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/Z6VLK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Z6VLK.jpg)\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: I seem to be low on fuel parts n such even though I\\\u0027m using both NovaPunch and Slisko pack of some sort. Tips of any other good mod parts?"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T04:30:57Z","Content":"ive never seen anything bigger than 3m\n\nalso, the biggest fuel tanks ive ever seen are in the nove punch pack. \n\n(unless you want to cheat, [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11574.msg179540#msg179540](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=11574.msg179540#msg179540) and [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4762.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4762.0))"}]}
