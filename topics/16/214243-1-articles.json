It is part of a bigger stack, and it would fly back and do a propulsive landing next to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. See that nosecone on the top? It comes from the ReStock\u002B mod, and it is connected to that Alligator hinge from the BreakingGround DLC. The idea is that this would act similar to the Starship vehicle, and inside that fairing you\u0027d have payload(s), that would be released by opening the nosecone and having them float out that way. The fairing would essentially act like a cargo bay and not deploy. However, the nosecone is just extremely unstable during flight. It moves around and deploying it is a pain. This could be fixed with some struts, but you\u0027d have to disconnect them and have an engineer use the EVA building feature to place struts again, and I\u0027m not planning on making this craft kerbal rated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat can I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T23:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not clear about what you\u0027re asking, but what about placing the nose cone on one of the row of attachment nodes that extend above a fairing base?
