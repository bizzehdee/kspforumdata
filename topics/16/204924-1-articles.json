First, all my existing vessels were no longer compatible. That wasn\u0027t a big problem since being a newbie it gave me a chance to \u0022start over\u0022 with a better idea of how to proceed. The other problem is a little more troubling; the stock alarm clock is no longer available. I\u0027ve upgraded the tracking station to level 3 so that can\u0027t be the issue, and I can\u0027t figure out how to get the alarm clock back. Was it removed as a part of the \u00A011.1-2 upgrade? If not, any\u00A0hints on how to get it back? I guess I could install the alarm clock mod, but I\u0027m curious why the stock one is no longer there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-21T19:54:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock alarm clock was introduced in 1.12 IIRC, not 1.11. Try verifying the files in Steam (Steam library \u0026gt; right click KSP \u0026gt; properties \u0026gt; local files \u0026gt; verify integrity), that should download any missing or corrupted files again. Turn off steam cloud sync for KSP too, that just seems to cause problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure you weren\u2019t using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E mod in 1.11.1 along with other mods? Putting mods into the Steam copy of KSP and then updating KSP itself is a good way to break stuff and if some mods went missing that would explain the incompatible craft- generally speaking all craft made of stock parts are fully compatible when you update the game version to avoid any issues of losing crafts or saves when updating the game, so I suspect you\u2019ve been using mods that are now broken or missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macbates","CreatedById":212503,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-21T21:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, poop! I had saved the old version of KSP before I installed the new one, then ran into some issues so I switched things around and re-downloaded from Steam a few times.. Turns out that my \u0022old saved game\u0022 is version 1.12.3142, while the \u0022new game\u0022 is 1.11.2307.
