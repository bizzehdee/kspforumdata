In laymans terms you\u0027re flying sideways instead of following a trajectory that\u0027s close to one that the gravity wants to pull you along. you should do a long gentle retroburn only to kill off your overall velocity. Your retrograde marker will gently float to the top of the navball then. So:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Deorbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Orient yourself towards the retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Wait until you\u0027re a few thousand meters off the surface. And i mean the surface and not \u0022sea\u0022 level. Keep pointed towards retrograde ALL THE TIME.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. burn gently, but enough to keep your velocity to be about 100 times smaller than your altitude. so if you\u0027re at 2000m your velocity should be 20m/s. 10m/s at 1000m and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Use your RCS thrusters to keep your retrograde marker in the center of the top of the navball. That means you\u0027ll be traveling completely vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you should come to a nice gentle landing. I have a lot of fun with this.
