One of the goodies in my opinion was the heating on re-entry and the thrill that it was causing. I cant remember how many times I jumped on my chair when suddenly without warning (\u0022termal indicators\u0022) something blows up. I need help cause my knowledge in changing files like .cfg is 0 and im afraid to ruin my game ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ... i\u0027m currently on 1.0.0 - stock btw... but sad cause there are good changes on the 1.0.2. (considering using \u0022kerbin alarm clock\u0022 and \u0022KER\u0022 - idk how this tweaks will affect that aswell, so I might not use anything). \n\nSo please can someone help me to achieve this with a noob explanation how-to? \n\n1- heating on re-entry like in 1.0 at 120% (that\u0027s what I was playing with) but without canceling the \u0022good\u0022 updates on \u0022Nerv\u0022 , service bays, chutes and other items that were improved on 1.0.2. All I want is my heatshield back and the need to come into the atmosphere in a good angle. I\u0027m afraid to change atmospheric general values, idk how will affect game in other aspects like Duna and parachutes?\n\n2- Is there a way to turn those termic gauges and the new termic overlay on parts permanently off? or do I have to press f10 everytime I fly? hate to not have surprises, if I want to know I stick a thermometer.\n\n3- one extra issue ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) - Any easy fix for the heatshield not transfering heat for adjacent parts after 0% ablator?\n\nI have seen posts about changing cfg back to 1.0 but I need to be reassured that it wont affect other things or cause unbalancing in game cause I love it too much to break things up. I will keep on playing on my 1.0 until I find a solution to my issue. Thank you so much for your time, this community is awesome, I noticed it already. \n\nHave a nice day and may the liquid fuel be with you... always ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T07:35:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Darkphas3**"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:06:04Z","Content":"One variable that has a big effect on atmospheric heating is convectionVelocityExponent.

It is possibly another \u0027fix\u0027 that will eventually turn out to be a bug?\n\nI did try the latter though, and it didn\u0027t make much difference alone... Might have made a few radial things explode more, but I came screaming in at 2.5km/s directly down, face first, and the Mk1 pod survived until it hit the ground. That definately wasn\u0027t 1.0 behaviour, or realistic, or in the catastrophic failure/sadistically amusing spirit of KSP!\n\nReally the only problem 1.0 and 1.0.1 (I think) ever had in this regard was a single value in the heatshield parts being wrong (PhysicsSignificance). I pre-fixed this and was a happy clam until 1.0.2. For some reason all these other changes have rendered the heatshields useless. That can\u0027t be intended behaviour after you worked so hard to include them, can it?"}]}
