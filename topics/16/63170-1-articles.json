I\u0027m running with FAR, DR, KIDS, and a few other mods. I\u0027m using the same craft over and over, aiming for the same circular orbit, and and seeing how stable the ascent is and how much dV I have left over when I hit said orbit. With each flight I\u0027m adjusting a different parameter. I\u0027m using the ascent guidance autopilot in MechJeb only to try and improve the repeatability of subsequent tests by taking out pilot error (since I bought a joystick I enjoy flying my rockets a lot more than letting MJ do it, but I like the info that many MJ modules give me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the parameters I\u0027ve been adjusting have been launching with and without FAR\u0027s Dynamic Control Adjust, having MJ limit ascent acceleration to various numbers, adjusting the ascent profile, having precise controls turned on, etc. One of my variables has been tweaking is the maximum deflection range of my tailfin control surfaces. In the VAB, right-clicking on one of the AV-8R\u0027s brings up the window to adjust a couple of parameters on the winglet, but I\u0027m a little unsure about what the difference is on some of the tweakables. It appears I can toggle on/off the ability of the winglet to respond to pitch/yaw/roll commands, and adjust the amount of maximum deflection each gives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The fact that there\u0027s two sections for each surface means that I can assign it to have a certain range of motion for pitch as well as yaw (for example)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Also, I would imagine that pitch and yaw are more important to rocket ascent, so should I disable roll control altogether for all four winglets? Would engine gimballing and SAS be the only roll control I (or MJ) would have, and would that be enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) One variable I haven\u0027t tried messing with yet is the variables (k and d, if I remember correctly) FAR has for the control limiters (accessable after you leave the VAB). I\u0027m thinking that these are more akin to a type of \u0027gain\u0027 that gets factored into control inputs (whether made by me or MJ). Are these only active when the their corresponding FAR limiter is toggled? Should I be messing with these at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the first person who has been down this path, so any advice on which variables I would be better adjusting, and which I should leave alone would be appreciated. Again, I\u0027m only letting MJ get me to orbit for the repeatability of these tests. I\u0027ve read that MJ doesn\u0027t do well with FAR installed, but I\u0027ve gotten some pretty stable (albeit sluggishly controlled) ascents during some of my trials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T12:21:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 12:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Luckfish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMoved question to FAR thread\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T16:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELuckfish,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to temper my comments when someone asks about FAR because I have no experience with it. But I feel bad nobody is trying to help, so here are my thoughts. (Maybe I need to get FAR so I can answer some of these posts...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I would guess that if there are separate sections, then it probably controls the range of motion for each axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Pitch and yaw are more important for rockets (generally). You can disable roll if you want, but to go back to your original point of testing, I doubt that disabling roll will get you much improvement in performance. If you are going to selectively disable roll, make sure you do it symmetrically or you will end up with unwanted yaw/pitch when you try to roll. Engine gimbal will only help roll if they are off axis (i.e. you have more than one engine). SAS will help roll no matter where you place it. Either of these can be sufficient to control roll, but that really depends on the size of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I can talk all day long about flight control gain parameters, but I don\u0027t know if k \u0026amp; d are gains or limits in FAR. Sorry. If they are gain and limit parameters, I still doubt you will see much performance improvement. MJ already tailors inputs to not overcontrol (in most circumstances). Gain and limiters are usually implemented to aid in \u0022feel\u0022 of a craft while you\u0027re flying it, so that it reacts similarly to inputs at different points of flight. MJ is already imposing this on itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T16:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEngine gimballing doesn\u0027t provide any roll authority, off axis or not (at least in stock, I too have no experience with FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T17:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEngine gimballing doesn\u0027t provide any roll authority, off axis or not (at least in stock, I too have no experience with FAR).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops, my bad.

After thinking a bit and reading your posts, I think I\u0027ll be setting the lateral fins to only control pitch, and the ventral/dorsal ones to only control yaw. If my rocket is fairly large, I might give each one a minor amount of deflection control in the roll category also, to assist SAS and any off-axis engine gimballing. It makes sense that the roll axis would be touchy when flying a rocket through an atmosphere, because there isn\u0027t much in the way of atmospheric negative feedback to dampen the inputs like what pitch and yaw would feel. The only thing really counteracting roll would be inertia. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR I would tend to get some pilot-induced oscillations (especially in the roll axis) during ascent, whether I flew manual or used MJ. Since FAR thins out the atmosphere to something reasonable (as well as fixes the silly simulation of drag) I can understand how the control surface response would need to be adjusted. My first few flights with FAR didn\u0027t go so well until I figured this out. I actually uninstalled FAR for a short bit, but it made everything seem way too easy, and the drag equation and fake gravity turn kept bothering me. I\u0027ve decided to put my space exploration on hold until I get pretty sharp at designing and flying in the FAR atmospheric model. I had been pretty intimidated by both FAR and Deadly Re-entry at first, mainly due to hearing about other people\u0027s frustrations and problems and seeing a few YouTube videos, but going without them now would feel a bit like cheating. I think one of the biggest draws KSP had for me was both the realism (compared to other space games) and the steep learning curve.
