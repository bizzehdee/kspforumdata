Got the game on the Steam sale, first post on these forums, of course it had to be a question, hope you guys can help me out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to figure out how I can access more information on celestial bodies without resorting to the wiki or other out-of-game resources. So far, I\u0027ve gone as far as Minmus, but I\u0027m getting to the point where I want to start exploring other planets. However, without knowing what gravitational forces and atmospheric pressure I\u0027m dealing with, I can\u0027t really design an exploration vessel and set its\u00A0course. I\u0027ve tried looking for the atmospheric scan results of the bodies I\u0027ve visited, but I can find no such thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, after scouring the internet trying to figure out how I can gather information about my next destination without spoiling the entire adventure, I resort to you good folks! Can anybody tell me if it is possible to figure out a planet\u0027s diameter and atmospheric pressure, in order to set a course for scanning and eventual landing, and if so, how I do it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T15:19:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to the tracking station (or map view if you\u0027re currently flying a ship). Zoom way out until you can see the other planets. Click on the one you\u0027re curious about and select \u0022focus view\u0022. On the right side of the screen there are a few buttons that pop up. Click on one of those (can\u0027t remember exactly which one) and you will get more detailed information about that planet/moon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T15:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just checked that out.
