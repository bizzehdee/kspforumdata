Currently I\u0027m using my system\u0027s Control Panel mouse settings to slow the pointer but that, obviously, makes the pointer cumbersome at other times. It would be nice to have the accuracy of a very slow pointer when in map mode and adjusting maneuvers and such but still have a faster pointer at other times?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought gang.
