Since the weight of support struts wasn\\\u0027t scaled up, you can brace them sufficiently without making it less efficient then a \u0027small\u0027 rocket. That\\\u0027s logical, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept it doesn\\\u0027t work.

I\\\u0027ve tried bracing, and cross-bracing, and X-Bracing, and - on my latest rocket - I\\\u0027ve even resorted to running struts right down the tank-stacks, to try and hold them together. Sometimes, I can get the smaller ones into orbit, but any proper three-stage, Mun-capable rocket is a no-go. The latest one made it to 35K or so, solid as a rock, before it all went sideways.
