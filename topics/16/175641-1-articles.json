So if you attach 4 engines to a plate, it\u0027ll produce less drag than if only 2 engines of the same size are attached, an engine plate smothered in engines causes basically no drag at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-05T22:55:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2018 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by blakemw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-06T05:55:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, engine plates can save up on struts or decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
