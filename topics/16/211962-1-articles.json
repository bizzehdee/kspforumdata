I was wondering if I have to go to orbit and then manuever over their site to do the pressure readings or if I can launch from their site. I tried going over their site in orbit at around 110,000km and doing pressure readings\u00A0 but it didn\u0027t work. Do\u00A0 I have to be lower?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-10T19:11:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts are randomly generated so it\u0027s hard to tell what the requirements are if we can\u0027t see it.
