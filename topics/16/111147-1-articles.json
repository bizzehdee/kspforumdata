This became more noticable while towing an asteroid or with a very long ship. I tought this was caused by kraken first but now that i did some digging i found out that it is common and the best way to prevent it to have the controll point at the middle of the craft since the game is getting the orbit calculations from the controll point. I still wanted to confirm if this is true. Does everyone experience this? What are your toughts on this? Is this a bug or a common part of the game physics that we have to live with?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T15:54:04Z","Content":"Its really normal. It has something to do with center of mass and torque. And if your craft isnt so big that it barely fits to physics bubble, or your orbit isnt almost skimming the atmosphere by meters, it shouldnt really matter."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:02:46Z","Content":"I\u0027ve noticed this with the maneuver nodes, too. But that is a separate issue. The node handles are oriented according to the former orbit, and do not update as the new orbit changes. So, for example, what was \u0027normal\u0027, gradually includes more and more \u0027prograde\u0027 or whatever. Any time your burn has a prograde or retrograde component, Pe and/or Ap will change. (If it averages out, you\u0027ll see them change then return.)\n\nWith that in mind, is your ship turning to follow \u0027normal\u0027, or locked to the original attitude?"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:04:26Z","Content":"I noticed this while towing an E class asteroid and the pe was moving up to 5000 meters as i turn the asteroid. The fact that my controll point was at the farthest point from the asteroid and the ship being 4 kerbodyne tanks long didn\u0027t help either i suppose. Im sure you can understand my shock when trying to get the asteroid into an aerobreaking situation and seeing my trajectory moving up to 5000 meters ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThis is posted by another user. Found it while doing research about this issue and it fits what im experiencing only on a smaller scale;\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
