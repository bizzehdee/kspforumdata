If you like messing about with space stations in low orbit you can add another pod to it so it can carry up a couple of kerbals. I\u0027ve seen Scott Manley use a modified Aeris to launch tiny probes, but that\u0027s about all it can do. It\u0027s got the docking port so you could refuel it in orbit, but chances are that\u0027ll be done with fuel flown up on something that isn\u0027t single stage so that kinda defeats the purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thescientist","CreatedById":69046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T09:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs there is written in a lot of post, tha Aeris 4A isn\u0027t a very good SSTO becuse she was done when the game physics was a little less accurate, so it isn\u0027t the best spaceplane that exist. It is, however, a good way to train the new players that must learn how to land, how to save fuel, how to prevent flameout, why it\u0027s a bad idea pitch up a lot when taking off (BOOOM - hey KSC, hadn\u0027t the plane a rocket engine?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)...this means that it has an autonomy quite limited without refuelling. also the RCS system is unbalanced, so it isn\u0027t good even as a crew tranfer vehicle. It\u0027s a trainer tha is made up to experiment new ascent path and new ways to flight (due to her tight fuel margin, doing this kind of test with the 4A means immediate aswer to your doubt about some flight path), nothing more IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T09:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPayload is 1 Kerbal to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr mishap more often... delivered to random locations on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T10:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice to have a two man cockpit and a passenger module in all different sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd: Recently I saw an old youtube video of a really cool space shuttle built in an older version of KSP.
