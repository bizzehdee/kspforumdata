But if I\u0027m in a low Mun orbit already, can I just start adding from there? 640 to land, another 640 to get back up, then 210 and 860, then into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. That totals 2350 Delta V. That seems like a lot. I seem to remember, before I discoverd MechJeb, I managed to land a rocket on Mun. It was almost out of fuel, but I just took straight off and escaped Mun\u0027s gravity fairly quickly, and from there I had just enough Delta V to shrink my orbit until I hit Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like the cheat sheet is not useful for this purpose because it assumes I\u0027m slowing into a nice circular orbit between each maneuver. Is that right? Or will it really take my orbiting lander 2350 Delta-V to land and return home?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-26T19:55:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2014 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Name Lips\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chemieglennie","CreatedById":60180,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T08:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need the 860 to slow down for Kerbin.
