Larger tanks have a higher thermal mass and can therefore absorb more heat. Short of adding wings or what-not to act as a heatsink, you could try running the LV-N\u0027s at less than 100% throttle. \n\nIf you aren\u0027t opposed to mods, there\u0027s that route too."},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:33:01Z","Content":"I had the same problem.\n\nAttach the nukes to the new nosecone adapter (Mk 1 to tiny) and attach these radially to a Mk 3 tank. Can burn at 5/6 throttle until 5k\u002B dv.\n\nEdit: 6 engines attached this way on the short LF Mk 3 tank. You will need more fuel than this for 5k dv as well as fuel lines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T19:35:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pax Kerbana**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:45:42Z","Content":"Just use a 5000 size mk3 liquid fuel tank and you should be fine untill your fuel runs out."},{"CreatedByName":"ScottyDoesKnow","CreatedById":70796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:58:29Z","Content":"Thanks for all the answers. My problem is that this is an Eve return vehicle so I need to drop them during Eve entry. And currently my 9 X200-32s are both perfect for the Eve transfer (~2700 dV) and needed for the Eve ascent.

The little panels are all pretty short, so getting the same surface area would be unwieldly.\n\nThe gigantors here though aren\u0027t the lynchpin of the operation - thermal mass is.

A wing piece radiates just as well, but is more conductive, so it will pick up more heat to radiate.\n\nThis means that solar panels can help quite a lot, but shouldn\u0027t be the linchpin of your heat management. In which case the 1200 vs 2000 degrees don\u0027t matter.\n\nThat said, I find that heat generation just plain silly.
