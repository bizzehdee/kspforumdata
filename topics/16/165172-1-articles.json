A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, but at the same time understand the dev choice regarding attached/unattached parts. I\u0027ve done it myself when I accidentally remove parts, quick hit save (but don\u0027t exit), then realize they\u0027re gone. Wait, CTRL-Z!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would assume in order to check for all unattached parts, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E editor would need to have an instance (or keep track of) of every single part placed in the editor at any time, which when saving/exiting/re-opening the parts are gone means it\u0027s only checking based on parts attached to the root. Otherwise, you\u0027d have very hefty craft files with every unattached part lying around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. So probably to combat bloated craft files, the game doesn\u0027t check whether parts are in the editor window when saving, only whether they\u0027re attached to root.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, making this function like significantly more robust 3D editors is probably not something the devs would (or even could?) do. IMO it\u0027s not really meant to be a 3D editor tool, the editor is just the minimum necessary to build a spacecraft, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClose, but not quite I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is the file structure, that is a tree. It has no conception of two trees in the same file. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E they can keep a detached tree\u00A0no problem because it\u0027s already instanced in memory, but when you go to save, the save file (as designed) must be a single tree with each object attached to N children but only one parent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several options. First, it should be extremely easy for them to be aware. I know how many objects (trees) I have rendered in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I know which one is attached to the master pod and any that aren\u0027t. So when the user goes to save, I would know what needs to be saved in the file but also know how many detached trees there are and how many objects are in each.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a minor addition, I could also pretty easily track the number of elements (parts) that were present the last time this file was changed. So the easy part is knowing that with this save the user is attempting, he/she will be deleting X number of elements in Y trees. That\u0027s an alerting threshold problem, use judgment to set a value past which, if it wasn\u0027t intended, the user will be very upset about losing those parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat to do with detached trees is the tricky part. If the user says \u0022NOOOO I DIDNMEANIT!\u0022, you can\u0027t just randomly attach those detached trees to the existing model and then save that, that would create as many problems as it would solve. The correct solution is to save any detached tree of \u0026gt; x number of parts as a separate file, using the main model\u0027s file name as the root. E.G., Atlas IIIA _detached_parts_1. There may be other correct (as in fulfills requirement in a way the users are happy with) solutions but I think most people would be happy with that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen in the game general settings, there would be two new flags for the user, defaulted to on, and two fields to set the threshold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*) Save detached parts in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Threshold: 10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(*) Save detached parts in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Threshold: 10\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want a really good implementation you add a couple more fields to specify root name(s) to be used and also\u00A0to set the path if you want to\u00A0saved detached parts to something besides ThisCareer/Ships/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-06T04:39:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2017 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vossiewulf","CreatedById":179033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-06T03:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223166000\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165172\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504662055\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166502\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spricigo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Spricigo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo matter how much you want to blame the game, that was just your own mistake.
