During the burn, the maneuver marker on the navball is constantly updated to account for errors, be they because of imprecise steering or otherwise. Note that this is mitigation, not a solution -- but it goes a long way.\n\nIn low Kerbin orbit, interplanetary ejection burns of up to two minutes (burning one minute at either side of the node) still have near-perfect results.

Burn most of your burn then go map and do little test burns (or RCS) to see which direction you need to do your adjustment burns to refine your intercept. Just doing one burn I am lucky to be within 10km of my target. Doing this method I usually get within 100m of my target (in LKO for docking)\n\nThis scales well. I use the same method for interplanetary burns. Do most of the burn, then go to the map, focus on the planet you are aiming for and adjust until you get as close as you can from your current position. If you cannot get closer than a certain distance then redo the fine adjustment half way there (usually).\n\nSometimes you just can\u0060t get close to your target in one burn due to the way orbital mechanics works."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T19:36:52Z","Content":"There is three exceptions to the split rule for nodes: circularization, rendezvous, landing.\n\nUnless you want to circularize to a particular orbit, you want to do the circularization fully before Ap and you want to do it prograde instead of on node.

It is fairly obvious why you would want to finish such a burn before you reach closest distance.\n\nIf you use a node to plan a suicide burn, you also want to complete the burn before the node.

A cumbersome vessel may not be able to turn quickly enough between nodes, yet *this doesn\u0027t matter* -- just open the throttle at the right time and let MJ find the maneuver marker as quickly as it\u0027s able to. Not only will the current maneuver marker move to compensate, but the consecutive maneuvers will be updated, too, and in the end things work out quite well.\n\nI have no idea how it really works.

I think the position of the node adjusts according to the burn you originally wanted when you set it, and before you passed it. However, it does not update according to the changing mass/TWR of the ship, which I noticed by decoupling a large heavy stage (the node did not move). Therefore it does use the original mass/twr of the ship when you first set the node. For very long burns (using nukes for example) I will burn until I\u0027m about a minute past the node (depending on how long I have left to burn), delete the node, and create a new one ahead if me and continue.
