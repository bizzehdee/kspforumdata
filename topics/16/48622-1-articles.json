I\u0027ve got a nuclear rocket at a 1500km orbit, and it has 3.2km/s in the tank according to Mechjeb. Should this be enough to get there and circularize (won\u0027t aerobrake, had very, very bad experiences with the thin atmostphere), or should I send up another 5km/s of delta-v to dock with the rear of the rocket? \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/EJvB4S6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EJvB4S6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent the wrong rocket up by mistake, it has the older and heavier lander, with a bit less delta-v than my more current rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you will find your answer here, and many other answers.. have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/J1z0o\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/J1z0o\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:21:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more than enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut do you plan to go back to Kerbin after that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazeFallow","CreatedById":83905,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:28:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just completed the Duna Apollo Style challenge and can confirm that 3.2km/s is MORE than enough Delta V to get you there. As the challenge shows, a nominal transfer will get you to Duna in roughly 75 days. With 3.2kms Delta V you should be able to shorten that time if you\u0027re ok with Aerobraking. I found if you\u0027re entering at 3300m/s you can safely aerobrake as low as 8500m periapsis. If you are going slower you need to up that to as high as 11000m for about a 1000m/s speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T15:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the pilots of the main craft are going to transfer to the lander, leaving the craft as an orbiter.
