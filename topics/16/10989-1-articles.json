The game (unhelpfully) doesn\\\u0027t show you these, so you have to read the part ratings and imagine. Mass too far forward: Your plane won\\\u0027t take off, and will fly like a lawn dart. Mass too far back: Your plane will be super maneoverable, until it flips backwards out of control. ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png)[/li]\n\n[li]Center of mass just below center of lift, or wings tilted up in a \u0027V\u0027. This will make your plane\\\u0027s yaw angle self-correcting (it will fly level without constant tweaking). 8)[/li]\n\n[li]Tail not sticking out too high from the plane, or a \\\u0027mirrored\\\u0027 tail fin below the fuselage. \u0027Yaw-roll coupling\u0027 is your enemy - if you only have one tail sticking up the top, anytime the tail pushes your plane sideways, it will also tend to roll the plane the opposite direction. This can make turning a tricky balancing act. ???[/li]"},{"CreatedByName":"ianken","CreatedById":6543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T21:39:13Z","Content":"Here\\\u0027s something a bit simpler...flies well.
