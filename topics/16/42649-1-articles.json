If so, try using that to dip your periapsis just inside the atmosphere where you can aerobrake down to the surface. I saved a Kerbal coming back from the Mun that way once ^-^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just want to save the Kerbals inside, get a rendezvous craft to meet up with the three pods in orbit (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScott Manley\u003C/a\u003E makes great tutorials), then EVA the kerbals and use their thruster packs to get them inside an empty pod (hitchhiker cabins work well for this) on the other craft, then use that crafts propulsion to deorbit itself after operation. Afterwards you can terminate the empty pods from the menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to go the realistic way of getting rid of the pods, you\u0027ll have to make either a craft that can dock with them after a rendezvous, if your stranded craft has a docking port on it, or a craft to pull your stranded craft out of orbit. If you dock with it, you can refuel the stranded ship or just pull it back like that. If you don\u0027t have docking ports, you can either make a frame of girders and struts which can catch the ships and deorbit them like that, or get the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25563-0-20-KAS-v0-3-1-Kerbal-Attachment-System\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/a\u003E mod to pull them out of orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and don\u0027t forget to check any craft returning with Kerbals in it for parachutes. You don\u0027t want to land without parachutes, if you\u0027re deorbiting something like a station module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor crafts around other bodies, you\u0027re going to have to make another craft that can go to that world, but also has returning capabilites. Make sure there\u0027s enough space in them to hold the stranded Kerbal. Either go there, rendezvous and pick up the Kerbal, then leave back for Kerbin, go there and refuel the stranded ship (make sure both are left with enough for the return if your second ship is also manned, or enough fuel to deorbit themselves if the ships are unmanned), or bring some other way of deorbiting the leftover stranded craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-18T14:20:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2013 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spyritdragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
