Turns out when you change the mass of a pod it doesn\u0027t effect your mass in the flight. But if you change the mass value of a fuel tank that does count and calculated accordingly in the flight. 100 mass enough for you to submerge safely with 2 m/s into to the bottom of the ocean (craft does not explode when you hit the bottom, but make sure surface is flat). However you can only watch your craft from a 90 degree angle from the game camera (thats bothering) and everything looks like you are just floating in the sky there is nothing visual about diving into the bottom of the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: It is not that exotic as i was expecting plus camera is buggy after altitude 0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"greg12","CreatedById":56261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T22:16:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHack gravity make the craft submerge easily.
