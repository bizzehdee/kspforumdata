There\u0027s MK3 to 2.5m adapter, then 2.5 to 1.25 adapter, and the Klaw.\n\nAnd when running at full power at 4x warp, the connection between the MK3-2.5 and 2.5-1.25 adapters fails. It\u0027s the weakest point - the Klaw is very strong, and MK3 connections were vastly improved in 1.0.4, but that one is still weak and carries the whole stress of the asteroid against 4000kN of force.\n\nAdditionally, the MK3 to 2.5m adapter is convex so trying to pull a strut from the other one ends up with the strut ending short of the joint. So, any smart methods how to do it?\n\n(and I know the easiest answer is \u0022don\u0027t use 4x phys warp\u0022, but I\u0027d prefer something faster - last time I captured a Class E and brought it into LKO, it took me a week.)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T10:30:05Z","Content":"How about this?\n\n![1oBtBE8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1oBtBE8.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T12:36:00Z","Content":"Does that even work?
