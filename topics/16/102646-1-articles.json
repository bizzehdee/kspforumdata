The issue is that it requires a space station to be in orbit at the start, and no research to actually be done yet. The only way I can figure to do this is to build the space station and put it into orbit in 1 save (sandbox) and import it into another career save. I am unsure if that is possible, or if there is a better method.\n\nAnother thought is to change the save file and take away research and everything while only leaving the station in orbit...\n\nLike I said, any ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:31:21Z","Content":"Both of the methods you propose would work.\n\nIf you want to build the station in one save, then put it into a \u0022new\u0022 save, it\u0027s a matter of copy/paste for the VESSEL structure.\n\nIf you want to build the station, then sort of \u0022reset\u0022 your save, you can also do that but requires a bit more \u0022cleanup\u0022 and work to catch all the bits.\n\nI can probably help you through either process, but it\u0027s a bit lengthy to write them both out right off the bat. If you have a preferred solution, it would make it easier for me to write up just the one set of instructions. My personal recommendation is that I think it would be easier to construct your ship in a sandbox save, then start a clean game (with whatever settings) and copy over the already-orbited station from the sandbox to the new save.\n\nWelcome to the forums! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T02:36:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T00:41:30Z","Content":"Technically you can switch save modes by going into technical stuff in the persistent.sfs(use notepad)\n\nversion = 0.90.0\n\n Title = Messing Around (SANDBOX)\n\n Description = No description available.\n\n linkURL = \n\n linkCaption = \n\n Mode = SANDBOX\n\nSandbox is simply switched to CAREER\n\nI recommend starting in career so contracts dont get bugged, switching to sandbox launching, then switching back to career.\n\nYou should also see lots of other things you can change.\n\nThats all,\n\nJT"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T05:55:02Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t the hyperedit mod be an easier and... safer solution.

Althogh it didn\u0027t sound like hartmde was asking for help launching (as JTpopcorn pointed out), but was asking for help getting a station into orbit, then working through a regular career game. In which case, hyper edit would only help getting starter parts to space, and would still require the player to spend funds to get it going. Even if hyperedit was used, the save file would still require some editing/tweaking to accomplish hartmde\u0027s goals.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
