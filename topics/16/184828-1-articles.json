I couldn\u0027t find such option to turn off damage to buildings in cheat menu, so i\u0027d like to know if there is a mod like advanced cheat menu or something like that. I don\u0027t really want to create another save because at some point I might want to return the damage or change something else, also all the launched crafts will be gone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-29T05:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHit ESC, click on the Settings menu, click on the \u0022Difficulty Options\u0022 button at the top.
