The latest seems to be 10k. But still it doesn\u0027t tell me if that is considering a sea level launch. I have set up my refinery on top of a mountain on Eve, at 5000m altitude. What would be a realistic DV number to design a ship that can land there, refill and lift off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilio\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T06:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor wingless craft: It is variable depending on the TWR of your craft. If it has lower TWR then you need more dV. For every craft you have to find the sweet spot of fuel mass versus TWR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will be lucky to get a rocket with 5500 dV to orbit from 5000m and that will want an initial TWR of around 1.5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mountain that is 7500m high with a not too steep area near the top that will help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tbarcello","CreatedById":147952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T07:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amagi82.kerbalspaceapp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amagi82.kerbalspaceapp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got you.
