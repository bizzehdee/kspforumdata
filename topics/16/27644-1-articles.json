If, looking \u0022down\u0022 at Kerbins north pole, that KSC sat is \u0022east,\u0022 how do I position the three other sats at North, West, and South? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey all, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, obviously, I\u0027m using RemoteTech and attempting to establish keosynchronous orbits. I understand how RemoteTech works and I\u0027m able to get the orbit. My problem is the spacing between my comm sats. Assume I want a four-point network around whichever body I\u0027m working with. How do manage my timing to ensure there are ~90 degrees between each of my sats? Note that I do NOT want to do too much changing of the orbits after the apokee is reached(meaning I don\u0027t wish to move it to a smaller orbit, time accelerate until it is in position, then put it back). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. In hyperedit, is there a field which lets me change the position of a ship in its orbit without changing the orbit itself? What is the technical term for the point in an orbit an object currently occupies or is there one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamn...this should be in How-To.
