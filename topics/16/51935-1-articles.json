Here are some things that I have done, I\u0027m wondering if (a) there\u0027s anything I haven\u0027t thought of, and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, if anything I\u0027ve done here is novel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All science equipment, including a transmission antenna, are mounted on a rover, allowing me to land my lander at the intersection of a few different biomes, pop the rover off, and then run around and collect data on all of the nearby biomes. Solar panels and batteries galore, to allow for lots and lots of transmitting, since I just leave the rover on the planet when I\u0027m done. I can collect all the science data from space on the way to my destination, while the rover is still attached to my lander. I have to make sure to get all the space science on the outbound leg, because the rover\u0027s not coming home with me and thus neither are all the experiments attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rover design is longitudinal, with all the fragile experiment parts along the centerline, and the wheels extended out on long booms, so that even if the rover tumbles in a low-g environment, the experiment bays are not damaged. (Of course the rover is designed to run fine even when flipped upside down.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bonus: With a transmitter antenna on the rover, I can do EVA Reports and surface samples without having to leave my seat. So I can do all science experiments, an EVA report, and a surface sample, all at once, and transmit them all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- External command seat on my main command module/lander section (in addition to the command capsule that\u0027s already there), so that I can EVA, move to the external command seat, and be able to do EVA reports *and* Crew reports on my landing approaches or takeoffs without leaving the seat. I haven\u0027t actually checked to see if I\u0027d survive re-entry if I hit atmo at reentry speed, so I move back to the command capsule in those situations. But for the Mun or for situations where you\u0027re flying around in low atmosphere, it\u0027s great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Assigning an Action Group Key that contains every science experiment observation, plus a Crew Report. So I just press a single key and the results of all the science experiments pop up on the screen, and then I hit TransmitTransmitTransmitTransmitTransmit. Also add an extra key for just the Materials Bay because I have to transmit that one so many more times than the others. Eventually, as the reports start approaching zero value, I\u0027m hitting TrasmitDiscardTransmitDiscardTransmitTransmit, transmitting only the valuable experiments, to save time and battery power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I haven\u0027t figured out how to do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to add Surface Sample and EVA report to an Action Group key. I still have to use the mouse to do those, even though I can do all the other bits of Science with one key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to use keyboard commands to transmit samples, or perhaps a way to automate \u0022transmit all samples all at once, skip all the dialog boxes\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to keep the transmitting antenna extended all the time. I can assign an action to extend it, but then when it\u0027s done transmitting some data, it retracts again anyway. I\u0027m trying to avoid that moment when it\u0027s folding back up and I press the Transmit button on my experiment, and nothing happens because the antenna was folding up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to figure out when you\u0027e driven your rover past the boundary into another biome, without actually running a science experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to just Make The Lander The Rover, by adding wheels to my lander, so that I don\u0027t have to do the whole \u0022separate the rover\u0022 thing when I get to my destination. All of the wheels are too fragile for my big complicated landers which are loaded with fuel and batteries and solar panels and experiments. The wheels just break when the lander sits upon them or moves much at all. I can repair the wheels, but it\u0027s useless if they keep breaking every ten meters. I can get the \u0022giant\u0022 wheels to work without breaking, but they have a tendency to rip off of my lander body, making repair impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other interesting ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepants","CreatedById":74088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T05:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tfabris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tfabris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow to just Make The Lander The Rover, by adding wheels to my lander, so that I don\u0027t have to do the whole \u0022separate the rover\u0022 thing when I get to my destination.

If you need more than an Oscar-B or two, it\u0027s too heavy. The science experiments are comparatively lightweight and you should be able to make an LR with pretty much nothing but them and some wheels. Without a lot of batteries you can use time acceleration to increase your energy intake from solar panels.

You can\u0027t avoid transmitting EVA reports during a long trip but you should never transmit surface samples, Goo, or Jr. Bays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most points you will ever get for an experiment is returning the 1st 2 times you run it. This accounts for like 85% of the total available points for that experiment at that biome or orbital location, and it\u0027s a complete waste of time to go back for the remainder. So, have 2 copies of each experiment for each zone you plan to fly through and return it all. This makes for missions that are limited by the number of science parts you can get off the ground and land safely. But you can go, grab the points, and come back without having to think too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative is to have only 1 copy of each experiment and never return anything. Instead, you run/transmit each experiment in each zone over and over until you get 0.0 points for it, then move to a new zone. The reason you should never return anything with this strategy is because this relies on getting all available points. If you ever stop transmitting to return a sample, that stops you from getting more with that experiment on this flight, so you have to go back for the rest. This makes for missions that can visit as many zones as you have fuel and electricity for, with a lighter ship than the above.

I try to land as close to the boundary as I can, so that I don\u0027t have to drive very far, but I still can\u0027t get it close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example: I just did a Mun mission where I landed near the boundary between the East Farside Crater, and the east-west canyon that runs eastward from that crater\u0027s eastern edge. Going by the map in the KSP wiki, I thought I had absolutely nailed the landing, I thought I was in the area that would be defined as \u0022crater\u0022 and would have to drive only slightly eastward to hit the canyon. Instead, I landed, and I was already in the canyon biome, and had to drive about four kliks westward to hit the Crater biome. And also, along the way, managed to find a tiny patch of Midlands that wasn\u0027t even on the map. So although \u0022look at the map\u0022 gets me in the neighborhood, that neighborhood is still many kilometers wide and involves a lot of driving.
