They could do floating readings around the atmosphere and watch the weather more carefully and land and be resources for any people or machines. And have beacons etc to help machines find and make fuel, water, air, etc. maybe try to make floating water collectors and use some amount of internal pop can affect and a greenhouse affect to create warmth and float above and use a basic pressure system to get the warm air down or maybe some trick with the water drip to create a small amount of heat transfer and maybe chill factor at night that goes and it stored for the day in fridges or like devices.
