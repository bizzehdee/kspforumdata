Some of my reaction wheels kept toggling between enabled and not enough electric. It didn\u0027t cause any issues until I tried to run a probe that only had the okto for reaction wheels and use MechJeb. It worked fine manually, but mechjeb kept reseting it\u0027s turn every time the power cycled, so it couldn\u0027t maneuver at all. It did this consistently across multiple craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled across the fix by accident. It seems to be that KSP is confused about which pod is in control.
