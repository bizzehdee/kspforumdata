If so, if a rescue ship with a Kerbal can get there, you can extend the panels through an EVA. Fly your spacewalker near the panel, right click on it, and he can extend it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing that, I\u0027d recommend sending up a battery truck. Something with a probe core, some better-positioned solar panels, and the appropriate docking port. Capture and dock with your stricken vessel, and the panels on the battery truck will charge both ships. That might give you enough power to finish the original mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
