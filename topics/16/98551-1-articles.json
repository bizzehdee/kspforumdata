In the end I buttonspam to get things selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When physically attached (station A with ship \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, I cannot transfer from A to B. At some stage the camera changes (I think as a result of furious clicking) and then I can transfer from A to B and vice versa. What is that change that happened? It seems that the system decides there\u0027s just ONE entity (the new large station) but I dont know what\u0027s the trigger for that. It does\u0027t seem to be the station alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you have one station, will it use ALL RCS to do stuff, or can you still control only from A or B?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Can I transfer fuel from B -\u0026gt; A somehow? without mods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If I have a kerbal from B climbing manually over to A, how do I select him in the fury of having A and B and the joined C?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, praise the Korde for the [ ] keys to switch close vehicles.

When you dock 2 vessels together the game then views it as a single spacecraft. Only once the vessels have been merged cab you transfer fuel. To do this, simply select a tank that contains fuel you want to transfer by holding alt then clicking it. Then select the second tank you would like to transfer with by again holding alt and clicking the second tank. This will make the transfer \u0022in\u0022 and \u0022out\u0022 buttons appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once the station is one vessle then it will utilize all attached resources as one vessle, you no longer have control of the individual sections that have been docked together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Yes you can. You would need to dock A to B and follow the same instructions. Once docked together click on A\u0027s fuel tank by holding Alt then clicking on it. The. Select B\u0027s fuel tank the same way and the transfer options will appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. To switch control to a nearby vessle or kerbal use the \u0022[\u0022 and \u0022]\u0022 keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!

I can see they attach, but for some reason the one-vessle camera angle only kicks in after clikcing everywhere.

Can it be that you are oscillating a bit? Because if so, the docking ports will take a few seconds (and sometimes more) to align themselves correctly before actually connecting. To solve that, turn off both RCS and SAS just before (or immediately when) the docking ports are magnetically drawing towards each other. RCS and SAS on on both vessels will actually have both systems \u0027fighting\u0027 each other, this can sometimes lead to oscillations that may last up to a minute or more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo vessels become one instantly upon docking. I think the main problem is that you aren\u0027t yet docked when you assume you are.
