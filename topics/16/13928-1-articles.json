Think a combination of novapunch, KW, Zeoxyne, powertech and dynasat. Oh, and the carts. Trying to remember if I had any odd and end ones as well. Satellite relays, some laning legs, and OA Lights.

It was impossible to land any more at the site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey look odd, but the real cool things is stuff like those foreground ones, and the one far background all fit within 3m shrouding. The others, only the industrious looking fixed legs and capped tanks are exposed. Rover one is really handy. It flies well, and the rover itself is suspended. When it lands, the rover is only a bare little bit off the ground for an easy dismount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the strength, it is possible. I was wondering if the couplers only have strength maybe one way or something. Without a previous failure record, is impossible to know. Any modders who know the code well would be able to give you a more difinitive word. The upside down landings do work, whether it works for eva will depend on how the kerbal mount/dismount works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-14T18:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried making a stock-only one.
