But it does help to teach you how to fly by eye. Maneuver nodes are a bit of a crutch, you know.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the tiny contract rewards are there to force you to learn to be really economical.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor tourists, you have to add a MK1 crew cabin to your ship --\u00A0unless you want to unlock the OKTO and put them in the cockpit, yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that, yes, there is a lot of grinding for money. You definitely need $100k to upgrade your pad to do a good job of getting to Minmus. Upgrading Mission Control is vital to be able to perform as many contracts on a single mission as possible (I just did 7 high altitude survey contracts in 1 flight).
