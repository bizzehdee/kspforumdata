Contract satisfied, but then I can\u0027t get the capsule safely to splash down because the chutes keep failing. I\u0027ve tried deploying them as early as possible but it seems like nothing I do will get them to open until 5km altitude and by the time my capsule \u002B heatshield is that low, it\u0027s screaming along at nearly 1km/sec and the chutes tear right off. I\u0027m not sure how to slow my capsule down enough to use the chutes safely without being able to deploy them earlier.

The chute icons change colour. Red - don\u0027t open, Yellow - risky, Grey - ok. As Akaishi_ said, come in at an angle. If you are doing a sub-orbital flight, don\u0027t go straight up.

The old \u0022souposphere\u0022 is gone, so the air doesn\u0027t slow you down near as much. In order to spend more time in the thickest part of the air to slow you down, you\u0027ve got to be traveling sideways.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, for just a sub-orbital hop, the heat shield is completely unnecessary. All its doing now is adding weight (which increases your ballistic coefficient because you\u0027ve got more mass but the same cross section area) and making you go faster than just the pod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you ditch the last booster, make sure that you turn retrograde, this will provide the best braking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd a note about the parachute icon (this was already mentioned, but it\u0027s worth saying it again). The icon has two parts, the background and the actual icon part. I say this because each can change colors. If the icon part is white, then it\u0027s not broken, and ready to be staged. If the icon is blue/cyan that means that you\u0027ve \u0022armed\u0022 it by staging it, but it has not deployed yet. At this point you can right click it and disarm it, and stage it again later. If the icon is yellow then it has been pre-deployed, and a green icon is fully deployed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the background.
