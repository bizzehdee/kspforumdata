With either option you \u003Cu\u003Emust\u003C/u\u003E make sure the game treats the bit you want to connect as the parent part to have an available node: if a subassembly, the only node it\u0027ll recognise is where you detached it when you made it a subassembly (so you attach something else to the top of the docking port, make that the root, then remove the rest and drop it into the subassembly box); if you want to merge, just make the top docking port the root before you save it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA second reason for making it a subassembly (or merging it in) is that your launcher will then have its own root part that is facing the right way from the start, so the VAB doesn\u0027t get confused. Otherwise, changing the root part from one that has been turned from its default position can make the VAB flip or turn the entire rocket - not an insurmountable problem but a pain to have to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne final thing to note: since the ship isn\u0027t being built in a \u0022standard\u0022 manner, you might find unexpected behaviour when separating craft, such as the game thinking that a discarded bit of rocket is the \u0022main\u0022 vehicle rather than debris.
