The problem is though, since I don\u0027t have enough\u00A0deltav to get into a full orbit, my orbits tend to be sub-orbital and semi ballistic. The Apo. tends to be ~80km, and yet when I re enter the pod is going to fast for me to deploy the parachutes in time. I\u0027m getting frustrated and am wondering if this is suppose to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T13:45:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will happen if you go straight up and then straight down again - or anything remotely close to it. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you re-enter from orbit, remember, your mostly going sideways - so you get to spend a long time in the atmosphere to loose speed. \u00A0Sub-orbitally, the horizontal component to your velocity will be much less - which means you\u0027ll have less time in to the atmostphere to slow down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few approaches to this - you can try and give your re-entry body improved lift characteristics so that you glide back rather than falling like a rock - which will prolong the time in the atmosphere. Alternatively you can researcha and use drogue chutes which aren\u0027t enough to land with but can slow you down enough to deploy the main chute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, early on, your best bet is to simply do less steep sub-orbital missions. \u00A0Burn\u00A0sideways more - you\u0027ll limit your potential Ap, but at this stage all you\u0027re trying to do is hit \u0026gt;70km before coming back - so use any excess thrust to get sideways velocity which will protect you on the way back down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T13:46:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 01:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wemb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T13:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a really common problem with newer players.

In the very first sub-orbital flight, the aerobreaking effet given by pointing the \u0022heat shield side\u0022 prograde can indeed by insuficient.
