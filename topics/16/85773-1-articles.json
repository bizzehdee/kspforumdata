There are a couple things you can consider/do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get a rotating wheel stabilizer on there. SAS rocks socks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If you need to turn low, get at least two wings (control surfaces) at the base for stability and control. Even with less atmosphere, there is still atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Try to wait to correct above the atmosphere. If you are burning fast and far, you may extend your orbit to an undesired height, preventing this from being the best option, so use it as a last resort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would avoid mechjeb until you are more seasoned. When you have to make complicated maneuvers in the future, reliance on mechjeb prevents a full dissection of possible problems. I don\u0027t even use it because I want to understand every aspect of everything as for fault, etc. Just a suggestion. Don\u0027t worry, so long as there is support at liftoff, every rocket is going to go straight.

You can turn 45 degrees right off the launchpad in stock without any consequences. This is because there is no air pushing against your broad side in stock, where as FAR/NEAR simulate that effect, if you turn too fast your rocket will be pretty much traveling sideways against the air which best case scenario causes you to lose control, worst case with FAR is your craft gets ripped apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou said your COT is in line with your COM, but how far from it? If you have a heavy payload in the front of the rocket that shifts the COM too close to the tip, the thrust is going to push the back end around. This is true in any aerodynamic case. The solution in this case is to build smarter. You can break up your payload if possible, or even (in stock) hang it on the sides from a support beam along the sides of the lifter, so the center of mass of the payload is closer to the center of mass on the lifter. This all depends on the shape and size of the payload, you want to keep your mass on either side of the lifter equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots would help us help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T17:56:56Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friend Bear","CreatedById":123301,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T18:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, sorry for that.
