Could you post one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, though, it sounds as though you might be making the rocket too top-heavy. When you are performing the gravity turn, the weight at the front of the rocket might be enough to overpower your reaction torque and pull the whole thing over. Try making a bigger, or at least heavier, booster underneath the payload during the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T21:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECouldn\u0027t agree more with Maximus97.

Shaking/Rotating Radial Decouplers - This was a common problem I encountered when using a lot of Solid Fuel Boosters, regardless of RT-10 or BACC or any other model. A high thrust to weight ratio results in those joints shaking and you usually need 1, 2 or 3 strut per booster (RT-10, BACC, S1 SRB KD25k respectively) to secure to the main rocket you\u0027re boosting up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Centre of boost significantly below top heavy designs. If your rocket has a huge amount of mass towards the top and very powerful boost towards the bottom, your rocket will become unstable immediately upon launch/stage activation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Over compensation by RCS \u002B SAS combination. Sometimes I completely disable RCS during launch and build in more SAS controls. RCS tends to over compensate and results in small twitchy movement. It continues to try to compensate that twitchy movement and you get even more twitch before it breaks apart. This is really a compounding effect of a rocket that has many parts and has weak joints/linkages or radial decouplers etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Weak structural joints/linkage - Certain joints in the rockets are weak. Often this occurs in large multi-stage rockets where the sections for orbit or interstellar travel starts shaking because it has a significant amount of mass and the joints are stressed. Placing struts as suggested will help this issue but you have to identify which parts are the one which are disconnecting etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice in general is plan your mission top down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Bring only what is absolutely needed at your final point (e.g. Science Lab? Goo? Thermometer? etc. ONLY BARE MINIMUM). Fit the smallest possible engine and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Build a redundancy of 10-25% (depending on your competence) to account for human/piloting error throughout your stages working backwards from your final stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Use Solid Fuel Boosters in the early stages as much as possible. I found that S1 SRB KD25k great for lifting things into higher atmosphere and using RT-10 to assist in achieving stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you follow that advice your rocket will be really paired down and have less moving/shaking parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T11:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy crystal ball says:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket is a teensy bit wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have wing surfaces toward the front of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket is wobbling, presenting ever-changing angle-of-attack to the wings, worsening the wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust move the wings to the extreme rear, and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armament","CreatedById":117171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T12:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks K77, my rocket was probably a little too top-heavy (2-stage lander) but using T-45s over T-30s meant I was able to keep stable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K77LostNSpace","CreatedById":72529,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T15:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESweet, glad I could help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
