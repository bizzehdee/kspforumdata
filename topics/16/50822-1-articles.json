The first is the age-old problem of things being deleted in atmosphere more than 2.5km away. It\u0027s possible to keep flying in circles until he lands but it\u0027s very annoying. Is there a mod out there or config file change I can make to increase this distance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is compounded by the second issue; I have to release him above 500m elevation or he\u0027ll go flying out of his chair. So is there a way to reinforce the seat so he can handle a near-instant 200m/s deceleration? It wouldn\u0027t be so bad if I could drop him meters above the ground, and either have him land before I leave the area (~12.5s) or do a quick circle and then leave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, I\u0027ll see how slow I can get to try to make him stay on. If he can stay on at 50m/s I can drop him at low altitude and have 50s before I\u0027m out of range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CvVtjRtb","CreatedById":59454,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T17:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-31T03:08:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2019 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Thehalospartansa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E[]\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T18:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can make the plane unmanned and just let it disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T20:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a little something like this a few days ago.
