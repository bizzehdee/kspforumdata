I think he is meaning any ship that you aren\u0027t currently in control of. It doesn\u0027t matter if you have kerbals on board, if it\u0027s being piloted by a probe core, or if it\u0027s just pure debris. If the other conditions are met: outside physics range of ~2.5km and below 0.1 atm (~23km on Kerbin) will be deleted with no funds being recovered. This is true for any atmospheric body, it\u0027s just that the altitude cutoff differs by planet/moon based on the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, if you can jettison your stages above 22km (with a little upward trajectory) you can sometimes have enough time to get your main craft in orbit, then switch back to your dropped stage to watch it parachute down. That would allow it to land and you can recover it for funds. If you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to do that, you\u0027ll have to find a mod that fits what you\u0027d like. There are add-ons that refund money (as have been mentioned) and there are add-ons that extend the physics range beyond the ~2.5km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Repseki","CreatedById":133987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T14:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the info, definitely what I was looking for.

I found the most reliable way of being able to do this is to only expect recovery on the last stage ejected before gaining orbit. It still is a bit risky though and takes a bit of planning. I\u0027ve had quite a few larger stages mostly destroyed when landing, even with plenty of chutes. Once the stage hits the ground (or water in my case) it topples over and most of the parts disintegrate... Normally, it doesn\u0027t destroy my chutes, so the additional investment in the craft is returned. Well, except for the extra dV required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill try to place the chutes closer to CoM on an empty stage next time to try and situate it horizontally next time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T17:22:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have stage recovery and I set the attempt powered recovery off.
