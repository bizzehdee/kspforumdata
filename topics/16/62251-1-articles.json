The best thing in this situation is to hear someone else spell it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, I was trying to compare engines running on different propellants. Liquid fuel vs. monopropellant for instance. And I was wondering: is an Isp value given for an engine running on fuel type A directly comparable to one given for an engine running on fuel type B? Or is its meaning specific to one kind of fuel only, and you would need to translate the other number into that frame of reference before comparing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose this boils down to the result of the following hypothetical scenario - an engine with 500 Isp fed by fuel tank A and an engine also with 500 Isp fed by fuel tank B. Tank A contains 1000 units of fuel A, which weighs 1 ton in total. Tank B contains 5000 units of fuel B, which also weighs 1 ton in total. Do the two engines run out of fuel at the same time, or will one run for longer than the other?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T13:45:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T13:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey will run out at the same time, Tsiolkovsky\u0027s does not include any units other than tonnes, m/s and m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T13:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...I could just have looked at the equation, couldn\u0027t I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E my issue everytime this happens \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E And all it takes is for someone to play Captain Obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I must be getting old...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T14:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6an engine with 500 Isp fed by fuel tank A and an engine also with 500 Isp fed by fuel tank B.
