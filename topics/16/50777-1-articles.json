But part way through my launch the rocket tips into an unrecoverable dive. I finally clicked on all the tanks as this was happening and saw that one of the tanks was nearly empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe setup has a center tank and 1 tank north, south, east, and west (for a total of 5 tanks, with the middle one being the largest). It looks like an \u0022X\u0022 from a top down view. I ran one fuel line from each tank into the middle one. and one fuel line from the middle one to each of the outer tanks thinking this would balance out the fuel as it drained. I have checked countless times and all fuel lines are going in the proper direction and are attached to the tanks, but the one in the \u0022back\u0022 (the one that faces away from you as you enter the launch screen) drains faster creating a balance problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ... what am I doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayfare","CreatedById":52072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T10:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSPs fuel logic is easily confused by loops and/or a mix of converging and diverging flow routes.

If you don\u0027t use any fuel lines, the side tanks drain too fast. If you use fuel lines from the middle tank to the side tanks, the middle tank drains too fast.
