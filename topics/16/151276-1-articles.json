Latecomer to KSP here, didn\u0027t have a computer worth mentioning for the last several years, but more or less everybody I asked for game recommendations mentioned KSP and I am loving it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I just started trying to mess about with some planes and have a few questions I can\u0027t figure out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the first plane I made - I just followed a YouTube tutorial because I had no idea at all where to even begin. \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHMIapk41iA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHMIapk41iA\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022iCkIAx4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iCkIAx4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the second successful plane I designed. Needed something with more range and a booster to get up above 18km until I get better engines later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EqvM5Sh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EqvM5Sh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings me to my questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The first plane is very unstable. It is flyable, but twitches around and wants to nose down a bit at all times (I suspect this may be due to the air scoop on the bottom hidden in the picture). If I turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E it freaks out. The second plane is steady as a rock, I can set a heading, turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, turn up the time to x4, and more or less stop paying attention until I am approaching my destination. Anybody know why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The first plane wants to drift to the side on the runway, even when stopped with no throttle, even with brakes applied. A couple of other designs I tried were even worse about this. I got into the habit of throttling up immediately before it could get out of hand. This second plane does not, although it will drift forward slowly without brakes. Why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) When I made the first plane and took it out to mess about with it I discovered that the controls were backward to what I was used to. I use an old PS3 controller with a dead battery to play KSP. There was a series of failures to take off as I exploded into the runway because pulling back on the joystick was making me nose down (took a few tries to figure out that this was the problem and not something with the design). So I inverted the joystick in the options. Problem solved, the plane now flies more or less as I am used to from other simulators. Star Fox and X-Wing are simulators, right? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Then when I took the second plane out I was having the exact same problem. The stick is still inverted, but this plane behaves in reverse of the first. What gives?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisb2244","CreatedById":168694,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T15:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I\u0027m not certain, but I\u0027d say you have not enough pitch authority for the first plane. There\u0027s no tail, and so only the ailerons on the wings give you pitch control, and they\u0027re not far in front of/behind (I.e. front or back away from) the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough the second plane has a similar problem, it looks like you have the Swivel engine there, so you can use the gimballing of the engine to add pitch control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Might be your wheels are not completely square to the ground. Try using the rotate and offset gizmos in \u0022absolute\u0022 mode to correct. Having a plane too heavy for the wheels also does this, but your planes seem ok.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) No idea, sorry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T03:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally, you want the little blue \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E ball indicator to be a bit \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethe yellow \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator ball. So that they are not quite touching. When they touch, your plane will have pitch problems. When you have them right on top of each other, generally you will have severe pitch problems and your plane will be unflyable, as you found. Why your second plane works is a mystery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, control surfaces attached to swept wings can be confusing ...\u00A0both to the program and to the player. The general point is that a control surface that is in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E has to operate inverted to one that is behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. (Think about how a canard has to operate compared to a rear stabilizer.) So the program tries to guess whether each control surface is ahead or behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and inverts their operation if they are in front. Which brings you to swept wings -- the program basically can\u0027t figure these out automatically. So it always gets them wrong. If the program gets it wrong, then you can use the control surface\u0027s context menu, and set the \u0022authority\u0022 to -100 to partially fix the problem. Or just mentally use the controls inverted, as you have done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever:\u00A0those Type A swept wings (on the first plane) are a very bad deal. They are expensive, extra\u00A0heavy, and very draggy, and give you very little lift in return -- compared to all the other wings in the game. Also, the game does not actually model the wing sweep in the aero portion of the game; swept wings have no drag bonus. So if you really want to use a swept wing for aesthetic purposes, go ahead. But if you are having trouble making your plane fly, then switching to straight wings might be a smart choice. You will always know if your control surface is ahead of or behind your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T06:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, you want the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003Ecol\u003C/abbr\u003E just inside the com usually. \u00A0The advice above is true for before the old\u00A0aero, and usually sorta works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Yep, not enough pitch authority. \u00A0Just take a pair of the elevons, turn off roll and shove them on the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2:It looks like you might have a quadricycle setup on the first plane. \u00A0Don\u0027t do that. \u00A0Change your plane to have a single gear in the front and two on the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe control inversion may be because of a bug in the way that the game recognizes the way that control surfaces should act. \u00A0if the root part is in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the pitch control is behind, it will think that its in front, not behind. \u00A0What you could do is add a tail and disable pitch on those control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T08:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me the really basics are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBlue bal (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E) behind yellow ball (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAt least 1 horizontal control surface in front of yellow (and blue), and one behind yellow (and blue).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTail fin on the back.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nMy favorite designs (because they are stable) usually have large wings in the back (helps to push that blue ball back), and winglets or canards near the front.
