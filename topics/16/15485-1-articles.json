Unless your ship is a /ridiculously/ unweildy monster, you\\\u0027ll have time. The Mun is close, and its Sphere of Influnece is nearly 5000 km across.

The Mun is close, its SOI is huge, it\\\u0027s moving faster than you are at that point, and Kepler\\\u0027s Second Law means that you\\\u0027ll be hanging out near apoapsis for a long time. There\\\u0027s no need to circularize; it just wastes fuel and prolongs the trip. Be patient, and wait for it to sweep you into its SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHis is generally the most fuel-efficient way to get to the Mun, and a fairly quick, which is why it\\\u0027s generally so popular. Been doing it since there was a Mun to go to, and have missed the Munar SOI only once with this method, due to my own carelessness.
