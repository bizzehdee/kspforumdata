Set your target in the map view and it\u0027ll plot ascending and descending nodes. Burn normal/anti-normal at one of these nodes to reduce your relative inclination to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext you need to get your apoapsis and periapsis in phase with your target (ie get both apoapsis on a line through the centre of Kerbin). This is accomplished by burning radial-out or radial-in. This step can be skipped if your target is in a nearly-circular orbit, but is necessary if your target is highly elliptical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird you need to catch up to or wait for your target. If you are ahead of your target you need to be in a higher (slower) orbit. If you are behind it you need to be in a lower (faster) orbit. If you\u0027re approx 180 deg away it doesn\u0027t matter. If you\u0027re not concerned about it taking longer you can wait to go the long way round (for example you are ahead of target in a lower orbit) for a dv saving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, you match periapsis to perapsis (you are higher) or apoapsis to apoapsis (you are lower). This is accomplished by burning pro/retrograde at the opposite node until the altitudes match. This will slow your rate of catching/waiting, so feel free to leave this until you\u0027re nearly caught up. Or you can do this immediately if you don\u0027t mind waiting a little longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage you should start getting intercept markers that show your closest approach to the target. If your orbit crosses your target you will get a closest approach for each crossing. For this reason when acomplishing step 4 I make sure I don\u0027t cross the orbits because I find dealing with a single intercept marker makes things clearer. You can now adjust the closeness of your intercept by burning pro/retrograde at either apoapsis or apoapsis (whichever you earlier matched with your target) to adjust your orbital period. You can usually do thus in one burn to get a rendezvous on your next orbit, but it may be cheaper in dv to wait a few orbits do that you don\u0027t have to adjust as much, or you may be constrained in how much you can adjust by a planetary surface, atmosphere or lunar sphere of influence. Don\u0027t de-orbit yourself by accident! If you did all the previous steps accurately you should easily be able to get an intercept \u0026gt;0.5km. Hover the mouse over an intercept marker to see the separation at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo complete the rendezvous match target velocity at closest approach. The nav-ball should automatically switch to target mode when you get close. It may also accidentally switch to target mode if you pass within visual range of your target at any earlier stage. If this happens don\u0027t let it screw up your orbital manoeuvres! Target prograde != orbital prograde! Switch between nav-ball modes by clicking on your velocity. Burn retrograde to target velocity to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations! You should now be rendezvoused within 500m! You\u0027re close enough now to manoeuvre directly at the target, but keep your velocity low (\u0026gt;10m/s) so as not to mess up your orbit. Docking is now relatively straightforward if you\u0027ve got the rcs controls down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T02:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m doing a minimum-fuel rendezvous I usually go to the tracking station and time warp from there.
