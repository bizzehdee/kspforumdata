But I was curious about whether it\u0027s currently working as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the stock functionality, I was using the sub-assembly mod. And similarly to the stock subassembly, you could only save a selection of parts which the root part of the craft, or of the ghosted selection had a free connection node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a montage of screenshots to showcase what I\u0027m referring too. Made 2 variations of a tiny probe. The first example (top left) the root part has a parachute on top and a fuel tank at the bottom. The center top screenshot shows you can\u0027t save it, then the top right screenshot shows that there are infact nodes to connect the vessel \u0027as a whole\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe I just show that if you remove the parachute (bottom right), you can save it (bottom center).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rather limits the way you can use subassemblies. I have a work around because I use the rootpart selector, so I can reassign the engine as the root part and then allows me to save it as a sub assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this working as intended, or should we be allowed to save a vessel as a whole even if the root part has no more stack nodes left?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/01bbuj4m0qwr6ro/Sub_Assembly_Root_Part_Only.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/01bbuj4m0qwr6ro/Sub_Assembly_Root_Part_Only.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T13:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot save anything as a subassembly that has the root part of the craft in it.

Look at my screenshots, the root part is the probe center. And it can be saved. It just can\u0027t be saved if it has no attachments left. I\u0027m wondering if this is stock functionality or not. When using the root selector mod you can pretty much save any premade crafts, you just select the part you want it to be connectable from. That vastly improves the usefulness of the subassembly. Without it all your constructions need to have the root part as the \u0027base\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T13:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ashflare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ashflare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERespectfully, this is incorrect, you can save anything, including the entire craft, if you like, but the root part must have a free connection node\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh?

Let it have some limitations perhaps, but part trees can already be jumbled in any given direction by the docking system - having it available in the VAB would be a great help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course the bug I mentioned in the subassembly manager thread should be fixed. Root parts at the moment do not get checked for their surface-attachment node, so a craft built around a fuselage or a fuel tank (i.e. a custom booster or spaceplane) will not be saveable as a a subassembly if both of its \u003Cstrong\u003Estack\u003C/strong\u003E nodes are occupied, despite the \u003Cstrong\u003Esurface attach\u003C/strong\u003E node being free - something that works easily with identical constructions detached from a surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
