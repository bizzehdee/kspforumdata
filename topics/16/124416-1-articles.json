This means that the parts of your craft that are pointing prograde, retrograde, radial or anti-radial, the craft wont hold those positions as it continues to orbit because the positions are relative to the planet and its curvature, not the craft itself. But this also means that in an equatorial orbit, the part of your craft that is pointing normal and anti-normal will continue to point that way as it orbits (which is why it is recommended that you park a craft to be docked with later with its docking port facing normal, so that it will still be pointing that way when you come back and wont be rotating relative to its orbit as you try to dock.
