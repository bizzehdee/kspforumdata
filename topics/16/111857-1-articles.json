If you didn\u0027t then you don\u0027t have a legit source for it, since Steam has moved on to 1.0.2 now.\n\nFor your own sanity as KSP progresses in the future, I\u0027d really suggest learning to like 1.0.2 - it\u0027s really not hard, it\u0027s just different and has a few new rules to learn. If there\u0027s specific problems that are bugging you, ask the community how to solve them. Most likely you just need to modify the way you build a little ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"areutheman","CreatedById":137048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:22:53Z","Content":"well the advanced physics make my computer lag i CANT get used to it i want the old version or im done with this game."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:27:34Z","Content":"Right click on the game in the Steam list, select properties, then Betas and try the previous stable version."},{"CreatedByName":"areutheman","CreatedById":137048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:33:42Z","Content":"it says it needs beta access code to unlock private betas where do i find the one for JUST BEFORE 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:35:33Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need an access code.
