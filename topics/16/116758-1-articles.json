The aerodynamics of the rocket will tend to keep it going in a straight line. If you\u0027ve got static (unmoving) fins on the rocket, that\u0027ll make this even more pronounced.\n\nAnother is if your rocket is very large and doesn\u0027t have control units on it, like SAS or RCS.\n\nObviously having both of those is worse.\n\nTry starting sandbox game and finding an engine with high gimballing, add an SAS control unit and don\u0027t exceed 200 m/s in the lower atmosphere. If that doesn\u0027t work, you\u0027ve got some serious bugginess. Otherwise, it\u0027s just a matter of getting used to aerodynamics."},{"CreatedByName":"iNUKE","CreatedById":102782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T19:43:25Z","Content":"\u003E Try starting sandbox game and finding an engine with high gimballing, add an SAS control unit and don\u0027t exceed 200 m/s in the lower atmosphere.
