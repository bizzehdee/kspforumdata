The launcher needed depends on the payload weight. Pictures of the lander (or orbiter, as the Mun is now a pain to set down on) you are using might also help. To go to the Mun, you want to drag your apoapsis out to the Mun\u0027s altitude. You need to thus burn on the opposite side of Kerbin from where you want the intercept. The lead angle (how far in front of the Mun you want your orbit) is roughly 45*.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BananaLee","CreatedById":73706,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T02:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took me 69 hours of slow and steady learning to land Jeb on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.
