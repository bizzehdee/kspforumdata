There is plenty of electricity and the batteries are fully charged. There are 2 kerbal pods which was fine, but after i did my ship docking i put a kerbal in one. Then i moved him back to the ship and un-docked and de-orbited. There are no other command modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@gus and @UbioZur I think that could be the problem! Now that you bring it up I did decouple a maneuvering rocket I left there which had a command module. I can launch another module with one attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll let you know if that was it.
