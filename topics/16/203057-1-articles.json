not sure that I fully understand your question, but I\u2019ll give it a shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSetting up a maneuver node lets you plan what the effects of a burn will be. \u00A0 However, you \u003Cstrong\u003Estill need to manually complete the actual burn. \u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 You do this by firing your engines when the ship reaches the maneuver node you set up, making sure it\u2019s pointed the correct direction\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, you are in low Kerbin orbit (~100km). \u00A0 (Just kidding, I mean ~100 km..) \u00A0You plan a maneuver to reach Mun, so let\u2019s say it calls for a prograde burn of about 850 m/s. \u00A0 When your ship reaches the maneuver node, you point your ship prograde, and burn. \u00A0 Eventually your\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0path will very nearly match the projected path from the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that the burn times calculated in a maneuver node assume all energy will be expended at a single point in time, which is of course not possible. \u00A0 The maneuver node assumes a burn duration of zero seconds, but in reality it may take you 10, 100, or 1,000 seconds, depending on your thrust to weight ratio. \u00A0 So many players bracket their burns to have roughly half the burn occur before the maneuver node, and the rest (other half) occur after passing the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI apologize if I misunderstood your
