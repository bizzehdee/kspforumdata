Just Target Jebediah, or the command pod. If jeb is away from the pod, target him. Launch your savior probe, and this is crucial: Change your plane (how inclined your orbit is) to his. If no further adjustment is needed, make sure you both have the same orbit. If he is ahead of you, make your orbit smaller to catch up. If he is ahead, make it bigger. Once you catch up, switch the navball to Target mode, by clicking where it either says \u0022Orbit x m/s \u0022or \u0022Surface x m/s\u0022. Once it says Target, wait until your closest approach, then turn on SAS and click the one at the bottom that says anti-target. Make a small main engine burn until it says under Target on the navball something under about 5-10 m/s. Then, take out little Jebarooney, fly him over in his RCS pack, and get him in the ship.
