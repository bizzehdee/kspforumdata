I have a very standardized space program where the standard tug and all mission modules fall in or near the 30-40 ton range, so everything goes up on the same lifter and most interplanetary ships consist of 2 pieces: the standard tug and the mission module. With the tug attached, such ships typically have about 4200m/s delta-V, enough to go most places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the standard tug is pretty simple, just the big nuke engine, the 3-high metal fuel tank, some RCS, reaction wheels, a probe core, a Sr. docking port, and 2 RTGs. The engine and tank are KSPX at present but I bet they\u0027ll be stock in 0.22. 1 big nuke has a SLIGHTLY better TWR than 2x LV-Ns as well as fewer parts, and makes using the superior Sr. docking port a breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xKXE4Hv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xKXE4Hv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are occasions, however, when I want more thrust and/or more fuel, and/or a docking port on each end. In such cases, I replace the big nuke with another Sr. port and put 4x LV-Ns with small tanks on outriggers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T19:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy tugs are quite simple: a central fuel tank with docking ports on the front and back, surrounded by several radial nukes. The payload ship can be mounted on the front docking port nicely, and as many fuel tanks as I need can be docked to the back of the ship, to be undocked when expended. This design has technically unlimited delta-v, as you can dock as many fuel tanks as you please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T21:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis depends.

It reaches orbit with a lot of fuel still in its launch booster, so you can use that to top up the tanks of your payload and give a bit of extra delta-v at high thrust for your departure burn. Once you ditch the launch booster, it\u0027s one orange tank and one LV-N. It accelerates \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E slowly, but it has enough kick to push a small space station into Eeloo orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JerryIRacer","CreatedById":71799,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T01:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are mine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj44/jburkacki/KSP%20Screenshots/screenshot78_zps15e0505c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot78_zps15e0505c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj44/jburkacki/KSP%20Screenshots/screenshot7_zps83834d42.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot7_zps83834d42.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj44/jburkacki/KSP%20Screenshots/screenshot34_zpsc17d7b50.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot34_zpsc17d7b50.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i269.photobucket.com/albums/jj44/jburkacki/KSP%20Screenshots/screenshot39_zps9bd4bdcf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot39_zps9bd4bdcf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuke I am using is equivalent of 3 stock ones. 3 times the mass and thrust.
