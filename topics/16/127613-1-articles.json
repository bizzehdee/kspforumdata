Is there a way to completely turn this off so the computer is not even recording it. I need it to test flight a vehicle that has engines that just kiss other parts of the ship and endlessly fill this up. It may be crashing the game or causing lag after endless inputs and was curious if there was anyway to shut this off all the way. Not just in the Flight window screen persay but in any back logs also. Though anything will help. I\u0027m trying to free up cpu on the one core that is always 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve run the game via starting the official launcher and used turn off log to give extra performance(for a very big ship) and AMD mode for my CPU(which seems to be helping), but I need to turn off everything I can. I\u0027m already at the lowest settings I can pick too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-12T01:00:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2015 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
