Then, keep raising your apoapsis until you see (via orbit thingy on map - hopefully you\u0027ve got your conics mode to \u00273\u0027) that you will escape Duna into solar orbit. Once in solar, you need to tweak your orbit so you run into Kerbin - just the same way you did to reach Duna. At this point you should need comparatively little energy - providing your timing and aim is right. Your window however may be hundreds of days in the future though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ramses","CreatedById":26418,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T22:33:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet into orbit from Duna at 270 degrees as opposed to 90.
