I have solar panels, which are getting sunlight, but the batteries are not recharging. This is the first time this has happened to me in the current game I\u0027m playing. And before anyone says it, I\u0027m am not running the Kopernicus mod.\n\n![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\nPlease help. Thanks.\n\nFalse, alarm, everybody. It appears .48 exposure wasn\u0027t enough to get the batteries to charge.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T05:36:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 05:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MerlinsMaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T05:31:02Z","Content":"Right click the panel and see what it says.

It\u0027s possible that may have been a contributing factor, but I think the primary cause was that whatever parts I had using EC were using it faster than the solar panels could replenish, and it looked like they weren\u0027t charging. Also, the Remote Tech flight computer had the satellite pointed in a certain direction, and as a result I couldn\u0027t turn it. But I wasn\u0027t aware parts could block sunlight, so I will definitely keep that in mind going forward.

Sometimes if your orbit is low and you\u0027re close to sunrise/sunset, even if you can clearly see the sunlight bating your craft, the panels will say they\u0027re blocked by the celestial body."}]}
