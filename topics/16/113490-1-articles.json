I am not trying to patronize you or anything but you just gotta accept the game as the buggy mess it is and enjoy it as much as you can. I mean this should come as no suprise to you that sometimes biomes registers wrong especially where biomes meet and there are hundreds of bugs in the game. Im sure you know this but moving your location a bit will solve the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T08:26:40Z","Content":"It is a glitch. Either because of the polar mesh or because of the biome boundary or could be both.\n\nNot sure why and how \u0022accepting the buggy game\u0022 is related to just asking a question whether a behavior is buggy or not, especially since in this game it happens more often than other games that you missed something so that you thought it was a bug but it\u0027s actually intended - it never hurts to ask, and if you did miss something, you would learn. So I don\u0027t understand why asking a question is discouraged."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T09:04:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t understand why asking a question is discouraged.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking a question... The problem is that this particular question has been asked before and a simple search answers it. This just feels like asking the question \u0027\u0027Why do my rocket turns at launch?\u0027\u0027 It has been asked before and im sure it will be asked again as i saw it atleast over a dozen times in last month.\n\nI might have been a bit hostile in my post and i apologize if that is the case. I know i should have just left it alone or explain op that this has been asked before and direct op to a thread where this particular problem is explained. Lets leave it at that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T09:07:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 09:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"SignalCorps","CreatedById":134795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:53:23Z","Content":"I try and search for existing threads before I ask, but I guess I didn\u0027t use the correct keywords so I missed any existing ones.

And I\u0027ve encounter this problem several times in different locations 10-100\u0027s of km apart.\n\nAnd I understand glitches happen, it\u0027s part of coding. But I don\u0027t think we should just \u0027accept\u0027 glitches and expect them just to be there. It\u0027s part of a developer\u0027s job to address these things, especially in a game we pay for. I\u0027m not faulting Squad for anything, as they\u0027ve done a remarkable job with this game, and have been doing very well at addressing issues. But we should expect a developer to fix problems, otherwise you run around in Assassin\u0027s Creed 4 with no face and fall through the game world forever.

When you get that kind of answer its generally best to ignore it until someone gives you a legitimate answer, like below.\n\nTHe issue in question is caused by how biomes are determined. Biomes are created as a map of a planetary surface that is color coded. The color, as RGB code, is tied to the biome. Sometimes, because of compression, biome borders can register as a biome completely unrelated to either of the two biomes its sandwiched between. One of the most common occurrences is the transition between shores and grasslands on Kerbin. Simply heading west out of the KSC can register you in tundra for a brief minute.\n\nThere\u0027s also a plateau on Duna where highlands and midlands are mixed up (highlands on the edges, midlands in the middle), but that\u0027s not your issue. There may be a mistake on the biome map or you were caught with a fluke in determining biome. Its a known issue and there\u0027s actually not much Squad can do about it aside from cleaning up the maps (unless of course they\u0027re willing to fully recode how biomes work)."}]}
