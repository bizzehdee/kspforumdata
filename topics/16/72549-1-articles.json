I towed a \u0022space station\u0022 segment in to orbit and released it. Now I\u0027m trying to dock on it. I\u0027ve been dry humping this thing all morning. I can get them to kiss. They seem perfectly a lined. They sort of stick to together. I\u0027ve tried turning sas off. But they never seem to dock. Is there any thing which stops you from docking on an... inert object. I mean there is no one on board. No crew. No sputnik. Am I doing something wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T18:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne or both of your docking ports may be mounted backwards. They\u0027ll only connect from one side so you hve to be careful when mounting them on your craft. Also, docking ports only connect to the same size ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T18:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you might have one of the docking ports facing the wrong way.

This is a bit of a recycle off of a previous post of mine, but it seemed like a good place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe junior and regular sized docking ports are reasonably obvious since each side is pretty distinct. The Sr docking port is a bit harder, because both sides are relatively flat. I\u0027ve included the shielded docking port too, but that should be pretty obvious since you can only connect it one way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach docking port has a lighter ring on the docking side. Those two sides must meet at a reasonably flat angle for the ports to dock. You can be pretty far off, but if your ship is large then the ports will have a hard time swinging the ship around to lock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/WHPVE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
