It took me a while before I was ready to try setting a whole science lab (and therefore all the engines and fuel to get it there) down on the Mun. I did a few Minmus labs first then scaled up the most efficient result to suit the Mun\u0027s gravity. And the booster stage for those builds was monstruous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStability on landing is going to be very diffficult. Like, horribly difficult. Most of my labs have the thinnest tank underneath and small radial tanks with engines around the sides. And I still managed to tip over one or two of my first Mun attempts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd looking more closely at the four outboard engines there, they look like Puffs. They are decent for their size, but they use monopropellant, which means that you need two sorts of fuel to get your 140kN thrust. With very careful balancing I\u0027m sure the weight comes out much the same, but you\u0027re staging them at a different time to the LfO engine (which looks like a Terrier) so I think there\u0027s a high chance you\u0027ll run out of monopropellant first, and most of your descent will be with only 60kN of thrust available. With the big fuel tanks, it\u0027ll take a very long time to burn through the fuel and you\u0027ll have a very poor TWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, as I said earlier, I tend to end up with squat rockets, so my suggestions are not necessarily the best !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T10:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs suggested above: replace the Terrier and LV-N with Poodles and\u00A0run some stabilising struts from halfway up the core to the landing legs. I\u0027d also add some nosecones to your SRBs, and strut the SRBs to the core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also looks like there\u0027s nowhere near enough booster for the payload. The LV-N/Terrier/Poodle are good for orbital work, but they don\u0027t have the TWR for boosting to orbit. It looks like you\u0027re going to run out of high-TWR booster long before reaching orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: if I\u0027m reading it right, you\u0027ve never been to the Mun before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lab is a very big and heavy payload.
