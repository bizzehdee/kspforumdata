I usually start burning with the 5th stage and switch to the nuclear engines (6th stage) when the 5th stage uses up the fuel. After I changed the size of the Rockomax Decoupler and started using that instead, this problem hasn\u0027t occurred. I don\u0027t think anything is blocking the stage. The funny thing is that the stage becomes a separate ship that I can switch to but it sticks to the fuel tank in stage 6. Sometimes it comes of if I time warp. If it does that it usually blows up my 6th stage.
