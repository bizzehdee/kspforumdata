Picking things up off the ground is just really hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main thing to understand about grabbing with the klaw is that at the moment you touch your target,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe klaw has to be nearly perpendicular to the surface that it\u0027s grabbing.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Unlike some other players here, I find that your speed makes no difference whatsoever. Fortunately, you are doing this on a very low-G body. I\u0027d say, land right next to your target, look it over closely, find the most horizontal surface on it (probably the top?) and see which direction it\u0027s tilted -- so you know which direction you have to tilt your probe while you are coming down on top of it, pre-orient your probe, and then take it really slow. You may want to use the kerbal to push the pod downhill (or maybe uphill?) to someplace where it is as level as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
