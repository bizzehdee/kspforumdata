I managed to forget putting any comms on the lab and the shuttle, so I sent another ship up with an antenna. This validated the mission, but I still can\u0026#39;t send any data from the lab. Can\u0026#39;t comms pass through docking ports? If not, does anyone have any other suggestions apart from transfering everyone to a new science lab and destroying the old one? ;)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T10:46:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 10:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by carlsb3rg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T15:44:10Z","Content":"\nThat\u0026#39;s odd, that really ought to work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m guessing that the answer to this next question is \u0022yes\u0022, but just to confirm: have you successfully used science labs on other missions in the past?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAssuming so, and therefore that this is a problem specifically with this mission and not with your usage of science labs in general, I have no idea.

The funny thing is that after I went to Kerbal for a while and did some other missions, and then went back to my lab, transmission worked perfectly. It\u0026#39;s strange because I didn\u0026#39;t do anything at all. It just complained about not having any comm device, and suddenly it worked. Oh well.

I don\u0026#39;t know exactly what resolved it, but when I saved, closed, and reloaded the issue was gone. I\u0026#39;m guessing that KSP does some sort of check to see if a ship has comms on it when the game loads and goes from there, but who knows.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSide note: For a while I got so bad about attaching antennae to things that I made grabber-comms probes to fix my mistakes.
