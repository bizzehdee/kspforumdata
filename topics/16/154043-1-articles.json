It will show the waypoints, the names, and the corporation that gives the contract -- and the waypoints are color coded to help distinguish them. It will do this even before you accept the contract, so that you can know whether you want to accept the contract or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Once you have accepted the contract, and you begin a flight, you can click M to go into map mode. Once again, it will show the waypoints, the names, the company,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eand the altitude.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0That last being a very nice new feature, so you don\u0027t have to keep referring back to the contract while you are in flight.

That will put a navigation marker on your navball, and all you have to do is fly toward it. It is often good to plan a route to get several measurements in one flight, if you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will get a message, and the marker on the navball\u00A0will flash when you reach the waypoint;\u00A0and the waypoint will disappear when you take the measurement. The shape of the marker, and the symbol on the waypoint tell you what kind of measurement you need to take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a contract that requires multiple measurements, as you complete one waypoint it will automatically activate navigation to the next closest waypoint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh! ... and welcome to the forums! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-26T22:08:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2016 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"patgarret77","CreatedById":172916,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T22:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot for everything!
