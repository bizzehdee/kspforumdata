However, it was written before the offset tool was a thing. I say that because when you use the offset tool with angle snap on, it snaps the part to a grid, which makes it a whole lot easier to align landing gear to a\u00A0standardized height. Speaking of which, I highly suggest starting by making a subassembly with landing legs and a docking port at the exact height you need them to be on all of your modules, and use that as your building guide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T18:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a base using the Konstruction mod, using the extensible legs of the cradles and the adjustable legs.
