Go figure. But the next couple of times I was able to get the parts to touch but not attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part in question is the \u0022Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port\u0022. I have a few questions about it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Does this part attach to itself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The part has a \u0022male\u0022 side and a \u0022female\u0022 side. By male I mean the side with the smaller radius. Does the part attach male/male, female/female, or male/female? I think I\u0027ve tried female/female and male/female but neither worked. Before I spend another 30 minutes trying male/male I want to confirm if that\u0027s the problem or if it\u0027s something else. So do they attach male/male? Or do you have to turn them on? Or am I completely missing something? I was really confused when I touched the parts and they didn\u0027t attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I\u0027ve read various conflicting information about this issue online, it would be helpful if the devs included a note in the game about it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CelestialMechanic","CreatedById":63925,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T16:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you attach the docking port so that the part with the larger radius (the same as the 1.25m rocket parts) is attached to your rocket, and the smaller radius faces out to dock, on both ports.
