In a case of a double-coupler with two ports on it, I got them lined up but only one of them acutally links.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem was exacerbated by the efforts to sidemount a warp pod, a design I am dumping for my major interplanetary mission to Jool. Only one point would dock, the other slightly twisted. If I were to turn the engines on that, the twist would be brutal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm interested in approaches for stable docking for assembly of large interplanetary spacecraft. I am happy to consider mods that act to beef up the strength of the docking attachments as well, but my searches have yielded nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T00:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMulti-port docking, while possible, is extremely difficult. Both ports must be perfectly aligned. The easiest way to ensure this is during construction ensure angle snap is on, and use the same ship for whatever you need it for. (In your case only build one pod and then just re-launch said pod)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
