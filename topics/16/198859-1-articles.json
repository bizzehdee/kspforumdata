However, for now in stock, you must dock the two vessels together (into a single vessel) before you can do a fuel transfer. So (depending on your settings) you may need some fuel ducts along with a klaw or mini-klaw, or you can weld docking ports onto one or both of your vessels and then remove the docking ports when you are done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-19T21:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could take a fuel tank with fuel in it off of one vessel and put it on the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you then drain it, you could then take it off and put it back on the vessel with fuel, refill it, and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike a jerry can. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-19T23:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2020 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Superfluous J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-19T22:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223896160\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198859\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221608414462\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could take a fuel tank with fuel in it off of one vessel and put it on the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you then drain it, you could then take it off and put it back on the vessel with fuel, still it, and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike a jerry can. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat made me smile! \u00A0 Unfortunately, we are talking about vast amounts of fuel. \u00A0 So, while this would work (I\u0027m assuming..), not really the workable solution I\u0027m looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am able to dock vessels on the surface, although there are some nasty bugs that sometimes happen when you do that. \u00A0So, lots of F5. \u00A0 I\u0027m looking forward to a stock way to just run a fuel hose from one ship to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107529-curveball-anders/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022107529\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107529-curveball-anders/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Curveball Anders\u003C/a\u003E, thank you for your mod suggestion. \u00A0 While I\u0027m trying to do this in stock KSP (for, uh, reasons), other members who hit this post will find your suggestion very helpful!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022154251\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@bewing\u003C/a\u003E, Hmmm, that gives me an idea to try. \u00A0I\u0027ll report back if it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
