Just Kerbals for the station? If so, you have way, WAY too much fuel. Below here, I\u0027ve posted an SSTO that I designed, able to reach orbit and perform a Mun fly-by before returning and landing at KSC, with a crew of 2 as well as 8 passengers (typically tourists). I think the \u0022standard\u0022 is about 15 tons per RAPIER. It actually went through multiple revisions with different engine set-ups, and it was even able to achieve it\u0027s objective with only TurboRamJets and LV-909\u0027s. RAPIERs help a ton, though, due to being able to (usually) go a little higher and faster before losing thrust. I do recommend something like a set of LV-909s as your orbital, high-ISP engines, but ONLY if they don\u0027t weigh much. If they\u0027re too heavy, they\u0027ll really slow down your jets, causing you to lose any dV gains to friction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the big humps to get over is the 200-300m/s \u0022barrier\u0022 that occurs with a lot of low-TWR spaceplanes.

What I typically do is angle up to about 5 or 10 degrees, so that as I\u0027m climbing, my thrust output continues to increase smoothly. During this time I manage the throttle so my TWR never rises past 1.3 (I use Kerbal Engineer for this info). Once I reach about 12km (at which point I\u0027m usually between 300-500m/s, depending on how much attention I\u0027ve been paying), I crank the engines up to full and pitch down a couple degrees (but still about 5 - 10 degrees above horizon). My intention here is to reach about 1200 m/s at about 20-24km, then switch to closed cycle, pitch up, and complete the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also consider adding some more wing area on there. As it stands, it looks like it doesn\u0027t quite produce enough lift. The more lift you have, generally the lower TWR you can get away with. In most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually made a drone SSTO the other day for use as a miner on Laythe. It\u0027s TWR is high enough that I can pitch to basically 45 degrees after take-off, and have my thrust continue to increase. This, I think, might save a lot of fuel, since I\u0027m spending significantly less time in the thicker part of the atmo, losing speed to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs are extremely difficult at first, but trust me, they get easier with experience. The Laythe-miner SSTO is actually one that I slapped together in all but 5 minutes, and it achieved orbit without revisions.
