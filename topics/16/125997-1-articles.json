That way you can adjust the position of whole wing by just moving the root part instead of having to reassemble the whole thing. As far as I know, it doesn\u0026#39;t make any difference if you start with the leading or trailing edge. To stop them from braking apart, use struts or install the Kerbal Joint Reinforcement mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaving said this, I would recommend you use the large wing parts instead of trying to make your own with smaller parts. Advantages of doing this: lower part count, better structural integrity, no fiddling around with the pieces to get them to fit together just right, you can fill the large wing parts with fuel. This is just a matter of preference, but in my opinion these advantages outweigh the limiting factor in terms of aesthetics.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T19:11:52Z","Content":"\nIf I understand what you\u0026#39;re asking correctly....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did my own wingset from the FAT-455 set in the Squad Folder.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just did a copy of the files, rescaled them up 85%, increased the fuel capacity and empty mass the same, and adjusted the lift in relation to the surface area, increased drag 15% (due to size) then called them the FAT-1000 wing set.
