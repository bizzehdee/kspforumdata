Now, the actual glide is easy. I can land my shuttle any day in any condition. The issue is putting it in a position to actually land at the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Kerbin, this was easy as I as able to use the Trajectories mod to put my projected landing site on the landmass on the other side of the water from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and as I re-entered, the landing site would adjust to just ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E mountains, which was perfect for a glide to the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m not on Kerbin anymore, I\u0027m on a Kerbin-sized Earth. As such, the 28 * inclination of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E makes getting that trajectory a bit trickier. Thus far, the best I\u0027ve managed was a landing in Cuba. No amount of tweaking my trajectory has been able to give me that perfect site at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E yet. Or even anywhere near it so that I could then use my glide time to get to the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my question is do you guys have any tricks for actually accomplishing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould also be noted that while yes, I could just add jet engines to my shuttle and greatly reduce the requirement of getting as close to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as I can, that kind of defeats the point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-22T07:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no actual answer for you to get to \u003Cstrong\u003Eprecise\u003C/strong\u003E landing calculations.

So even although you may be able to land near or exact to the location based on a orbital trajectory calculation the rotation of earth shifts your surface landing area when your orbit is inclined against the landing target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know this ofcourse, the reason I\u0027m telling is because I want to ask if this is the only parameter that causes you to land off target.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan you confirm this, can others confirm this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EYou could try the following.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is the only reason for missing your target then what you may do is use a maneouvre node where you\u0027ll retro burn to calculate the amount of time from a set maneouvre node to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E (let\u0027s say it\u0027s 50 minutes).\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst do a hyperedit test and see how much\u00A0 time is added to that maneouvre node calculation in actual flight time. Because the actual flight time will take longer because of aerobraking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do that you\u0027ll only know the added time for aerobraking under the same descend profile and it will never be the same exactly depending on your maneouvring through the atmosphere but you may be able to nail it down within 10-20 seconds difference. Let\u0027s say the maneouvre node said 50 minutes, and a static descend profile test get\u0027s it to 52minutes and 30 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow calculate how much the earth surface would have rotated in 52 minutes and 30 seconds.

I wouldn\u0027t even try it. If your shuttle is capable of steeper descends, coming in from a higher alttitude on a steep aerobrake descend can make for a more precision landing.
