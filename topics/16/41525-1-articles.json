The satellite moves at the same rate as the ground beneath it, so from the perspective of the ground the satellite looks stationary. This can\u0027t work over the poles, because the poles don\u0027t rotate. That means that in order to move at the same rate as the ground at the pole, a satellite couldn\u0027t move... and you can\u0027t orbit when you\u0027re not moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some ways being explored in the real world to create \u0022statites\u0022, like satellites but they don\u0027t have to orbit, with solar sails or more exotic means... but in KSP, there\u0027s no way to park a probe or satellite over a pole and make it stay there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T23:11:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to do it is to have a craft with a TWR of at least 1 and park it over the pole and use something like the mechjeb translatron to hold it perfectly still (humans just aren\u0027t skilled enough to do it manaully) using thrust to keep it up. The poles don\u0027t rotate so you can\u0027t orbit, but you can hover, though this is only good so long as you are in control of the vessel and you have fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T23:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could do something like a Molniya orbit, which is a highly eccentric orbit with a period of half a day where the satellite loiters near apoapsis above the target area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case, you could simply put your satellite in a 90 degree polar orbit with your periapsis just outside the atmosphere above the South pole and your apoapsis high enough above the North pole to make your period 3 hours.
