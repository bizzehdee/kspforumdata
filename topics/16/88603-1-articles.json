However, I haven\u0027t even managed to reach the surface of Eve as my landers burn up in the atmosphere during entry. At least I now know how to make a lander aerodynamically stable during descent, but a lot of problems remain. I\u0027ve searched the forums and Google for answers, but found not much. All I know an ascent from the Evian surface to low orbit \u0027costs\u0027 5 to 7,5 km/s Delta-V, TWR should be at least 1.7, and an ascent vehicle should be as long and thin as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how big should I make an ascent vehicle if my goal is to bring a capsule with a mass of 0.8t to Evian orbit? This question is quite prominent as it has great influence on how to design the lander and the transfer stage. The lander shown here has a mass of 90t. Thought I nailed it with that thing, but the heat shield (in this case a thrust multiplate adapter) simply can\u0027t withstand the dense Evian atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/30a3u9s.png\u0022 alt=\u002230a3u9s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T14:46:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bekiekutmoar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T22:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could probably work the dV equation backwards.

Simply put, you need a huge lander, but slowing down a huge lander in the atmosphere without rapid disassembly is a huge challenge. I still have not succeeded in the round trip BTW, but I have finally stuck a landing... except I broke several of my liftoff engines on touchdown, which stranded Bill Kerman down there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy successful landing ended up using all of the following strategies together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Don\u0027t do a direct interplanetary approach straight into the atmosphere. The speeds are simply too high. Instead, you need to do several gentle aerobraking passes to get down to a very low orbit in order to bleed off as much energy as possible before your final re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The final re-entry has to be as gradual as possible. At the end it will still inevitably get steep and abrupt, but don\u0027t make things worse than they have to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Consider adding a large retro-rocket burn to assist during the peak heating phase. When the FAR dynamic stress level (Q) gets above 40,000, you run an elevated risk of things going boom (especially if you get even the tiniest bit off-axis), so I keep my eye on the Q-meter and fire up a huge retro-rocket to help slow things down once the Q forces get into the upper 30 thousands. The retro rocket combined with the atmospheric drag slows you down very quickly. This takes more fuel and mass than a purely passive re-entry, but for a really large lander I\u0027ve found it helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T04:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 04:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T08:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completed exactly this mission.
