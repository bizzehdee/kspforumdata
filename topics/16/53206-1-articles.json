So, here\u0027s what I\u0027ve gathered. The game renders the surface textures up to 160km, slowing things down a lot. So best to put your station above that. It\u0027s easier to keep the ship that needs to be refueled at 2.5km from the station, so it doesn\u0027t get rendered / physics applied, as it also slows things down. Instead park it in the same orbit 3km away, and use a ferry to transfer fuel between.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T23:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the career mode, with the lack of real stationparts, I designed a small ship that I can lauch to refuel crafts, rather than a station that the craft docks to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasier to dock a small tanker to a big rocket than a big rocket to a big station\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
