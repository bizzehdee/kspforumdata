It doesn\u0027t happen with 1 hitchhiker, gotta have 2 to get the message. Connecting fuel tanks doesn\u0027t help. Fuel lines won\u0027t attach. Am I missing something, or is this a bug? I received a contract to build a base that can support ten Kerbals...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T10:33:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"noxgandhi","CreatedById":145050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T11:29:41Z","Content":"tried to reconstruct using every type of pod - not getting the report you described though. are you running an up to date version? any mods which might be responsible for this?"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T11:33:34Z","Content":"Random thought but do you also need to include fuel supplies for the base in the same way that you do for some space stations? If so, it might be the completion of your living space requirements once the second Hitchhiker is attached that\u0027s triggering a second message to remind you about the fuel requirement.\n\nOr more likely, it might be a bug. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:25:04Z","Content":"Thanks for trying to replicate. If the version on Steam is up to date, then so am I. I have no mods. It is not a requirement of my contract. Windows 8.1 \n\nI decided to launch anyway. We\u0027ll see if I can complete the contract. Funny thing is, this was the first time I have ever tried to use fuel lines to do asparagus staging. Just before I thought I was ready to launch, I checked the engineer\u0027s report and found this message. Of course I thought it was something I had done with the fuel lines and spent far too long rechecking my plumbing. Finally I just started tearing pieces off the ship until all I had left was a pod on top of 2 HHs, and still the message was there, but it went away when I took away one HH. Came back if I reattached it. The pod was the 1 kerbal octagon pod. iirc it is called a lander can.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T12:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:30:09Z","Content":"It sounds like an interesting bug.
