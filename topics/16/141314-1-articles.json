I launch almost all my ships straight up, and they all do tend to drift a tiny bit retrograde (west). So my ascents tend to be a little more vertical than one might expect, because the drift counteracts Kerbin\u0027s initial rotational velocity during the burn. I use the effect to fine-tune my Mun/Minmus intercepts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
