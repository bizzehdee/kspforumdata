Whenever I\u0027m flying to other planets I\u0027ve not used any calculators (or calculated it myself). I\u0027ve just use the maneuver nodes and gotten to where I wanted by trial and error. Sometimes my kerbals have spent years (decades?) in space awaiting the right window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I want to do things the right way. I\u0027m not maths genius, nor do I have interest in calculating all this stuff so I\u0027m using the tools that are available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m attempting to get to Dres using the Protractor tool and the Olex calculator.
