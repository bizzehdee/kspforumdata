For instance, place a small ladder section on the corner of a ledge tilted 45\\* inward. This will allow the kerbal to climb up onto the ledge.\n\n![ladder1_zpsknwp2gjm.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/ladder1_zpsknwp2gjm.jpg)\n\n![ladder2_zpsl0y2zo3s.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/ladder2_zpsl0y2zo3s.jpg)\n\n Best,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T17:07:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 05:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"SymbolicFrank","CreatedById":138922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T17:01:05Z","Content":"Thanks.\n\nIt\u0027s mostly, that the main design decision of all my landers/rockets seems to be: will the ladders work?

I have to design them around that, which is frustrating.\n\nI always make sure my ladders extend just a little below the level of my landing legs, because the actually ladder doesn\u0027t have a collider (The retractable ones) they can penetrate the ground, the top of the ladder is right next to the door of the command pod. Sometimes I have to use multiple ladders, also, while on a ladder, if you press SHFIT\u002B\u003Cdirection\u003E Your kerbal will look in that direcion, and if you then press SPACE they will jump onto a ladder placed next to them.\u003C/direction\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"SymbolicFrank","CreatedById":138922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T17:18:25Z","Content":"If Kerbals moved from each ladder onto any other and multiple retracting ladders would be automatically at the same radius as the others (extending exactly into one other), it would be no problem. But that only tends to work with a few of the pods and if there is only a single fuel tank underneath.\n\nEven placing the retractable ladders just beneath the pod is a problem, you really have to add multiple fixed ones around most transitions.\n\nIf they would just transition from one ladder collider to the next, all would be well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T17:21:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SymbolicFrank**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T18:33:36Z","Content":"I would love to see Kerbals able to move sideways on a ladder too.
