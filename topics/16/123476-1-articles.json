And if you do your plane change to match Min on the outbound leg instead of doing it in LKO you will save a lot also (and it\u0027s not always needed as someone else pointed out. Lots of times I just burn a little normal or anti-normal to get the intercept without matching planes and then take care of it in the capture. With Min\u0027s low gravity, all that is cheap compared to Mun. The thing that keeps me from using Min more is the 5-8 day trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T05:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to Danny\u0027s answer.
