I am curious because I have a space station with about 10 kerbals on it and need some way to get them off without deorbiting the station. I use to be able to do it in the older builds with the BOLT-ON add on, but it doesn\u0027t work with .20.

The probe core controls everything and the hitchhiker is NOT populated automatically. Gives you tons of space and you can reenter and land the thing safely provided you keep the landing gentle. Mine slows down with two drogue chutes, lands on two radial chutes, and has six of the heavy duty landing legs. Just keep in mind that you have to keep the probe core powered, and it\u0027s a fairly heavy hab module to be chucking up and around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zanzibar196","CreatedById":67228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T22:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022flyingskippy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022flyingskippy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there anyway with .20 to launch a rocket with an unmanned pod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you mean something like what this video shows?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHygHYgYlJs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it is definitely possible to do that in .20... also, you could just send up a hitchhiker container if you want to do 4 at a time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flyingskippy","CreatedById":73436,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T01:17:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe first capsule you install that CAN have crew WILL have crew, at least until the next update, when that whole system is being reworked.
