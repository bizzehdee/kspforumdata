The RT-10, BACC, and the massive srb thing are all worse now, and the RT-5 is useless for all intents and purposes unless you are making kinetic missiles to shoot at stuff (works wonders for that purpose).\n\nThen again, it takes less dV to get into orbit, and id assume it was like the engine ISP changes made to balance the rockets and not make it single SRB to orbit game."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:02:44Z","Content":"I think Kickback always had 2500 solid fuel and 650 kN thrust but its burn time and Isp have definitely been reduced.\n\nBurn time is now ~49s in atmosphere (according to KER) but was 65s (according to [the not-updated wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Solid_rocket_booster))"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:34:43Z","Content":"![OkOmLZF.png](http://i.imgur.com/OkOmLZF.png)\n\nSame fuel quantity.

So if the SRB is set (via tweakable thurst limiter and propellant) to run for 30 seconds, it will run for 30 seconds. Off the pad it will have a lower thrust, and that will increase as the SRB climbs to lower pressures, and higher ISP values.\n\nIn 0.90 and prior, the thrust was fixed, and the Fuel Flow would be modified by the ISP. So, if the SRB was clamped on the ground, and forced to burn at the lower ISP, it might run for 25 seconds, where-as if it was allowed to climb, it would start using less fuel per second as it went up, so the total run time could be 35 or 45 seconds depending on where it was activated, and how quickly it climbed to near peak ISP values. The higher it went, the higher the ISP, lower fuel flow, longer burn time."}]}
