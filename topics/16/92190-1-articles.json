If you transmit a second time, for most experiments you\u0027ll find that the science for transmitting gets extremely small, around 1% or so. Only when it reads 100% (For EVA reports and Crew reports, as far as I know), will you get full science for transmitting. Eventually (From memory, around the third time), it\u0027ll just give you 0.0 science for transmitting, even if you still get science for recovery.
