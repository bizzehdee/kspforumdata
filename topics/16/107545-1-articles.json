Didn\u0027t aerobrake much but could not engage time warp until above 1000km with that same message. Not only that, the craft did actually have some acceleration force acting on it, and was still reducing my orbit up to 1000km, albeit very slowly.\n\nPlus, when returning from a Duna mission, I did the same when intercepting kerbin. Dropped the craft below 50km on kerbin\u0027s atmosphere for a little aerobraking, and couldnt time warp (just physic warp) till above some 400km or so, even though Kerbin\u0027s atmospheres ends at 70km. \n\nSeems like a bug to me, triggered when crossing the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Jenteb07","CreatedById":58646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T12:16:39Z","Content":"Yesterday I had the same thing, it happened to me after I installed \u0022Stock bug fixes modules\u0022.
