That\u0027s mostly going to be the time that kerbals will be without a way of generating power, and therefore they will need to consume a reasonable amount of charge without draining batteries completely. Whatever value you choose should force players to build vehicles with electric charge storage\u00A0in mind, but it shouldn\u0027t be excessive so that something like a simple Mun base would need several tonnes worth of batteries to survive a night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T04:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222798536\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476231609\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162932\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Benji13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/11/2016 at 5:20 PM, Benji13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello.
