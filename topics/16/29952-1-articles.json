Wiki says impact tolerance at 50ms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem is i guess my plane is heavy due to all the engines and fuel , i can get to only 160ms any lower and my nose drops and i go straight in , Probably should have put more wing surfaces . So really there is no way to land it \u0022plane like \u0022:S \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei guess i could full throttle and point vertically up and then slowly descend like a rocket down and the flip forwards . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei dont know what else to do . any ideas are welcome .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T07:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHorizontal speed isn\u0027t an issue if you are landing on perfectly level surface, such as the runway. What actually kills you is the vertical and lateral speed. Vertical speed you can gauge by the instruments. For a heavy plane, you should be under 5m/s. It\u0027s a lot easier to control at slower speeds, but ultimately, just matter of piloting skill. If all else is perfect, you can land going 160m/s without crashing your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things are rarely perfect, however. Any lateral movement can cause the wheels to snap off. This can be caused by either a slight crawl on approach or due to any flex your plane has resulting in parts becoming slightly mis-aligned. Again, at slower speeds, this isn\u0027t as big of a deal. But at 160m/s everything has to be perfect to do the landing. To improve your chances, add struts. The more rigid you can make the plane, the easier it should be. You should also add some struts to the landing gear pods themselves. See, they can also flex under a heavy plane, and then they can be slightly misaligned. At high speeds, that can cause them to snap off, and the rest is obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you might also be trying to land on terrain that\u0027s less than level. Any bumps in the ground will convert your horizontal speed into vertical and lateral. That means that each terrain will have a maximum landing speed. At 160m/s you should not be landing anywhere other than landing strip at KSC or the nearby island. You might be able to do the landing on terrain surrounding KSC or the second space center. They are both rather level, but I\u0027ve noticed that even these have some minor bumps, and hitting one of these at 160m/s would be catastrophic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there are options for reducing landing speed. The reason you have high approach speed is low angle of attack requiring high speed to maintain lift. First, you can try shifting CoG or CoL to allow for better control. But that\u0027s not always possible. Failing that, consider adding lifters. Place some jets underneat the wings or body, wherever you have the room. Try to put them as low as you can without risking impact with ground. The plane should be very nearly balanced on these. A bit forward of CoG could actually help you to increase angle of attack as well. This can bring down landing speed from 160m/s to something closer to 70-80 easily, and that\u0027s way more landable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more tips, you can try looking at the old land speed challenge threads. Building a land speeder has many of the same prerequisits as building a plane that can land at high speeds.
