I would love to be able to land, but that won\u0027t work either. there is no surface to land on, just a super destructive ocean. I\u0027ve tried lowering KAS winches down into the sea, but they just get destroyed. i\u0027ve tried using Hooligan labs ballast tanks, but the ship just sinks and explodes anyway. are there any mods that prevent this? anything that makes a joolian surface or lets me save in the atmosphere? any help would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davieholgate","CreatedById":78564,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T22:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are open to mods, try this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hooligan-labs-airship-parts-and-plugin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hooligan-labs-airship-parts-and-plugin/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the wiki it says you CAN put Kerbals on the surface, but all craft are crushed or devoured by the Kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: try making a space station then, since it may also be impossible to save while using balloons too, sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-09T22:59:38Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2014 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by davieholgate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETrying not to be a complete idiot, read full OP and realised how stupid i was.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T23:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a how-to kind of a question, so moved to the how-to sub-forum.
