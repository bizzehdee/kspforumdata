When orbiting on the nightside or sitting on the pad during the night from some angles my ships would vanish. - like ghost out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Giw4hLq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Giw4hLq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty stealthy huh? So its been happening in the last two versions of ksp - even before contracts and science! so I just assumed it was my graphics card or something...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway fast-forward to today. I have ksp 64-bit installed and a load of mods and the situation is getting worse and a few other bugs are creeping in: When I come back to some of my ships in orbit or mun bases the 1x6 solar panels look broken - right clicking on them show they are taking in sunlight perfectly fine. I select retract and they jump to being fully out and then close - reopen them without problems - come back to them later they are broken again (looks like they are retracted but at an odd angle) - its happened sometimes on the large panels too but thats very intermittent. Then my engines started to act up - for no apparent reason one random engine will start to spaz out and sending my ships in a spin - I get clicking/static noises from the speakers - setting its twin to 70% thrust seems to solve it but who wants to fly around on 70% thrust!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought to myself lets solve all these so I can get back to playing this really really awesome game (coming up to a year anniversary!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I check my graphics card and download the latest drivers for it. Then I download the latest version of KSP - 32 bit version this time. Extract it and run it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a simple rocket in to orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet it go around the back of the planet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eobserve it for any fading\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problems - works perfectly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall the latest Mechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the above with a mechjeb unit attached to the craft (old one still in orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno problems - works perfectly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the same for KAS \u0026amp; Module Manager\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno problems- works perfectly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstall Kerbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the ghosting. I knew it was a problem straight-away as the border around the KSC was black (the grassy ramp between the center and the flat terrain) and a newly launched rocket faded around the back of kerbin. So I thought HA-ha resolved but .. but Kerbonite is new and I\u0027ve had this problem for agggeeess. soooo... must be a texture or something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemove all the textures from kerbonite - still getting the problem. Uninstalled kerbonite altogether and .... still ... getting the problem :/ what? Remove everything from the save (bear in mind that I\u0027m exiting out of the program, removing something and coming back in for each uninstall). So now I\u0027ve removed everything back to the original KSP and it is still happening .. okay odd it must be something to do with the save file. So I exit back to the main menu and open up a brand new game. Problem has gone. So its gotta be something with the problem save right? Fire up the problem save and now its fine again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now I\u0027m back to a very odd problem. I\u0027m gonna delete this copy and try again - this time leaving out kerbanite and see what happens. But has anyone come across this before? Can someone shed some light on what is the cause? Where to look?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T20:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you already found the problem.
