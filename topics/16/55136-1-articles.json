I can either make an insanely maneuverable plane the flips out at the touch of a button and slams into the ground try to do its own aerobatic maneuvers, or it has a turn radius about the size of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, how can I make a maneuverable and stable plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, by the way, the sooner I get help, the less deaths Jeb experiences...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxjetterxx","CreatedById":37766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T01:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey RocketTurtle.

It seems like you\u0027ve seen the results of running to either extreme. What you want to do is to take a stable plane, and make it less stable; put the control surfaces further forward than they are. Then, if it\u0027s still not maneuverable enough, move the fins even further forward.

The big difficulty is trying to maintain a high turn rate during a normal turn. Pull back on the stick all you like, the plane will only turn so hard and then the nose will start flopping back down, and begin oscillating. Try to do this in a real plane and you\u0027ll stall... but KSP doesn\u0027t have stalling, hence this odd behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving all of your mass centralized (minimizing your moment of inertia) and just spamming control surfaces front and back can go a long way to overcoming this.
