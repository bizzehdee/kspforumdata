Anywhere except when I am orbiting earth, loading a saved game triggers an overheating off all parts of my ship and it explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you save, go to the Space center, or go to The Space center and save, then jump to Tracking Station to fly your ship, without having to load the game, if it takes too long, overheating is triggered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just jump very quickly to see what happen and was lucky to get the ship just a few seconds before it was too hot. It\u0027s a question of time, I don\u0027t know what is happening, but sure, if you have to load a game, you\u0027re going to overheat.....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeadly Re entry is not in my Game Data folder\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-02T19:45:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2021 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by gilflo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-02T19:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, that does not happen to me. What other mods are installed? If this is easily reproducible then let a ship explode and then \u00A0get the logs and upload them somewhere like Dropbox where they can be accessed by others.
