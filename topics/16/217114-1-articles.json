However, if I steer too much away from prograde, this thing flips and cannot be recovered. it appears to be aerodinamically unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would blame the wings being that much forward, but the center of lift is in the right place. doesn\u0027t look right at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, if I don\u0027t do any sudden turn, I can fly up nicely. The flat part behind looks ugly and drags heavily, but it doesn\u0027t create any real issues. The really bad part starts when i ditch the wings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022cIYu3gT.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cIYu3gT.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the rocket that ensues. I removed the fairing to see it better. Well, this thing flips immediately. The flaps in the back are a latest addition to try and prevent that, but they do no good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, I can see that the center of mass is shifted in the back of the rocket, which can create problems. on the other hand, I have a large flat surface, which should make drag. the front is very aerodinamic. and I have just added a bunch of flaps. I also have a powerful engine (it needs to be, the planet has 2.2 g) with a lot of gimbaling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose I could try to fix the center of mass, but it\u0027s chancy. The upper stages are meant to be discarded from the top, so I can keep the engine (a necessity to get the high deltaV and thrust required to leave Derbin); but they are used in vacuum. The first stage, with the vector, is dropped while still within a significant atmosphere; I\u0027d really not have to tilt the rocket and discard a tank from the front in that condition - plus, I\u0027d lose the aerodinamic tip. Aside from that, I have done what I can to minimize the center of mass issue. No good; I have launched a lot of horrible payloads without fairings, and this looks to be the most unstable of all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt some point I discovered that the fairing wasn\u0027t working properly and the things inside were still causing drag. I fixed the issue - the screenshot below shows, I am selecting a bunch of stuff inside the fairing to check that their drag is 0. still no good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022qCKrC5Z.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qCKrC5Z.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat rockomax tank in the back has an abnormally high drag; it\u0027s the same drag of the backwards fairing, which has an open node in the back. so it\u0027s like that tank has an open back. which it hasn\u0027t. I can\u0027t understand what\u0027s causing this, but it\u0027s drag behind the center of mass, so it should actually help with not flipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022GXxyl9T.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/GXxyl9T.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis final shot shows the moment I release the wings. the rocket flips upwards immediately. resistance is still 0 inside the fairing, staging didn\u0027t mess with it. yet there is one big red line starting inside the fairing, as if there was something actually messing up that could be responsible. however, I selected each and every part inside that fairing, and couldn\u0027t find anything with any drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose I could try to move the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E forward, though - as I explained - it would cause a lot of other problems.
