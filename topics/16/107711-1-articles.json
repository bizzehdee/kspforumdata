If there\u0027s no Kerbal, you can\u0027t control it. Mechjeb is not a probe core.\n\nAs for a smarter way to do it: You can use [ and ] to switch between ships in the area\n\nAnd a smarter way to transfer Kerbals: Click on the hatch. You get a list of the Kerbals in the associated Command pod, with a button EVA and Transfer next to it. If you click Transfer, it highlights all the available commandpods. If you click on one, the Kerbal transfers to it. No need for EVA"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:35:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So - I built this three stage monstrosity.

No idea why though...\n\n1) Click on the crew hatch of the Mk1 pod while Jeb is inside. A small window should pop up displaying his name and two buttons, \u0022Transfer\u0022 and \u0022EVA\u0022. Click transfer, then click on the lander pod. \n\n2) First, don\u0027t take offense to this if you can help it. Can you confirm that it was in no way user error? Was the unit actually in there? Did you visually confirm it was there? I see that you have mechjeb windows up in those screenshots, and if the only unit was inside the service bay on top of the lander capsule, it would go with the capsule. If you have two units, try removing the one from the upper stage and see if you still get functions. If not, try attaching it elsewhere. \n\n3) There are definitely more efficient ways, but I don\u0027t know what tech you have available. If that gets you there, then it\u0027s good enough. \n\n4) Keep an eye on your TWR. If it gets too close to 2 (I try to keep it around 1.5), your engines are unlikely to throttle down fast enough, even if Mechjeb cuts throttle entirely. This usually leads to an overshoot, and the autopilot may try to correct for it, but it screws with the encounter. It\u0027s not the fault of the Mechjeb unit, it\u0027s a function of the engine throttle."},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:39:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 4) Keep an eye on your TWR.

Right click the engine, and reduce the thrust limiter to a more managable number. Especially usefull for high TWR ships where you want fine control"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelvf","CreatedById":21146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:42:12Z","Content":"It \\*might\\* be an error...

You\u0027ve build a nice vessel. I\u0027d probably attach the lifter below the lander for reduced drag (it should fit to the two outrigger fuel tanks); and I for one wouldn\u0027t even bother with a dedicated lander and docking, just land and return on the last stage and be done with it.

No idea why though...\n\nFor multi-stage craft with MechJeb, mind what stage your active engines are in when doing anything where MechJeb has to calculate a burn (transfers, especially landings, etc.). Unless it\u0027s been rectified, you\u0027re best off making sure the active engines MJ will use for the burn, and only those engines, are in the \u0022bottom\u0022 stage."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelvf","CreatedById":21146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T21:37:36Z","Content":"Thanks for all the tips.
