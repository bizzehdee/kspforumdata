Set the docking port you want to dock with as your target and just use docking mode to keep the prograde marker on the pink circle on the navball. Easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough its hard for some It still baffles me at the difficulty people have.

If you don\u0027t want to use a mod, make sure your RCS thrusters are positioned as close to the CoM as possible, taking into account where that will be when your fuel tanks aren\u0027t empty.
