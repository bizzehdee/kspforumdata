When you reach about 100 m/s, turn over 10ish degrees to the east and turn off your SAS. Let the rocket get to 300 m/s and allow it to turn on it\u0027s own. It should have about a 45 degree angle at 10 kilometres. At around 12 to 15 km, start gaining speed, and a lot of it. You want a pretty shallow trajectory, so you can get plenty of speed before reaching apoapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s as far as I\u0027ve gotten.

I suspect that KER\u0027s figures were a bit off due to it being unable to calculate the true benefits of asparagus staging and/or the immediate dropping of boosters and tanks. I should have taken screenshots at each stage to check the numbers, but I was a bit busy trying to keep things on track.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in 1.0.5. what works best?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 - 100% thrust off launchpad. At about 200m/s reduce thrust so that speed rises slowly up to 300m/s* as you climb to about 8-10,000m altitude. If you\u0027re using SRBs, you might find that your LF engines are barely ticking over at this stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - start gravity turn straight off the launchpad.

Some people say that if you wait to get up to about 100 m/s then it becomes a bit more pedictable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - follow prograde down to about 50\u00B0 at 8,000m or 45\u00B0 at 10-11,000m**, then slam thrust up to 100%.
