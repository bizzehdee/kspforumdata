So it is not fixed to the same orientation as when you launch, like a gyroscope, but always points toward down in terms of gravity? I guess this must be true since the brown half always seems to point toward the ground say whether i am on kerbin or mun also because if you keep the same attitude when in orbit the ball rotates as you go around the planet.\n\nSo how does the game decide how to set the orientation of it when you enter a different sphere of infuence? Setting \u0027down\u0027 to the the center of mass of the planet only sets two axis, how is the other determined? This confuses me greatly when trying to takeoff from mun or whatever to go in a specific direction. This also would mean the navball for two different craft in different points in the same orbit would be oriented in different directions right? \n\nI am confused because I thought it was like a gyroscope with orientation set a launch but that cannot be the case..."},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T18:48:57Z","Content":"Blue always points up, the red line (heading 000) always points north and heading 090 always points east."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T19:08:38Z","Content":"The center of the blue area is radial, relative to the body, orange being anti-radial.

And it has always bugged me that there is no way in the game to plan your trajectory before you launch.\n\nA [reference frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference) (RF) is a system of coordinates tied to reference points (like North, Vernal, mainbody center), so the coordinates are uniquely fixed. The origin of the RF can be located with your ship, and that\u0027s the case with the navball RF, so angles are given in relation to the ship attitude. Hope that helps, as the idea of the RF as \u0022a point on the surface of a sphere...\u0022 implies there is still confusion.\n\nAbout the \u0022inertial navball\u0022, what you wish seems to be a different thing. An inertial navball would be tied to an [inertial RF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference), that implies no acceleration of sorts. Rotating RFs are never inertial, so what you\u0027re asking is for a RF that has a fixed orientation in space. The RF used in astronomy, that is oriented by the ecliptic plane and the vernal point, is inertial, and KSP also uses a similar RF to keep the position af everything orbiting Sun.\n\nNow, your intent is to launch to a specific orbit, therefore to match specific [orbital parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements). In particular, you\u0027ll want to launch at the correct inclination when the ship is aligned with the plane of the future orbit. Such a plane is univocally identified with two directions, such as the vector to the periapsis and the vector to the ascending node. Those vectors are certainly univocally described in the inertial reference frame (centered on the mainbody of the orbit), but to use them you need to see where they are. The inertial navball would provide the fixed direction in space to define those vectors coordinates (for the ascending node, you just need its longitude, as the latitude is 0 by definition; for the periapsis, it would be simpler to use a point at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from the ascending node longitude, so its latitude would be = inclination). By those two directions a unique circle can be drawn over the navball, and your ship position in relation to that circle would give how close it is to launch on the correct orbit. Now, on a \u0022local\u0022 navball (like the standard one in KSP) you would observe the circle rotate in relation to your ship \u0022fixed\u0022 position; on an inertial navball you would observe your ship location to move (with the body rotation) and the circle stay fixed. In either case, you have to meet the alignment of ship location and circle to launch, and that is trivial only when launching from KSC (almost 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 latitude, and 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 axial tilt), as you launch when aligned with the ascending node.\n\nBut, when is the ascending node (AN) aligned in the case of KSC? just when the AN longitude (always sidereal) is the same as KSC longitude (sidereal). The longitude at KSC is a linear function of time: 360\\*(UT/21599.91201454)\u002B(90\u002B74.4) (the latter from the initial rotation at epoch=0 of Kerbin and the geographic longitude of KSC; hope to not have inverted the values as had no time to verify). Ok, so known the time (UT), you can compute the sidereal longitude, and when that matches the AN longitude, that\u0027s the correct time. Easier than creating an inertial RF navball and trying to use it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T12:35:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Setting \u0027down\u0027 to the the center of mass of the planet only sets two axis, how is the other determined?\n\nWell, imagine you\u0027re in orbit - you\u0027re travelling forward in (some) direction - that\u0027s the pro/retro grade axis determined.
