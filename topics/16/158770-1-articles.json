Those FAT wings have long lever arms on them, and a large force with a large lever arm can break their joints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are basically two answers: struts (or autostruts), to make the joint stronger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr use multiple shorter wings (perhaps clipped inside each other), becase they have shorter lever arms to their Centers of Lift. Does a 200% tweakscaled FAT wing have 14 points of lift? 3 BigS wings should give you 15 points, IIRC. Then you just have to make them look nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t use rigid attachment, becaue that makes the joints more brittle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-05T23:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the right spot. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E How about pics of the plane in question?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
