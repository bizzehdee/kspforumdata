Duna\u0027s orbit is not actually circular, so the precise transit will vary slightly depending on exactly when you are launching. The calculator doesn\u0027t take that into account. It\u0027s also really hard to place your outgoing maneuver marker on exactly the right spot, and to tug the little adjuster arms precisely. But if \u003Cem\u003Enothing \u003C/em\u003Eyou do is creating an intersect, then as others have said, you are probably missing the precise window by a few days in time.
