I have wasted hours trying to create a stock NASA shuttle work-alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there are a few problems I already understand. She\u0027s currently woefully under-fuelled, for one thing. I also haven\u0027t had the chance to test the OMS or the RCS, both of which I\u0027ll need to get the ship above the atmosphere to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s just it - I\u0027m doing something systematically wrong, but what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design process was as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Create an orbiter with viceless flight characteristics, with jet engines. Check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Make the jet engines jettisonable, and test its glide characteristics. Check (although I am yet to test it with the OMS pods and RCS system added; that\u0027s something I should do!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Angle the SSMEs so that the stack can launch in an upright direction. Check (with extreme difficulty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where I\u0027ve run into strife. The launch now goes generally reasonably well (albeit drifting a little) until the SRBs are jettisoned. It\u0027s from there that things start to go rough. The orbiter/ET combination start to wildly tumble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know that the Shuttle must do something to prevent this kind of tumbling (which obviously comes from unbalanced engines), but what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file is downloadable \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/johnos-shuttle-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance - I am fully expecting that I made every error known to Shuttlebuilderkind. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T12:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell yes, its the unbalanced engines. Im at work so cant test-fly it. But from the picture at that link I can see you\u0027ve angled the shuttle engines to balance against the srb\u0027s. Once you drop those the thrust is way off the centre of mass for the shuttle/ET combo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality the shuttles engines do a lot of vectoring, true. Once the srbs are gone though your engines would need to actually be tilted the other way to compensate for the off-centre thrust, gimballing only goes so far. Strip the srb\u0027s inside the vab, then check CoM and CoT to see its characteristics in that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would be to lose the angling of the shuttle engines and instead balance the initial stage of the launch by moving the srb\u0027s out of over-all symmetry to offset the thrust/weight of the shuttle (so they sit a little toward the same side as the shuttle, try and bring them closer to your starting CoM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with these alterations you are going to be off-centre once the srb\u0027s drop, though the neutral shuttle engine angle will allow them to vector modestly to allow for the ET weight. The remaining control needed to maintain vertical flight is probably gonna come down to SAS and RCS along with whatever lift the shuttle control surfaces can still provide (thin air).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont sweat it. Shuttles are hard. Mainly because as soon as you start adopting realworld designs, you have to deal with the fact that they are, by nature, all unbalanced as sin. That and NASA\u0027s own tech doesnt perfectly lineup with ours, nor does ksp work quite like the realworld.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T12:56:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T12:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is almost certainly the weight of the SRB\u0027s that keep it balanced, as soon as you drop them the center of mass shifts, this results in the center of thrust not going through the center of mass. The shuttle would need to gimbal its engines to get the center of thrust through the center of mass. However this is where the problems lie. In the stock game the engines don\u0027t have a very good gimbal range. You could try to add a large amount of reaction wheels to counter it.
