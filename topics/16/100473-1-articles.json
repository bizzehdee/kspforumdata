It seems that my dock was useless because I just wanted to transfer fuel from one station to another so I could send that to Mun. But when I ALT\u002BRight click it appears the option of fuel transfer but the IN and OUT buttons appear just for 1 milisecond and then stay blocked. (First the button look blue and then just like plain text). And even if I click there or something nothing happens.\n\nI need your help or my mission would be stupid.\n\nThank you very much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T03:09:15Z","Content":"Are you playing in career mode?
