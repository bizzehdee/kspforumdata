And it could even take off again! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after a long flight and a rather difficult landing you exit the cockpit to stretch your legs and get some fresh air. And when you are ready to get back in and take off you find out that your aircraft rolled away and there is no way you can catch it. Now you are stranded and waiting for rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of this thread is how can you stop a plane after a landing so it doesn\u0027t roll away? Is there a button I\u0027m missing that can toggle brakes like SAS? Or can you attach something to your ship to stop the wheels from spinning?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T16:13:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edouble tap the brakes key (b by default) to engage the parking brake.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Qumefox","CreatedById":43197,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T17:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, hold down B to apply brakes, and as endless said, double tap B to engage (or disengage) the parking brakes when stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T18:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may find that setting the handbrakes while on the runway is quite fiddly, but it works fine on the ground, it\u0027s a small but annoying bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T18:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find the double-tap for the parking brake kind of finicky, so depending on your design, you might also be able to simply retract the landing gear and let the plane rest directly on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Muffin","CreatedById":55618,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T20:16:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I feel kinda stupid.
