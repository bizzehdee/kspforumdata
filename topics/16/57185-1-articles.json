I know money isnt yet a factor in our space programs (i guess the kerbal government gave us all a blank cheque), but when money does become an issue, getting our science done cheaply may be a serious consideration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso i designed two solutions, the first being my usual munar science lander/return craft, with all the science apparatus on board and enough fuel to take me from Munar insertion (where the final launcher stage leaves me, similar to the Apollo missions) to return, including everything i would need, mainly power, and the total cost racked up to just shy of 26k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen i designed a second solution, using one command module for the munar insertion and trans-Kerbin ejection, and a seperate lander, with the science apparatus on, capable of simply landing and returning to the CSM after completing the science. in stock KSP, there is a fatal flaw in this design, whereby the CSM command pod cannot store all the science data to be returned, so by using a couple EVA Data Storage Pods, created by Talisar and available \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/radial-experiment-storage-container/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E i could transfer the science from the lander to the CSM pod to be hauled home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis solution, though using far less fuel overall, required an RCS system for docking procedures, and two docking ports, all costing moolah, ending up with a total cost of just over 35k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe big difference is partly down to the extortionate price of the mk1 lander can, which costs 2600 (compared to the mk1 pod which costs 600), so we can safely assume that teh cost would be 2k less when money becomes an issue and the can is appropriatley priced, but that still leaves a 7000 [insert Kerbal currency here] difference in cost, in FAVOUR of the simpler, less efficient solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, my question is, is there a benefit to using multiple vessels for a mission in this way, other than using less fuel overall, (though your dv is not necessarily increased because you have the mass of two pods, two engines, RCS system etc added on) in place of using one simple craft built efficiently enough to perform the same mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor those wondering, the .craft files are \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./folder/zk9503sf7kh58sh,1zhup2yzijc43d1/shared\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. you will need Kerbal engineer redux and the data storage containers installed, otherwise all is stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks peeps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T16:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how it really boils down in KSP, but from the standpoint of overall dV use in real crewed space programs, it usually saves dV when one has the separate components of surface to orbit flight, orbit to orbit, and then orbit to surface; especially when those steps can be reversed for a 2 way mission. Of course on a 2 way trip the final 2 components may be combined (the capsule jettisoning for a parachute landing, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify: the launcher for everything (or SSTO to dock with orbiting interplanetary ship), the interplanetary ship and the destination lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, my interplanetary missions have been of the \u0022launch that behemoth into orbit\u0022 variety. The interplanetary portion is mainly a dock-able set of fuel tanks and engines. My lander is also the command module when attached to the interplanetary ship. Once I get serious about Career mode and Science, I can see that your questions will be interesting in relation to my approaches to interplanetary travel. I find Kerbal Engineer to be very useful (and MechJeb too) for such mission design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T16:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is one example of which I can think of already now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as Biomes on Duna (and other planets/moons) are unlocked, it makes sense to split a mission into 2 stages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

The fuel to intercept and dock back up is about equal to what it would take to perform an atmospheric braking orbit for kerbin. On top of that, if you have side engines, they work well to have a wide based and stable lander. Really the main part between the Appollo missions and KSP is this fuel usage and support equipment. The orbiter had longer term survival, alot more fuel just to make a landing, plus all the electronics necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
