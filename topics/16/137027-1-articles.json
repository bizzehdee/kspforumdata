I am trying to assemble an orbital fuel station. I\u0027m using a spoke and wheel style. One six point hub with six arms. I have hub adapters on each arm with a long structure linking the arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I have run into is I\u0027ve assembled the parts in the VAB and they all fit perfectly. But in orbit there is a huge gap between one hub cap and the connecting structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I missing something obvious? Why would there be such an obvious gap when in the VAB they all fit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Oh yes I\u0027m using KSP 1.0.5 on a windows pc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-15T22:00:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2016 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Up The Ying Yang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EInfo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T23:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222515953\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137027\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460757494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125944\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Up The Ying Yang\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Up The Ying Yang said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I missing something obvious?

If you have section A on the station and are trying to place section B, section B will only attach to one place, either the arm from the center or to section A, but not both because that would give to two parent parts, and that\u0027s not allowed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason it looks right in the VAB is because there are no physics forces acting on it in there, but as soon as physics start it deforms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne solution is to stitch it together with strut connectors (struts, fuel lines, and docking ports are special exceptions to the \u0022no two parents\u0022 rule).
