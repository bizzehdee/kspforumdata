That\u0027s basic aerodynamics. At any particular angle-of-attack, the bigger wing has more drag. But it needs a lower angle-of-attack to get the same lift. And if you\u0027re flying nose-high the fuselage will generate more drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a slight rotation of the wings will pay off. How much? You would have to test, but least drag at cruising speed will have the nose and prograde markers aligned and on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe classic short-wing high-speed design is the F-104 Starfighter.

Drag for aero surfaces is calculated off of their lift rating, and lift rating is calculated based on physical part dimension. There may be some slight variance in lift/area, but it will be minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat that all means is that all the wing parts are equal in the sense that if you build a wing out of several parts that is the same size as a single wing part, you will have the same lift and drag rating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also true that radially mounted parts are subject to the windstream, even if hidden in a nosecone. You\u0027ll have to hide those things in a service bay or cargo bay when possible. Wings are a special case of this though, because they don\u0027t use the cube values, but a scaled product of their lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel in the wing does not affect their \u0022wing\u0022 properties (lift or drag). Using them is better than adding extra side tanks, but is a matter of preference if you want to put the fuel in the fuselage or not.
