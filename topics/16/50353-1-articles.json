To do this sort of stuff you\u0027re far better off making maneuver nodes. That way, you can play with it. Drag the prograde/retrograde markers around and see what your resultant orbit does. Drag the node back and forth and see what happens when it\u0027s earlier or later. Once you get what you want, just aim where the maneuver node tells you and burn when it tells you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boonestorm","CreatedById":89875,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T08:01:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Horseman said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft and right are highly misleading here because they depend on where you are coming from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPass behind a planet on its orbit to accelerate, and in front of it to decelerate. Lower periapsis=more effect (except there is an atmosphere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite sure that burning at periapsis will give you the greatest return for your delta v (as always, because of the Orbeth effect). However, as you can not apply all the thrust at one single moment, I suggest timing your burn in such a way that you burn equally before and after periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe direction of the burn would be prograde for acceleration, and retrograde for deceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoonestorm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-24T08:03:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2013 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Boonestorm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
