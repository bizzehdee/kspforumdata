We\u0027re having a blast roaming space. We just arrived in the gravitational field of Jool and landed on Pol. I *assumed* that all planets would contain at leas a small concentration of ore, but Pol doesn\u0027t seem to have a gram in its crust. :S This made me wonder.... are there more planets which don\u0027t have the precious ore melange?\n\nI made a small list of ore-containing planets/moons that Bill visited so far: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E Moho\n\u003E \n\u003E Gilly\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbin\n\u003E \n\u003E Mun\n\u003E \n\u003E Minmus\n\u003E \n\u003E Duna\n\u003E \n\u003E Ike\n\u003E \n\u003E Dres \n\ndoes any of you know if there are other celestial bodies that contain ore?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T05:20:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xendelaar**"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:36:38Z","Content":"All of them do."},{"CreatedByName":"xendelaar","CreatedById":139535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:46:03Z","Content":"My scanner isn\u0027t able to find any traces of ore (0\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B7 threshold) on pol.

I think the problem lies in the scanner, as you already mentioned. The system works a bit weird: The ore concentration of a given survace relies almost only on its biome, whithin a biome there is only minimal difference. The scanner\u0027s cutoff takes \u0027about\u0027\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AE the highest concentration on the celestial body, then, if you have e.g. 50% cutoff set, the map will show the area with more than \u0027about\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AE\u0027 50% of this maximum, the map view is very unaccurate. I assume the empty map view could mean the only 4 biomes of Pol all have about the same concentration, and it does not matter where you land.\n\nAnother possibility: Did you use the \u0027Show Biomes in Map view\u0027 debug option? It removes the overlay and it will not show up again after you switch the option off, the overlay off, and activate the overlay again."},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T02:50:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All of them do.\n\nJool?\n\nMy scanner rejected to scan Jool.\n\nThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what I got for the Jool\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
