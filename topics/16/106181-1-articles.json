You just have to burn your periapsis down to below 0. As long as the active Mun orbit is below ground level at some point you\u0060ll get the mission done.

At periapsis, burn retrograde just enough to capture (i.e. the highest possible apoapsis). Coast up to apoapsis, then you just need a tiny retrograde burn to lower periapsis below 0, thus completing your contract, then immediately a tiny burn prograde to raise periapsis to something barely above the surface (so you won\u0027t crash).\n\nThen just orbit the mun until your periapsis direction lines up with your next stop; for example, if you\u0027re going back to Kerbin, wait until your periapsis happens about 70 degrees west of the spot on the Mun directly facing Kerbin. Then do the necessary prograde burn right at periapsis, and you\u0027re on your way."}]}
