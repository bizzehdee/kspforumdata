It seems to me like the jet engines provide massive thrust as the plane gets faster and at lower altitudes than was needed in 0.9 but the heat kills the spaceplane at around 20km and if I try and fly at higher altitudes where the air is thinner and the heat drops off the engines just die. Perhaps I am using the intakes incorrectly? Are intakes occluded by other parts? I\u0027ve tried the pre-coolers but they didn\u0027t seem to help.\n\nI am obviously aware that the everything is very different in this update and welcome that but maybe the balance is wrong? I can\u0027t seem to get over 1000 m/s in a spaceplane now. Perhaps this update favours planes that are heavily dependant on rocket engines to reach orbital speeds which would be a shame."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:22:46Z","Content":"Nope, spaceplanes are impossible now.

Those who aren\u0027t experts probably slap on loads of rocket fuel and rocket engines and rely on that to get them to orbit. This update seems to favour the second method. Possibly it is easier to haul larger amounts of oxidiser with fewer jets engines than before as heating is more of the limiting factor at around 20km than thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:50:01Z","Content":"I probably should have started small, but I\u0027ve got a mk3 plane with a large cargo bay nearly to space.\n\nDuring multiple tries, I overheated in the atmosphere, and blew up.\n\nThe last, most successful try, I was climbing at 20 degrees between 16km to 20-something km, seeing reentry effects and hoping it would be ok... a heat meter sure would be nice. Anyway, I symettrically lost 2 inner control surfaces on the main wing... and then it seemed to reach nearly peak speed, but obviously at that point air density was dropping fast, and nothing more happened, it was flying nice and steady.. sans 2 control surfaces it started with.\n\nEverything was going nice... then the air density dropped too much and the engines starte to cut out as I was at about 1,100 m/s (no spin, thankfully), I engaged the KR-2L booster... and apparently had a bit of a thrust imbalance, and soon started to spin out of control.
