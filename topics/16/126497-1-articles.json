It was rather easy before 0.90 :D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo all have to be occluded by a heat shield? With that rover design i described, the wheels wouldn\u0026#39;t be occluded by a 2,5m heat shield, so it\u0026#39;d have to use a 3,75 heat shield then where the rover fits in? Do cargo bays work?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBonus question: How would i get an empty SLS-tank (the largest one, S3-14400) with wheels to duna? Not that it would make sense, but this is where i can\u0026#39;t simply attach a heat shield in front of it anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPS: i had only sent rather small probes to duna until now. Very light, short and streamlined with a 1,25m or 2,5m heat shield. My configuration always has an upper stage with retrograde rockets, drogues and normal chutes. After heat effects disappear, i start the rockets to slow me down to safe chute deployment speed. After the chutes deployed and the fall gets slow enough i jettison the heat shield and use the rockets again just before touchdown, if my vertical speed is to high for a soft landing. After touchdown, i power up again, so the whole thing is _just_ before lifting of again and decouple the upper stage, so it flys off (and with some F5\u002BF9ing, the lander stage doesn\u0026#39;t flip around).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI doubt i can adapt this 1:1 for much larger and heavier payloads.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T10:20:14Z","Content":"\nDuna\u0026#39;s air is thin enough that it doesn\u0026#39;t practically matter. My Duna lander is still a FLT-200, with three radially mounted FLT-200\u0026#39;s. It cares not for the heat, although drogue chutes are definitely needed.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T13:07:34Z","Content":"\nHeatshields are by far the most effective protection from reentry heat.

Deploy all chutes with the pod 1.5km opening, rover chutes for 1km opening, after the pod chutes are fully deployed decouple the rover and pray that the separator bit falls off nicely. If all goes well the rover and pod should land within walking distance. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGE.\n"}]}
