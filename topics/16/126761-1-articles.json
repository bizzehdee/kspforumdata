If you are in an equatorial orbit about Kerbin, then you can inject into an equatorial orbit about the Mun. (In this case, which is degenerate, in fact you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E do so. The fact that this doesn\u0027t often happen is due to the fact that you\u0027re rarely in an exactly equatorial orbit.) If you\u0027re in an orbit inclined 12 degrees around Kerbin, then you cannot inject with an inclination lower than 12 degrees in the target orbit (and in fact it will sometimes be a lot more, due to offsets in your inclination - the inclination between the plane including your ship at the moment you start your burn and the target body and the plane including the parent body and the target body determines the exact inclination).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Minmus, if you are an equatorial orbit, you cannot inject into an orbit lower than 6 degrees inclination (and this only if you get there at the ascending or descending node). In order to get to a lower inclination, you have to start from an orbit with a lower inclination. Funnily enough, depending on starting conditions, you might not be able to easily lower your target inclination either - depends on where the AN/DN is on your transfer orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncreasing target inclination is always easy - you do a normal burn well out from the target, which costs you a pittance in delta V. You may need to include tangential and radial component not to miss your target or to keep a sane periapsis, but this should also be small. (If it isn\u0027t, back up - you\u0027re doing something wrong.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
