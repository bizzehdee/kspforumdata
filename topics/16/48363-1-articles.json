(I\u0027m sure most of us go through this stage, yeah?) As of this morning, I\u0027ve accomplished that for Moho, Eve, Gilly, Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, Duna, and Ike (and Dres will be done by this evening, hopefully). But as I eye the Joolian system, I\u0027m trying to think of the best way to go about it, especially since Tylo will be so demanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had a thought--what if I sent multiple unmanned missions ahead, which simply carried landers sufficient to land and return to orbit, and put one such lander around each moon of Jool? Then I could send a single manned mission through the Joolian system, rendezvousing with each lander in turn, landing, planting a flag, and returning to the orbiter. Has anyone tried this, who could maybe offer some advice for such a mission? Even if you haven\u0027t tried it, does it sound feasible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T15:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA fun readthrough is Brotoro\u0027s Long-term Laythe Mission thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27552-Long-term-Laythe-Mission-(pic-heavy)-_-With-Part-16-_?highlight=laythe\u002Bmission\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27552-Long-term-Laythe-Mission-(pic-heavy)-_-With-Part-16-_?highlight=laythe\u002Bmission\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably more complex than what you are thinking, but definitely shows an organized effort to bring multiple unmanned landers (and other things) to Jool followed by manned craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T15:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely feasible; basically it\u0027s a Munar Orbit Rendezvous, except around a different world. You\u0027ll need to be sure to pack RCS for docking maneuvers and maybe some extra fuel for orbital plane change maneuvers, and you\u0027ll need to be VERY careful that you wind up getting your crew capsule travelling around the target body in the same direction as the lander - a 180 degree plane change is no laughing matter. A refueling tanker or two around Jool might be a good idea in case of an emergency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamis","CreatedById":84719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T17:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat Laythe mission thread is inspiring! My idea isn\u0027t nearly as ambitious as that, but it certainly sets a kind of precedent for lander seeding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, excellent point about making sure the crew capsule ends up orbiting in the same direction as the landers. That\u0027s going on my checklist, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll report back!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
