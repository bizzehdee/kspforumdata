I enjoy designing these craft a lot and they seem to be a nice way of collecting science - unless you smash your whole thing to bits while landing after an 1h-long mission...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T13:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the game will have extreme difficulty simulating physics on any craft that is not focused. From memory, this stems from floating-point inaccuracies piling up, as well as the performance issues of potentially having a great deal of craft being uncontrolled yet still flying through an atmosphere. While you may not see it as a problem when you only fly one mission at a time, the game still increments time whilst you\u0027re in the space center and in the tracking station. Normally, the game would put such objects into the \u0022on-rails\u0022 simulation mode, but it cannot do this for objects moving through the atmosphere, as this simplified simulation cannot handle aerodynamic drag. It is for this same reason that any objects further than 2.5km from the presently focused craft are automatically erased when in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere below ~20km altitude (the altitude changes for other planets with atmospheres IIRC). Until the devs work out some way to make it work without creating crippling performance issues, it is something we all have to live with, I\u0027m afraid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ll probably move this to Gameplay Questions, as that seems to be where it belongs best. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T22:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause the game will have extreme difficulty simulating physics on any craft that is not focused\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour argument is against switching to the space center from flight, not against saving/loading in the atmosphere. You don\u0027t go on-rails and switch to a different ship with a quicksave. In addition, it would be a Simple Matter of Programming to allow quitting to the main screen, and when you reload that save you\u0027re directly set up on the in-flight ship rather than to the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere doesn\u0027t seem to be a save file format for ships flying through the atmosphere (like there are for landed and orbiting ships), but that\u0027s just another SMOP.

I only need this for retrying a failed landing (or perhaps you know, going to sleep), not going Away From Kontrols on it. If going AFK crashes the craft, that\u0027s fine - I accept the tradeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T19:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo put it simply, the program does not calculate atmospheric effects unless you are focused on that very vessel. If you have one craft that is about to do atmospheric braking, and will take several entries/exits before it is \u0022swallowed\u0022 by the atmosphere, and if you are sure those several brakings are going to take several hours, then, by all means, leave that craft focused and go to sleep. You will have proper atmospheric braking results when you wake up. Just make sure you calculated it right - or wake up in the middle of the night and check on it. Did that once myself, too : )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to your original question: no. you cannot save while something is in the atmosphere. You might be able to save if you switch to a different vessel, but don\u0027t hope the one in question would behave as you expected it to. Most probably it will keep orbiting as if no atmosphere was there (and maybe even as if no surface is there... sucks, I know)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fenderzilla","CreatedById":70047,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T17:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BlackBicycle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BlackBicycle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edon\u0027t hope the one in question would behave as you expected it to.
