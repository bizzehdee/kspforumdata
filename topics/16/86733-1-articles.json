One is a ship file I downloaded of that massive tanker that takes 15 minutes to get into orbit (can\u0027t find the link). the other is one I made.

Most these problems arise from the Docking Port having been placed in such a manner that it spans two or more parts, for example if its\u0027 been placed by the joint of two Rockomax 32 Fuel Tanks for instance. Also other parts placed in such a manner that it clips into the the docking port can cause problems, like say strut end-points and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not had this particular problem since starting to take great care in how and where I place my Docking Ports to ensure nothing interferes with them or overlaps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T04:44:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zylark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T13:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022giddonah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022giddonah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the reply, but it makes me want to just abandon the ship.

Don\u0027t worry about what the save file says for date modified, assuming you have quicksaving turned on (From the difficulty menu) then it will save. What you want to look for is the name of the craft you are currently flying using the search funtion, then look for the docking port part (I believe it is moduleDockingNode) from there you want to find \u0022state = \u0022 (should be pretty close to the top) and make sure it says \u0022state = Ready\u0022 with both sets of numbers after it set to 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepeat the process for the ship you are trying to dock with. The easiest way to ind a docking port on a ship that has multiple ports is to disable crossfeed, and then you can search by \u0022crossFeed = disabled\u0022 (Not sure if it\u0027s crossFeed or xFeed)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
