Pre-0.22 a lot of people got used to building massive rockets (moar boosters! moar struts!), but in reality a bigger rocket just makes things harder because of how fuel works.

You can see in my pictures I have an LV-909 engine, T400 fuel tank (180L of fuel), my science experiments and the pod (along with landing gear and parachutes). With that 180 fuel and a 390 isp engine you can deorbit a 5 ton ship, land on the Mun, take off and return to Kerbin with fuel to spare.

From what I can tell from watching Scott Manley\u0027s videos, this is the most efficient way of getting back into a Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, when I\u0027m setting up the maneuver node, I keep an eye on \u0022next\u0022 orbital path once we leave the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence to watch the Kerbin periapsis and try to make my Mun escape burn put me in a Kerbin orbit that might graze the atmosphere (about 50-60k... I could be wrong - but below 70k anyway). That way, if I still end up running out of fuel, the orbits around Kerbin will slow me down each time I fly through the atmosphere so that eventually it\u0027ll bring me down and I can rely on the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting there, etc. I can only recommend looking at the top speed and ISP of each engine. The higher the ISP, the more efficient the engine. Some are good in atmosphere (ie. lifting off from Kerbin), others are better in space (in a vacuum). Personally I go with a multistage rocket with ever smaller fuel tanks and engines. That way, I\u0027m using the smallest, lowest power engine (and hopefully most efficient) to land on the Mun, with enough fuel to get me back into Mun orbit and then finally back into Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-28T17:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2013 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Queeg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T18:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stealth17\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stealth17\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI always used MechJeb to see how much TWR and Delta-V I had.

I\u0027ve returned 15 surface samples in a single Mun mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the main purpose of the thread, I find the trick is to be choosy about overbuilding the craft. For example, this is my multi-biome Munar lander. It has enough delta-V that I can usually hit 4-6 biomes in a single mission and is usable far earlier in the tech tree than you are now (the only tech it uses that you don\u0027t have are the folding solar panels, and you can easily work around that). The four radially mounted fuel tanks are chained drop tanks, so I drop the first two as soon as they\u0027re empty, and the other two when it\u0027s time to go home (and they\u0027re empty). The center stack as enough fuel to return the craft to orbit and put the craft into an aerobrake return to Kerbin, provided the drop tanks have been dropped. As you can see, that\u0027s over 10k delta-v, which is serious overkill if you\u0027re not planning on suborbital hops to go to multiple biomes. Though definitely do suborbital hops rather than a full return to orbit then landing, that will take over twice as much delta-v per hop. Heck, I even do most of my initial landing using the transfer stage, dropping it only when I have to so that it won\u0027t be under me when I land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pbxGW6G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pbxGW6G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027d have to be really meticulous to have any chance to even get close to 15 biomes with that craft, however. My other multi-biome Munar lander takes a slightly different approach. The lander is a multihop lander/rover combination, so it drives to biomes that are close, hops to those that are farther away. This is the one that I\u0027ve hit all 15 biomes in a single trip with, though it takes a lot of driving to pull that off. This one uses the same technologies as the first one plus wheels, so it often isn\u0027t my first Munar lander in any particular career mode save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/kFJ3g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
