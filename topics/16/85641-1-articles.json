Its endlessly painful trying to connect boosters to your spaceship, especially large ones. I have a mission where I have to test the LFB KR-1x2 boosters in an orbit around Kerbal. It is not that hard because you can use another 4 of that LFB boosters to snapshot into orbit... \u003Cstrong\u003EIF\u003C/strong\u003E you are able to connect 4 of them to your launch unit and 2 of them (obviously empty, they are only for the mission and 2 because of balance) on your orbiting unit. Really, I am not able to fulfill that mission because either me or the programmed routine of assembling parts to a spacecraft is stupid. I, certainly, connected the boosters via Hydraulic Detachment Manifold because I have to get rid of them when they\u0027re burnt out. Thats were the pain starts. Sitting 2 hours\u002B straight (and thats no exaggeration) trying to connect 4 boosters to your launching part is \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT FUN\u003C/strong\u003E. \u0022Wow... the 4 are fitting now... little bit of clipping but it will do.\u0022 NOPE, jettison won\u0027t work and you are doomed to drag. Tried single atachment, tried 2s atachment, tried 4s atachment, tried console (clipping)... to no effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are not able to atach even a single booster \u003Cstrong\u003Eprecisely\u003C/strong\u003E to a Detachment Unit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You have to handle with angle of view, hight, depth and all 3 of them are not able to influence at one time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Clipping is the most PITA in the VAB because you think its working but if you launch your rocket... nope, not today my friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Theres no way to zoom out in VAB.
