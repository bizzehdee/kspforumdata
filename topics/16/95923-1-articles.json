I have a spreadsheet with information on the coverage of satellites, but this link you can view the cover. It helps a lot ... I saw the KER\u0026gt; Rendevouz: Phase Angle. But I do not know what he means. It seems to me that it is against the current position of my ship to the target, it still does not know how to project the burn point for the AP achieve the desired angle (72 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T16:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe you want the longitude of perigee. You can compute this value by adding the longitude of ascending node to the argument of perigee. Both of these are available in KER. Then, compare the two values for the two satellites to compute the angle you\u0027re looking for. However, it will be very difficult to burn directly into that orbit without lots of really hard math. If you can manage it, I would suggest putting the second satellite in a circular 1400km orbit and then lowering its perigee when it\u0027s current longitude is 180 degrees away from the desired longitude of perigee. You should be able to get within a degree or two using this method. Then, you can burn radial/anti-radial at apogee to adjust the longitude of perigee precisely. This will change your apogee, but you can change it back at perigee without significantly affecting the longitude of perigee if it\u0027s not a major change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dida44","CreatedById":132949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T02:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJimbimbibble, thank you for your interest! I tried your suggestion but due to not understand exactly your explanation (do not speak English and translators does not always make a good translation), I had no success. It would be possible to give an example (even hypothetical)? Maybe then it would be easier for my understanding.
