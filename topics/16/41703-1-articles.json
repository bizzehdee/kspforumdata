It doesn\u0027t take much delat-V to circularize this at the far distance. Then just coast around until you\u0027ve got the right phase angle (ahead or behind, depending on your orbit\u0027s diameter) to the moon. From there, just a mere fart of a burn will take you to the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the main planet has an atmosphere, by all means use it to aerobrake, so you don\u0027t have to spend as much fuel to get captured. Each aerobraking is a unique experience because it depends on the velocity you arrive with, plus the configuration of your ship. So have the mission control boffins back on Kerbin run simulations. That is, quicksave as soon as you enter the main planet\u0027s SOI. Then tweak your periapsis down into the atmosphere and see what you end up with. If you don\u0027t like it, load the quicksave, put the periapsis in a different place, and try again, repeat until you\u0027re happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T03:22:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you approach Gilly, but long before the capture, plan a correction burn to adjust the plane. It will then take very little fuel to get into a proper equatorial orbit. In fact, this can often be done with thrusters from such a distance. You have to set the map view to a planar view to plan such a burn. The maneuver has to be very precise so is best done with very low thrust for a short period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlingshot maneuvers around moons can also be used to change the orbital inclination as much as 90* to actually match their orbits using very little fuel. Again, that has to be done before being influenced by their gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had one equatorial encounter of a Jool moon that hit so precise that I nearly got a slingshot orbital capture.

Is it just a big waiting game?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general plan is to aerobrake to get your Jool apoapsis out in the general vicinity of Laythe\u0027s orbit. So as you come out of your aerobrake, coast to your apoapsis then burn to raise your periapsis and circularize your orbit. This is because odds are, Laythe itself isn\u0027t anywhere near your Jool apoapsis. So now you ride around the circle until you achieve the same sort of phasing angle between your ship and Laythe as you\u0027d use to transfer from Kerbin to Duna (if you\u0027re inside Laythe) or Eve (if you\u0027re outside Laythe). This won\u0027t take very long because moons have a short orbital period. Anyway, once you\u0027ve phased up with Laythe, a tiny tiny burn will make you cross paths with it, after which you can aerobrake at Laythe to help establish your final orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time taken to phase up with the Laythe depends on the difference in your orbital velocities, which is greater the further apart your orbits are. But you want your orbit far from Jool so raising your periapsis is cheap on delta-V. So something like \u002B/- 15-25% of Laythe\u0027s orbital radius out from Jool should work pretty well, as long as you don\u0027t get tangled up with one of the other moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T16:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently at work and my work computer can\u0027t access Imgur; say\u0027s it\u0027s porn.

Doing just what I described above, apart from the pic of the spurious auto-capture to Ike. I think I had to wait about 3/4 of my orbit around Duna to catch up with Ike. Once I left Kerbin, I don\u0027t think I used more than 200-300m/s dV to get my Ike orbit, including mid-course tweak to intercept Duna (forgot to blip throttle prior to ejection burn), tweak to set periapsis for Duna aerobrake, burn to circularize Duna orbit, burn to transfer out to Ike, and burn to get captured by Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
