Since I\u0027ve never attempted anything like this before, I was wonder if there\u0027s any oversights or flaws in this Spaceplane Carrier that could doom the mission, any thoughts?\n\nThe front end of the ship (the orange tank with the mailsail engine) will be left behind as a refueling station for Kerbin, while the back two-thirds will head off to Duna powered by a Poodle engine. One spaceplane is for Duna, and the other Ike, and this will be a two-kerbal mission. The flight plan is essentially to launch at the prime launch window for Duna, put in an orbit, have Valentina fly the spaceplanes one at a time, gather rocks and data, return to the vessel. After the missions are complete, she will then fly back to Kerbin in the Spaceplane with the LV-N while Jagie will say behind and conduct research in the on-board laboratory.\n\n(Remember, I\u0027ve never left Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, so I\u0027m not entirely sure what to expect)\n\n![XFrcSwrl.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/XFrcSwrl.jpg)\n\n![pzEQ3B2o.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/pzEQ3B2o.jpg)\n\n![Dl68iHoO.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/Dl68iHoO.jpg)\n\n![bLCVgX4Q.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/bLCVgX4Q.jpg)\n\n![OCzHzIQM.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/OCzHzIQM.jpg)\n\nEdit:\n\nThe results of my trip:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Nj-0_odsrI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T00:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T00:40:23Z","Content":"I see two potential issues.
