(Again I blame Brotoro) But I was curious what Fuel Crossfeed Capable actually meant. I\u0027ve never really run into this (Except when clustering engines) I\u0027ve never tried using it as I am here. Will fuel flow from the center tank to the outer nacelles?

Parts like decouplers are not fuel crossfeed capable, meaning fuel above them will not flow to the engine below it, even though fuel runs top to bottom. Therefore fuel will no flow between stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently edited (made a second one) a small cube strut to not be crossfeed capable so I could attach fuel lines to run behind some SRB\u0027s without the fuel flowing into the center stack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T22:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook at any part\u0027s configuration file - unless there\u0027s a line in it that specifically says \u0022fuelCrossFeed = False\u0022, it will will allow fuel cross-feed. That\u0027s a sizable fraction of the parts in the game, incidentally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your design, you can indeed feed the outer nacelles from the central tank; I\u0027ve got that very phenomenon going on with my Thanatos Heavy 7 booster for the Constellation Challenge. You can also go the other direction, of course; it all depends on how you aim your fuel lines (stick them on the part you want the fuel to come \u003Cem\u003Efrom\u003C/em\u003E, connect them to the part you want to run fuel \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C/em\u003E). It\u0027s part of the usual advice I give to people who are having problems with their early M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landers (e.g. take that FL-T400 you\u0027re using and swap it out with four FL-T100s, put three of those tanks outboard and run fuel lines to the center, put your legs on the outer tanks and voila - you\u0027ve widened and shortened your stack so it\u0027s less likely to tip over while not sacrificing fuel or adding mass).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T22:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, fuel will not flow from a central tank to one that\u0027s been attatched radial to it.
