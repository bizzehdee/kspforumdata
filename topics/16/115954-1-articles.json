You could get rid of the battery and one of the panel, but it lets you with only 5 electricity units. While possible it\u0027s too annoying.\n\n- An Oscar tank and two spiders for thrust\n\n- A Small reaction wheel. Even if the spiders are supposed to have great thrust vectoring (8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 !) the spacecraft was totally uncontrolable without it. I don\u0027t know why.\n\n- A normal chute and a drogue chute for landing. The drogue chute is decoupled during landing, which allow a 300 m/s boost in delta-V.\n\nHere are some pictures I made :\n\n[![1436986427-2015-07-15-00013.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436986427-2015-07-15-00013.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436986427-2015-07-15-00013.jpg) [![1436986510-2015-07-15-00003.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436986510-2015-07-15-00003.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436986510-2015-07-15-00003.jpg) [![1436985014-2015-07-15-00004.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985014-2015-07-15-00004.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985014-2015-07-15-00004.jpg) [![1436985016-2015-07-15-00005.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985016-2015-07-15-00005.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985016-2015-07-15-00005.jpg) [![1436985030-2015-07-15-00006.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985030-2015-07-15-00006.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985030-2015-07-15-00006.jpg) [![1436985033-2015-07-15-00007.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985033-2015-07-15-00007.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985033-2015-07-15-00007.jpg) [![1436985036-2015-07-15-00009.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985036-2015-07-15-00009.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985036-2015-07-15-00009.jpg) [![1436985035-2015-07-15-00010.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985035-2015-07-15-00010.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985035-2015-07-15-00010.jpg) [![1436985037-2015-07-15-00011.png](http://image.noelshack.com/minis/2015/29/1436985037-2015-07-15-00011.png)](http://www.noelshack.com/2015-29-1436985037-2015-07-15-00011.jpg)\n\nNote that the chute isn\u0027t enough for slowing the spacecraft, you have to use some retrorockets.\n\nI picked a random landing site (only condition was on the day side), but I think it could go ASL.
