Single press of Q or E spins them really hard, with exception of the biggest ones. I even bought joystick hoping that this will help but still they are spinning like crazy. Using less control surfaces makes control of other axises really hard. I tried putting control surfaces close to main axis but it makes only a slight difference...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Febin","CreatedById":63053,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T20:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure why this is happening to you, try pressing the TAB key to turn on fine controls. This will make the buttons/joystick less sensitive. It would help if you could post some pictures of the planes that do this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T20:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll be the caps lock key that you want, not the tab key.
