I\u0027m guessing something else is messing with that. Interstellar Mod does play with that, IIRC. Still, without a pic it is hard for us to see the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FAR VAB/SPH GUI is very helpful for building stable craft. In the simulation window, set mach number to 0.2 and pitch to 1 and do an angle-of-attack sweep. The \u0027Cm\u0027 curve should stay positive (at least out to 20deg) both with and without fuel. Change pitch to -1 and repeat, this time making sure that Cm stays negative. Now change the mach number to 3 and repeat the entire process. If your craft works in all these regimes, chances are good that it will stay pitch-stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for flat spins, these are usually the result of unequal thrust or not having a sufficiently large vertical stabilizer that is set far enough behind the CoM. Try making it bigger or moving it back to improve this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T18:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy overheating, do you mean an orange bar starts filling up, or your parts explode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lucy1nTheSky","CreatedById":101294,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T20:21:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought i posted a picture...

You don\u0027t see any real life planes with fins like that, and there\u0027s a reason for that: they make the plane less stable in yaw. Getting rid of those might help with yaw issues.
