I have perfected normal straight-on docking with a tug craft for building ships in orbit. However, I am not confident in assembling pieces on the sides of the ship so they are in line with the rest of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems I need at least 2 connection points for each module to make sure it\u0027s straight. Easy enough to line docking ports up in the VAB with angle snap. But is there an efficient way to do this that doesn\u0027t involve an obscenely huge launch vehicle and putting my five-stack propulsion module up in one chunk? I can\u0027t seem to figure it out without putting unsightly RCS blocks all over everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just remembered what\u0027s essentially a \u0022bar stool\u0022 design for the tug, with the main body serving as host to four long RCS-equipped limbs that reach down over the module to be maneuvered. I do have a semi-functional version or two of this, but would probably need a new one.

Simplest and most flexible would be to place the HubMax six-way connectors in the stacks. For a more streamlined option, take a fuel tank (or any stack that will be common between the core and all your likely boosters), attach docking ports radially near the top and bottom, and save it as a subassembly. Then always use that subassembly when you want the docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the actual docking, it\u0027s a bit trickier than normal docking since you need to match orientation so that both docking ports connect at the same time. (If one connects first, the other will not dock even if it comes close.) But it\u0027s entirely doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T11:40:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E 2\u002B connectors to make it straight, it just makes it a lot easier because you can see what in-line is; you can, with a little patience and a balanced craft, dock perfectly in-line with a single docking port. As cantab said, it\u0027s just a normal docking but with an extra orientation, which is pretty tricky if you attempt the docking from a focus point parallel to the target piece. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it\u0027s much easier if you \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port. Just line up the craft as you would for a normal docking but remain stationary (relative) a very short distance away and then rotate as necessary. Adding a few ASAS modules to whatever you\u0027re docking is amazingly helpful to lock the rotation once that\u0027s done, because unless you\u0027ve perfectly balanced your RCS thrust you will have moved away and moving back might try to rotate again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a little practice, but \u0027normal\u0027 docking does too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T20:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ediagram\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m asking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I can imagine it will be a bit tricky, but I should be able to do that much with the way you said, saving each module as a subassembly.
