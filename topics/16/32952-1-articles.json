Well you can always lock the steering on the four rear wheels. Trust me it helps a lot. And how exactly does it flip? On the side? Front/rear? Disabling some of the wheel\u0027s motors depending on how it flips over could help.

So maybe turn off the steering on all wheels but the front ones and turn off the motors on the front ones. Then just break by pressing backwards and you should see some major improvement \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cordeos","CreatedById":70178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T17:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour tips were quite helpful, I\u0027ve been able to keep it under control better if I stay below 7 m/s. I would still love tips on better rover design. Lower center of mass seems a good target, but some kind of anti-roll or self correction feature would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:21:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELow center of mass is key, of course. As far as a self-correction feature goes, my rover design incorporates a toroidal fuel tank slung onto the underside and a pair of 24-77s sticking out the front and facing up. When my rovers flip (provided they survive, of course), I light up these rockets and give it the rover a little bit of a kick. It\u0027s usually enough to tip it back over, though it\u0027s easy to overdo it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight also think about adding a roll-cage for the RTGs and your probe core; that\u0027ll reduce the chance of them blowing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing you should do is drive around using the docking controls (i.e. translational controls), not the staging controls (rotational). On low-gravity worlds like Minmus, you\u0027ll have to do this just so you don\u0027t flip your design from your probe core\u0027s torque thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robbii6","CreatedById":69855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T18:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you click the docking button situated in the bottom left it is much better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
