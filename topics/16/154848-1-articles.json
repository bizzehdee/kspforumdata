I finished building it and stored it as a sub-assembly as normal. later, when I attempted to load it onto the launcher, the LP-6(having 3 large lander cans) showed up without an attachment point on its main docking port. the docking port is situated on a radial attachment point, which is situated on top of the first two landers, one of which is the parent part. what am I doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T20:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222918203\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022154848\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484156865\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168675\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022whitejj01\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, whitejj01 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat am I doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure without seeing a screenshot. But there most certainly should be one attachment node. The game won\u0027t let you save a sub-assembly if there isn\u0027t.
