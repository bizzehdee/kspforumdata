Another way would be to accept and fulfill a satellite contract, making sure to put a thermometer on the craft (many of the contracts require one anyway), and then just leave it in orbit. That way you get two birds with one stone, and future science from XX orbit contracts can be very quickly and easily completed.

For example, if they mention common argument about Kerbin being a sphere or oblate spheroid, I try to send back gravity survey. If they are engineering company talking about explosive failures I figure they want data on how chemistry or material samples behave in space. IMO it seems likely a system like this will be implemented in future update much like the current requests for specific types of surveys on planet surfaces."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T16:23:41Z","Content":"ANY data.

It is very common to get \u0022collect science data from space around X\u0022 from places you\u0027ve already been. You may even get the same contract multiple times. If you already have an old probe/lander parked there, you can fulfill the new contract immediately and for free. Thermometers are good for this because they are cheap, repeatable, and can be used both on the surface and in space (low).\n\nExample: I got an old robotic lander sitting on Moho whose primary mission has already ended. Since then I have twice received \u0022collect science data from space around Moho\u0022 contracts. All a had to do was return to my lander, pulse the engine to lift a few meters off the ground, quickly log the temperature before touching back down again, and transmit the science data. Contract completed in almost no time and easy money in the bank."},{"CreatedByName":"Acet","CreatedById":123646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T17:51:45Z","Content":"Once you unlock the Rockmax 48-7S engine, the first probe core with SAS (the one after the Sputnik) and the basic solar cells, you can put in space a probe with an antenna, a thermometer and enough dV that it can do \u0022Science from space\u0022 missions anywhere up to and including Duna, Eve and their moons, all of this for about 8k a launch and within the parts limit and tonnage limit of the Level 1 VAB and Launchpad."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T18:26:33Z","Content":"Yeah, as soon as you have a satellite somewhere the \u0022Transmit or Recover Science Data from...\u0022 contracts are easy money.\n\nAlso fun tip: Crew Reports only need a command pod, no Kerbal required!
