As long as I don\u0027t over-power my ships with the boosters (which also means keeping them light) the snap-together construction in the VAB is working fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I was doing some thinking on reducing the height of my stages for my standard workhorse, and I figured that this would add some additional capabilities. So I started unlocking some heavy rocketry, only to find that these larger parts are not reliably holding together. They frequently will bounce apart when dropped onto the launch pad. The assembly will have failed control connections intermittantly at different sections, so while it may land on the launch pad in perfect working order one time, the next 4 times, one or more stages will have a open connection and nothing below that stage works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now I\u0027ve come up with a work around that works really well, but I don\u0027t see that anyone else is using that work around in their craft, so I\u0027m wondering what other people are doing to bind their larger diameter rocketry sections together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy work around is to add struts where they are easy to add because I have some angles to work with, and where I have straight sections with a trouble spot, I put some fins, with struts leading up and down from the leading and trailing tips of the fin, forming a rigging/brace structure that both stiffens and provides apparent compression for the rocket sections at the joints, resulting in perfect performance. This also allows for larger boosters to be used, and the resulting vehicle can be used to lift heavy loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my question is, what do the people that are \u0022doing it right\u0022 doing to get larger rocket sections to hold together? I mean just a single large engine, a short tank, and a small capsule rattle and shake like there is nothing holding them together at all, and I know they are \u0022connected\u0022 just as well as my reliable 2.5 meter rockets that are as tall as the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be fair, my tall rockets have bottom sections that are multiple 2.5 meter sections strutted together in clusters of 6, and large blocks of solid boosters strutted to the bottom, so it\u0027s not just a long pencil... And even those had problems when I apply too much force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was surprised my rigging system worked, for a long time I thought my collapses under high-power were from excessive thrust force, but now I see it was from insufficient section clamping force, and is actually lateral collapse, I can sustain much much greater engine loads (and support greater payloads) this way. And my end-to-end control path appears to be reliable during the \u0022drop\u0022 to the launch pad.

Many of them I already had tried with varying success... Botch\u0027s suggestion was pretty much the first thing I tried, and I found it difficult to get struts to adhere to surfaces without enough of an angle to allow clearance for the strut. The strut seems to be the only part that forces clearance... Everything else will happlily go through walls... Walls can go around struts, if the struts are there first.... sometimes. And when you build sub-assemblies that use struts, sometimes struts will disappear and seem hard to replace...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the struts weight doesn\u0027t appear to be as predicted by the part, they appear to be lighter, so perhaps the given weight is the maximum for the strut\u0027s longest length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe struts on fins seem to be very useful, as the fins appear to have a side to side rigidity so you don\u0027t have to side strut your trusses if you don\u0027t want to, though you should if they were real. The fins seem to be stronger than they should be for what they are, I get girder strength for 1/6th the weight, and the part adds control surfaces during takeoff... though that is a mixed blessing as I find that too many fins has a cost in fuel, as does allowing the autopilot steer the ship while in the atmosphere (the autopilot can double the fuel it takes to reach orbit). Gimbals and just enough SAS to barely control the ship seems to be the right mix if you want to let the autopilot drive, though I suspect there are probably other ways to trim/damp the autopilot stick response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an engineer in real life, that is what makes this game so cool, it employs a lot of semi-realistic engineering.
