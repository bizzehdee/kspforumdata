Practically though, that is really, really deep. It would be worse than taking off from Eve - while Jool\u0027s gravity is lower, the atmosphere is ridiculously dense. It\u0027ll still be a fair bit more dense than Eve at sea level at that altitude, and the way up to space will be longer than from Eve at sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, given the choice of lugging a giant manned Jool ascent vehicle in all the way from Kerbin that will absolutely require staging, or using a tiny throw-away probe with perhaps some winglets...

SOUNDS. AWESOME!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t progressed that far in the game for fineprint to generate Jool missions but I\u0027m assuming thats the same as the kerbin ones where you have to fly to 4 points on the map. Personally I would retrofit my ssto from air breathing to lq\u002Box and take it for a spin in the atmosphere!! but yeah it might be worth going steetwind\u0027s method - perhaps mini-ssto\u0027s with probe cores instead of kerbals for a one way trip down in to the atmosphere - far safer..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T08:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone once did a \u0022landing\u0022 and relaunch to orbit on Jool.
