When using this design I completely loose control of the craft when the jet engines shut down due to lack of air at the rising altitudes. I have seen people put together lifters using jet engines before but I am not sure how they are remaining in control when the jet engines burn out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my questions are: Is it possible to use jet engines and remain in control after they burn out? Is there a way to have them power down automatically before they burn out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not want to stage them to detach as I am trying to make the lifter re-usable.

That\u0027s built into the software, so there\u0027s no way to prevent it, and it means they will apply uneven thrust and send the rocket tumbling. So the thing to do is set them to toggle on/off with an action group. Do a test flight and see when they fail, and the next time you launch, turn them off in a controlled way with the action group just before fail altitude. And currently, the attachment system isn\u0027t working, so external hosting is the *only* way to post images.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T18:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can watch your Air intake drop like you would total fuel or mono-propellent with the Resources tab in the top right corner.
