I have two problems. The first one is that when I launch the vehicle shuddenly explosions. You can see it in the video Im going to post. Also When I try to land or take off the plane change the direction with no apparent reason. I think I could solve it puting the landing gear in the wings, but I didn\u0027t have time to do it now. I succesfully landed this plane once but was really difficult. Hope you can say me what is wrong and I will fix it, also started making planes and this was my second one but the first one didn\u0027t have this huge problems. Also I hope this is the right thread in this sub-forum I started in the forum yesterday \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/4kOgJ94_nUk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T21:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the part clipping that\u0027s doing it.

I changed the position of the landing gear to the wings and now works fine. Also I put more struts and now 10% of the times explodes (wich is acceptable). So thanks for the Help, problem solved.
