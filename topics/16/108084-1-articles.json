I am in the corect orbit within about 1k. Degree angle is correct , though it says 180. Strange thing is, my probe is able to alter its orbit by itself, with the engine off, SAS off, me not touching anything. \n\nEven thoguh on occasion it settles, the it still shows its not in the correct orbit.\n\nAnyone else having this problem?\n\nTHe probe is just a okto, antenna okto fuel tank and a ant engine, nothing special."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:50:33Z","Content":"Are you sure you\u0027re going around in the correct direction? 180^ sounds like you\u0027re supposed to be in a retrograde, not a prograde orbit. Are the little dots of light on the target orbit going around in the same direction as your probe?"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:54:55Z","Content":"ah, that might be it. i look into it thankyou"}]}
