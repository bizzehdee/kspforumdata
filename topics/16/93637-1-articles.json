The first click is supposed to click a selection of parts other than the root. So, from the perspective of your desired new root part, that would be any adjacently connected part. Then, select the root you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really isn\u0027t very clear, though, and as far as I have seen, nothing goes wrong no matter which part you click with the first click, so long as you avoid selecting the new root first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this seems like it ought to be Gameplay Questions; I\u0027ll move it there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T17:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the first part clicked on does not need to be the old root. I think the first part selected might force some parts organization internal to the game (such as which direction to rebuild the craft), although those things are fairly transparent to the user. I haven\u0027t confirmed this, but it\u0027s my guess based on how the vessel tree structure works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Navy2k","CreatedById":95246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T17:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is too that the first part you click should be any part other than the intended new root part because it defines what is the top and what the bottom part of the newly generated tree.
