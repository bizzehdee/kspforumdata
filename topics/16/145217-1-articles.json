Nothing too complex, just one that could lift off of the ground. I tried building a rotor for several hours, but none would lift off unless I hacked gravity. I can\u0027t find any tutorials or ships to download, or any forum threads that explain the design of one in detail. Can someone who has built one give me some tips?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T21:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you should start here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/98700-stock-helicopters-turboprops-we-keep-on-developing/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;embedComment=1698162\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-1698162\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T21:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich parts mods are you using and which special (like rotating) parts are you using?

That does simplify things. 2 things to keep in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe angle of the wings first.\u00A0Too great angle and the wings will stall if the stress doesn\u0027t break the whole thing, too little and there won\u0027t be enough lift. Only experimentation on a given design can give you your optimal angle in KSP, I would think but also bear in mind that typically, the angle really doesn\u0027t have to be great at all. 5 degrees perhaps, perhaps 3-4 will do, 10 tops before things start to go south, could be a starting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRPM. Fast does it. Very fast even. Consider real helis with their perhaps 300-400 rpm, or model helis with their 2000-5000 rpm.\u00A0Wobbles and total disinteration will threaten but work on making it sturdy yet as light as you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne more thing. Helis (even DIY ones in KSP)\u00A0are really demanding when it comes to perfect balance. Put a say, 50 kg part on only one wing as it spins at say 500 rpm\u00A0and watch the ensuing mayhem. Shouldn\u0027t be to much of an issue in KSP with parts copying and symmetry mode but definitely something to keep in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
