But\u00A0I don\u0027t think I was as clear as I should have been. \u00A0I have not unlocked any motorized wheels in the tech tree yet and I am trying to land all of my base modules close together so I can connect them with pipes. \u00A0As you can see I have landed near my other landers but still several hundred meters away. \u00A0What I was trying to do is just slightly leave the surface and scooch towards the other landers. I was trying to do this by tilting slightly towards the other landers while under a small amount of thrust. \u00A0If you do not tilt correctly the first time it gets ugly real fast. \u00A0So Based on this photo and its nav ball what do I need to do to make sure I understand what the WASD keys are going to do?\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0yulHPa.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00220yulHPa.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0yulHPa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn that case all you need to know is the relative position of the ships on the surface. If they\u0027re directly east tilt towards the 90\u00B0 mark on the navball.

My camera can be pointing anywhere and I\u0027m trying to figure out how to align it so I know what direction I\u0027ll tilt when I press \u0022w\u0022. \u00A0I am going to try and set one of the landers as a target and see if I have better control just using the nav ball. \u00A0Thank you for the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, when trying to align on a navball marker, only look at the navball, not the ship. \u00A0Looking at the ship will only confuse you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, in orbital maneuvers, only the pitch and yaw axes matter. \u00A0Roll doesn\u0027t matter at all for maneuvering. \u00A0Because of this, KSP ignores the roll axis so much that it introduces arbitrary rolls into the ship while doing pitch and yaw maneuvers, doesn\u0027t care that it does, and doesn\u0027t bother to correct them. \u00A0To see this in action, have a probe core or pilot with all the \u0022point in a given direction\u0022 SAS buttons available. \u00A0. \u00A0Turn on SAS with the T key, then hit the \u0022point prograde\u0022 button. \u00A0The ship will pitch and yaw to put its nose on prograde but will roll some along the way for no reason. \u00A0Now hit the \u0022point retrograde\u0022 button. \u00A0Instead of simply yawing or pitching 180^, the ship will do some of each and toss in a bit of roll for no reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe result of all this is that a ship is almost always rolled in an arbitrary direction. \u00A0Because the angle of the roll determines which way the nose moves relative to the camera when you pitch or yaw, just hitting the WASD keys will make the ship rotate in an arbitrary direction. \u00A0And if you habitually use the SAS \u0022point to\u0022 buttons, this will always be the case, so just ignore it like the game does and don\u0027t look at the ship when you\u0027re trying to point at a navball icon \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously, in space, the angle of the ship\u0027s roll only matters in 2 cases: \u00A0The 1st is docking. \u00A0Often you want the ship you\u0027re docking to be rolled in a certain direction relative to the station or other ship. so it will fit between the station\u0027s solar panels or the ladders on station modules will\u00A0line up. \u00A0The other is landing on a planet where you want the crew hatch and/or any science instruments you plan on accessing on EVA facing the sun so you can see them. \u00A0Both of these desired roll angles can be set at the very last moment, and should only be done at that point because if you do them earlier, the game will probably roll the ship somewhere else and you\u0027ll have to do it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, if you really, really want to look at the ship, here\u0027s what you do. \u00A0First thing is to roll the ship so that the pod/cockpit probe core\u0027s upper surface is actually facing \u0022solar up\u0022, which is parallel with the lines running up out of the north poles of every planet and the sun. \u00A0To do this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMake sure your navball is in \u0022Orbit\u0022 mode by clicking on the speed readout until it says \u0022Orbit\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPoint the ship at its prograde navball marker.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRoll the ship until the line dividing the navball into blue and brown halves is vertical. \u00A0The brown side should be on the same side of your ship as the planet you\u0027re orbiting and the blue side should be on the same side as deep space.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you are in a PROGRADE orbit facing the prograde direction, the brown will be to the left and the blue will be to the right.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you are in a RETROGRADE orbit facing prograde, the brown will be on the right and the blue will be on the left.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have the ship oriented this way, position the camera wherever you want. \u00A0Now, when push WASD, the ship will move in the expected directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut don\u0027t get used to this because the game will figure a way to change the roll angle arbitrarily again if you use any of the \u0022point to\u0022 buttons, MJ\u0027s SmartASS, kOS, or anything else that reorients the ship without your manual control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lucky
