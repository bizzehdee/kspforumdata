So the appropriate mods are to be assumed\n\nCurrently I\u0027m trying to create a shuttle-type spaceplane and no matter what I do, it flips over. My newest attempt is a lawn dart in the lower atmosphere, but during re-entry it still behaves like it had its wings attached to the nose or something. I didn\u0027t even know it\u0027s possible that a plane is unstable during re-entry, even though, should it survive that re-entry, it becomes so stable that I\u0027m still able to recover and land it.\n\nSo, here are some pics.

Also, on the wings, the control surfaces further from the middle are set up as flaps with the intent that they would also act as airbrakes and would help stabilize the spaceplane. However, this didn\u0027t seem to help much.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T20:46:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xrayfishx**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T21:42:59Z","Content":"You need some way to move the center of mass to the forward part of the ship during reentry.

Leverage-wise, that could be pulling it around (it would go nose up if that was it). Mount it closer to the center of mass on the vertical stabilizer.\n\nThe air brake is positioned like that because I want it to hold the AoA quite high, like the Shuttle. It is supposed to pull the nose up some, but keep it down should it go too high. It isn\u0027t responsible for flipping it. I know because earlier versions didn\u0027t have an airbrake.\n\nOne thing I thought of myself is that maybe at a high AoA the CoL changes because the lifting body effect becomes stronger relative to wing lift. In that case I would need to have most of my cross-section behind CoM. What I mean is that maybe at 40 degrees angle wings don\u0027t produce much lift and most of what\u0027s affecting the plane is drag. So really I need to be worried about my center of drag, which, I believe, could easily be in front of the CoM in my design. I\u0027ll keep experimenting.\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it,.that could explain the yaw instability as well. \n\nHow could I move the center of drag backwards? Moving CoM forwards more than near the end of the cargo bay is not feasible, because carrying around 5t of dead weight isn\u0027t how I like to play.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T08:50:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 08:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xrayfishx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T09:30:04Z","Content":"The Shuttle used its RCS to maintain stability during the extreme AoA early reentry; if you\u0027re determined to keep the high AoA reentry (which generally isn\u0027t necessary in KSP, even with DRE), half a dozen strategically placed Vernors would replicate the Shuttle RCS."},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:20:37Z","Content":"Delta wings and their secrets... I\u0027ve built a lot of them with FAR but not using RO. Besides things already mentioned, here\u0027s my attempt to explain whats happening. I\u0027m not natively speaking english, so pls be lenient with me, my non-existing drawing skills and my technical expressions...\n\nWhen flying transsonic or supersonic it\u0027s recommended to use arrowed wings, but there are some special facts about them:\n\nAir flows like this at arrowed wings:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/XmauE)\n\nAs you can see, this could decrease vertical control when the tail is in the middle. \n\nFor increase of control capabilities use multi-delta-wings and a bigger or two tails (I prefer All-moving-wings from B9 proc. wings) in the middle and/or like a winglet. In reality thickness of the wing and edge shape would effect airflow too, but I think FAR doesn\u0027t recognize it - changing edge and thickness has no impact to the stability numbers.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/bBG0J)\n\nNow airflow is closer to the fuselage. Pay attention to the lenght of the leading edge. It is greater which leads us to hypersonic flight:\n\nAt arrowed wings and high AoA lift is created by air vortexes at the upper side of the wing. Thus even higher AoA up to 25-30 can be handled easily and increases lift in comparison to the linear method. This effect is known as vortex lift. I hope this link can help: [http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/labs/windtunl/classes/unstaero/vortflo1/vortflo1.html](http://soliton.ae.gatech.edu/labs/windtunl/classes/unstaero/vortflo1/vortflo1.html)\n\nDon\u0027t hesitate to search for other stuff, it\u0027s really interesting, because the behaviour of the vortexes has to be modeled numerically for special usecases, eg. edges of scramjet inlets.\n\nNow long story short the vortexes are mainly related to the length and shape of the leading edge and the shape of the wing. Until the vortexes break down (at very high AoA) they are symmetrical and have the following pressure distribution:\n\n![gZT7B6S.png](http://i.imgur.com/gZT7B6S.png)\n\nSo for your instabilities:\n\n1. Increase leading edge length - change wing shape - you can fly at higher AoA.\n\n2. Use vertical control where the highest pressure occure.\n\nThis is a simple example of your craft and FAR shows nice numbers (don\u0027t pay attention to Xw it\u0027s unimportant):\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This is why, for example, the SR-71 could not exceed something like 8 degrees AoA or it would become unstable (\u0022flip out\u0022 in KSPeze).\n\nIndeed, especially because SR-71 has a long sharp edged body, which should create lift, compared to relative short wings at the back. It\u0027s the same vortex lift mechanism for the body. If I remember correctly they were very surprised during flight simulations that critical AoA is 14 subsonic and 8 degrees while in supersonic flight. But the transition between stable and unstable vortex lift isn\u0027t at a fix AoA. Eg. maneuvers like rolling can create non symmetric lift, which causes yaw torque at the body. But that doesn\u0027t mean, that the vortexes breakdown completly.\n\nAs I said above the shape of the leading edge has a great influence to vortexes.

I forgot air breaks, but it\u0027s rockstable during ascent and reentry, even at high AoA.\nLook at the wing shape and leading edge of the wings, from thick root to thin ends, sharp leading edge and a falciform overall shape of the wing. \n\nCan anyone confirm, that FAR doesn\u0027t recognize thickness and leading edge shape? Or is it B9 proc. wings, because at least in the VAB the colliders of leading edge aren\u0027t updating.\n\nPerhaps one of you might know, if there is a mod which contains ramjets?
