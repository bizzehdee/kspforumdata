So allow me to detail what happened below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent a three man crew to land on Minimus, and they did land. But while one of my Kerbonauts was out exploring one of the frozen methane lakes, I decided that it would be better to move the lander to him, rather than him to the lander because of the distance. So I took the lander to just about one click north of the exploring Kerbonaut (the first man from my agency to set foot on Minimus.), Elcott Kerman. However, the lander ran out of fuel on the burn to land, and crashed - resulting in the death of two Kerbonauts, and the marooning of Elcott.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I set a rescue operation into motion immediately. Another craft landed just three clicks west of Elcott and he was able to board the crew tank of the recovering ship. I decided to leave the recovering ship there for a while just so I had an established presence on Minimus. Until yesterday. When I chose to bring Elcott and the rescue crew home. However, the rescue landing had to be precise and thus it was fuel intensive (I\u0027m still working to perfect landing and insertion technique, I definitely have improved a lot.) So when I lifted them off, they escaped Minimus orbit on a trajectory that put them into a heliocentric orbit. I sent out two rescue crafts to try to intercept them before they were flung into orbit with the sun, but neither yielded any success as craft rendezvous is not something I\u0027ve ever done before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now Elcott and his rescue crew are orbiting the sun - and I need some guidance on how to handle the rescue operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Then just get into a lower or higher orbit than the stranded ship and timewarp. I would do some math to get things close, then EVA across. But you really don\u0027t need to do math. Just wait until they are close and match the orbits.

At a glance, the orbits appear to intersect, so you can theoretically just send your ship up to Max warp and wait for Kerbin to recapture it again. It will take time...a lot of time...but your command pod has infinite life support, right? I\u0027ve done similar experiments with expended landing stages on return trips from Minmus, and they all come back down eventually...well, some crash into the moon first, but they were all recaptured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on that, waiting and warping is your best bet. If you do find yourself on a moon intercept course, see Scott Manley\u0027s video on affecting capsule trajecotry using EVA-ing kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
