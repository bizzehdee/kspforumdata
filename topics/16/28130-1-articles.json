So, as usually I got in a low parking orbit around Kerbal (71,234/96,721) then I commenced the inter-planetary burn. Which put me on course to encounter the gravity of mun. All went well until I was about to put my retrograde burn on. Aligned myself to the retrograde vector and then tried to start my burn.... The engine didn\u0027t fire at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow from previous experience I thought it was a power issue (but this time I installed to solid panels and a battery box on the back of the command module, which was also fully powered at the time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I thought it could be the fact the stage was burnt out, so ditched the stage and started the next. Still nothing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be very great full if someone could give me pointers, thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you undock anything during the flight? Sometimes this randomly causes engines to be set to deactivated status. Right-click on the engine and see if you can change that on the menu. Meanwhile, in the staging display on the right, is there a green fuel capacity bar graph next to the engine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
