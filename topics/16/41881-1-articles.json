If you\u0027re in space or on another planet, instead the \u0027Terminate Flight\u0027 button is active. The only principle difference at this time is that any Kerbals on a terminated flight will go onto the \u0027Missing\u0027 roster, whereas they go on the \u0027Unassigned\u0027 roster if they\u0027re recovered. By default, \u0027missing\u0027 Kerbals will respawn into the Unassigned roster after a period of time. So unless you\u0027ve enabled permadeath by manually editing persistent.sfs, the only penalty presently for terminating versus recovering is that you temporarily lose the Kerbals on the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Career mode I assume \u0027Recover\u0027 will also bring back the parts on the craft in question, or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbuMaia","CreatedById":77637,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T00:14:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that the End Flight button is gone, how can we get a log of how a successful flight went?
