I want to improve the first part of my ascent tho ie when to start my gravity turn (altitude, speed etc).\n\nThe ones im using at the moment which work really well are\n\n1. keep speed under 200 m/s under 10,000 alt\n\n2. keep speed under 500 m/s under 30,000 alt\n\n3. make sure I\u0027m on a 45 degree angle by 20,000 (and time to apoapsis around 50s)\n\n4. get horizontal around 50,000.\n\nThese work well but I\u0027m wondering when u start the turn and at what rate (if I pitch too early, stability can be an issue, but too late and I lose a lot of DeltaV by being inefficient)"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:50:05Z","Content":"not driving anything close to optimal myself, so no protips from me...\n\nbut you could just grab KER (it\u0027s a mod displaying a lot of useful infos) and try to be as close to 100% atmospheric efficiency as possible as soon as you can. that should work for the optimal speed values. since this value is drag dependent it differs from ship to ship.\n\nrest sounds fine, but as i said, not a pro here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T12:13:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 12:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by heng**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"leocrumb","CreatedById":141389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T11:55:56Z","Content":"One thing that really helped is a Scott Manley tip to get that 50s to apoapse time at 45 degrees (absolute gold) (I have Kerbal engineer so I can watch this) then you can use pitch to get either side of the prograde marker to get it there.

While that\u0027s not the case for rockets, it gives some clue as to the thermal problems involved with speed at this altitude; namely they aren\u0027t that bad, and a steeper rocket ascent will give you even less time at this altitude.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![3LHNntf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3LHNntf.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E (Steep angles of ascent are horribly inefficient for SSTOs and means you\u0027re either wasting air-breathing mode, or using more engines than you need, so resist the urge to do them even if they *are* fun.
