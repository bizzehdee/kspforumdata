The way I\u0027ve handled this in the past is to build my satellites as if there was some kind of station-keeping facility (usually just including \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, and 2 or so units of monopropellant per year of planned lifetime).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce they\u0027re launched into the proper orbits, edit the save file to make all of the satellites in the constellation have exactly the same orbital parameters, with no digits after the decimals, and the proper phase separation. They will stay perfectly lined up as long as they stay on rails (you never fly them, or get close enough to load them into physics). I don\u0027t really consider this to be cheating, given there\u0027s no other way to do it that I know of, and I\u0027m spending the extra mass/funds to outfit them for station keeping. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Same technique might work for placing craft at L4/L5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce their station-keeping fuel is \u0022used up\u0022, you can send a \u0022refueling\u0022 mission, or replace them, or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neilcomara","CreatedById":182529,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-31T21:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome\u00A0I\u0027ll have to try that, thanks for the great advice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-31T23:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E that you have to match.
