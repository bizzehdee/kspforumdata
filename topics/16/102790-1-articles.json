This is my ship design:\n\n![test.jpg](http://s22.postimg.org/o6nrbmxyl/test.jpg)\n\nThe controls are reversed and because of that SAS just spins the ship in all directions. Is this a design problem? How can I avoid it?\n\nThis is a design for a landing stage. \n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T17:25:04Z","Content":"It\u0027s a problem with engine gimbals not working properly when the engines are above the center of mass, they move in the opposite of the desired direction.
