In that case, what happens?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, using AlexMoon\u0027s excellent calculator, at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E , I find that to get from Kerbin to Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting at 70 km requires about 1714 m/s of delta-V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting at 1000 km requires 1433 m/s of delta-V\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, surely, if I started off from 1000 km with full fuel tanks (due to refueling at a station there), then surely I would still have almost 300 \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E delta-V when I got to Duna than if I had started at 70 km and taken advantage of the Oberth effect?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it is, overall, less fuel efficient, since it would take me more than 300 m/s of delta-V to circularize the 1000 km orbit from the 70 km one. But if I\u0027m refueling, that doesn\u0027t matter. It only matters how much I have in the tanks at Duna, or how big a tank I need in order to get to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, am I missing something, or is it actually the case that the stock answer of always start low is only applicable if you are not refueling on the way?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-13T14:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2013 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Crater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T12:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve heard, you\u0027re pretty much correct.
