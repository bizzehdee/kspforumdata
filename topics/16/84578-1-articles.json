To prevent the Boosters from skewing I added one strut-connector for each booster (see images). The problem now is, that the version WITH strut-connectors will lean to one side during flight and wants to tilt while the version WITHOUT strut-conns won\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now try to figure out and understand why this is the case. Please note that my primary interest ist NOT to find a solution (like using two struts on each booster), but to understand why it is the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore answering, please consider the following :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The struts I use are perfectly aligned. They are exactly perpendicular to the fuel-Tank and do point exactly to the center of the each booster. I did this by adjusting the .craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thought I could have made a mistake symetrising the struts, the behaivior was the same with normally placed struts (as good as can be done by eye).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The two Rockets are identical (apart from the struts) . I \u0022generated\u0022 the Rocket without struts by removing them from the one with struts, so everything else should be unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The struts work by tension, not by pressure, so they should self-align.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Previously I had the struts at the top, where they work by pressure. The effect was the same but there was an explanation for that : Because they are just a point-to-point connection they cannot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E absorb torque. By \u0022pressing\u0022 at the fuel-tank from both sides, they made the tank to elude to one side (you know what I mean?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the images (3 per Rocket) : The upper ones is with struts, tilting to the left during flight; The lower ones is without struts, going straight up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wWKNS13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wWKNS13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6OSLjmw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226OSLjmw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-14T14:54:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2014 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dieter_G\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dieter_G","CreatedById":121902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T13:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could up my .craft file if needed, if someone tells me how\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T13:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have had the same exact rocket tilt on separate launches - it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dieter_G","CreatedById":121902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T14:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you mean it was just a coincidence ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I tried several times: always the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T15:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe struts have a teensy bit of \u0022give\u0022 on them, before they kick in and hold position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing *any* sort of strutted booster-on-radial connector will lead to either leaning, as your does, or a tendency to spiral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can do though is the minimize the effect a LOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse two struts for each booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t have the struts run straight to the tank, rather have then splayed out.

Some of these points are predefined (axial points), some are ad-hoc set up during build (radial points). These points are rigid relative to the part center. You can imagine these points floating in space around CoM, or connected to the CoM via rigid sticks. Most important point is that this structure is 100% rigid and does not shear, bend or twist under any kind of stress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts are connected by their attach points. Initially, attach point of one part exactly touches attach point of the other part. These two points are held together by a \u0022spring\u0022 that allows some displacement, bending, or twist in the connection, and applies counteracting force proportional to amount of displacement, bending, or twist already in place. That makes the connection flexible while parts are rigid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decoupler is exactly this case - a part that has two attach points, one touching corresponding ad-hoc radial attach point of the center tank, the other touching corresponding ad-hoc radial attach point of the booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA strut \u003Cem\u003Emay be\u003C/em\u003E (and probably is) a different case. Here, the strut itself may be the \u0022spring\u0022. As well as connection between two normal parts is trying to hold attach points of two parts on top of each other, the strut is trying to hold two distant attach points in their exact relative distance and position. And the distance may have some effect on behavior and \u0022springiness\u0022 of the connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-16T12:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2014 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dieter_G","CreatedById":121902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T12:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut now, as I \u0022promised\u0022 yesterday, another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at that :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/07HHUOM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002207HHUOM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/moF5Okg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022moF5Okg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KwpsPoU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KwpsPoU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RxN5RrV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RxN5RrV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9IfKvII.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229IfKvII.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SLi6x4Q.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SLi6x4Q.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tNun3l5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tNun3l5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7M47we7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227M47we7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/86slbkE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002286slbkE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot it ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines are OFF after the second image, speed is negligible.
