How to get to Eeloo generally but ideally under my conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) How to match the maneuver node trajectory more precisely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Is there a better way (mod?) to more precisely plot interplanetary transfers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I have attempted:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is day 257 02:00 I am within 1 hour of the transfer window from Kerbal alarm clock. One day late for the optimal transfer window in AlexMoon\u0027s launch planner.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI plot a prograde burn with the listed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E (2054m/s). I then eyeball the ejection angle listed (109 degrees to prograde).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis generates and change of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E with jool past apoapsis. I fiddle the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E slightly and manage generate an intercept with Eeloo at 25 million km closest approach. This seems far so I fiddle for an hour and never come up with anything better. My idea based on other guides is to call this good enough and then try to adjust it closer by matching inclinations at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then attempt the burn 5 times. Each time I can generate the change of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E with Jool but I can\u0027t match the trajectory precisely enough to generate an Eeloo intercept.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReasons I am having trouble matching the maneuver node\u0027s trajectory. My rocket has 971m/s remaining in a chemical stage and then 1778 m/s in a NERV stage. The chemical stage burns out in 55s and the nuclear stage burns for almost 8 minutes. I have extensive experience flying around the kerbin system and I usually point toward the maneuver node and try to divide my burn evenly around either side of the maneuver node. I\u0027ve struggled to do that here for several reasons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Do I want to divide my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E or my burn time around the maneuver node? I thought logically \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E but when I do that the trajectory has been more off than when I try to divide time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Do I want to burn prograde or toward the maneuver node? I\u0027ve tried both and I can\u0027t tell. I\u0027m limited in my ability to burn toward the maneuver node too far in advance of the maneuver because I end up burning down into the atmo since I am so far around the orbit from the maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, any advice on how to sort this out would we welcome.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EOR\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Did I make some fatal mistake in my rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E or timing and I should convert this to a Jool bound mission instead?

A rule of thumb I\u0027ve seen about long burns is to not exceed 1/6 of an orbit, i.e., 60 degrees. At 80 km your period is around 35 minutes so you\u0027re well over that. It\u0027s probably doable, but it\u0027s going to be a less efficient burn. If I were planning the mission from scratch I would either aim for a higher starting orbit or else try to divide up the burn over multiple orbits (periapsis kicking). From an 80x80 orbit you could preburn around 900 m/s, leaving you a bit over 1100 to finish. Unfortunately the orbit would take you well over a month to return to periapsis so you\u0027d have to plan ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you can do if your first stage has a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is to lower the thrust of the engines so that they match. This gives you a continuous thrust over the whole burn, but unfortunately in your case it would make it a good bit longer. For a more reasonable length of burn I\u0027ll often do that to keep the burn balanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your specific questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The maneuver nodes assume an instantaneous burn right at the node. The best way to approximate that is to start the burn when the time to the node is half the burn time, i.e., half the burn before the node and half after.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What I usually do is switch back and forth. Start burning towards the maneuver node and watch your periapsis. When it starts getting too low (say 71 km), switch to prograde. Once you pass the periapsis you can safely switch back to the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, Eeloo is a tough target. If you can pull off an encounter with the initial burn you\u0027re doing really well. I think I had to do two correction burns before I finally got an intercept. With this long burn it\u0027s going to be even harder. You need to allow a decent margin of extra fuel (10-20%) to make up for the inefficiencies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use MechJeb to do most of my interplanetary transfers. It seems to do a pretty good job most of the time. I also make frequent use of the info windows which display things like degrees to prograde and relative inclination with the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T02:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the long burn time is probably what\u0027s messing you up. My suggestion will be to break it into two burns, since you have an hour remaining. Use the first burn to make sure you come back to your maneuver node at the correct time. That is, burn to set the period of your orbit so that you come around your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E at the right time, and force your maneuver node to be at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. The fact that your orbit will take twice as long will mean that your second burn will be a much smaller fraction of your total orbit, and therefore will not mess up your angles nearly so much. And yes, burn to the maneuver node in this case and not just prograde. Getting to Eeloo requires precision, and the maneuver node gives you precision. Burning prograde gives you efficiency without precision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T05:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat bewing said about\u00A0 splitting your burn over 2 orbits.\u00A0 That\u0027ll knock time off the longer, trickier burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the 2nd burn, I\u0027m going to espouse heresy:\u00A0 Ignore what the transfer-window planner tells you for all except the day (ish) of departure.\u00A0 Your high-efficiency, low-thrust transfer stage will not be able to make the desired burn with sufficient precision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had success getting to Eeloo and Dres with the following (and my apologies in advance for the Giant Wall O\u0027 Text):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Set up a \u0022dummy node\u0022 from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with a prograde burn that gives you an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E at about the right distance from the Sun and an ejection from Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s parallel/tangent to Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 That tells you where you need your FIRST burn in order to get its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E in the right place.\u00A0 (You won\u0027t get an encounter;

You definitely need to employ periapsis kicking here, which means missing the transfer window by possibly a day or two as you loop around repeatedly. But the thing is: because your destination is Eeloo, and Eeloo is really far (in physical distance terms) out there and moving really slowly, your transfer window has a lot of leeway. Moho is the planet that gives you headaches because missing the window by an hour already impacts your transfer. Eeloo is super forgiving.

As you already discovered, there are multiple reasons why you would make a course correction. And they all require different approaches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPlane change. Sometimes you have a transfer window that is located far away from the intersections of your orbit and the target\u0027s orbit (Ascending Node/Descending Node). If the difference in inclination between your location and your destination is significant enough, this makes it \u003Cem\u003Eimpossible\u003C/em\u003E to force a single-burn solution unless you mean to go full-on torch ship. You\u0027ll have to make a second burn at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E in order to reach your target. Sometimes these burns can be quite costly in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFixing your transfer orbit. When you use a low-thrust propulsion solution, your final transfer orbit may be off compared to the simulations, because all the simulations assume an instantaneous change in velocity. Rather than waggle about with your engine on after your node is already completed, you instead cut thrust and make a new node. Maybe fifteen to twenty minutes ahead of your ship\u0027s current position. Use this node to get the intercept back that you wanted. It should typically only require single-digit \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, rarely going into the low double digits.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRefining your intercept. Most missions that want to insert into orbit at the destination generally want to do so with the lowest periapsis possible, but it may be hard to get a nice low periapsis with a maneuver node from really far away, and then also hit that course exactly with your manual throttle control. It\u0027s usually better to do this when you\u0027re closer. Personally, I like to do it right after I\u0027ve entered the destination\u0027s sphere of influence, as you are slowest relative to your destination at that point. Then you can use radial and normal directions to push the periapsis closer to the surface, and adjust whether you\u0027re passing over the poles or by the flanks of the destination (or whererver you want to be passing). You typically don\u0027t use prograde/retrograde here except for precision adjustments; slowing down is what your periapsis is for. The cost of such a refinement node will vary greatly depending on your destination, how you came in, and where you want your periapsis to be, but typically expect a low-ish double digit value.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHonorable (?) mention: changing arrival inclination. Maybe you want a nice equatorial orbit, but your destination has a vastly different orbital inclination than Kerbin, so you\u0027re coming in from above or below the equatorial plane. I\u0027ve seen this confuse and frustrate people a lot, because they typically try to force this with the initial transfer node, or a correction node halfway along the orbit, and it pretty much never works. So it\u0027s important to understand that choosing your arrival inclination is a subset of point three. As you refine your intercept, you choose the position of your periapsis. If you place it over the poles, you get a polar orbit reliably. If you position it over the equator, you get... no, not an equatorial orbit. You get the inclination of your transfer orbit. And anywhere between the pole and the equator, you get a mix. It is \u003Cem\u003Eimpossible\u003C/em\u003E to get an equatorial arrival orbit with a \u003Cem\u003Ecourse correction\u003C/em\u003E when you\u0027re coming in from out of plane. So what do you do? Well, you make a course correction as in step 3 to place your \u003Cs\u003Enode\u003C/s\u003E periapsis directly over the equator. And then, you fold a classic plane change into your \u003Cem\u003Einsertion burn\u003C/em\u003E. Yes, this will be expensive, but: because the pythagorean theorem is a thing, combining a 1,000 m/s retrograde burn with a 1,000 m/s antinormal burn will cost only 1,414 m/s, not 2,000 m/s. And that\u0027s how you \u0022correct your course\u0022 for an equatorial arrival orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what about those course correction nodes halfway along the orbit that people told you to make? Well, they can work, too. You can make intercept refinements from much further away than the edge of the target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it\u0027s typically even cheaper. But the problem with that is that you will be in a different reference frame, so your node handles will be oriented differently, as will your camera. That makes it less intuitive to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlane change nodes, where they are required, will also typically be around halfway along the orbit, give or take some depending on the individual case. And yes, you can even fix an error in your transfer orbit later than right after your initial burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo often enough, a course correction node halfway along he orbit is a \u0022one stop shop\u0022 solution. You match planes, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E fix the transfer burn error, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E reposition the arrival periapsis in one fell swoop. That\u0027s a perfectly valid approach, and many people use it. But I still wanted to break it down into its individual components above, so you better understand what one might try to achieve with various kinds of course corrections. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-22T07:36:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2020 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDumb typo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pahimarus","CreatedById":202283,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-24T00:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone.
