If I were to post one though, I would require that you land the whole ship on the moon and take off again. Using LOR makes the whole thing quite a bit less difficult, since you only need to drop a tiny lander down the Mun\u0027s gravity well. Moreover, after messing about a bit more and seeing how far you can actually get, I think it would be more fun if the objective was landing on multiple bodies. Right now what I envisage is different numbers of points for each body you might land on and return from, based on total deltaV required, For example, I might give 3 points for Minmus, 6 points for Mun, and 1,000 points for Eve. I would also add point multipliers for multiple bodies, upping the body-specific score by a larger factor for higher numbers in sequence. For example, Mun might be worth 6 points as the first body, 12 points as a second body, and 24 points as a third body. In each case, you would have to completely exit the body\u0027s SOI, return to the surface, and then back to Kerbin for successive landings on the same body to count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I would have multiple classes, with higher base scores for the heavier ones. These would include Kerbocycles with only an ECS, Mk1, Mk2, and Mk3 cockpit-based designs. I would probably also have a score enhancement for not using nukes and one for carrying 5\u002B kerbals. All parts would have to be stock, and no navigational aid mods, aerodynamic mods, or extreme part clipping would be allowed. It seems like this would allow for many different strategies for getting the highest score, making the challenge more interesting overall. Anyway, I currently have both a Mk2-based design that can probably do a Mun-Minmus tour and a kerbocycle that has well over 6,000 deltaV at LKO. Once I have these documented as seed missions, I\u0027ll probably go ahead and post the challenge. It will be very interesting to see what people can come up with!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T16:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s the Double Mission Challenge which is involving a lot of SSTM (then back to KSC, then back to the Mun, then back to KSC, then...) designs.
