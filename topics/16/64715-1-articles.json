The Precise Maneuver Node mod can allow you to do the same thing, but I find it easier to push a node back 112 days 11 hours 13 minutes with Mechjeb than to edit it by 9717180 seconds in Precise Maneuver Node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T19:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter shifting around the view and/or zooming in, I find that sometimes I still can\u0027t add a node where I want.
