However when placing two fuel barrels side by side, and engine mounted to the bottom of one barrel can\u0027t access fuel from the other side barrel. Now I\u0027m confused and wondering what exactly are the rules for how fuel flows through components, since it looks like it can travel radially but not if the radial component is another fuel tank, which seems rather arbitrary to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**Edit**\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mentioned that an engine on the bottom of one fuel barrel can\u0027t access fuel from a radially mounted barrel, apparently this is only half true, you can still manually transfer fuel between the two barrels, allowing the engine to access fuel from the side barrel by funneling it through the middle one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-05T19:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2014 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ghost314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T18:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-23%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-23%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T19:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ghost314\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ghost314\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit looks like it can travel radially but not if the radial component is another fuel tank, which seems rather arbitrary to me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour observation is correct (it applies if the part is fuel tank for the requested type of fuel, so if it is e.g. liquid fuel-only tank, it will pass oxidizer request radially but not liquid fuel request - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules-%280-23%29?p=880757\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post880757\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[see here]\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was not that way, any standard staging (central tank -\u0026gt; radial decoupler -\u0026gt; stage tank) would pull the fuel from the central fuel tank first and the central engine would lose all its fuel before the stage you\u0027re willing to drop first.
