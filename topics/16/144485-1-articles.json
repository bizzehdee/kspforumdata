I kinda hope you have two, at least. But the main point goes like this: as long as you are not watching the probe, it does not use any power. It only uses power when the ship has focus. So, if you make sure your batteries are all charged when you switch away from the ship, then they will still be all charged when you come back to it. The way to kill a battery is to not pay attention to whether your solar panels are getting any light, and then timewarp. So, for a probe, make it a habit that the first thing you do is always point one of the solar panels at the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick with disabling a battery was cancelled with version 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a request in the bugtracker for some kind of standby mode for probes, that will stop them from using electricity -- we will see if that gets implemented in some near-future version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, your rocket will drift slightly off-line over time. I just recently had a probe in Minmus orbit end up pointing tail-first at the Sun with drained batteries (I timewarped). I had to wait half an orbit for the probe\u0027s orientation to change a little bit, so that I got enough power to start a tiny rotation -- which got me more power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Reactordrone said, if you point your probe north or south, then it will automatically rotate slowly as it goes around its orbit. You can still end up with short periods where you have no incoming solar power, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zo San","CreatedById":166958,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T01:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the responses!
