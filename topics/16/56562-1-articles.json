It adds 15% to the transmission efficiency of the experiment.

After transmitting them, you can clean them out and they\u0027re ready to go again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe ML allows you to transmit the same experiment from the same ship and location more than once. HOWEVER, the practical limit on this is 2 times because of the 40% overall cap on science earned from transmitting. IOW, the 1st time (including the ML\u0027s bonus) you might get 35% of the available total, the 2nd time you will get the remaining 5% under the limit, and thereafter you can\u0027t get any points for transmitting that experiment in that location at all. You have to return that experiment to get any more points in that location.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENOTE: Sometimes the ML will let you get somewhat over the 40% transmission limit.

The sensor-type experiments are reusable, but the diminishing returns were changed so that even if a transmission only gets you 20% of the value of a return, a second transmission from the same location is going to return much less science (like a third as much as the first one), and each subsequent one is much smaller.
