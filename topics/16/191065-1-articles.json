When I build some rocket and use move gizmo I can place some part to the place, where it partly or fully overlap another part of the vehicle. Even the rocket built in this manner is sometimes fully operable (in other cases it explodes \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0).

Unfortunatelly after reading this threads I am still confused, because some of them seem to be outdated and also full of opposing opinions.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have theese questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Is parts overlapping also called \u0022part clipping\u0022? Or it is something diferent?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) If it is \u0022parts clipping\u0022 then why after checking and unchecking \u0022Part Clipping in Editors\u0022 in game console doesn\u0027t change anything on this behaviour (I didn\u0027t notice any diference)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Why is this even possible in this game which tries to simulate many physics effects\u00A0(I mean building a ship which breaks physics laws)?\u00A0Is it possible to disable it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for all helpful answers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-17T23:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/202293-jirka828/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022202293\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/202293-jirka828/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@jirka828\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Yes, overlapping parts so that they intersect and/or occupy the same space (partially or entirely) is what people mean by \u0022part clipping.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The check box for \u0022Part Clipping in Editors\u0022 doesn\u0027t have as much effect as it used to. As I understand it, the KSP editor was much more stringent about how much overlap it would accept when you attached parts together. I believe this was before the rotate, and translate editor gizmos were introduced. At the time there was a good reason to restrict part placement since it was harder to correct their alignment afterwards and the game wouldn\u0027t let you place parts near each other that overlapped significantly. Now, you can attach parts and then move them out of each other\u0027s way with the editor gizmos if you want to. If I remember correctly, checking the box to allow part clipping may allow you to attach multiple parts to the same attach node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) As a single player sandbox environment game your play style is mainly dependent on the rules you want to enforce on yourself. Adding more player control over part placement opened up greater opportunities for designers of custom and replica builders to experiment with. Some also cite instances where the density, weight distribution, or other properties of stock parts could be considered unrealistic or otherwise too restrictive compared to the options available to real-world craft designers. Consider that in the real world it would be easy to just use a structural girder that\u0027s half the size of the small one in the game if that\u0027s what you needed for your craft. But in the game the only solution might be to attach the girder provided and hide half of it inside the fuel tank or somewhere it won\u0027t be seen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s still entirely possible to build craft without relying on part clipping/overlapping, but the game is simply not as restrictive as it used to be. I am unaware of a way to enforce the restrictions against part clipping - except by sheer willpower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-18T00:00:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2020 12:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jirka828","CreatedById":202293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-18T07:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146104\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@HvP\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBig thanks for your extensive answer!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223729439\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191065\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221579304895\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider that in the real world it would be easy to just use a structural girder that\u0027s half the size of the small one in the game if that\u0027s what you needed for your craft.
