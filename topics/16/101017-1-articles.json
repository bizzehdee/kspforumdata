There were two to collect in-flight, but the third required me to collect one on the surface. Shouldn\u0027t have been a problem... but the site was in the water! Luckily, my gamble paid off when I did a hard landing in the water, shearing off my wings, but luckily I got the point and the contract completed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T15:34:39Z","Content":"Yup.

Company will offer contract considered impossible or stupid just to see who makes bid. If no bid, is really impossible? Then don\u0027t do. Maybe other company can do it, get paid, then is good for everybody and have drinks later. Or cannot do it and have to pay penalty and get sued in court, then reconsider bidding on stupid objective next time. Maybe manager get fired! That is good for few drinks also. \n\nLike sometimes you are Apple, and you make impossible contract, and get maker of SAPPHIRE GLASS which is cool stuff to accept impossible contract. Then drive into bankruptcy and buy assets. No sapphire glass for you!

You just have to pay whatever they gave you as an advance.\n\nI got one (which I accepted) to test the KR-2L at the surface of Mun. I can either cheat and use it for the whole trip, or use it only after landing. Either way it\u0027s going to be hard, but not impossible."}]}
