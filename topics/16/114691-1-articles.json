My orbits always end up elliptical.\n\nWhen launching, once your AP is at where you want it to be, cut your engines. Then, once you\u0027re close to AP, perform your circularization burn. Burn slightly above the horizon to push your AP away from you, burn slightly below to pull it toward you. Alternatively, you can lock your SAS to prograde, and when about a minute away from AP, start burning at max thrust. If your time to AP starts increasing, cut thrust, and wait until the time to AP is lower (for example, when 30 seconds away, and then 15 seconds etc.). Repeat this process with a lower and lower throttle and eventually you\u0027ll get into a nearly circular orbit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) How do I intercept thing also in orbit?

It gives some pretty good hints.\n\nIn short:\n\n0. start with the same orbital plane.\n\n1. Put a maneuver node with an orbit that passes the target orbit a little.\n\n2. look for the markers of target location and your location\n\n3. move your node and adjust the trajectory (both prograde/retrograde and radial/antiradial nodes are useful, as to make the encounter markers as close as possible\n\n4. burn, meet up.\n\n5. when near the target, make sure your speed indicator shows \u0022Target\u0022 (click it, above navball, if it doesn\u0027t)\n\n6. burn retrograde (it\u0027s retrograde relative to the target!) to zero your relative speed\n\n7. aim at the target and burn -a little- - some 10-20m/s is perfectly sufficient for a 5-10km encounter.\n\n8. If you missed by more than 300m, jump back to point 6, repeat as necessary (or alternatively, use RCS \u0022translate\u0022 controls to keep your \u0022prograde\u0022 marker squat in the middle of the \u0022target\u0022 marker, correcting as necessary during the approach)\n\n9.

Is there something wrong in my technique?\n\nOne possibility:\n\nIn orbit, your craft face the same the direction relative to the universe, which means they rotate around relative to Kerbin (or whatever else you\u0027re docking in orbit of). For example, if you\u0027re pointed prograde at one point, half an orbit later you\u0027ll be facing retrograde.\n\nThis can mean you end up having to make lots of small corrections as you try to dock. The usual suggestion is to point your crafts\u0027 ports at the normal and anti-normal directions (e.g. North and South if in an equatorial orbit) as there is no rotation in that plane - the docking ports will keep facing the same way."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:14:28Z","Content":"ElWanderer pretty much has it. Not only does your craft remain pointing in the same direction, but you have to keep in mind that you\u0027re not moving towards your target in a straight line. Instead, both you and the target are moving in circular paths around Kerbin that happen to converge.\n\nIf you\u0027re not lining up along the normal plane, that means that your velocity relative to your target will drift over time.,as will your relative velocity.\n\nAnother technique to try out, once you\u0027re within 1000m or so, is using RCS in translational mode to shift your prograde back across to the target."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:16:18Z","Content":"\u003E One thing I noticed was that during the final approach on dock (less than 1000m), it was very hard to consistently keep my target and prograde aligned (or anti-target and anti-prograde).

Yes, you need to perform the \u0022small burns\u0022 but not with the main engine but with directional RCS. Thing is, at 10km distance 170m misalignment is one degree angle. At 500m it\u0027s already 20 degrees, and escalating fast. Not to mention the shorter orbit of your target the more will the orbital motion spoil your alignment. (two bodies at the same speed but different altitude or not identical orbital plane, will move in an ellipse around each other as they circle the central body. The aim \u0022right for the target\u0022 is a convenient approximation assuming your approach takes significantly less than an orbital period. If you take good several minutes for the approach, the misalignment is to be expected.\n\nThe final docking approach is a different game than the rendezvous approach.

(For one thing, your CoM shifts around as you burn fuel.) You can get it *approximately* right with judicious design, but in practice it will always be off a bit.\n\nThe result of this is that every time you want to, say, thrust directly sideways, your ship will actually torque a bit, which the RCS thrusters will then waste fuel in correcting for. The result is that your craft wobbles and you waste monopropellant.\n\nFortunately, there\u0027s a very subtle and frequently unappreciated feature built into the game. If you turn on \u0022fine control\u0022 mode, your RCS thrusters automatically shift into a mode where they aren\u0027t just all-or-nothing; they can fire at partial thrust, and the game automatically calculates the right thrust levels for all the various thrusters so that the thrust is applied perfectly symmetrically around CoM (e.g. thrusters located farther from CoM will fire at reduced thrust).\n\nThe result is that when you thrust sideways, you get a perfect sideways burn with no torque. This gets rid of wobble and doesn\u0027t spam monopropellant.\n\nNote that it\u0027s not foolproof; if you have a really poorly-designed craft that has very badly asymmetric RCS distribution, such as having all the thrusters located on the same side of the CoM, then there\u0027s nothing that this sort of auto-correct can do to help you. But in general, RCS control works better in fine-control mode for this reason."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:43:28Z","Content":"It\u0027s also useful for rotational control outside of SAS use ... some craft are TOO responsive to rotation controls (because you either have almost nothing or ten times as much)."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:47:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you, this was very helpful.
