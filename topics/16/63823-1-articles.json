Because with a polar orbit the ground is constantly moving under you. So you never pass over the same area. That huge mountain that was 100 meters to the side may be right under you the next pass. I found this out the hard way... So if im going super low its a 0 degree orbit so that Im passing over the same ground every time. I baby sit the craft for a few orbits to make sure theres no mountains coming at me then I leave it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOVE low orbits. So much fun. But.. rendezvous is pure hell.. and sometimes impossible. So be careful on that one. A small plane-change burn could drop your altitude just enough... and its like a fly on a windshield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T01:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Mun_heights.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Wiki you can go as low as 6200m\u003C/a\u003E for inclinations less than 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.
