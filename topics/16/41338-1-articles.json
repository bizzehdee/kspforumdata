Without bragging I can say I make decent ships that should be possible to get to other planets. My problem is getting inside it\u0027s sphere of influence. By \u0022it\u0022 I mean Duna since people says it\u0027s the easiest to go to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already landed on the Mun over 5 times and landed on minmus once. So I think im ready for interplanetary. So when I\u0027m using this manvuever node I do get an intercept. I burn the way it tells me to burn. But I don\u0027t get inside of the sphere of influence of Duna. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing wrong really. I watched alot of tutorial videos but didn\u0027t find them any helpful. Can anyone give me some tips for this or link a good explaining video?

To avoid the node burn time error (the major cause of missed encounters IMHO). blip the throttle of the engine you\u0027ll use to do the burn. That is, tap L-SHF to start the engine up with the least-possible amount of thrust, then a split-second later hit X to kill the engine. This won\u0027t make any noticeable change in your orbit or your upcoming ejection burn, but it will reset the burn time calculator and usually put it right on the button, even for nuclear engines with 6-minute burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: This pretty much a requirement for ALL ships to do burns for any purpose more than a few seconds\u0027 duration if either 1) you\u0027ve never run that engine before, 2) you ran it before, but haven\u0027t run it since you docked that engine to other parts of the ship, or 3) have run the engine before but since then have changed your focus to another ship or quit the game and restarted it. All of the above things screw up the burn-time calculator, so ALWAYS blip the throttle at some point before your burn and don\u0027t do any of the above things until the burn happens, just to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Even failing to blip the throttle isn\u0027t that big a deal on ejection burns. OK, so the burn-time calculator was way off and you did considerably more than 1/2 your burn after the appointed time. No worries. PROVIDED you ejected at the proper time with more or less the right amount of burn in more or less the right direction, you won\u0027t be off very much. Just coast until you leave Keribin\u0027s SOI and wait for the SOI change to happen completely, so your blue path leads in the general direction of the target. Now you can add a maneuver node a short distance ahead of your present position to get the encounter you thought you had before. It probably won\u0027t cost you more than 20-30 delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slugy","CreatedById":76281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T21:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Burn so that you are half way done by the time you get to the maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Watch what is happening in map view!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T21:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a really long burn time (I\u0027ve had burns of up to 20 minutes) another trick is to PE bump: burn at your node until just before you reach escape velocity, stop the burn, time warp around your orbit until you are at the node again (which should be at or close to your PE), then finish your burn.
