I want to build a base on minmus... I have no idea where to begin...

You don\u0027t have any resource-mining mods so about the only purposes you can have are Science! and roleplaying. With the latter, you can just plunk down whatever you want there and pretend it\u0027s doing something cool. With the latter, you should probably have a Mobile Lab although this is more roleplaying than necessary, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving decided what the purpose is, you then need decide on what sort of functional module(s) you need to build to achieve that purpose. Then you need to decide what sort of supporting modules you need to support that function, such as crew quarters, rover barns, etc. Basically, just make a list of all the functions that need to be carried out. Once you\u0027ve done this, you can start figuring out how to get these functional parts to the location. Maybe you can combine several functions into 1 module, maybe other functions need modules all to themselves. The size of modules is mostly limited by the size of the lifter you can build with the parts you\u0027ve unlocked so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your base will be multiple modules arriving separately, then you have to be pretty good at landing them close together. MJ is pretty good for this, at least on places without atmospheres. Some would say too good, tending to land things on top of other things, so probably you\u0027ll have to hover and move over somewhat at the end. But this is Minmus where there\u0027s no gravity so this is no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your stuff is on the ground, you have the question of whether to connect them physically or not, and if so, how. This is where a lot of folks have lots of problems because docking on the ground can be a real hassle. But you\u0027ve got KAS so no problem there. Just get things close enough together and hook them up with pipes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, say you want a science base built around a Mobile Lab. The idea is you\u0027ll have little suborbital landers (NOT rovers) that go out to all the biomes, get samples, and come back, then all the data gets carried into the Mobile Lab. Between lander trips, the Mobile Lab will rearm the goos and bays on the landers. And rather than transmit the data (which wastes science points), you want the Mobile Lab to return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first you need to add stuff to the Mobile Lab so it can land on Minmus, return to Kerbin, and then come down safely by parachute. That\u0027s 1 module. Then you need the landers that will go get the science, 1 module each. Then you need some fuel tanks to refuel the landers, for 1 or more modules. Then you need housing for the lander crews, 1 or more modules. And maybe a power module with lots of solar panels to run the whole thing, but that\u0027s just for show because each module will have enough power to run itself or it wouldn\u0027t be able to get to Minmus anyway. Plunk these down close enough together to connect with KAS, use KAS to refuel the landers between trips, and you\u0027ve got your base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
