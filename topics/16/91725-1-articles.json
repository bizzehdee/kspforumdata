You need to release the cables and move your ship forwards after grappling. 20 meters should do, then lock the cables and use very low thrust so they don\u0027t break.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T14:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, try a long boom made out of xl girder segments with a docking port on one end and a grabbing claw on the other. Difficult to launch, but makes for a very sturdy pulling tether. And the docking port makes sure you can leave the boom in place on the asteroid while you swap out a depleted tug craft for a fresh one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T14:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, using KAS I can assemble this thing in place.
