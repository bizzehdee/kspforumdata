I expect there will be a patch coming out shortly (a week or two at most) to deal with issues players have uncovered that the beta team missed.\n\nFor the moment you can try doing things like attaching air breaks to the capsule to give it drag which will slow it down before getting to deep into the atmosphere (making heat shields less necessary or irrelevant) and applying aerodynamic forces which will help keep it properly oriented."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

There\u0027s already a mod that fixes it.\n\nI have noticed though that atleast with my LKO flights since the update there doesn\u0027t appear to be any heating effect.

The offset angles the capsule enough to produce lift by itself, rather than requiring you to turn it around. It\u0027s... pretty curious. I hope they add \u0027tilty\u0027 heatshields, like the present ones, and \u0027not-tilty\u0027 heatshields that act more like the old deadly re-entry ones, because it\u0027s a neat feature... it\u0027s just really hard to wrap your head around."}]}
