I am kind of new to Kerbal Space Program, but I already have 36 hours of gameplay and I can make my way around...

That I didn\u0027t calculate the fuel right and Bob Kerman with the lander are stuck in the Mun, with no fuel and limited Life Support (I got only ONE shot at this). Now the complicated part: I am not advanced in the tech tree and I only got 1.25m Rocket parts. Fortunatelly I have all 1.25m fuel tanks and Engines, but I do not have RCS, only the simplest inline reaction wheel and AV-R8 Winglet, no precision engineering (small fuel tanks, RCS tanks, fuel ducts, etc) and no docking. I have the Stayputnik, basic eletric systems (small batteries and 1x6 and 2x3 solar panels), basic communications (communotron 16 and Comms DTS-M1) and LT-1 and LT-5 Micro landing struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I\u0027m using: Remote Tech, KW Rocketry, B9 Aerospace (do not have any aerodynamics yet, so it doesn\u0027t make a difference), Ferram Aerospace Research, Deadly Reentry and TAC Life Support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a Simple but working Communications Satelitte Orbiting Kerbin, so sending probes to the Mun are not a problem (as I did send before... it\u0027s still there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo could you help me build a Rocket with the limited parts I have that is able to Land on the Mun and come back?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbeS","CreatedById":80644,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T04:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou just need a DeltaV of like 6000 m/s it isn\u0027t very hard to do, but if you waste too much fuel you would probably need more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T04:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf they are running low on LS then use your first mission to land two pods, food water etc, and a powersource.

Is my own term pretty much, but I use it for reference to aerodynamic drop pod style ships with no exposed components during re-entry phase. Here is sample pod picture for what you pretty much want getting to orbit. I prefer to fly cowboy so when I separate the mun transfer engines, I will sometimes have a bit of fuel left. 5000km to deploy the decel-orbit engines then finish landing on the quads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/470922910250314871/B43DECC424EC6FEC9E8ADC219DC4B92405531C95/\u0022 alt=\u0022B43DECC424EC6FEC9E8ADC219DC4B92405531C95\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDe-orbit so that you leave mun counter to munar orbit, a simple atmo break and you are home. I recommend following for getting it up. Attach to the lander engines the long tanks with the 45 engines powering it. Affix enough booster to get those into orbit without using them since you will need them at the moon. For early boosters, my favorite to use are a sub assembly that consists of the long tank with a tri couple on top to make them a pack of engines. I have two subs for each early on. One that attached via the tri coupler, and the other that attaches radially. This is because whatever part was attached when you pulled off for the sub is what will attach when you use said sub assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
