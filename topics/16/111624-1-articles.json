Great way to check everything ingame.

You can\u0027t land on it---you explode at some low altitude.\n\nJool: High and low orbit mostly. You can get \u0022flying\u0022 if you\u0027re on a suborbital trajectory about to crash there. It is SOMETIMES possible to get surface data there as well, but that depends on the mood the Kraken is in that day. Usually everything goes badly haywire down there as soon as you make contact. In any case, these latter 2 are pretty much only for 1-way trips via probes.\n\nAsteroids: In stock, AFAIK all you can get is a surface sample. Asteroids ain\u0027t planets and don\u0027t have biomes, so even when you\u0027re right next to them you\u0027re still in high (or perhaps low) orbit of either Kerbin or Kerbol. However the mod DMagic Orbital Science has several instruments specifically designed to get science from asteroids."},{"CreatedByName":"bluegasou","CreatedById":145441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T00:02:37Z","Content":"Thanks!

I\u0027ve gotten \u0022while flying at Jool\u0022 results on my initial aerobrake run into Jool, for example, and then happily coasted up to apoapsis and profit.\n\n (Though to get \u0022while flying at Jool\u0022 during aerobrake, I have to wait until I\u0027ve slowed down below escape velocity. As long as I\u0027m still on an escape trajectory, it will still say \u0022in space near Jool,\u0022 regardless of whether I\u0027m physically in atmosphere or not.)"}]}
