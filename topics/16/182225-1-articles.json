This habit usually serves me well. But not now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI now have over 600 savegame files in my main ongoing career game. I CANNOT GET RID OF THEM. I mean, I can and I do -- big bulk-deletes of hundreds at a time, using the usual straightforward Windows shift-click and delete. The files vanish from my directory structure as expected.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut then when I restart KSP from Steam, Steam ADDS THEM BACK. I assume it thinks it\u0027s \u0022fixing\u0022 my \u0022corrupted/missing\u0022 files or some such, and if I were NOT doing it deliberately I\u0027m sure I\u0027d be quite grateful. But it\u0027s starting to take a long time even to display the \u0022Load Save\u0022 dialog, and nigh-impossible to find the particular file I\u0027m looking for in the game\u0027s UI.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow can I circumvent this, and force Steam to let me delete old save files I no longer need?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Yes, KSP will let me delete a file from the \u0022Load Save\u0022 dialog, but ... I can only select/delete ONE at a time. And see above re OVER SIX HUNDRED saves to delete. Surely there\u0027s a better way?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-17T00:16:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re doing it wrong.\u00A0\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EI recall seeing a very very similar thread on this very topic not so long ago.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Try digging through a search (good luck) to see if you can find an answer.\u00A0 I think there was some automated resolution.\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-17T00:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh-ha!\u00A0 As SO OFTEN happens when I admit publicly that I can\u0027t solve a seemingly-simple problem, IMMEDIATELY after posting the question I sorted out an answer that worked at least for me.\u00A0 Posting here in case someone else has a similar issue and wants a similar solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy desired parameters:\u00A0 delete the files I want deleted, while retaining the ability to use Steam\u0027s sync to cloud feature in the future--see above re being glad of this feature if my files actually WERE corrupted.\u00A0 (So turning off cloud sync in Steam won\u0027t work for me, since it retains all those old saves and will \u0027restore\u0027 them the moment I turn the feature on again.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution that worked for me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nStart KSP\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo to Settings and run in window rather than full screen\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWITH KSP STILL RUNNING:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo to Windows, bring up my save folder overstuffed with old saves\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMass-delete old saves as desired\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(Optional) Go back to Settings and revert back to full-screen mode\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nQuit out of KSP\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSteam will re-sync its cloud files when KSP starts and again when it quits--but if done as above, it ends up syncing that folder to its state AFTER DELETING all those old saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll have to go in and do this again every now and then, but it lets me keep the useful parts of Steam\u0027s cloud-sync while still letting me declutter my saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
