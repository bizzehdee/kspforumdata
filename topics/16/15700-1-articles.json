I had to learn how to fly rockets again because I abused mechjeb. Regardless, it is a fantastically written plugin, and I still do use it for orbital info. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"demon_warrior49","CreatedById":35423,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T00:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info. ill try the latest version (i had 1.8.4) and get back to you all.
