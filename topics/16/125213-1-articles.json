Kerbin\u0027s ocean\u0027s now have the same density as regular water - 1 metric tonne per cubic meter. You want your craft\u0027s density to be about the same. So what you can do (and this is a very crude method of doing it; an exact method would involve differential equations) is pop open the engineer\u0027s tab and find your length, width, height and mass. Multiply the length, width and height by one another; this is your crude volume. Divide your mass by your crude volume, and you\u0027ve got your crude density. With a crude density value of less than one, your craft will be positively buoyant and have a tendency to float. With a value greater than one, it\u0027ll be negatively buoyant and have a tendency to sink. In either case, you\u0027ll need propulsion units to counter the buoyant tendencies of your craft; positively buoyant craft can also be made neutrally stable by adding ballast - say a set of monoprop cylinders set on decouplers. And then you\u0027ll need some kind of main propulsion system, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that a craft with a crude density equal to one would also have a tendency to sink. Why? The method of determining volume (length times width times height) is for a rectangular prism (a box). Unless that\u0027s how you\u0027re designing your craft, your actual volume will be somewhat less than this \u0022bounding box\u0022 volume. Volume and density are inversely proportional to one another, so as you decrease volume, density increases. Fair warning that you\u0027re really probably looking for a value somewhere in the 0.9-1.0 range, with the exact break even value dependent on your craft\u0027s design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat oughta be enough to get you started. I will say this - air acts like a fluid (the five words that give meteorologists nightmares), so almost anything you can apply to an aircraft you can apply to a submarine. You\u0027re just dealing with a medium with a roughly thousandfold increase in density.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T19:36:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T18:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThankies\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T19:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how popular making submarines is going to be in general, now that water behaves as it should.
