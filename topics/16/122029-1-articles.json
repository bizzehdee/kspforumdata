If the idea is to retrieve the lander later, you\u0027ll need to think of another solution - such as additional docking ports on the sides of the payload. Otherwise, you\u0027ll have unavoidable floppiness (and a strong potential for splodiness) all the way in. Getting those in the correct position is tricky but rewarding if you can manage it. And if you don\u0027t have to redock the lander, then struts are all you should need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow heavy is that lander? It looks awful small to be going in a Mk3 Cargo Bay.
