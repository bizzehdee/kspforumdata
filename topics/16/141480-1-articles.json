To save fuel when returning to LKO, I aerobrake and I thought I could facilitate the process by using the A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E. part but it tends to heat up much before the engines which I face towards the front/heat. It\u0027s a hassle to have to keep deploying and retracting them twice every orbit and I\u0027m not sure they really make that much difference. Does anyone have any techniques I can use? I saw what I presumed to be airbrakes on video of the SpaceX rocket landing and they had holes in, presumably preventing them from getting as hot as they would otherwise, even if that makes them less effective per unit area. Perhaps a girder attached to the outside of an airbrake would behave similarly if the airbrakes were located in a more recessed position?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rHmSqL8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rHmSqL8.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"archenemy_6","CreatedById":160281,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T00:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think if you want a more aggressive aerobrake you\u0027ll need to switch to a heat shield.
