Every time I think I have a good grasp on the mechanics of it, the weirdness of driving in low gravity gets me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is my rover in its current incarnation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i34.tinypic.com/29vxthx.png\u0022 alt=\u002229vxthx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love some stern critique of the design, since it handles like a unicycle on a skating rink. It is impossible to achieve a speed beyond 12-14 m/s because even at about 2-4 m/s, it starts to lean heavily to one side, and if I somehow keep it straight long enough to accelerate for a while, the back wheels begin to float off the ground. The rover will completely flip over if I don\u0027t lay up on the throttle. ...oddly enough, the rover is also capable of flipping itself upright even when upside-down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027d love your input on wheel placement, mass distribution, basic rover principles, etc. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T20:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re seeing is the effects of your pod\u0027s torque. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange your control mappings so that your driving controls are not the same as your maneuvering controls, that way using the rover wheels doesn\u0027t cause the whole craft to flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently wrecked one of my rovers the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T20:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree with Odin.

After that, I highly recommend including ASAS and some RCS in the design. Even without the RCS, the ASAS will make your rover much stable, since it will try to keep it up with the command pod torque. When It trouble you can just hit RCS and with that the ASAS will keep it level short of total loss of control (like if you roll your rover at 50 m/s in microgravity). The RCS can also be helpful if you want extra friction for acceleration (you can \u0022push\u0022 the rover downward) and as a effective emergency break when rolling downhill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one of my stablest rovers. It has 2 probe cores (for extra torque) and is build around the ASAS unit. It has quite a good store of RCS, but since I hardly ever switch it on, it can last for VERY long time. It is prefectly stable driving at 40 m/s over mountains on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1289.photobucket.com/user/yes753cac/media/screenshot20_zps8574a4ce.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1289.photobucket.com/albums/b514/yes753cac/screenshot20_zps8574a4ce.jpg:original\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot20_zps8574a4ce.jpg:original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-20T20:53:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2013 08:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Torham234\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastodon","CreatedById":57231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T21:26:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas others have said, go to the main menu, go to settings, and remap your controls.
