Not because its floating out besides the craft, turns out that doesn\u0027t make any difference at all. It being upside down reduces drag more than right side up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven this, I\u0027d give an arm and leg for a wind tunnel or some sort of drag preview, especially with respect to drag occlusion. Testing aerodynamics is becoming a bit laborious. Anyone know of any tools or tips besides doing comparative dry runs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T06:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, been known for a while. It\u0027s because it reduces the drag at the front and the back of the craft when switched around like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too would love some way of getting at least a vague idea of the drag of a craft whilst in the VAB/SPH. Just a \u0022this is the total drag when flying in a straight line at 1000m\u0022 would do. Would then at least allow you to compare craft and parts as you add, remove and change them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T16:44:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also love to see some kind of wind tunnel mod, maybe an extension of RCS build aid? This kind of stuff is quite tedious to test in a repeatable way. When 1.0 came out TweakScale did not scale drag at all, and it took quite long for people to even notice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
