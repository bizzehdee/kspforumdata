This will give you a much better idea of whats going on on your final approach and get your orientation correct. I\u0027ve done picture perfect captures because of this mod. I know this isnt really helpful on getting close to it... but hey. Another mod to look at is Mechanical Jeb 2 AKA MechJeb AKA MJ2. This can make the node planning take a second instead of minutes trying to get it right. Anyways... on to the meat and gravy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1. Place something in orbit to dock with. Place it about 120Km or so up. Have it face in a Normal or Anti-Normal position (facing north/south). This helps prevent confusion and even give you impression that its spinning when in fact, its not. More often than not, if you see Kerbin, you will try to use that as a point of reference instead of the target. I speak from experience on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2. Launch your ship that you are going to use for the docking procedure. Launch when you have a phase angle of about 45-60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I\u0027m not entirely sure since I\u0027m used to something in a 300km orbit, and I had to launch with a PA of about 85\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or I\u0027d shoot past my transfer window before I got other stuff done. Try to get a near circular orbit, this will help in keeping your separation distance down at time of closest approach. Set you\u0027re initial orbit lower than your targets, as this allows you to catch up to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3. Align planes to match. MJ2 helps greatly with this, I always aim for an inclination difference of .01\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or better. Burn at the AN and DN, If not using MJ, set up a node to plan it out, get it 0.0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4. Transfer burn.... have MJ2 setup this as well, or try to plan it with a 6km separation or better. Try to get the burn right and start cutting back on the throttle when it approaches 0 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV for the node. you want a .1 m/s difference, otherwise your separation is going to suffer. You\u0027ll also want to be ahead of the target and not behind it on closest approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5. Fine tuning and final approach. When your target is about 10km start slowing down your relative velocity. I\u0027m assuming you have an idea of what the markers mean... you\u0027ll want to burn facing the retro-marker of the target. During this stage you can fine tune your closest approach so a 4.4km separation becomes a 0.0km separation. As you start getting closer to the target (and as your relative velocity drops) you\u0027ll see the retro marker shift. You want this marker on the pink triangle at all times. To make this happen, note the angle and distances at which retro marker is to where the triangle is (or the direction of your target). Point your ship along the same angle and direction and past the Retro Marker (or RM), and set SAS. Burn until the RM is back on the triangle, cut engines move back to the RM. Start slowing down even further. As you slow down, the RM will shift, do the same thing as it shifts. When you\u0027re within 1km of the target, slow down to about 10m/s relative velocity, and then 5 at 300m and so on. When you are slow enough (3m/s or so) you can start using your RCS translation controls (IJKL, much like WASD, H/N to thrust forward backward) to move the RM back on the target. at about 50m, use RCS to kill your velocity, then start guiding it in. Its really simple once you get the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember, slow adjustments with RCS, and an direction you thrust in, you\u0027ll have to thrust the opposite direction to kill your movement.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T21:21:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sovek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EmanonP","CreatedById":60201,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T21:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry these out.

Preferably at a round number. if you can get it at exactly 120km up at both periapsis and apoapsis then it makes your intercept easier. You know exacly what orbit you are trying to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) design your docking vessel. It should include: RCS thrusters that can turn/move the ship in all 3 axis. Plenty of RCS fuel. ASAS. Plenty of fuel for a rocket engine to achieve a close approach/intercept. Also it should have lights and a power source to illuminate the docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) launch your docking vessel; and set your target as your target using a right click in the map view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) At either the ascending or descending node burn south or north to \u0022align\u0022 your orbit with the target. Just click on them to set a maneuver nod and adjust the pink triangle orbit accordingly. You\u0027ll know you\u0027re aligned when you see the AN/DN quickly flip sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Generally I start in a lower orbit and \u0022catch up\u0022 to your target. As you get closer, speed up at apoapsis (or sooner if necessary) into a slightly higher orbit getting closer and closer to the targets orbit. The closer you are to your targets orbit the slower your relative speed will change. If I overshoot then speed up to a higher orbit (higher than the target orbit). Burns are often imperfect; you may need to repeat step 4 to ensure the orbits are aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When you get to within 5km of the target click on the velocity display and toggle it from \u0022orbit\u0022 to \u0022target\u0022. Then point your nose at the target Purple circle using the nav-ball and accelerate toward it at 10-50 m/s. As you close turn and prepare to burn opposite your relative velocity (they yellow circle with an x in it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) When you notice that you are no longer getting closer to your target burn toward the yellow circle with an x in it until you reach zero relative velocity (with the target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Repeat 6 \u0026amp; 7, but as you get closer you will need to reduce your speed to just a few m/s. If you find yourself within 100 meters of your target you should burn to zero relative velocity and move to RCS power and \u0022docking mode\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Disable your rocket engines. When you are trying to maneuver for docking you will probably accidentally throttle up your engines. Just disable them to avoid a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Point yourself at your target and use RCS thrusters to move closer. I usually leave SAS on, but wait until in \u0022docking\u0022 mode to turn on the RCS. Just be prepared to turn off RCS as you are \u0022coasting\u0022 in so that SAS doesn\u0027t use all your RCS gas just keeping it stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) When you get really close (less than 30 meters) don\u0027t move toward the target but instead move toward the empty space along the side/end where you intend to dock. Once you reach that space near the docking port, then zero your relative speed, go back to the \u0022normal\u0022 maneuver mode to turn your craft to directly align your docking port with the target docking port. Then switch back to docking mode and close the last 30 meters with very careful RCS maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) If you bump the target and it begins spinning then time accelerate briefly to stabilize it and then repeat step 11 to try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T23:38:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 11:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Alistone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brienne","CreatedById":59216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T07:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWatch tuto... \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/15652-Orbital-Mechanics-101-A-Kerbal-Space-Program-Tutorial\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/15652-Orbital-Mechanics-101-A-Kerbal-Space-Program-Tutorial\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to really understand: while you re close to the vesssel you re aiming for, switch to \u0022Target\u0022 mod with your Navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPro/retrograde marks are now related to the Target.
