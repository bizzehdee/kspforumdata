And vice versa. Burning before apogee raises/lowers the apogee rather than the perigee and pushes it away from your craft. Burning after apogee raises/lowers it too, but pushes it in the other direction. And of course, if you burn enough at apogee, it becomes perigee, when raising the orbit.

So if you\\\u0027re about to reach apogee and thrust to increase speed, the apogee moves away from you, \u0027ahead\u0027 of you. Likewise, if you\\\u0027re past apogee and increase speed, you push the apogee away from you, \u0027behind\u0027 you. The effect only becomes really noticeable, though, if you have similar apogee/perigee heights, because obviously to shift a highly elliptical orbit halfway across a planet requires a DAMN LOT of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut try it for yourself. Get into an orbit. Any orbit. Then get to apogee and increase speed a little to lift perigee up to apogee level. And then play with it. If you\\\u0027re right between apogee and perigee, you should be able to raise/lower your total orbit with a burn (though, of course, you\\\u0027ll have to expend as much fuel as you would have to if burning at perigee to raise apogee, then up at perigee to get the apogee up, so don\\\u0027t expect to see a lot of change for a little thrust!).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-15T18:30:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, fair enough...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\\\u0027s say I\\\u0027m in a circular parking orbit around Kearth/Kerbin, with the Mun at 12 o\\\u0027clock (N), and I want to \u0027aim\u0027 my apoapsis at 10 o\\\u0027clock (NW).
