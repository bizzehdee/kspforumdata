From my understanding, none of these should affect missions in any way.\n\nAny help or suggestions would be much appreciated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027ll upload some screenshots to Imgur.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

As said, the usual problem is orbiting the wrong way, but one of your screenshots shows an Ascending Node of NaN degrees, which usually means it\u0027s almost perfectly zero. If you are orbiting the right way I assume you\u0027ll try closing and re-starting the game."},{"CreatedByName":"jwilhite","CreatedById":90637,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:09:18Z","Content":"You really don\u0027t have to be very exact in order to complete the satellite missions. If the two orbits just look pretty close when you eyeball it, the contract will complete just fine. So, as others have said, it isn\u0027t your precision that\u0027s the problem. You\u0027re probably just going the wrong direction."}]}
