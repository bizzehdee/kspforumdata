I don\u0027t play anything else.\n\nI like the feeling of achievement when you unlock some new science or finish a contract. And I think that it teaches a lot about the game and the physics, because it starts with few parts, but also without the advanced probe core and pilots. Also, because you do not have limitless cash, it teaches you to be (at least a little) efficient in your designs.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, maceemiller said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, sorry to bring up an old thread [...]\n\u003E \n\nIt ain\u0027t necroing if you\u0027re the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
