I noticed that there\u0027s this cool new retraction animation that some of the docks do now when you decouple them.

KSP vehicles can\u0027t have any loops of connected parts, so I\u0027m pretty sure your whole ship was being held together by the docking port on the lower left. The other two ports were attached only to the docking port above them, and not to the adapter below them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure about the best way to prevent this. I\u0027m assuming you don\u0027t have access to a senior docking port if you\u0027re doing this trick in the first place, and since detached ship parts can\u0027t be edited in the VAB, I can\u0027t think of an easy way to force the docking ports to be attached to the lower adapter. Maybe if you made the station module the first part, then added the capsule to the top?

I\u0027m a bit OCD about stuff like that, I want my space station parts to be neatly facing the right sides, or at clean 90 degrees from others. Even if you\u0027re really really careful with the singular senior docks you inevitably end up with tons of wiggle in your space station\u0027s central axis and all of the things you attach to that axis end up looking like the spindly branches of a skinny tree (see Goon Station for a fine example of this). I think there might be a way to edit the parts files and force all of the docks to be aligned along a common value, but I consider that cheating at that point. Multi-docks is the only \u0022legit\u0022 way to ensure everything is straight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the reason I managed it back in 0.21 was because I gave every single module it\u0027s own command pod, every part of the station was it\u0027s own small independent spacecraft, which helped me put the thing together. The problem is that at the end I had a ridiculous amount of redundant parts that weighed the whole thing down (all the same it looked pretty cool... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/THKJ975.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/THKJ975.png\u003C/a\u003E). Here I\u0027m trying to make most modules \u0022dumb\u0022, but that seems to be what\u0027s breaking the multi-docks. And yeah, I did another test, it\u0027s not a special animation it\u0027s just the dock sinking into the separated spacecraft as it breaks off. Any triple dock that isn\u0027t part of the \u0022main\u0022 craft snaps right off when you disconnect them.
