The small ones are fairly robust, for the weight they are made to hold, but the large ones seem to be made to hold the same as the small ones (strength and impact tolerances are identical). The only real difference is how much they weigh and their ejection force. As it is now, you could literally use a small stack decoupler wherever you use a large one and you would be saving yourself .45 tons per. Not only are struts your friend, but their placement really matters (don\u0027t attatch struts to decouplers).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T14:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked at the rocket and there seem to be three things causing problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

At current, the structural connections on the large parts are a little weak, but the actual structure of the rocket itself outside of the mounting point react different. This is why you might find large rockets running alot smoother. The large decoupler itself is also a bit weak for the output of the engines. Much similar to what henge says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy common re-inforcement to this is to use the small structural hardpoints (the non jettisoned ones) around the lower fuel stage. Use this to attach structural members to link past the coupler to the upper stage. Another thing to consider is the more complex fuel and thrust mechanics. The 2m high thrust engines often can be too much acceleration for a heavy rocket entering orbit. It sometimes helps to reduce your thrust to prevent wobble and structural collapse. You can do this by simply reducing throttle, or what I have done is fuel line link my outer ring of engines to my inner one. As I gain higher altitude, the outer tanks and engines run out and are jettisoned, the inner stage still has full tanks. Once in space, use the efficent small engines for your travelling. It might not be as quick, but you won\u0027t overpower your structure, and the increased fuel efficiency allows you to cut out some weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMunRules#1","CreatedById":17298,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-06T16:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheHengeProphet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheHengeProphet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(don\u0027t attatch struts to decouplers).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not?
