However, I cannot get the ports to work to attach my craft for refueling. I figured maybe I attached them incorrectly or something, so I went back to the sandbox and pulled up the prefabricated crater crawler, which have built-in docking ports. As a test, I have two of them (with extra fuel tanks) just off the Kerbin runway. My plan was to test the concept and see if I could transfer fuel from one to the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I cannot\u00A0for the life of me get the ports to work.

It\u0027s much easier and simple. Just arm the claw, get close to rocket and grab it (it\u0027ll attach to object on contact), then transfer the fuel before releasing it again. You can grab and refuel the rocket from any direction instead being limited to a docking port. Docking ports is kinda hard to use when attached to rover since you only have 2 axis adjustment while the usage of docking port needs 3 axis adjustment to be effective. The grabber claw can also be used in orbit to refuel spacecraft\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-13T22:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223353730\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173867\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523654690\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022181256\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Klapaucius\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n32 minutes ago, Klapaucius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I cannot\u00A0for the life of me get the ports to work.

Once they undock from each other, you need to get them about 10 meters apart before they will reactivate and you can dock them again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the major point is probably clipping and colliders. That is almost always the cause of explosions, and it also prevents docking. If you have other parts near your docking ports, and those other parts bump into each other before the docking rings fully touch and dock -- then those other parts bumping into each other will prevent the docking. Now, when I look close at your image, below your docking ports I think I see a couple of parts bumping into each other. Make absolutely sure that your docking ports touch each other first, and that they have a lot of clearance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, it seems unlikely that you want to be using docking ports for this at all. To attach for refueling, you almost always want to be using a Klaw, and not a docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n32 minutes ago, Klapaucius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting, as well.
