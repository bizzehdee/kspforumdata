In case just works for Debian, which distro is the best or more user friendly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T23:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUbuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu or any other *buntu you\u0027ll find is probably very user friendly.

I\u0027ve been playing KSP on Ubuntu no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of variants, regular Ubuntu is a pretty different UI to Windows. You might like it, you might not. Linux Mint (separate, but based on Ubuntu) has a more familiar interface and is well-regarded. If you want something quite streamlined, along the lines of XP interface-wise (but without the fisher price looks), try Lubuntu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
