Part of the problem is a fundamental difficulty in game design with trying to please everyone, when different players have radically different ideas of what\u0027s fun versus what\u0027s an annoying chore. Some people are like me (and, I suspect, you), and view gathering science as a fun challenge and a major point of the game. Such people likely find the MPL to be overpowered and game-dampening. On the other hand, a lot of folks view science as an annoying grind, and want to get it out of the way so they can get on to what they consider the fun bits. I can see how the MPL would really help with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, it is how it is.

There\u0027s no \u0022percent\u0022 provided by the MPL, it just turns results into data and data into science points as I described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like to use the MPL but find it too overpowered, one thing that you can do to mitigate it slightly is to install a life support mod, like TAC-LS. That makes your Kerbals require consumable supplies over time to stay alive, so that means if you want to park some scientists in a lab for many weeks doing research, you have to keep them supplied with oxygen and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T19:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the great things about KSP is it can be easily configured to fit whatever play style you want.

In the time it takes to get level-3 scientists trained up and into your science base (assuming low-energy transfers), a very focused player, playing on the Normal skill level, can clear the stock tech tree entirely. I don\u0027t typically play quite that focused, but my minmus surface base pulls down about 9 science per Kerbin Day with two level-3 scientists on board. Including travel time, a single-manned science lander with an untrained pilot can easily beat that on science return, even if it only lands in one biome, and it\u0027s not that difficult to build a lander that can hit multple biomes over Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
