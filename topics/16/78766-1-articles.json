Standard launch procedure for me is to await the \u0022tower clear!\u0022 and begin to point my velocity vector east, following it until I reach 45 degrees then holding my navball there while the velocity vector continues towards the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time I wanted to launch into a polar orbit so I immediately began heading south after clearing the tower. The most important thing to note during the launch is at 1:19 you can see I have my pitch at full deflection just to prevent my rocket from tipping over past 45 degrees. I\u0027ve never had to hold even close to full deflection before to do this during a launch. When the SRBs drop and I lose thrust prior to main engine throttle up, the rocket flips out because I didn\u0027t zero out my pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if turning over towards the south was a bad idea, and if I should have began east and gradually increased my velocity vector towards north/south as I ascended. I can\u0027t think of any other reason why I had the pitch issue with the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother guess is the use of the RealChute nose cones to recover the SRBs. In all previous launches I\u0027ve used stock Squad nose cones. I usually just use a sub-assembly for the lift stage but in this case I had to remove and replace the SRBs - perhaps I put them on a tad bit angled? Doubtful, since I used part symmetry and EditorExtensions to get them evenly spaced around the rocket. But still, that is the only other change in this launch besides the southward turn over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-21T19:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2014 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T05:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that you don\u0027t have enough thrust at the point you separate your SRBs. It looks like you are playing with FAR (Hard to tell from your toolbar) which means you should probably start your turn at about 200m, not whatever altitude you started at, it should also be a smooth turn, with very few jumps in pitch. As your SRBs start running out of fuel start throttling up your LFB. Another option (Depending on your TWR for your SRBs) is to have your Liquid engine ignite at the same time your SRBs separate, then you just have to keep your throttle on full and your engine will start at full thrust when it\u0027s ignited, which will help you push through the massive wall of air that builds up in front of your rocket because of those SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roastduck","CreatedById":98490,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T05:55:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically what Taki said, but I would actually slightly lower the launch TWR by tweaking the SRBs a little. With FAR, I\u0027ve always felt more comfortable with a launch TWR of about 1.3. As far as the gravity turn, instead of doing it at a specific altitude, as soon as your velocity hits 100m/s, start pitching over about 2-4 degrees, then just follow the prograde marker. Once you nudge it over that first time, it will naturally keep shifting very slightly. Let it creep over, and just keep pointing right down the center of it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T06:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 tweak those SRBs down for an initial TWR of about 1.1 to 1.2 (1.3 is fine, too). Between 75 and 100 m/s surface vertical speed, pitchover 2-5 degrees. Follow the prograde vector, adjusting the throttle so that your gravity turn is gentle and aerodynamic. You want to be within 5-10 degrees of horizontal by the time you reach 50 km altitude.
