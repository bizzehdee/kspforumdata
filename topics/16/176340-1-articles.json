Hold SHIFT, then drag the decoupler out of the cargo bay. Attach your rover to the decoupler. Use the MOVE TOOL again and select your decoupler. Press SPACEBAR and the decoupler should recenter on the node in the cargo bay. Test before you leave Kerbin. Duna\u0027s gravity is slighter than Kerbin\u0027s, so there should be no trouble at Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBe sure to let us know if that works! Good luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
