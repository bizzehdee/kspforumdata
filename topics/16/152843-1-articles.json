Something I\u0027ve started to notice recently is that if a planned maneuver node is two weeks or more in the future, the Delta-V needed will change while the craft is loaded. Not by a lot, but enough that I should probably wait until the maneuver is almost due to fine-tune and execute it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this normal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DD_bwest","CreatedById":164906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T19:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndo you see it changing while your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is on to try and point towards your node?\u00A0\u00A0 if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E is on, it can slightly change your orbital parameters, the more orbits out(actually, the further out in general) your node is, the more these small changes will effect your node.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe thats the case atleast, ive observed behavior like that, and by not using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters so far in advance, the problem went away\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T19:52:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DD_bwest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T04:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a number of causes for this. \u00A0As \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/164906-dd_bwest/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022164906\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/164906-dd_bwest/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DD_bwest\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0says, having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E activated can cause this, even if not actually being used at the time. \u00A0There are also a bunch of things going on under the hood in KSP such as rounding off and the whole thing about the orbital decay we used to have and the fixes for it that we now have, that cause things to change slightly over time. \u00A0Also, if you have Kerbal Alarm Clock, you might have set it to recalculate nodes periodically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, nothing\u0027s ever exact, perfect, or constant in KSP due to various inherent limitations of the game itself. \u00A0And even if they were, the interface prevents us from executing nodes perfectly anyway. \u00A0But you can get close enough for government work so I just quit worrying about all this some years ago, unless orbits just refuse to be stable or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E changes more than a a couple dozen m/s. \u00A0Then there\u0027s something really wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
