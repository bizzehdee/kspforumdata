If the inclination change is sufficiently large, it can save you fuel to raise apoapsis to almost escape velocity, perform your plane change at apoapsis, and then shrink the apoapsis back down, because inclination changes require delta-V proportional to velocity. If it is a target orbiting the same body, you will set up your plane change at the ascending/descending node.

Here\u0027s how I enter into an equatorial orbit around such planets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: Adjust your periapsis so that it passes over or close to the equator of the target planet (since there are no stock tools that tell you where the equator is, just use your best judgment). Essentially, your periapsis is crossing the AN or DN of the planet\u0027s equatorial plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Perform an insertion burn/aerobrake that is just enough to get captured by the planet. At this point, you will have an inclined orbit with both a low periapsis and a very high apoapsis that cross the AN or DN of the planet\u0027s equatorial plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Fix your inclination at apoapsis. Since your apoapsis is so high, you will only be traveling 10-50 m/s, which means that inclination changes are very cheap.
