Instead of building an enormous launch vehicle to lift my payload fully fueled, I\u0027d rather launch it unfueled on a smaller rocket. I could then launch a couple follow-on missions to rendezvous with it and fuel it in orbit. If anybody knows how to do this, your help is appreciated?

I got the same obsessive refusal to have strut remnants on my pristine ships.\u003Cp\u003EMore on topic, sending up payloads dry is pretty simple. As have been mentioned there are several ways of doing this. Empty the tanks before launch, or use payload tanks as fuel-source for your first stage by means of mods - like Goodspeed Fuel Pump that is a must have either way to cut down on tedious manual fuel transfers. Especially useful for when using in orbit Fuel Depots and such. Just dock, and fuel is transferred automatically according to how you\u0027ve configured your fuel tanks. Now if only Goodspeed would include other resources like say Life Support and such...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
