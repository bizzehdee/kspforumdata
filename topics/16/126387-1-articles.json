The M700, to the best of my knowledge, works perfectly. It shows ore concentration on the map as it should. However, after it scans, it automatically transmits its information, yet the tracking center claims that it has no data. Whenever I try again on the spacecraft, it works fine again. I\u0026#39;ve scanned Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus, each with a separate spacecraft, and none of them work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other issue, which is probably me doing something wrong or simply doesn\u0026#39;t exist, is that the narrow-band scanner and the surface scanner doesn\u0026#39;t seem to update anything or be \u0022remembered\u0022 in any way. Is there some way to make it remember what I scan with these, or do I just have to try to remember it?\n"}]}
