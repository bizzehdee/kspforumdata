One Idea I have is to create another set of arms that come up and attach to middle of the original arms to provide support when the craft is under acceleration.\n\nIs this possible?\n\nTo put it simply, is it possible to have a craft dock with itself/Is it possible to attach a part that is not a strut to more than one part?\n\nIf not, is there a mod that will allow me to do one or both of these things?"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T07:43:23Z","Content":"One option I can think of: struts from KAS, which you can attach and connect in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T11:16:52Z","Content":"I\u0027ve taken the liberty of moving this to Gameplay Questions, a better place for this sort of question.\n\nMultiple docking connections are definitely possible, and ships can dock with themselves if they are flexible enough to bring the ports into contact.
