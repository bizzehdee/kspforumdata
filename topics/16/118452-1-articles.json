I landed on slope of Minmus and when kerbal got off from external seat they just fall all the way down the hill. I waited for a long time hoping he would stop, but due to low gravity he just gain speed and finally died. it\u0027s so annoying and I can\u0027t switch on his EVA thruster to stable him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eare there any ways to make sure kerbals stand straight after leaving external seat? Thanks all\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T13:27:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI take it the seat was radially attached on the vertical side of a tank or something? In that case, you have several options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut some radial part under the seat so the Kerbal will appear standing on this. It has to be somewhat lower than the seat\u0027s back or he\u0027ll just go flying. The part can be anything, an engine, a structural panel, a solar panel, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, all that said, there are hills on Minmus too steep for Kerbals to stand on at all. Just contacting the ground there will send them rolling down the hill. So if you\u0027re in such a place, the only solution is to land elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T14:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas the kerbal ragdolling? Unless they\u0027re in ragdoll mode (which generally only gets triggered from colliding with something), just switch on your EVA thrusters and fly him/her to safety. (This is especially easy on a low-grav world like Minmus, where the EVA thrusters pack enough punch to take a kerbal all the way to orbit, if you are so inclined.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
