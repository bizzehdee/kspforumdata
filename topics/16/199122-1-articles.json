Two years ago my method was to just use mechjeb but since it is nowhere near as accurate and realistic as the script I\u00A0abandoned it and never went back to it. The problem is my script requires the impact position given by the Trajectories mod and since it does not give you the trajectory and impact position for the non active vessel, I cannot land the boosters simultaneously. I can do the boostback burn by making one booster copy another but it\u0027ll be of no use if I can\u0027t land them. Writing script to predict impact position on\u00A0an atmospheric body sounds way too complicated and I doubt I have the time and skills for that. Is there any way to get the impact position for two vessels taking into account lift, drag and the rotation of Kerbin?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-27T19:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this is not a suggestion for the game\u0027s development, the thread has been moved to the gameplay sub.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
