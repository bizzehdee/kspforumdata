All the added pilot/probe capabilities after basic SAS \u0022attitude hold\u0022 are pretty much useless, and eat RCS/electricity like candy. So as soon as you get the 2nd probe core, all remaining probe cores are functionally interchangeable for most purposes and it really pretty much does devolve to a matter of aesthetics. (Which also bugs me, as the sizes/shapes I am most fond of are the VERY LAST probe cores, highest in the tech tree--the small and large axial-stack cores. And of course the Mk2 spaceplane drone core, though that can be gotten around by sticking a less-pretty probe core in a Mk2 cargo bay.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T19:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eseriously the tweak everything mod does exactly what all you people are asking for \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T19:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027m on the fence about the probe core issue.
