I know I\u0027ve only started playing, but I like to think that I am not *that* bad, if inexperienced. In career mode, (which I\u0027m still working on), I get whatever mods look interesting, which currently include Mechjeb (I refuse to use the automatic transfer. Period.) I also have remote tech (which complicates unmanned missions). On the tech tree, I don\u0027t have atomic engines, and I have the very basic rockomax parts (not the big capsules or anything though.) Oh, and I \u003Cstrong\u003Ejust\u003C/strong\u003E got the first clamp-o-tron like an hour ago. My problem is that I wanna go to Duna, but I want to return too. I barely have enough fuel for a flyby, and I can\u0027t get my periapsis low enough to aerobrake; it\u0027s requires too much precision. However, I think the main problem is my ship design.

After performing that burn I trim the intercept down to low Duna orbit (I usually do this at the ascending/descending node). Simply adjust normal/antinormal to get the intercept to the desired inclination, and then its usually a slight prograde/retrograde or radial/antiradial adjustment to get the periapsis down below Ike\u0027s orbit. The further away you are, the less dV you\u0027ll need to adjust, but the less control you\u0027ll have. So don\u0027t be afraid to do this multiple times as you get closer. I usually set my final aerobrake altitude by burning radial/antiradial at the edge on Duna\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T21:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use (almost) optimal transfer windows, a return mission to Duna requires only a little more fuel than a similar mission to Mun. The mission profile is a bit different, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a mission to Mun, you need 7500 m/s of delta-v, allowing some margin of error. After reaching a parking orbit around Kerbin, you should have at least 2800 m/s left to complete the mission. To be able to return to Kerbin, the lander should have at least 1000 m/s remaining at takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a Duna mission, the total delta-v requirement is around 8000 m/s, with a similar margin of error. This assumes either aerobraking at Duna or a using a risky strategy, where you just set your periapsis below 10 km and hope to hit reasonably level ground. Add 500 m/s for establishing a low orbit around Duna before landing, if you don\u0027t like aerobraking. At the parking orbit around Kerbin, you should have 3300 m/s remaining (or 3800 m/s, if you don\u0027t plan to aerobrake). Reaching Duna and landing at it requires surprisingly little delta-v, as you can use atmospheric drag and parachutes to kill most of the speed. Bringing enough parachutes for a safe landing is not advisable, however. It\u0027s more fuel efficient to carry fewer parachutes and do a short burn just before landing to bring the speed to a safe level. The lander should have at least 2000 m/s remaining to return to Kerbin. This also assumes aerobraking or just diving deep into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere - establishing an orbit around Kerbin can be expensive after interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T00:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for those fiddly little adjustments when you\u0027re half an interstellar orbit away, try using single taps of RCS, does wonders (but plot a maneuver node first so you know what it will do!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T03:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kind of enjoy building early career mode ships, but the low-tech phase lasts so little and getting science is so grindy, so I play sandbox instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I would probably build something \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/jltsiren/stuff/duna_low-tech1.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike this\u003C/a\u003E for an early career mode mission to Duna.

After ditching the empty fuel tank, the lander has almost 2600 m/s remaining for slowing down to orbital speeds, landing, and returning home. The big parachutes on top of the fuel tanks are intended for Duna landing. If you repack them, you can probably bring the entire lander back in one piece.

This saves 0.08 tonnes for the four panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There were some ladders attached to the parts you have already removed, and some of those ladders had matching pairs on the other side of the ship. By removing four ladder components, you save 0.02 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter these modifications, your lander is 1.25 tonnes lighter. If that does not increase delta-v enough, you can add more fuel to the lander. Two FL-T100 fuel tanks add 1.125 tonnes to the mass, and the lander would still be lighter than originally. FL-T200 fuel tanks could also be acceptable, as your transfer stage has a lot of extra fuel. You could also use half-empty FL-T800 fuel tanks instead of the full FL-T400 tanks in your lander, and fill them from the transfer stage before detaching it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T13:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022saamoz1014\u0022 data-cite=\u0022saamoz1014\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m a little hesitant about building a ship, or refuelling it in orbit, since I only have the basic clamp-o-trons.

This helps a lot! Once you get your intercept, focus on duna, your trajectory (within duna\u0027s SOI) wil display there, and you can actually look at it well. Use RCS (or in my case, I used Ion engines) to set up your orbit to be prograde and equatorial, if you\u0027re coming in on a hohman trasfer from Kerbin, you\u0027ll want to set your perapsis at 12,000 to 12,000 - Remember not to time warp across SOI changes (ie during kerbin escape, and when entering Duna\u0027s SOI), otherwise you may find this changing significantly, of course, once you enter Duna\u0027s SOI, make sure to set it to 12,000-12,500 again, this allows you to spend very little fuel to circularize your orbit in a stable orbit with an apopsis between 50-100 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you can do, is avoid a \u0022direct ascent\u0022 from Duna. I\u0027ve gotten better at orbital rendevous (I don\u0027t use mech jeb, or any addons like that), there is no sense in taking the fuel you need to get from Duna\u0027s orbit to Kerbin, all the way down to Duna, and then back up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave that fuel in orbit around duna, and simply link up with it again after getting back into duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did twice last night was not optimal - I had way more fuel than I needed (using 2x nuclear engines), and I took 2 command pods (the 3 person capsule, and then a 2 person lander) - extra weight, I could have eliminated the 3 person pod and put on a light probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could easily just leave a fuel tank with a docking port - no need to make it a fully functioning ship like I did (with its own pod, engines, RCS, etc), or maybe a fuel tank with a small probe core and some fixed solar panels, and docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 1st lander used 2x flt-400 tanks, and that flat rockomax tank (I think it holds the same amount as an FL-800?), and 3 aerospike engines with the two outer under the fl-400 tanks, feeding into the center (making it a 2 stage asparagus design). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerospikes were not chosen because the atmosphere was any concern, but because they are short, they have a much better thrust to weight than the nuclear engines (which were left in orbit), and they have a good ISP (the highest non nuclear ISP is 390, which they have and they have the higher TWR of all the 390 ISP engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually came in an aerobraked retrograde, and forgot to put separators, so I ended up taking the whole thing into orbit again as an SSTO - a retrograde orbit, because thats how my interplanetary stage was orbiting. It made it into orbit, despite carrying as deadweight 2x aerospikes (only the 3rd was going for the last part due to the fuel lines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the 2nd time, I used only 2 aerospikes, and instead of the central aerospike, I put a little rover underneath for the kerbonauts to use (clearance was sufficient).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt landed at a higher altitude (only used about 1 second of burn prior to touchdown), got into a prograde orbit without issue, linked with the interplanetary stage (nukes and ions), and since I had brought way more fuel than I needed, I refueled it, and left it in orbit, transfered the crew to my interplanetary stage, and waited for the return window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for all future launches, I won\u0027t bring a lander, I\u0027ll just bring fuel for my SSTO lander orbiting duna, and whatever payload I want to soft land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd time, I also launched my interplanetary stage, and lander stage seperately, and did a rendevous in kerbin orbit - no fuel savings there (its actually a bit of a waste), but the rocket launches were much more manageable than the very complex and high part count behemoth I launched the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this method, I need to scale down my launchers (7 large orange tanks, asparagus staged), as I basically brought over fullly fueled orange tank\u0027s worth of fuel all the way to duna - ie, my central orange tank - the orbital insertion stage had plenty of fuel left for both the lander and the interplanetary nuclear/ion \u0022tug\u0022, so I shut off their main engines, and took them to duna too, I also left them there (like I\u0027ve done with many fuel tanks around the mun and minmus), I\u0027m now in the habit of over-building my rockets, and when its time to head back to Kerbin, I guess how much fuel I need to get back (ussually with a good margin, and my main stage normally has ions, so I can ussully get it home if I run out, though it may take a while), and leave the rest in orbit with a small docking port for future use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death Engineering","CreatedById":68528,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T16:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iCNdrjyl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iCNdrjyl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, setting the conics patch mode to \u00270\u0027 should make adjusting your encounters from great distances much more precise.
