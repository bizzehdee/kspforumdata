I can\u0027t get the gravity assist calculators (like KSPTOT or\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbal-transfer-illustrator.netlify.app/Flyby\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbal-transfer-illustrator.netlify.app/Flyby\u003C/a\u003E) to work (or please tell me ways to calculate this). I want to know if it is possible to do this at a regular (ish) interval in time. I guess any multi flyby that is \u0026lt;1200m/s is also nice. I\u0027ve been wondering about this for years... I think in general Jool has to be opposite to Kerbin at launch (or you miss Jool even if you can get it to intersect Jool orbit) but I\u0027m not sure about the specifics?

It can do double flybys. It is not made for casual use and is not user friendly, but you can see the entire process that FF uses, step by step. It now does 6 bodies and includes the OPM planets.

To look for one such trajectory, create a maneuver node, leave it at 0 m/s, and right click on it to select next orbit. so you\u0027ll find intercepts on the next orbit. click again next orbit, you\u0027ll find intercepts two orbits in the future. eventually, you\u0027re bound to find a close approach that\u0027s close enough you can adjust your trajectory to take it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe kerbin-kerbin flyby is even easier: the key for a kerbin-kerbin passage is to eject into an orbit that lasts an exact number of years. if you eject into a orbit lasting 3 years, you are guaranteed that in 3 years your ship will come back in the same spot, kerbin will be in the same spot, so you\u0027ll have another encounter. you can measure the time of a planned orbit by making a maneuver node in that orbit and selecting it, it will be displayed in the lower left corner. this same trick is used to pass twice on any planet, you need an orbital time multiple of that of the target planet. or perhaps you can take a fractional resonance; for example you eject into a orbit lasting one year and a half exactly, so in 3 years your ship will have completed 2 orbits and kerbin will have completed 3 orbits and you will be in the same spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for jool, same thing as I said for the first kerbin flyby. if jool is close enough when you pass near apoapsis, you can make a slight correction in your gravity assist to get an encounter. otherwise, you will have to complete an orbit, and possibly more orbits, until jool will be close enough that a small correction will get you there.\u00A0 if you don\u0027t have issues with time, then you are guaranteed to find encounters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a general rule, I found that the key to chaining multiple gravity assists is to not plan them in advance. you cannot plan them in advance, because the game is not accurate after a while. you take the first flyby, then you wait a few orbits if necessary. and if you can find real spacecraft trajectories, you may notice actual orbital engineers also use this tactic. rosetta didn\u0027t meet its comet at its first apoapsis. parker solar probe is not meeting venus at every orbit. also, getting immediate multiple assists, like the voyager probes did, requires some very special planetary alignments. making multiple passages delayed by multiple orbits does not require any timing at all. I don\u0027t even bother checking transfer windows when using those trajectories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neven when time is a factor, it\u0027s generally not a problem. most of my missions use life support. but the thing is, when you are close to the sun maneuvers are expensive, but orbits are short, so you can afford to wait many orbits to find that moho intercept. when you are far from the sun, you may need to burn extra fuel to speed up an encounter, but maneuvers are cheap so you can afford the extra fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso I suggest, first thing go to eve. try to get a trajectory that intersects kerbin\u0027s orbit, and worry about meeting kerbin afterwards. it\u0027s good practice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-17T21:30:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2023 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eddy119","CreatedById":216429,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-21T02:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for this guys...
