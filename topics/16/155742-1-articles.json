It is important how the stick is named for KSP, no two identical sticks can be used without mismatchs. Other external programs can be used to supplement KSP and allow more functionality, different settings, or else. There could be really a lot to write about sticks and I would not even start with the basics without knowing more of this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
