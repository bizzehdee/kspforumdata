I\u0027m comfortable with a bingo fuel reentry. Right now it gets into an 85km x -60km suborbital trajectory. My flight pattern involves getting up to Mach 2.5 around 15km on afterburners, then cutting over to rockets for the rest of the flight (keeping jets on until they starve out for the extra savings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI originally tried a single-core plane without the extra fuel on the front; it behaved similarly, but I had to enter a shallow dive from 10km to punch through the Mach barrier.

But I\u0027m picky that way -- so don\u0027t take any of this as a criticism. Since you are so close to getting to\u00A0orbit, you may just want to implement\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of these suggestions and run with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) After generating the initial speed and altitude, the airbreathing engines are basically dead weight (until after reentry at least). The panther is the lightest decent jet engine, but it\u0027s still darn\u00A0heavy.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ESo you only want ONE in your design.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) An SSTO must minimize drag and weight. The front end of your plane is very good for this. The back end, not so much. Why two tailfins? At most you need one. And it should be as small as possible to minimize drag and weight. Do you have advanced reaction wheels yet? You could substitute one and get rid of many/all of your control surfaces -- control surfaces add a lot of drag and weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) There is a bug with fuel ducts and struts right now that make them add an insane amount of drag. Like, 5 times as much drag as the rest of the plane, combined.\u00A0I see two fuel ducts, at least. Are you dead-set against doing manual fuel transfers in flight? Jet engines can access fuel everywhere in the plane without using fuel ducts. So if you put your rocket tanks in front of your rockets, then you don\u0027t need fuel ducts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any struts on that thing? If so, try hard to get rid of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Two to four little canard wings would completely substitute for every single control surface you have on that plane, AND give you more lift. Bahfooey on negative control surfaces. (\u0026lt;- this opinion is not universally shared).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Terriers are lighter than thuds\u00A0and are much more efficient. I promise that 120kN of thrust is more than enough to get you to orbit, if your plane is a little lighter and less draggy.\u00A0So combining with point 1) and 3) -- get rid of the thuds, get rid of the two extra panthers, replace the two panthers with terriers, and move all the rocket fuel into the nacelles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- Beyond that, panthers need a little help in order to get into their high-thrust regime -- somewhere\u00A0just over 400 m/s. You can go into a shallow dive at 7 or 8 km altitude (often the best strategy with a panther). Or you can turn on the rockets for a few seconds. The panthers are guaranteed to flame out when you hit about 940 m/s -- as low as 17km altitude. After that it\u0027s all rockets, and I advise letting the nose rise by itself to a 30 degree attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. in 1.1.2 there is also a bug with \u0022body lift\u0022 being zero. It has already been fixed for the next version -- so what that means is that any SSTO you make now will perform a little better in 1.1.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-20T15:23:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2016 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T14:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be tempted to say the Thuds are not a great solution,\u00A0\u00A0their Vacuum ISP is rather low, and above 10km is effectively \u0022vacuum\u0022 as far as ISP is concerned -

It\u0027s not just about the plane feeling nice to fly. As AeroGav was saying, it\u0027s also about the amount of engine thrust that needs to be devoted to keeping the plane from plummeting back to the ground. A plane with more lift needs a lower AoA and less thrust. But it\u0027s a bit of a tradeoff with part count, weight, cost,\u00A0and total drag. Your wings have an effective area of a little over 4. It\u0027s easy to try a couple experiments to increase that number by 50% or 100% and see what happens. And what happens is that you end up in orbit with more fuel. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222595658\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463925707\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022117163\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jovus\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same goes for the control surfaces - that and I don\u0027t have any electricity generation on the craft, and I\u0027m using TAC-LS, so I don\u0027t want to drain my batteries just to keep the nose up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know that all those control surfaces all use electricity all the time, right? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-22T16:48:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2016 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T18:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222595772\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463932175\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour wings have an effective area of a little over 4.
