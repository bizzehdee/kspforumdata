And the control station needs one more. I don\u0027t know for sure which are getting the 2 units right now. But you need at least 4 to power everything.

Just remember- when it gets dark, you\u0027ll have no power; there\u0027s a mod called Deployable Batteries that adds deployable batteries specifically to counter this issue, but you need to charge them up in daylight so you\u0027ll still need more solar panels to run the whole thing either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
