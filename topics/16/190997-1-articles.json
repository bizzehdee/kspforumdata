When you have more than one pair of docking ports connecting two spaceships then you need to undock all of them to separate them. Yes, one of the pairs is the \u0022primary\u0022 in the sense that the order which part is parent and which is a child to its connected parts goes through this, but when you undock this and there are other docked ports, then one of these other becomes the new \u0022primary\u0022 until you undocked all of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may have been different in earlier versions, but 1.8.1 behaves as I said.

The only known fix was to edit the save game, identifying the ports in question and altering their states. Either that, or relaunching the vessel(s) and hoping that you would have better luck next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot too long ago, I had that happen to me.
