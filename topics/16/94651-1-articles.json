You want to go high, avoiding most of the atmosphere, just as you would to get into orbit. You should be able to do the usual ~10km vertical climb, then turn to the north and aim for your target. I\u0027m surprised that Mechjeb can\u0027t hit those targets... What is it doing instead?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly though, the most efficient way to get around Kerbin is by high altitude jet. The flights take a while, but you can build some amazingly long distance fliers and return all (or nearly all, if you use drop tanks) of the vehicle to base for a full refund.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greep","CreatedById":132944,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T06:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDepends, how good are you at landing a small plane?

Harder to build, but once you have a good one flying it to the destination is easy, albeit slow for long flights, though you can potentially hit multiple sites in a single trip.
