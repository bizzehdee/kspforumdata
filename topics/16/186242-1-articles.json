For the trip home Jeb rode in the crew cabin with Bob, and the new guy piloted for the trip home. Unfortunately the new guy messed up the de orbit burn, wound up re encountering the Mun again and then ran out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 A second rescue mission was launched with the same ship design piloted by Valentina with Bill in the back seat. Of course on arrival it was discovered that only one Kerbal could be rescued. Bob drew the long straw and Valentina, Bob and Bill headed home. Because Jeb\u0027s stricken ship was halfway home when the rescuers arrived, Valentina arrived in low Kerbal orbit with a ton of spare fuel, so she cleverly burned it all to give everyone a nice low speed re-entry. She jettisoned the the empty tanks and engine at about 60,000 meters. Soon it was apparent that there were some small mountains ahead and Valentina delayed parachute deployment to let the ship coast past them. It almost worked but at 4000m AGL it was clear the far side of the mountain was a cliff and it was directly below. Valentina manually activated full parachute deployment and gave the order to abandon ship. She then EVA\u0027d, jumped and pulled the rip cord. Bill transferred forward to the command pod and did the same. Last man out was Bob. Upon Eva, while still clinging to the ship, it was discovered that he had no option labelled \u0022deploy parachute\u0022. Maybe scientists do not get issued parachutes? Bob got back in the capsule and decided to take his chances, riding the ship in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Meanwhile our two parachutists had realized that due to a very limited choice of landing spots they would be unable to land simultaneously. Seeing this Valentina decided to execute some hard spiral turns to lose altitude rapidly, giving her time to clear the landing area for Bill. Unfortunately she forgot to set her altimeter properly, and she thought she was 2500m AGL when she was 2500m ASL, and augured in at about 120 m/sec. Bill landed safely about two minutes later, finding no trace of Valentina\u0027s body. So he called in the recovery crew. Valentina was posted as missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Now Kerbals must have a pretty amazing recovery organization because they returned to the scene in time to see Bob and the parachuting spacecraft touch down at a graceful 4.2 m/sec. On an eighty degree slope. The spacecraft was destroyed and poor Bob went with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The odd part is, Bob was listed as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E, not missing like Valentina. The persistent file listed him as \u0022assigned\u0022 even though his craft was destroyed and the pieces were recovered. I went into the persistent file and editted \u0022assigned\u0022 to \u0022available\u0022 but even after a complete game shutdown and reload he is still listed as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E in the astronaut centre lists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 How do I get Bob back?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-10T23:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223632702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186242\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562802076\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196475\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ron Devu\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Ron Devu said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I get Bob back?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen your persistent file twice.

This is very bad because I think the chute deployed then disappeared. The moral of the story is, jump first, give it second to clear the ship, THEN deploy your chute.
