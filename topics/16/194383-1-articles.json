Right-click the SEQ-3 (or SEQ-9) and pick any of the parts inside it, then hover over a Kerbal and drop it into the empty square in their personal inventory. Move the Kerbal somewhere on the ground and then click the little icon beside the deployable part (it looks like an arrow with a circle) to deploy it. When the part appears in front of your Kerbal, press space to deploy it. For best results, deploy the central control station FIRST, then power supplies, and finally science experiments. If using CommNet you will probably need the deployable comm dish anywhere beyond Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.
