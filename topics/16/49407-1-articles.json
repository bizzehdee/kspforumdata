But then the button for logging data is permanently gone. I cannot use the thermometer ever again, even when I reach a low orbit! Is this intentional? If so, why would this one part be one-time use when all other science parts can be reused? As a possible related issue, why would the temperature display read -199.98C when the actual temperature of the part is 0C?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T15:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThread closed, if you have more issues about the termomether please create a new topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, that temperature reading is just fine, you can achieve such temperatures IRL somewhat easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
