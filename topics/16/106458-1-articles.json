So I get a ship up into Kerbin orbit and realize the target is in a retrograde orbit - that is, he is going the opposite direction of all the planets.\n\nWow. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to manage this. To just cancel out my initial orbital direction (that is, head straight for the sun) I need 9k DV from high Kerbin orbit. So I will need even more than that to match the target\u0027s orbit. So, something like 21,000 DV just to catch the target, plus about 5k DV to get into HKO.\n\nETA: I just tried something else. If I intercept the target at his orbit, and then turn around and match his velocity, I can get to him with about 9k DV from HKO. Better, but still a huge deal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T02:09:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Pnakotic","CreatedById":115416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:07:01Z","Content":"Well now you know why they needed rescuing. \u0022Hey, [RocketBlam\u0027s Space Program], we screwed up REALLY badly...\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:07:56Z","Content":"Is he on a trajectory that intersects a a planet?

But it\u0027s still going to take something like 9k DV from HKO to get to him and get him on board. Then, I\u0027m still in a retro orbit and will have to somehow nail the return coming into Kerbin going the wrong way."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:53:42Z","Content":"Moved to the how-to section."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:12:11Z","Content":"If I may also complain, I too have been getting absurd rescue missions that I feel need to be nerfed.
