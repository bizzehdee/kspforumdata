The primary thing I would add is that Center of Lift is also known as Center of Pressure, and also happens to be Center of Drag*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*This explains why CoP behind center of mass gives you stability: just imagine fixing center of mass, and a force trying to push CoP/CoD backwards. If CoD is already behind CoM, that force stabilizes your aircraft: it\u0027ll try to keep CoD where it already is. Put CoD in front of CoM, and you\u0027ll have a wild ride of trying to keep your plane stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lopez de la Osa","CreatedById":131759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T15:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had read that tutorial, and is awersome to learn about aerodinamics, but I think my problem is about Kerbal software...
