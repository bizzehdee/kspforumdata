One to provide the lift, the other to counter the spin that the main rotor (or other same-sized rotor in some cases) causes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the traditional helicopter design consists of a large rotating blade to provide lift, and a smaller, tail-mounted blade that spins to move air to counteract the spin naturally induced by the main rotor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAH-64 Apache\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMI-17/MI-8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMI-24\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUH-60 Blackhawk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, just because you have two rotors, does not mean you have to put one on the tail vertically mounted. You may be able to get by with a dual-rotor design where both rotors are nearly equally sized. Designs that use this way of dual-rotors are...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECH-47 Chinook\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECH-46 Sea Knight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EH-21 Workhorse \u0022Flying Banana\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMV-22 Osprey (Albeit not a true helicopter, in VTOL mode it uses the dual rotors in this manner.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven still, there\u0027s another way you can avoid using a tail rotor. Some design houses, such as Kamov in particular will use two rotors that counter-rotate (read: rotate the opposite direction) that are stacked on top of each other. The two I\u0027m most familiar with are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKA-52/KA-50\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKA-137\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust google those designs and you\u0027ll see that helicopters are a bit hard to do without having dual rotors. I\u0027m not a flight engineer but I think this may be intrinsic to a successful helicopter, you need a rotor to stabilize your copter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Genius Evil","CreatedById":72989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T23:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!
