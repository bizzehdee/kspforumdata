The game switch from normal time warp to x4 max physical time warp. (Just like during the assend). The Eve atmosphere starts at 102 km although you need to go as far as 95 km for the loss of orbit due to the aero braking become noticeable. So you for short time operation such as pick up crew 97 km is ok. But you may be hit by the bug that sometimes occurs when orbit of two ships pass throw upper atmosphere of the planet. This bug lock you from switching the ship or returning to space center.
