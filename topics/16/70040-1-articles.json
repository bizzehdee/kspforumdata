Everything I flew would just go crazy shortly after I left the launch pad. Incredibly simple designs, perfctly stable designs, nothing worked. I did some testing and discovered that there were some automatic controls that were intentionally pushing my rocket off-course. I made several posts about it on the forums and also one on the FAR page in the Spaceport, but I never got a response from anyone who actually understood what was happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never figured out how or why it was happening, but the second time I tried FAR it mysteriously didn\u0027t happen and everything was fine. I\u0027d suggest you try uninstalling it completely and reinstalling FAR from scratch. This time, make sure you have the most up to date version. Also try keeping the FAR flight manager closed. You really don\u0027t need it. Just put the big fins on the back and your rockets will be prevented from going unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
