At what AP are you when you start your deorbital burn? How low are you when this happens? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally I dont come in any higher than 100km AP, and set my PE to around 5km above the KSC for my target. I try and stay around 20-30km till I get my speed down below mach 5, then I slowly drop down below 20km. I highly suggest airbrakes on the aircraft or spoilers to help slow yourself down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is generally my re-entry and launch profile for getting into orbit with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/437BSL9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022437BSL9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CZxJINb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CZxJINb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is a good picture of one of my craft FB-1 reaching lower atmosphere.

You ideally want it just behind it, but not super close. Next your numbers are bad, bad, bad. To much red. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you want something closer to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x1UwMhy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x1UwMhy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5GJp75N.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225GJp75N.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how the numbers are all green. This is good, red is bad. You can hover over them to see what they mean in game. But for a stable aircraft or SSTO you want something that can stay in the green across a wide variety of speeds and altitudes. I generally sacrifice high speed maneuverability on my larger cargo hauling SSTOs in favor of low speed stability and gentleness of flight. This makes them easy to land and fly normally, but a bit of a pig at hypersonic speeds just before it gets to orbital velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T18:43:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AFSATCOM","CreatedById":137572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T19:10:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main question here is how can the plane be stable in reverse with the CoL that far behind the CoM.

The faster you go your CoL will shift like real life. At supersonic speeds your CoL will shift back on the wings of the craft, moving your overall CoL back on the aircraft. This becomes more exaggerated at hypersonic speeds. And if you have the wrong shape of wing it could cause the craft to stop generating lift where you expect it to altogether. If you look at most of my designs you will a common design feature, same for Wanderfound, the other SSTO \u0022expert\u0022 here on the forums. Between the two of us we have put pretty much anything with wings into orbit and on other planets in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue I just remembered is if you end up \u0022overflying\u0022 the aircraft, or getting your AoA to far from your direction of travel you will cause the craft to generate lift in different ways. Some wings may stall and lose lift, others may start to turn into the main wings shifting your CoL drastically in another direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain FAR is not easy, but it isnt that hard once you get a grasp on it. The best bit of advice I can give is start small, and work your way up from there. After all the first supersonic aircraft wasn\u0027t the Concord, it was the Bell X-1 which was tiny by comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
