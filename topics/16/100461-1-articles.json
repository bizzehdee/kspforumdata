Build the end of the wing in full width. Then Alt-Click the innermost wing segment to copy it, place it, adjust the outer wingtips.\n\n- control surfaces can be tricky to place on angled wings. I mostly use the free snap setting combined with shift-wasdqe and the rotation gizmos to align them properly."},{"CreatedByName":"jsisidore","CreatedById":137847,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T10:29:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The gizmos are the 4 small icons in the top left corner of the editor (the keys 1 to 4 are assigned to them).\n\u003E 1 is standard mode as you know from the editor\n\u003E \n\u003E 2 is moving a part after you placed it\n\u003E \n\u003E 3 is rotating a part after you placed it\n\u003E \n\u003E 4 is reassigning the root part\n\nWhat version is that?
