I\u0027m using TT-38K radial decouplers to attach LFO tanks and rocket engines around a central core stage (which contains liquid fuel and turbojet engines). The turbojets in the center stage are pulling fuel from the LFO tanks even though there\u0027s a radial decoupler in between and no fuel duct! Maybe I somehow screwed things up by adding mods or something...? The only way I can think of to fix this would be TweakableEverything."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T21:21:42Z","Content":"Turboramjets now pull fuel from every unlocked source of fuel, whether it\u0027s in the same stage, or not. It\u0027s for airplanes, so they don\u0027t get unbalanced. Rockets shouldn\u0027t do that, if they do you may have a bug of some sort."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:45:53Z","Content":"MRS has the answer for this particular case, all airbreathing engines and the Rapier in rocket mode ignore crossfeed rules and drain evenly from tanks in the same stage, with stage being determined by the number of decouplers between the tank and the root part.\n\nFor posterity for anyone finding this thread later I should point out something unexpected: Radial decouplers don\u0027t block crossfeed. The reason you don\u0027t see it much is because it only works when there\u0027s a non fuel tank part attached to the decoupler."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T01:26:50Z","Content":"This sounds like a measure to help with in-flight stability as tanks drain..."},{"CreatedByName":"KBluey","CreatedById":110157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T05:23:28Z","Content":"Aha! I see the point, but it would be nice to be able to block the crossfeed when I don\u0027t want it.

Crossfeed has been enabled on all radial decouplers. \n\nThis is a bit of a pain since fuel lines are kinda deep into the tech tree. \n\nPrevious messing with junos taught me that the toggle works fine for air breathers (or junos at least), excepting that if you toggle while in flight the UI does not change to show that it\u0027s been enabled.\n\n(I had a couple of drop tanks on the wings of an aircraft, toggled in flight and nothing happened, gave up and continued flying. a little while later I had trouble with the damn thing rolling, figure out one drop tank was empty and the other was full...)"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T03:55:52Z","Content":"Yes, the rules changed for air breathers \u002B RAPIER closed cycle in 1.0.5.
