I assume the \u0027SkinToIntFlux\u0027 is the transfer rate between the skin and the internal, and it\u0027s a high number. When I pitch the craft up, the canards cool down very rapidly. By keeping the nose up as high as I can (it kinda rocks up and down) my canards have a chance to cool down. As the craft pitches down, the canards heat up to dangerous levels but they cool off again at the peak of the oscillation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the radiator that is making this happen. Without it, I can\u0027t keep my canards.\u00A0Eventually, the internal temperature slowly rises and reduces its cooling effect, but by that time we are out of the danger zone. Without the radiator the internal temp rises much faster and I can\u0027t cool the canards long enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my craft can make it to Jools lower atmosphere intact. Now I need to work on the ascent back out, and that unfortunately has some opposite requirements to the descent. Weird things are happening to the CoM as fuel is consumed, the\u00A0front heat shield throws me around a bit as I get back to supersonic (around 2500ms on Jool at 150km altitude). The problem with putting the CoM forward is that I can\u0027t pitch up well to cool my canards on the descent, but if put it too far back I have difficulty controlling the ascent. On my last test I touched the controls at a critical moment entering supersonic, (I should have just accepted a slight yaw) and went into a flat spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft has around 5000 dv, and I believe its enough to achieve orbit from ~115k altitude.
