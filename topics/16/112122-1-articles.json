I was trying to reach orbit in my KASA profile on career mode, and I was having some trouble.. I get above 70km Ap no problem, then I start burning near my Ap. It uses nearly all my fuel, and the Pe is not high enough so I just end up re-entering! I am still pretty new to the game, and I would like some help on how to fix this! Thanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T04:36:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T03:45:53Z","Content":"Did you fly straight up to 70km? A bit more info on what you\u0027re doing would help us help you.

Turn earlier. Turn can start at 70m/s~100m/s, way below 10km altitude. Ideally prograde should be already pretty flat around 30km altitude.\n\n2. Calculate your delta V - either by hand or by mod. That prevents a lot of unnecessary trial and error."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:01:18Z","Content":"All right, I must have been listening to some Beta advice, because where I read my orbit tutorial was an older post, and I heard the aerodynamics changed in 1.0. I\u0027ll try this, probably tomorrow."}]}
