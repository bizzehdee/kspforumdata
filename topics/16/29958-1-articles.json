Mun gravity is 0.166 from Kerbal, dont wanna do complicate math so... if you calculcated the 30t payload at landing on a planet with 1G you can land, if you round it up to 0.2 at the mun gravity, a tottal mass of 150 tons with a drive that was made for 30t payload at Kerbal Gravitation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still think the wabble could be mutch better, even with this drive, if you turn the rockets around so that they are the back of the complete \u0022ship\u0022 and not the front.
