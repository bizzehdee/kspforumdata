That is...normal behaviour. As told, depending of game setting losing signal implies different things. My current setting allows minimal control (probes can point to a cardinal direction, but i cant steer at will) and i can fire engines at 100% or stop them completely (no in-betweens).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
