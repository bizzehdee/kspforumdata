I have made a lander designed to fully study the Bop Kraken. However, I can\u0027t seem to mount it on top of my launcher. Nothing will \u0022stick\u0022 to the bottom. (Picture below.) \n\nIf I take a lander, I can\u0027t get a decoupler (or anything else) to stick to the bottom. In fact, in the third picture, you can see I\u0027m not getting little green balls for attachment. Neither can I take a launcher and put the lander on top of it. If I take the metal sheet that is the frame for the rover part off, I can get it on top of a decoupler (though it stick through), but then putting fuel tank (and the rest of the lander with it) on top of that won\u0027t work.\n\nI\u0027ve done this before with my manned rover (see last picture), which this lander is modified from, so I don\u0027t know what is wrong now.\n\nAny help?\n\n![bouiLUP.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/bouiLUP.png?1)![It9d4s8.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/It9d4s8.png?1)\n\n![J4hBcEe.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/J4hBcEe.png?1)\n\n![D2PTH1J.png](http://i.imgur.com/D2PTH1J.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T21:54:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidpsummers**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T03:02:08Z","Content":"Have you considered mounting it upside down?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T03:04:24Z","Content":"I can\u0027t seem to replicate that problem in the VAB.
