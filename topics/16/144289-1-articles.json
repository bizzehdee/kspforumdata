The Ike base then docked with the asteroid tug on a side docking port that was only intended\u00A0for refueling. The entire contraption, Tug with ike\u00A0base hanging off the side at 90 degrees, with the horrendous center of mass vs. center of thrust, then limp burned its way back to Kerbin, but without the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to enter orbit. A new mission was launched from Kerbin\u00A0to meet them as they were on a sling shot through the Kerbin\u00A0system.

Two smiling Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if that wasn\u0027t enough, the asteroid tug had just enough fuel to transfer to the old Ike base that then allowed the base alone\u00A0to enter orbit and land on Minmus, fulfilling one of those 4 different body flyby/landing missions. The money poured in, and I still have the Ike base (now Minmus base) ready to fly again. It was something like 5 different missions combined to produce a very satisfying outcome.
