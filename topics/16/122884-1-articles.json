I do know that all engines don\u0027t reach their maximum thrust at sea level; I just don\u0027t know why. Probably so they don\u0027t produce so much thrust that they tear the plane apart during take off, if I were to guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2. You\u0027re seeing velocity relative to the surface when the Nav Ball reads \u0022Surface\u0022. Now, there\u0027s a horizontal and vertical component to that, which you could figure out between the Nav Ball and the Rate of Climb indicator by your altimeter and the Pythagorean Theorem. Or you could install KER and have it tell you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got a resources readout that I\u0027m not familiar with. If it was the stock readout, though, you should know that air intake\u0027s readings work differently than the other ones. What it shows is how much air is left in an available \u0022pool\u0022, which is depleted as you ascend. You don\u0027t start starving your engines until that bar gets down to zero, and even then the engines will keep going for a while. Still, 15,000 m is roughly the service ceiling of the J-33; it\u0027ll flame out at that point no matter how many intakes you\u0027ve got on your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at your plane, I can see that you\u0027re doing something extremely low tech. If I may ask: how were you planning on recovering the pilot after the flight (for that matter, how did you take off without any landing gear)? I\u0027m also not seeing any ailerons - I assume you\u0027re controlling that part of your attitude on cockpit torque alone. That could partially explain why you\u0027re having issues with the plane. The other big one is drag - those intakes are producing a lot of it. You definitely don\u0027t need three intakes for a single engine; I\u0027d suggest cutting the radials unless you need the mass where it is, in which case I\u0027d replace the circular intake with a nose cone. Just be careful where the CoM winds up; you want it aft but not aft of the CoL - if it winds up there, your plane with become flip happy and uncontrollable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich may also be what\u0027s happening, why it spazzes out at 7,000. Your plane is short - there\u0027s no other way of putting it - so it\u0027s going to be sensitive to where the CoL and CoM are as well as to changes in CoM as the fuel drains. It could be that the CoM is going aft of the CoL at that time. Try draining the tank in the SPH and see where the CoM is, and set the position of the CoL (by adjusting your main wing position) ever so slightly aft of the CoM in that position. \u0022Refuel\u0022 and see where things are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3.

The JX-4 it will get you up to 20,000 and 1,000 m/s, a \u0022launch\u0022 point that\u0027s a bit closer to space (making the rocket-driven portion of the flight less fuel intensive).

Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill - the calculations problem remain unanswered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor intakes - I\u0027ve tested j-x4 engine with several intakes. It doesn\u0027t matter which intake i chose the result is the same. Flame-out at the same altitude. So whats the point of large selection of intakes if it doesn\u0027t mater which you chose ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T19:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe intakes are very different, and choice makes a huge difference. I think you\u0027re drawing false conclusions from your experiments, or being too aggressive in your test flights to get meaningful results. To really test the engine/intake combination you need to fly absolutely as fast as possible, which will include finding an optimal altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging air pressure, i.e. altitude, affects thrust directly since lower pressure = less thrust. It also affects thrust indirectly via intake product, which also decreases with altitude. Airspeed also affects intake produce and thus thrust, which is why the Whiplash and RAPIERs get that massive supersonic boost in thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extent to which each intake is affected by airspeed and altitude/pressure is unique to each \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eengine \u003C/span\u003E . They also have varying drag coefficients. The best all round is the Shock Cone Intake, but above certain altitudes the Ram Air Intake will actually produce more intake product than the Shock Cone does. Since the Whiplash is slower than the RAPIER, I usually pair it with the Ram intake for high altitude performance, and keep the Shock Cone for the RAPIERs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-13T20:13:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Enot engine, duh! :P\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stigy","CreatedById":151508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T19:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like I have to prepare for more test...

It\u0027s about .0068 m^2 for the turbojet and RAPIER and about .0017 m^2 for the Wheezley. You want to feed it enough air to keep it from flaming out prematurely.
