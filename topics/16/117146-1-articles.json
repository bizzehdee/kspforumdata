The RCS blocks on the diagonals are in a different action group from the blocks in the cardinal directions, for easy testing.\n\nDefine the thrust of one RCS block as T, and the monopropellant consumption rate as R. You may expect the net thrust and fuel consumption of the two craft to be:\n\nCardinal: 2T, 2R\n\nDiagonal: 4T/sqrt(2), 4R\n\nThus you may expect the thrust per unit fuel to be T/R and T/R/sqrt(2), respectively. I did. I did a large number of tests with different test rigs in space and on the pad.\n\nFor all my tests, the net thrust and fuel consumption rates were essentially identical. I timed the fuel drain in the tests below, and I measured the accelerations, and they were the same. To me this says that as far as RCS placement goes, don\u0027t try to use logic/physics/math. Slap em on, and they will work the same in either configuration. Someone else may wish to verify my tests. I haven\u0027t done them since 0.90.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Build a core with RCS, duplicate it, rotate by 45 degrees, or any arbitrary number of degrees, attach the two and launch. If orientation of the RCS blocks matters, translations will induce rotations.
