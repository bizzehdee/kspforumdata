I put an entire base down in one go so I didn\u0027t have to assemble it on the surface, but I still had to put a lander down nearby, I was able to put it within 100m in the \u0022simulator\u0022 (hyper edit), and landed it roughly 250m away when I did it \u0022for real\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy basic approach was start from a low orbit just above the edge of Duna\u0027s atmosphere and burn so that the periapsis was 3-4km and about 90 degrees around Duna from the target. This causes you to come in at a shallow angle and get the maximum effect from areobraking. As your spacecraft slows you\u0027ll see your projected trajectory intersect the surface and move closer and closer to your target. Depending on the areodynamics of your base you may need to adjust your initial periapsis up or down from the ~4km I used with my lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to start your final landing burn at just the right moment so you kill your forward velocity and come down near the target, but you should be able to wait until you are within a few km of the target (both horizontally and vertically) at which point your trajectory should be still overshooting the target, but not by much. MechJeb\u0027s readout of true altitude and time to impact are useful information here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no doubt other methods of doing this, but the above worked for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-05T19:37:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerBlammo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aluc24","CreatedById":152712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T19:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thank you all, but what are you talking about are powered descents.
