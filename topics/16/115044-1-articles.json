Anyways...\n\nSymmetry mode in SPH is usually the more logical \u0027planar\u0027 way - so if I try to attach a wing to the upper part of a palne, the \u0027mirrored\u0027 wing goes to the upper part on the other side. But sometimes it snaps the parts by axial symmetry, like it happens in the VAB - so in the above example, one of the wings will be placed higher.\n\nDo you know what causes the switch? Is there a way to control this mechanic?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T17:44:51Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:24:31Z","Content":"Pressing R by default switches the symmetry mode"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:46:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pressing R by default switches the symmetry mode\n\nThanks!\n\nDang that was too easy.

You can try pressing \u0027F\u0027 which is supposed to cause symmetry to affect the part you are hovering over and tell it that symmetry is for this part. Then select symmetry using \u0027R\u0027 and place your part.\n\nI have found that does work on occasion but on numerous occasions I have had to abandon the craft and start another from scratch. Quite Tiresome."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:50:37Z","Content":"Symmetry (especially in the SPH) is sometimes a goofy thing.\n\n- If you have symmetry selected and you drag a part over another symmetrically placed part, the symmetry mode with change to match the part you touched with the mouse.\n\n-- Which also means that placing a part in symmetry will force it to match symmetry to the part you\u0027re attaching it to\n\nBased on your limited description, I would guess that you\u0027re simply dragging the mouse over some other parts on the way. After you get the the placement spot you want, press R as Gaarst suggests to switch symmetry modes.\n\nThat\u0027s really the only symmetry rule, is that symmetry will switch to match whatever your mouse is touching (unless it\u0027s a single part). In the SPH, parts placed without symmetry (just a single part) default to holding Radial symmetry. So if later you remove some parts, turn on symmetry, and place those parts, they will all default to Radial and you can\u0027t switch it back. Sometimes that can cause a problem. Something to be aware of if you like to build one wing at a time, then remove and attach with symmetry later. This can usually be avoided by building both wings in symmetry at the same time, even if you want to pull it off and put it back on later, because the symmetric relationships will be correct.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
