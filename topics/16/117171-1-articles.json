A **powered flyby**, or **Oberth maneuver**, describes a maneuver in which a rocket falls into a [gravitational well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_well), and then accelerates when its fall reaches maximum speed. The resulting maneuver is actually a more efficient way to gain kinetic energy than applying the same impulse outside of a gravitational well. The gain in efficiency is explained by the **Oberth effect**, a phenomenon that allows employing kinetic energy to generate greater mechanical energy. In practical terms, this means that the most efficient time for a spacecraft to burn its engine is at [orbital periapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapse), when its orbital velocity (and so, its kinetic energy) is greatest.\n\nDoes this also apply to a braking burn, when I want to lower my apoapsis, or is then the Oberth effect actually inverse, i.e. I expend more energy at this periapsis in order to loose kinetic energy?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T14:30:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 02:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T14:02:41Z","Content":"The Oberth Effect benefits burns in both the prograde and retrograde directions.
