This is assuming you\u0027re not using DRE or want to keep it realistic since you\u0027ll be hitting the atmosphere at a terribly dangerous angle which IRL would be out of the question.

If you were to stop all equatorial orbital velocity without doing anything else, then you would fall out of orbit. Now your dV expenditure would include fighting gravity while setting up your sub-orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say generally you\u0027re better off getting the inclination change out of the way as early as possible (and when you are traveling as slow as possible). What does that mean?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you know before establishing an orbit that you\u0027re going to the pole (and have no reason to be equatorial) then go straight into a polar orbit. This can be done straight from launch (off of any body), or well before you get to the SOI change. (As others have said.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you\u0027re already in orbit, do the inclination change at as high of an AP as you can afford. If you\u0027re just barely capturing into a highly elliptical orbit, then keep the orbit elliptical. Do the plane change out at AP, then circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re already equatorial, then it\u0027s going to be expensive to go polar. The most efficient is like you said, to raise the AP, change inclination, then lower the AP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can burn to a sub-orbital polar landing by burning mostly retrograde, but also slightly north (or south). This effectively kills your equatorial velocity while establishing a polar sub-orbit. That would be more efficient than simply doing the entire plane change 90 degrees, then dropping your PE.

This means you need to compensate for your initial perpendicular speed caused by planet rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re already in equatorial orbit, bi-elliptic transfer is the best way to change it to polar.
