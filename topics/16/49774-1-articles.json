I don\u0027t know anything about the physics engine in the game, but it feels pretty robust (with some obvious flaws) when I play. Is the Oberth effect actually calculated in this game? Or is it something so inherent in the physics calculations that it just happens and there doesn\u0027t need to be additional calculations on the part of the game to factor it in?
