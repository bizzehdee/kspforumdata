Place the fairing base-plate under the decoupler that decouples your payload from the rocket (so that the fairing base doesn\u0027t stick to the payload after decoupling) and then build up the fairing around your payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA smaller issue is that I think that many of your fins may be above the center-of-mass (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E) and thus increase the rocket\u0027s tendency to flip. If you want to use fins to keep the rocket straight, then put them at the bottom of the rocket. Use the display of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) to check where the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is. Also change the fuel levels in the tanks, to see how the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E moves when fuel is burned. (The the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E is good, but the center-of-lift indicator (or \u0022Aerodynamic Overlay\u0022) is a bit misleading: it only shows the center of \u0022lift\u0022 but there is also \u0022drag\u0022 working on your craft which can mess up the aerodynamic stability of your craft.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how you launch, but changing that may also help: a real gravity turn means that you tilt the rocket rather early while you are still slow, and then follow the prograde vector (in surface mode) for most of the launch. That way the \u0022wind\u0022 is coming from straight on just along the axis of the rocket, thus minimizing the torque it applies to your rocket. Thus you can usually keep it steady with the engine gimbaling alone. I usually first go straight up, at 30 m/s I tilt over ca. 5 - 10 degrees, at ca. 150 m/s I lock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to prograde, and keep that until I\u0027m in orbit. How much I tilt over exactly and when exactly I lock to prograde depends on the rocket.

Although I mention it first it would be the last thing to do in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

The goal would be to unlock nodes that would allow you to two up the base in two separate pieces so it would better fit in the fairing. Some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, docking port\u00A0and some probe control units will do.... or you can make a really cheap \u0022worker bee\u0022 with mono and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E that you can burn up in kerbin atmo so the base won\u0027t have the extra weight... although it would be kinda small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
