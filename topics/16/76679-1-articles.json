However I seem to be having a problem with designing a reliable transport ship to get to/from other planets. My current designs have managed to get to both EVE/Duna (mostly due to luck in orbitable arrangements when I launched them.) My current design is quite inefficient 5 missions each with an asparagus staged central core to get into orbit of LARGE tanks/engines, then attach the central core to a cross frame that came up on the first mission with the command module/lander. Then usually 1-2 additional missions just to top the tanks off. Now aside from the normal issues I have such as forgetting to put on extra mono-tanks on the transport to refill the lander after it gets back into orbit, or one unfortunate mission to Ike where I had forgotten to put downward facing lights on the lander (Jebediah - hmmm, I should be seeing the dayside and my landing zone coming into view now, why haven\u0027t I seen it yet??..... as the lander smashes into a mountain/cliff that was completely blocking the sun) the issues I seem to be having are two fold. One is that I simply do not have enough delta-v right now to get anywhere other than EVE/Duna and get the transport back intact, and it\u0027s only reliable getting to EVE and back, of the 3 mission attempts to Duna I\u0027ve had to eject the command module from it twice while docked to the lander and use the lander to get us back on Kerbin (one transport wound up somehow smashing into an asteroid retrieval probe that I had just put into orbit somehow *wish I had been able to take pics* before scattering debris throughout the planet, second looks like it\u0027s attempting to be the next voyager probe). Also had to abandon one otw back from EVE as I keep having cross feeding issues either from refueling the lander in between landings, and one or more of the outer rocket sets will go dry during a burn and the subsequent spin the ship goes into ripped/smashed one of the stacks off and destroyed parts of the others ( had two outer stacks left intact though only had 5-10% fuel left in them, no engines left on the inner stack, but had almost 80% fuel in the surviving tanks, and no way to transfer the fuel as I was down to vapors of mono, and central core was attached with a stack separator).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question for you all is this, can you help me with a new transport design, that aside from whatever trips are necessary to refuel it, and replace any lost/landed probes/landers/rovers, is intact once it gets back to kerbin SOI, even if I have to send a ship to refuel it to get it back into close kerbin orbit. Also a design or mod suggestions (more along the lines of making transfers/intercepts easier while using the vanilla KSP parts) that won\u0027t force me to rely on the brute force version of a transport ship in interplanetary transfers. Also I\u0027m assuming that my problems with refueling issues in past transports were due to the fact that I had stack separators with no crossfeeding in the design, would this be correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m not looking for someone to tell me how to build it piece by piece (though I wouldn\u0027t object to such a design provided it does allow me to tweak it as much as I want to), but would prefer just some ideas/guidelines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-05T23:18:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2014 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruthgar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforum lagging posted it incorrectly\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T19:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChapters 7 and 8 of the tutorial in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread should be useful: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83368-A-reusable-transfer-stage-a-good-idea\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83368-A-reusable-transfer-stage-a-good-idea\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also like the \u0027checklist\u0027 mod, which is there to remind you of all the little things you might forget to add to the ship ;-0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, as long as you\u0027re using LV-N engines and not trying to make too huge a vehicle it should not be too hard to build a transfer vehicle for most planets. Check the delta-V requirements carefully (chapters 4/5), practice small and, if necessary, just try doing fly-bys first, without landers or other attachments. Don\u0027t be shy of taking spacestation components, spare fuel tanks, etc. to the destination as separate missions and docking them together in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an example of how little you need consider \u0027Fat Sally\u0027 in chapter 5.

Your transfer ship will need at least 1 LV-N engine, so that\u0027s 2 1/4 tons, leaving you 2 3/4 tons for empty tanks. You also don\u0027t need your orbital insertion stage with all it\u0027s attendant extras (RCS, guidance, solar panels, engine, etc) since your transport already has all of that stuff. So that means you can put it right on top of your booster/ transstage and use the leftover payload for even more tankage. Just be sure to leave enough fuel in it to attain and stabilize LKO. You don\u0027t need more than that at launch, since everything else you launch will be rendezvousing with \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E.

Yeah, it turns out my main issues were an over-engineered design with design flaws (more engines than needed, decoupler stacks when I didn\u0027t need them, not enough RCS jets in the right places or not enough reaction wheels to turn the thing (took about 5 mins to do a 180)), or just plain forgetting to put alternate docking ports on (first one was 90% assembled when I noticed I had included no extra docking ports for the lander to refuel. Other main issue was making simple mistakes in orbital mechanics which is funny considering I\u0027ve worked on/around SRBs for the last 20 years. So installed some of the informational mods MJ, kerbal engineer, etc.... along with the ScanSat and interstellar mods, and started a new career. Built a ship with about the third the science and that has litterally 1/2 the D-V of what I originally used to go to Minimus and just orbit in my old career. This ship managed to send a lander down to Minimus, get it back to Kerbin orbit, then successfully landed back on Kerbin, lander section fully intact. Had to use Bill to do it though, Jeb was injured during the initial prototype test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/91LDyvQ.png\u0022 alt=\u002291LDyvQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b8kfAk3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b8kfAk3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ri9aX1o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ri9aX1o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamn thing barely made it out of kerbin orbit, without asparagus staging I pitched it over too early and then burned up a lot of the lander fuel just getting into a stable kerbin orbit.
