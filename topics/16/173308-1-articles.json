in KSP specific impulse is not affected by the throttle setting.\u00A0 However, I\u0027d just like to add that in real life throttling an engine can have a small affect on Isp.\u00A0 This is because when an engine is throttled, we are reducing the flow rate of mass through the engine.\u00A0 It therefore takes less force to push the lesser amount of exhaust gas through the nozzle throat.\u00A0 This causes the pressure inside the combustion chamber to drop, and a reduction in the velocity of the exhaust gas.\u00A0 We therefore have a small drop in Isp, though in most cases the decrease is

With the original KSP for XBONE, I found that the drag caused by over burning the engines could limit the altitude of a rocket by as much as 50%. At least as far as shooting straight up and down for testing purposes. I haven\u0027t bothered to re-test that theory in KSP: Enhanced Edition, but the rockets are still stable and orbit is achieved easily using my old formula.

setting.\u00A0 However, I\u0027d just like to add that in real life throttling an engine can have a small affect on Isp.\u00A0 This is because when an engine is throttled, we are reducing the flow rate of mass through the engine.\u00A0 It therefore takes less force to push the lesser amount of exhaust gas through the nozzle throat.\u00A0 This causes the pressure inside the combustion chamber to drop, and a reduction in the velocity of the exhaust gas.\u00A0 We therefore have a small drop in Isp, though in most cases the decrease is probably not more than a few

As for the gravity losses, they ultimately manifest as a reduction in the total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E of the stage. Not a concern so long as the stage is designed to waste the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E anyway. Like... A stage with an initial t/w of 1.4 will need about 1600-1700 m/sec \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E (depending on diameter) to reach 25 km and 800 m/sec in a nominal gravity turn; the point at which I prefer to ditch my first stage.

Less heating problems, better aerodynamic stability, \u003Cstrong\u003Eand a rocket that\u0027s accelerating too quickly doesn\u0027t like to follow the proper gravity turn\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat last part is something I\u0027ve been meaning to bring up because I think it\u0027s important.\u00A0 We\u0027ve been talking much about gravity and drag losses, but the trajectory we fly is extremely important too in how efficient our launch is.\u00A0 We want to fly as close to horizontal as the atmosphere and rocket design will permit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s consider the two extreme scenarios.\u00A0 For this I\u0027m going to ignore drag and pretend that Kerbin has no atmosphere.\u00A0 This will allow us to see just what affect the trajectory has on delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, let\u0027s say we launch straight up into a trajectory that reaches an apoapsis of 80 km, then when we reach the apex, we accelerate horizontally to orbital velocity.\u00A0 To simplify the calculations, we\u0027ll assume that the delta-v is applied in instantaneous bursts.\u00A0 From sea level on Kerbin, we need to give our rocket a velocity of 1177 m/s to reach an apoapisis of 80 km.\u00A0 We when reach the apex, we have to go from zero to orbital velocity, a delta-v of 2279 m/s.\u00A0 So adding it together, we have a total of 3456 m/s.\u00A0 That\u0027s the worst case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew let\u0027s look at the best case.\u00A0 The most efficient thing we can do is launch horizontally right off the pad (hoping there\u0027s no mountains in the way) and perform a Hohmann transfer to orbit.\u00A0 This takes a delta-v of 2501 m/s off the launch.\u00A0 But by the time we coast around to the 80 km apoapsis on the opposite side of the planet, it takes only 72 m/s to circularize the orbit.\u00A0 That\u0027s a total delta-v of only 2573 m/s, which is far more efficient than the first scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality we fly a trajectory that is somewhere in between these extremes.\u00A0 We have to launch our rocket initially upward to get above the thickest part of the atmosphere, and then transition to horizontal.\u00A0 The faster we can transition to horizontal, the more efficient the trajectory will be.\u00A0 I tend to measure the efficiency of my trajectory by the magnitude of the apoapsis burn needed to finalize the orbit.\u00A0 If I can keep the burn down to about 100 m/s or less, I\u0027m happy.\u00A0 On the other hand, if I have to make an apoapsis burn of, say, 300 m/s or more, then I\u0027m unhappy.\u00A0 If I have to make that great of a burn, then I know I lofted the rocket into too steep of an arc and reached apoapsis too soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe I\u0027m just really bad at flying high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets, but I find it much more difficult to fly a good trajectory with a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket.\u00A0 We can\u0027t pitch over right off the launch pad or else the drag losses will kill us, so we have to gain some altitude first.\u00A0 While we\u0027re gaining that altitude, the high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket is gaining more speed than the low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket.\u00A0 And a high-speed rocket is more difficult to turn because the wind moving over its surface resists the turn.\u00A0 As a result of this, I just can\u0027t flatten out the trajectory of a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket enough.\u00A0 I always end up in highly lofted a trajectory with a large apoapsis burn.\u00A0 So while I\u0027ve saved on gravity losses, I\u0027ve given it back on the poor trajectory and greater drag losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is one of the reasons why I favor low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets (I typically like about 1.3-1.4).\u00A0 I find them much more controllable during launch.\u00A0 I can pitch the rocket over and just slowly push the apoapsis higher and higher.\u00A0 I try to keep the \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 at around a minute or so while ascending.\u00A0 By keeping the apoapsis just a short distance ahead, we\u0027re flattening out the trajectory.\u00A0 If we let the apoapsis get away from us, we\u0027ll end up in a steep arc (which is what typically happens to me with high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets).\u00A0 As we gain altitude and near the end of the burn, the apoapsis will rapidly move far out ahead of us and wrap around the planet, but that\u0027s OK.\u00A0 If we have to travel 1/4 of the way around the planet before performing the apoapsis burn, that\u0027s good.\u00A0 It means we\u0027ve come a little closer to the ideal Hohmann transfer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited
