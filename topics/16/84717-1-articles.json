The problem is, it takes an awful long time to launch the craft, get them to Munar orbit, rendezvous with the other craft they need to dock with, and then land them. If my craft has a fundamental design flaw, I have to start that lengthy process all over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there were only a way I could test out these designs on the flat grassy areas just outside the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I need test these craft in Munar gravity, not Kerbin gravity. I know that in the debug menu, you can select hack gravity, and there is no gravity. Is there any way to change it to Munar gravity? I\u0027m assuming there\u0027s no official way, but is there a way the program can be jerry-rigged to produce Munar gravity?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T02:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think so, but you could always use HyperEdit and just drop it on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MerlinsMaster","CreatedById":112079,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T03:01:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI may give that a try if it turns out there\u0027s no other way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T03:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about that either, but you can use Hyperedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut the ship in the launchpad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the orbit editor, select the Mun and enter the desired altitude.
