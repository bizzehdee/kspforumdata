However, when I make a near-identical plane, it seems to drift and wobble, and will hardly ever actually steer (tried it with and without SAS). \n\nIs there some setting I need to change to get this to work, or am I missing something crucial that nobody seems to have said in any tutorials? Help would be greatly appreciated; I really want to enjoy the game!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T05:52:48Z","Content":"You can disable functions on your control surfaces.

What I am doing is taking other people\u0027s craft files (either from the Craft Sharing Forum or the Challenges Forum) and dissecting them to learn how they work. \n\nKeep trying, you\u0027ll get it eventually!"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:29:19Z","Content":"[Obligatory link to guidelines for spaceplane rookies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026viewfull=1#post1546536). Keptin\u0027s guide is a must.\n\nNow, for landing on the runway - landing on the runway pure stock is a tricky business. I myself recommend putting a flag (better yet, sending out a rover which you then reclassify as a base once it\u0027s in place) on either end of the runway as even with the centerline as you can manage, as close to the ends of the runway as possible without being on the \u0022raised\u0022 runway section itself (if your flags are too close, the game will tell you about it when you try to launch a new aircraft and will clean it off the runway - making it disappear in the process). This is your \u0022meatball\u0022; you can use the distance to the flag to determine what your altimeter reading should be, and you can use both flags to check your alignment. For a roughly 5.7 degree glideslope, your altimeter should be (in meters) 100 times the distance to the meatball (in kilometers), plus 100 meters. For example, if you\u0027re 12.5 kilometers from the meatball, you want to be near ((12.5\\*100)\u002B100) = 1350 meters. Much above that and you\u0027re too high, much below that and you\u0027re too low. You can extend this system out further on the landward side - markers at 1, 5, 10, 15 and 25 kilometers from the end of KSC 09 will help you with your alignment further out from KSC and give you more time to approach. The final landing needs to be gentle - you want your descent at touchdown to be no greater than about 5 m/s, or you\u0027ll crush your undercarriage. Preferably, you want SAS off on touchdown, but whether or not you can do that will be a matter of how stable the plane\u0027s design is.\n\nIf you don\u0027t want to build a stock ILS, there\u0027s always the NavUtilities mod, an integrated ILS which is designed to assist with landing on any runway on Kerbin (including the KSC helipads at the VAB and Admin building). I myself use a combination of the two systems - the flag approach also gives you a marker you can use for your de-orbit to KSC. If you\u0027re at 100x100, put your periapsis at 44k right above KSC and you should cruise right on in (or at least be close enough for jazz to fly in the rest of the way). If you\u0027re higher, go lower, and vice versa."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T18:59:12Z","Content":"Try the (space)planes in my \u0027Exploring\u0027 tutorial (link in signature).

The stock atmosphere is pretty unrealistic so many people prefer the much more realistic **FAR** or **NEAR**. And therein lies part of the problem. Planes that behave flawlessly in FAR/NEAR sometimes perform lousy in stock or vice versa."}]}
