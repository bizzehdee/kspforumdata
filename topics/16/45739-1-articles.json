Adjusting the Pe all the way down to the surface takes slightly more delta-V than bringing down to 11-12km above. Why stop at 11-12km? Because that\u0027s prime aerobraking territory. And aerobraking at Duna saves LOTS of fuel in establishing your orbit. With aerobraking, it shouldn\u0027t take more than about 1300-1400 delta-V in total to get from LKO to LDO. You spend about 1000-1100 on the transfer burn from Kerbin, you spend about 100 at most en route to Duna tweaking your Pe to the correct aerobraking altitude and getting your inclination correct, and you spend the rest circularizing in orbit after aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Aerobraking is different every time and there\u0027s no instrumentation that really helps so F5, try it at one altitude, and if it doesn\u0027t work how you want, F9 and try a slightly different altitude. You want to do your final Pe tweak when you\u0027re about 90km above the surface because otherwise it will move too much before you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cartz","CreatedById":73435,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T20:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Odo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Odo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo it cant be done before you enter SOI? that was kind of the point, to save fuel so you dont have to do a biggish burn.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E It 100% can be done, I\u0027ve done it many times. What it takes is a lot of patience in tweaking your nodes. What you want to do is burn out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI during a normal transfer window, following a node setup to give you an intercept. Tweak it to get the periapsis reasonably close, but as long as you have the intercept you\u0027re golden. Once you exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI, plan a maneouver node at the ascending or descending node (whichever is closest) and tweak that node until your periapsis is quite small, if it disappears alltogether, gratz, you\u0027re on a collision course. If you can\u0027t quite get it there/don\u0027t have the patience to get it there you can do a final correction burn when you\u0027re 10d or so from a Duna intercept, just make that periapsis disappear and you\u0027re Duna bound. That said, even with a near perfect initial interception burn, Duna is going to come screaming up behind you at over 1km/s and at that speed, the atmosphere won\u0027t slow you down much before you lithobrake. Your best bet for the cheapest Duna insertion is to aim for a Periapsis of 7-10km, this will keep you above most of the terrain and allow you to use the thicker parts of Duna\u0027s atmosphere to slow you down for longer. If you burn just long enough to close your orbit, repeated passes through the atmosphere will bleed off enough speed for you to reach a desired apoapsis.
