It happens more when the game starts slowing down from the processor doing too much at once. I had one situation in which a typical fuel tank wouldn\u0027t show its info when I right-clicked. I kept re-clicking and also trying click and hold for several seconds, but to no avail. I finally managed to get the info to pop up by right clicking really rapidly, and it popped up after about 8 clicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly mod I use is Kerbal Engineer (not updated) but I only use it in the VAB or SPH to check vehicle attributes and I don\u0027t leave the part on, so I don\u0027t think that would be affecting it. I was not in time warp, and going back to it I still can\u0027t get them out. The game was not running slowly. It was the same story in space around Kerbin, passing by the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and even after landing on Minmus. It just doesn\u0027t work at all. I guess it\u0027s vaguely possible Kerbal Engineer is messing with it but I rather doubt it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T06:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhenever the game can\u0027t seem to find the hatch collider, going to the space center and back always fixes it for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T06:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClicking on the crew hatches has only ever worked for me if the camera is close enough to them.
