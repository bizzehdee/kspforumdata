You\u0027ll generally be fine within a few days, maybe even a few tens of days, for anywhere but Moho (which requires special treatment to get an efficient transfer anyway). Just bear in mind that a transfer that deviates from the fuel-ideal Hohmann Transfer may require not only a bigger departure burn but also a bigger capture burn or harsher aerobrake.

Simple rule of thumb: for everywhere except Moho, you have several Kerbin days on either side during which the dV requirement barely changes.
