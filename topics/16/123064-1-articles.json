Turns out they both have identical nearly circular orbits (see the picture) that spans 80-85km.

I can either maintain orbit, or get close to the target. I sat on high time warp and let myself orbit a few times to change our relative positions, but it doesn\u0027t seem to matter since no matter what it seems like I can\u0027t get anywhere close to them without de-orbiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last attempt ran around Kerbin for 3 in-game days of trying to get a maneuver node to reach them, adjusting \u0026amp; moving it around, etc, before giving it up and just orbiting again a few times to have another go.

Both of you are running the same loop around Kerbin, but neither can catch the other. This is called the \u0022phasing\u0022 of the two orbits. To rendezvous, not only does your orbit need to be identical to that of your target, but the phasing between the orbits also needs to be identical! Thankfully, changing the phasing is probably the easiest part of the whole affair. It works based on a simple principle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA higher orbit moves slower than a lower one. Therefore, an object in a lower orbit will catch up to, pass, and run away from an object in a higher orbit. You can see this in the solar system - just check how many times Moho goes around the sun for each time Jool does. If the sun is Kerbin instead, and the planets are you and your rendezvous target instead, you have the exact same effect. If your orbit is perfectly matched, both you and your target move at exactly the same speed around Kerbin; neither will catch the other. But if your orbits differ, then your relative position changes each time you go around the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why matching orbits and then burning to raise your apoapsis \u003Cem\u003Eguarantees\u003C/em\u003E that you will eventually see a close encounter pop up: what you are actually doing here is a phasing maneuver. You make your orbit so much larger that it takes you so much time to go around Kerbin that your target has time to catch up so much that it just happens to arrive at your periapsis the same moment you arrive. Now, how much dV that takes will depend on where exactly your target is relative to you on the orbit. If it is a little bit behind you, it will take very little fuel; if it is on the other side of the planet, it will take a moderately large amount; and if it is slightly ahead of you, it will take absurd amounts of fuel and it\u0027s probably better to lower your periapsis instead if the atmosphere doesn\u0027t get in the way, so you will do the catching up instead of your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you usually do not need to rush a phasing maneuver - you do not need to meet the target on your first orbit around. If you change your orbit only a little bit, you can then wait loop after loop after loop as your relative position to your target changes a bit every time. Then, when the target is suitably close, you make another adjustment to get your final close encounter. This patient method is recommended so that you get your target close to you without spending much fuel. If you do the single-orbit rendezvous outlined above, not only will your initial burn potentially cost a lot of dV if the target isn\u0027t already close to you, but the velocity burn you need to perform at the close encounter will also be very large!

Where a circle has a single point as its center, an ellipse has two foci (foci is the plural of focus) which are sort of analogous to a circle\u0027s center. In fact, a circle is a special case of an ellipse where both foci are at the same location. The defining characteristic of an ellipse is that from any given point, the sum of the distances to the foci is constant. There\u0027s a whole lot more to know about ellipses, but that\u0027s probably nearly all you need, but maybe some trivia; ever wonder why the game talks about \u0022conics\u0022 or what a conic is? It\u0027s because every ellipse (and therefore every orbit) is a slice of a cone, hence the term conic. Trivia for you and me, bread and butter for someone who writes software that deals with orbital mechanics. Every orbit is an ellipse and the body that is being orbited is located at one of the foci of that ellipse. That\u0027s it for orbits. Kepler\u0027s laws will give you some more detail and plenty of math, if you want to look them up. They were originally published in 1609 and 1619 and were meant to explain observations of the motion of planets, but they apply to spacecraft as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to orbital mechanics, which is the term I am using to describe the manipulation of a spacecraft\u0027s orbit. There are three axes along which you can apply a force to change an orbit. Each has a positive and negative direction. The first is \u0022prograde\u0022 and its negative would be \u0022retrograde\u0022. The second is \u0022normal\u0022 (not an observation of its mental state) and its negative is \u0022anti-normal\u0022. The third is \u0022radial\u0022 and it\u0027s negative is \u0022anti-radial\u0022. While you can burn in a direction that is not exactly one of these, the result of any burn will be a vector which can be broken down into components that are entirely in one of these three directions. \u0022Prograde\u0022 means in the direction of movement, that is to say tangential to the current orbit at the position of the burn (we\u0027re kind of assuming that burns take no time, which we all know is not true, but it\u0027s easier to get us close to the right answer by making that assumption). When you burn prograde or retrograde, the effect is always to change the orbital altitude at the opposite side of the orbit. If you burn pro/retro at one of the two apses (periapsis and apoapsis), then only the opposite apsis will be changed, increasing if your burn was prograde, and decreasing if your burn was retro. If you burn between the two apses, then the apsis ahead of you will increase while the apsis behind you will decrease. This will also roll the orbit, bringing the periapsis closer and pushing the apoapsis further away. Burning normal or anti-normal is used for changing the plane or inclination of your orbit. When you burn normal the point on the opposite side of your orbit from the burn stays the same, the points halfway from your burn to the opposite point will raise (prograde side) and lower (retro side), changing the inclination. You really need to know that 1 - the best point to change planes is either the AN or DN and 2 - the cost at AN and the cost at DN are only the same if your orbit is perfectly circular; if you are returning from a moon (like minimus) and want to enter a 0-inclination orbit of kerbin, you want to do it as far from Kerbin as you can, and that means you do it as soon as you enter Kerbin\u0027s SOI - you could probably do it by planning your ejection angle from Min perfectly, but when you\u0027re in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you can see it, which makes a world of difference when planning. Finally, a radial burn will push your orbit toward the apsis ahead of you (anti-radial pushes it toward the other apsis). If you are burning at an apsis, the radial burn will first rotate the two apses 90 degrees and then push toward the apsis ahead or behind. If you push far enough, your trajectory can become sub-orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what you (and the rest of us) have to do is learn these types of burns and the impacts they have on orbits in order to combine them to achieve our desired outcomes. Again, this is not easy; if it was it would be boring, wouldn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note, that sometimes (often) you have to wait for the right opportunity to do what you want. For example, Minimus\u0027 orbit is inclined 6 degrees, or -6 degrees depending upon which side of the planet she is on in her upward side of her orbit. If you are in Kerbin orbit, simply changing your inclination does not match the plane. Matching the plane can only be done at the AN or DN. Of course, if you match planes with Min from a circular Kerbin orbit, you are wasting a lot of delta-V on that maneuver. The much less expensive way to do that is to perform your transfer burn and then match planes at the AN on your outward leg, then fine-tune your transfer to Min and your insertion burn after the plane correction is completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually in this game you will need to have an understanding of these things, IMO, and a better understanding than I have, even. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll get corrections about some things here... However, I found that MechJeb\u0027s Maneuver Planner does an excellent job with most things here and will easily get you anywhere within Kerbin\u0027s SOI as well as Duna, Eve, and Moho. Catching asteroids is still a little tough with MechJeb. I highly recomment MechJeb as the essential mod for anyone who doesn\u0027t care to learn this much about orbital mechanics. But having studied it for so long, having dreamed of it my entire childhood and pined for it since the day I left the aerospace industry (22 years ago), I think everyone should love doing this stuff! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps - feel free to reach out to me if you need any clarification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDanny\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Waxing_Kibbous\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Waxing_Kibbous\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is an interesting approach that I\u0027ve used successfully a few times, the tricky part is using a retro burn to achieve orbit.\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1v1ZLXLBMQo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E The second part, approaching the vessel, can be done easier. Instead of pushing or pulling the target markers around on the navball, simply only fire when approaching the target, on the round pink one, then firing retrograde to slow down, your yellow one. Simply by using these two you can move towards it, slow down, move towards it again, slow down etc. Do this gradually and you can get really close quite comfortably. Here is my craft- it has a spark engine in the last stage which I find works well, I usually ditch a half tank of fuel but it\u0027s nice to have a cushion, and besides kerbals cost a lot to hire so a bit of waste is OK! Also notice the ladder down the side since I\u0027m still bad at EVA- aligning the rescue ship so the ladder is facing the other craft and straight up before EVAing the stranded kerbal gives you a big target to grab on to.
