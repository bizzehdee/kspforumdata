This defaults to true. When set to true, whenever you EVA in space, the Kerbal\u0027s body axis (from head to feet) is always going to point in a fixed direction, which depends on which view mode you\u0027re in when you EVA him (orbit, free, etc.). IOW, pitch (leaning over forwards or backwards) and roll (leaning over sideways) are locked. You can only change yaw (pivoting left or right) by moving the camera. In this condition, the spacebar doesn\u0027t work at all to rotate the Kerbal. You CAN left-click and drag to rotate the Kerbal in pitch and yaw temporarily, but as soon as you stop the clicking, the Kerbal will spin back to his original orientation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative is to set \u0022EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE\u0022 to false. Then spacebar does reorient the Kerbal. However, flying him around is rather different than you\u0027re used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, there\u0027s a solution to this delimma.

This toggles the setting of EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE between true and false at will. Thus, you can fly around as normal but if you need to change orientation, you can, then change back to normal flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T07:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ealso, the kerbal is fixed depending on what view you have set - so if you\u0027re on the ground (or anywhere for that matter) and have your view set to surface your kerbal will always have his feet pointing towards the ground - this is so crazy things dont happen when you\u0027re eva\u0027ing while on the surface - theres plenty of times Ive moved the camera so I have a top-down view of the kerbal as he eva\u0027s across the surface and I don\u0027t want him to suddenly face the ground when I do it!

Thus, rotating the Kerbal via changing camera position changes his facing in the plane of prograde/retrograde/radial plus and minus. When in free or chase mode, the Kerbal\u0027s head will be towards the \u002BRadial direction (same as the blue circle with the lines pointing outwards) so rotating the Kerbal with the camera changes his facing in the prograd/retrograde/normal plus and minus plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"temetvince","CreatedById":97920,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T17:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
