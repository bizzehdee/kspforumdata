I like to play with mods like RemoteTech and Interstellar Mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth rely on working satellite networks. One for comms, the other for proper microwave power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting things into KEO is relatively easy. Well you always get them close to KEO. And there lies the problem. Not even Mechjeb is so accurate that the archived orbit is 100% KEO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis always results in the sattelites shifting positions over time, till the network simply orbits itself apart. You can of course try to adjust them as the needs arises, but with networks consisting of a dozen or more satellites, things start to get annoying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing i did tried is to edit the save files. But i am either too dump or KSP is like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is: Do you guys now an elegant way to solve the KEO over time dilemma? Could there be a mod, that automatically keeps satellites in check?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any answer in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-27T06:02:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2014 06:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aeon-Phoenix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T19:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always just edited the persistence file once I\u0027ve gotten my satellites into near-perfect orbits. If it feels like cheating to you, that\u0027s fine, but I think with the lack of station-keeping tech in the game, it\u0027s acceptable. Just be aware that if you edit something into a perfect orbit, then focus on that craft later, the orbit won\u0027t be perfect anymore. You can always go back and re-perfect the orbit though, if you do accidentally go to a craft you meant to leave on rails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do, once your satellites are in a near-perfect orbit, is to find the crafts in the save file (just search the document for the vessel name).
