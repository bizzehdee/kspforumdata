One way of thinking about the Oberth effect is that you add more orbital energy when going fast (per m/s added) so burning is most efficient energy-wise when fast. You are the fastest when your kinetic energy is high. Your kinetic energy is high when your gravity energy is low. Your gravity energy is low if you are down in a gravity well (falling down speeds you up). Kinetic energy is non-relativistically 1/2mV^2. Going from V = 1 m/s to V = 2 m/s and from V = 999 m/s to V = 1000 m/s both require 1 m/s delta V. However the difference in energy in the first case is 3 units (2^2 - 1^2) and in the second case is 1999 units! (1000^2 - 999^2). By going faster you got 666x the energy from the same 1 m/s delta V!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you can\u0027t hit planetary transfer exactly from LKO it\u0027s much better to guess and get close and do some fine adjustment in solar SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso that is a very very very VERY cool graph which shows the difference wonderfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T23:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI miss-understand the above sentences?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravitational potential energy is negative: E = - G M m / r,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere M is the planet mass, m is the spacecraft mass, G is Newton\u0027s constant, and r is the distance between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the closer you get to the planet, the smaller r becomes, the more negative your gravitational potential energy becomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravitational potential energy is negative because it takes energy to escape the gravitation potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfinitely far away, the potential energy is zero, because the gravitational force is zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you don\u0027t spend any delta-V, your total energy, kinetic \u002B potential, is constant: E = 1/2 m v^2 - G M m / r\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus as you get closer to a planet, r decreases, making -1/r more negative.
