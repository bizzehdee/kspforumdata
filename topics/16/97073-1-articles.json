Since most orbits are done in, roughly, an equatorial plain my thinking is that if I use Mun as my reference I could adjust my inclination to set up for my planetary transfer. I have not tried this yet but I figure it would not cost as much to do it this way vs doing it in a solar orbit. Am I wrong on this and if so why? I figure if it is close to the AN or DN of the planet in question it should all line up, but I have been known to be wrong from time to time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T23:07:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Liowen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T17:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is no good idea to change inclination by separate burn if you are already on equatorial orbit. If you make inclination change during transfer orbit injection burn, velocities sums squared. If inclination change is small (few degrees), difference is typically negligible. In any case it is far less than separate burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you launch straight to inclined orbit you can benefit couple of tens of m/s. Or even more, if you need large inclination (Moho, Dres, Eeloo). In that situation you have to get right LAN. You can use (for example) angle to prograde -values which are given by Mechjeb and Alexmoon\u0027s transfer calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I should read more carefully. You asked that is it better to make a transfer via single elliptic orbit or use plane change burn at orbital node. It depends. Most cases in KSP it is better to use single transfer, but not always. Especially it is sometimes better to make separate plane change burn with bodies I mentioned (they are on inclined orbits). However, it is more complicated to plan such a mission with KSP\u0027s tools and it may be difficult to prevent losing the benefit to inaccurate orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E to compare different transfer types.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-18T17:44:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hannu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGood answer but wrong question\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T17:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELiowen,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You always want to perform inclination changes at low speed and as close as possible to the AN/DN.
