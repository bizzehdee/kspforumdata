if we allow, say, 500 m/s as a safety margin, that\u0027s 2500 m/s.\u00A0 So if you\u0027ve got that much dV, you should be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo calculate a rocket\u0027s dV:\u00A0 Take the wet mass (i.e. total mass including fuel), divide by the dry mass (i.e. when your fuel tanks are empty), this is your mass ratio.\u00A0 Take the natural log of the mass ratio (\u0022ln\u0022 on your calculator), multiply by 9.8 m/s2, then multiply by the Isp of your engine.\u00A0 This is your dV in m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for example, suppose your ascent stage is a lander can, plus a fuel tank with 2 tons of LFO, plus a Terrier, plus some parachutes, batteries, etc.\u00A0 Total (wet) mass will be about 4 tons or a bit under.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say 4 tons.\u00A0 That includes 2 tons of fuel, so the dry mass is 4 - 2 = 2 tons.\u00A0 4 / 2 = 2, your mass ratio.\u00A0 The vacuum Isp of the Terrier is 345s.\u00A0 (You\u0027re not starting in vacuum, but Duna\u0027s surface is pretty low pressure, and the pressure will drop very fast with altitude, so you can use the Terrier\u0027s vacuum Isp as a good approximation).\u00A0 So ln(2) * 9.8 * 345 = 2300 m/s, which is in the right ballpark though with a fairly narrow safety margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\u00A0 if you can get your ascent stage under 4 tons, powered by a Terrier with 2 tons of fuel, then you have approximately enough dV to get home directly from Duna surface.\u00A0 The margin is narrow.\u00A0 To make it more safe, either have a lower mass, or pack on a bit more fuel, or do a refuel in orbit (since over 2/3 of your fuel is used up just getting to Duna orbit from the surface-- the trip home to Kerbin is cheap in comparison).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do the mission and it turns out that you have not quite enough dV:\u00A0 another option, when you run out of fuel, is to get out and complete the trip in a spacesuit.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Kerbal EVA suits have a ridiculous amount of dV in them, like 600 m/s.\u00A0 An EVA Kerbal in low Duna orbit has almost enough propellant to go all the way home to Kerbin!\u00A0 So if you start your trip and don\u0027t have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Equite\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E enough fuel to complete your homeward burn, you have the option of going EVA, taking any science from the ship, and then using your EVA pack to complete the trip.\u00A0 That does mean you\u0027d need to launch a rescue ship to snag the kerbal upon Kerbin flyby, since there\u0027s no way your kerbal would be able to reenter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere without frying.\u00A0 So it\u0027s not necessarily an approach I\u0027d recommend, just a last-resort possibility to be aware of in case things go pear-shaped.\u00A0 And KSP is nothing if not a proving ground for wacky hijinks.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-29T19:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2015 07:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T20:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t the suggestion always - if you can make a rocket do Mun landing \u0026amp;

low end, to a massive multi-moon-exploring expedition on the high end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBopping around the Jool system does eat up quite a lot of dV; capturing to (and escaping from) Jool orbit is considerably more expensive than other planets.\u00A0 So if you just want a minimal rocket that will go there and come back, a flyby would be the thing-- set up your approach right and pull off the interplanetary billiards shot \u0022just right\u0022, and you can come back to Kerbin reasonably soon after the flyby.\u00A0 On the other hand:\u00A0 exploring Jool\u0027s moons is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efun\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 You could make it a more extended thing, send crew, check out all the moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go the route of an extended, multi-moon-visiting, crewed mission, then you\u0027ll definitely want to bring along drills \u0026amp; ISRU unit for local refueling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExploring Jool \u0026amp; environs is a whole other topic in its own right, if you want to get into that, it\u0027s probably worth starting another thread. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022
