The engines are too close to the fusalage, and the collision mesh of the body of the plane is blocking the engines. :/ You need to move them out a little further (throw in an octagonal strut). The game requires the whole circular area of the engine be clear for it to thrust. It\u0027s silly that it looks like it\u0027s just a pixel or two off, but...
