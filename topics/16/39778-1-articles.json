I can land pretty easily. The problem is, I use a LOT of fuel on the descent path because I end up freaking out and trying to cancel out some of the orbital velocity way sooner than I probably should, which basically leads to me fighting physics when I could be using the high velocity to my advantage to speed the landing process up. Theoretically, I know this. When I see the Mun below me and my distance toward it decreasing, I start trying to fight it anyway. This leads to me having very little fuel to establish a Munar orbit that\u0027s efficient, and leads to me having to find creative ways to make it back to Kerbin with little fuel after I reach a stable low Munar orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, at what point do you start bleeding off some of the orbital velocity during your descents?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T01:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe optimum descent profile is the time-reversed optimum ascent profile with a negative propellant flow rate.

The idea is to place your periapsis about 3-5km above your intended landing site. Upon approaching your landing site (how far determined by TWR) you should be near your 3-5 km close scrape height. Burn retrograde with enough radial positive component to cancel any falling but not enough to gain height.

Adjust your orbit until it intersects the surface at your target. A shallower descent is more efficient, but runs the risk of hitting higher elevation areas. You burn retrograde as you get close, pitching up and down slightly to keep your intersect at your target location. As you near the target, you can switch to vertical descent, which is practically necessary in rough terrain. How close you are when you switch to vertical is up to you and the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only concern is when you have long burn times to reduce velocity. The same shallow descent method works, but needs more care. Scott Manley showed a cool way to do it. Set periapsis [edit: see note below] directly above the target by only a few km. Set a maneuver node that kills all horizontal velocity so you drop down directly on the target. Take the reported burn time, and when you\u0027re that far away (in time) from the maneuver node, that\u0027s roughly the closest you can get before you need to start burning at full throttle. That keeps you from overshooting when you follow the shallow descent method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Note: doesn\u0027t have to be periapsis, but the less vertical speed you have in the orbit above your target, the more accurate the estimate of your burn time will be.

But on the way up your mass starts high and decreases and during landing your mass starts high and decreases. So you will spend more time in high gravity drag during ascent than during descent. This can be very significant for small craft with low TWR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re talking about fuel consumption giving higher TWR over time, yes? It\u0027s true that you\u0027ll have different thrust profiles, but the optimum trajectories will still more or less match up, you\u0027ll just be traversing them at different rates. Optimum takeoff in zero atmosphere is a nearly horizontal burn, and it\u0027s the same trajectory for landing. That way you don\u0027t fight gravity most of the way up or down, just your own horizontal inertia.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Somerled\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Somerled\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut the optimum trajectories will still more or less match up\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, they will look similar, but the dv needed might be very different.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somerled","CreatedById":13610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v shouldn\u0027t be very different. The key is you pull against gravity as little as possible by minimizing vertical thrust in favor of horizontal thrust. It\u0027s why delta-v for Hohmann transfers is independent of ship mass or TWR [edit: see note]. However, at the beginning of an ascent or end of descent, you need to exchange vertical and horizontal speeds, at which your TWR will be an issue and you will get some delta-v loss one way or another.

For absolute efficiency you only want enough altitude to clear the terrain, and no more.
