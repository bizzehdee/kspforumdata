Rename it to something.exe. Now right click on any file of the extension whose association you want to remove, go to Properties. Click the Change... button in the \u0022Opens With\u0022 option. It will show the current program and there will be \u0022More Options\u0022 link, click it. A list will come up, click the \u0022Look for another app on PC\u0022 link at bottom.
