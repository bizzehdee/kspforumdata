However, it came at a price. Booster Recovery was now basically impossible or unreasonably difficult to pull off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the part gets more than 25 km\u0027s away, the parachutes \u0022un\u0022deploy, and if the part is in the atmosphere and more than 25 km\u0027s away, it just disappears. How do you separate a side booster so it stops rising, starts falling, deploys chutes and touches down, all before you get more than 25kms away? What\u0027s the point of using them then?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a spaceX style launch, separated side boosters, switched to them and activated mechjeb2 auto landing. Both boosters touched down absolutely perfectly, about 50 metres apart. This was it! I was super excited! Painfully i then found out about the 25km problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds contradictory, but i had separated those boosters very, very early. And it was just lucky that by the time they landed and i switched back to my craft, it was at appoapsis- a pure fluke, and a result i haven\u0027t been able to replicate since!Although appoapsis was way too high.. Like 50km over target. I assume the rocket just kept going flat out, straight line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realise i could go sub-orbital, separate, get to orbit and switch back to them afterwards, so i can ride them down to avoid disappearing. But that is not on. I feel like this is a major step backwards for the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn ksp 1.1, the parts didn\u0027t disappear? You just hoped they didn\u0027t destroy themselves on impact, and even if so, there was often debris that survived.. And\u00A0I\u0027ve seen mechjeb2, guide two separate craft, and land them simultaneously no problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, FMRS would be amazing, but it seems to clash with the expansion packs- making history, breaking ground. And i really want them. Reverting back to 1.1 is not worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone tell me if its possible to get around the 25km barrier? I rate if it could be disabled, the auto pilot won\u0027t disengage, parachutes will work again, and you wouldn\u0027t have to just shoot and hope for the best. Maybe even the ability to switch vehicles in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the record, i don\u0027t care if the recovered parts are worth peanuts. It\u0027s what makes building, launching and getting to orbit satisfying. It\u0027s really irritated me, and even poisoned my mindset. I find myself just building what ever, using the money cheat and who cares because its all just going to be thrown in the trash. May as well just play sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd i have really been trying to do the career and earn enough money the right way, but i feel like the game is just stealing my sh!t and ruining the experience. Even if recovery isn\u0027t worth a lot or even worth nothing, it makes me more build conscious and the process a lot more enjoyable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy doesn\u0027t the game just put me straight into orbit and take all the fun out of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry, i know im ranting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-17T09:20:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour post implies this was easy in 1.1.
