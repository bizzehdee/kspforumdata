I always thought all you need is a ship in your fleet to meet the requirements even if it is not the ship you are controlling.\n\nJust to elaborate on kurja\u0027s response: Fulfilling a contract means that you are **CURRENTLY** satisfying **ALL** the contract requirements with the **CURRENTLY** controlled ship.\n\nNote that contract requirements are not a thing that you \u0022check off and you\u0027re done\u0022. They\u0027re live status indicators, that will gray out again if you stop meeting the condition. For example, suppose you have a contract that says \u0022Be in orbit around the Mun\u0022 and also some other condition. To fulfill the contract, you have to be in orbit around the Mun *while* you satisfy the other condition. It\u0027s not like you can send a ship, orbit the Mun, okay that\u0027s done, then leave Mun orbit and satisfy the other condition. The \u0022Mun orbit\u0022 requirement would light up green the moment you enter Mun orbit... and would then gray out again as soon as you leave Mun orbit.\n\nIt also only applies to the currently controlled ship. Suppose the contract is to \u0022launch a new station on a solar orbit.\u0022 You build your station, and it satisfies all the conditions (have a docking port, etc.) except \u0022be in orbit around the Sun\u0022 since you haven\u0027t gotten that far yet. You launch it on an escape trajectory from Kerbin, and then you go off to work with other ships. The contract won\u0027t automatically get fulfilled when the ship leaves Kerbin\u0027s SoI, since you\u0027re not currently controlling it. The contract will stay live... until you eventually switch to the ship, and then it will complete."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T20:04:48Z","Content":"Thanks good to know but not necessarily true\n\nOthers have stated for the Mine ore on Eve and deliver it to Guilly contracts that you can mine ore on Eve and then deliver different ore (I am assuming with a different ship) to guilly"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:02:19Z","Content":"It is true regarding your original question about the stations.

Each click of launch button will increment launchID, and the newly launched vessel has all parts associated with that ID. When you accept a contract, it also records the current launchID. This way the game can track whether it\u0027s newly launched (relative to contract acceptance) or not. Docking makes this matter more complex, but seems not scope of discussion here.\n\nThis also explains the Ore situation as Ore is just a resource and there\u0027s no launchID for it, so game has no way to rigorously check whether it\u0027s the same ore or not. Plus in real life if you have such contract, you also only care whether you\u0027ve mined the given amount of ore and send back a given amount of ore, regardless of whether the two sets of ore are indeed the same or not, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:37:35Z","Content":"I think some contracts require simultaneous completion of conditions, while some are not (like tourist / explore / survey)."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T02:23:09Z","Content":"I will check (because I can\u0027t recall for certain), but I think the mechanic was changed.
