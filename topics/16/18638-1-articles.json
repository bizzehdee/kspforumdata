If I have say and fuel tank, a tricoupler, another fuel tank, then an engine, will the engine use the fuel tank above the tricoupler or do I need to use the fuel pipe things. Also what if I used a decoupler instead. Thank you for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T20:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi winged_wolf, the tricoupler is fuel crossfeed capable, so an engine will use fuel from above, but a decoupler is not capable of transferring fuel anymore (it could in the demo) so you will need to connect a fuel line from a tank to the decoupler, allowing fuel to then flow through it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"winged_wolf","CreatedById":46637,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T20:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you very much! No wonder why my fuel didn\u0027t last as long as I thought it would... also that explains what the fuel crossfeed value is!
