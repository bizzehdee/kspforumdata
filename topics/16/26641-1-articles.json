The funny part is in a strange twist, even the fact that it would be a bobing an weaving battle could end up being an edurance test for the object being hit. Fuel levels wouldn\u0027t be too much an issue (unless for bad/good timing) but could end up setting up an oscillation or causing fatigue of parts to set up and end up doing a decent amount of damage anyway without hitting. Also as I said in the above post (edited) that you would go for a burst when near the target like anti-aircraft missile do. So they will be pretty much guided fragmentation missile. Cause even if you don\u0027t get a direct hit, you can still damage protective coverings, solar power, or any number of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efunny thing just thought of it. really Swarm Missle brages would be the most effective thinking about it.
