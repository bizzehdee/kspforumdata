Start with a center engine, add 8 engines around it. Pick one to start with and add a fuel line from it to the next one, then continue to number 4, and add a fuel line from number 4 to the center. Then repeat for the other side, so that the starting and ending engines are opposite of each other and Bam, you have a 9 engine asparagus stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T01:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing I\u0027ve always found helpful is to use the symmetry option equal to how many boosters you want to drop when you stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll use a simple \u0022one layer\u0022 asparagus setup for an example (1 center \u0022core\u0022 stage, surrounded with 6 \u0022booster\u0022 stages identical to the core)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 2 \u0022simple\u0022 options for how to set up the staging, but they only differ by how many tanks fall off when you press space. Specifically, you can drop 2 or 3 boosters per stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor dropping 2 boosters per stage, set symmetry to 2x, and just copy your booster stage 3 times around your core stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor dropping 3 per stage, it\u0027s pretty much the same thing, except you need to set symmetry to 3x and copy the booster stage 2 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that setting up the boosters this way is very helpful when it comes to arranging the fuel lines and staging, because the game will automatically set the symmetry options to match the setting you used when placing the boosters, and the decouplers are already grouped together to drop the boosters symmetrically. The other ways that I know of use 6x symmetry for the boosters but are forced to turn off symmetry for placing fuel lines, and because all the decouplers are in the same group it becomes much harder to set up the staging correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: sorry about the \u0022wall of text\u0022, if you\u0027re only interested in standard asparagus staging you don\u0027t need to read anything below this line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere ARE other ways to arrange asparagus staging, the most straightforward of which is simply adding another \u0022ring\u0022 to the above example. The second ring would need to be made from 12 boosters, and attached to the first ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also experiment with adding fuel tanks to the top of the earlier stages to offset the fact that those earlier stages are feeding more engines than the later stages. Doing that means that the staging times become more similar (60s, stage, 60s, stage, etc), and it also helps keep an asparagus staged rocket\u0027s TWR near 2.0 in the lower atmosphere, which I consider to be the \u0022butter zone\u0022 for trading gravity losses versus drag losses below 20km. Then again, YMMV and you might prefer a different TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I use MechJeb for ascent, and because it limits the rocket to the terminal velocity, I tend to use the \u0022add fuel tanks to boosters\u0022 method on rockets that I build that end up with a launch TWR over 3, that way the rocket stays as close to full throttle as possible in the lower atmosphere. It does drive part counts up a little (more for bigger rockets because of struts), but it does ensure that the \u0022launcher\u0022 part of the rocket has at least enough fuel to put the \u0022payload\u0022 part of it into orbit, and I can use whatever fuel is left to give the payload a \u0022kick-start\u0022 for its departure burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the fuel isn\u0027t wasted even if the payload is going to stay in orbit around Kerbin, as I have a very \u0022thirsty\u0022 orbital fuel depot that I put there specifically to act as a \u0022fuel vampire\u0022 of sorts, sucking any leftover propellant out of launcher stages that would otherwise end up as space junk. To prevent those stages from counting as debris, I have made a habit of putting a probe core, RTG, 2 sphereical monopropellant tanks, and a few strategically-placed RCS thrusters on the upper stages of all my launchers, that way even if I don\u0027t have any spare fuel storage capacity in orbit I can still safely de-orbit the stage (not to mention that it helps that the \u0022victim\u0022 spent stages can pilot themselves to the \u0022vampire\u0022 station) If/when I run out of tank space on that station, my next launch will be another empty tank module for the fuel storage station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing that ends up putting solutions in place for a bunch of problems by turning them into solutions for other problems, and it does that before those \u0022problems\u0022 can even become \u0022problematic\u0022 in the first place! Pretty efficient, if I do say so myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helped you figure out Asparagus staging, and maybe someone finds the \u0022space junk = free fuel\u0022 solution useful in their space program!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Sci\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
