So far I am able to make some nice plane which is not able to get into orbit for several reasons. One of them is I run out of intake air around 20-26km. I am using turbojets and I cant figure it out which intake is best and how many of those are needed for a turbojet to make it work for longer time. Also I have heard about those RAPIERs.

Turbojets work great in atmosphere to get your speed up, but once you are forced to shut them down you need to have something running. RAPIERS run for longer with less intake air before they switch modes, but it is a matter of whether they will provide enough thrust by themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried toroidal engines yet, they seem like they would be ideal upper atmosphere/vacuum engines, but they wouldn\u0027t provide any thrust from the ground (unless you wanted to waste oxidizer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to optimize a configuration of two turbojets, two RAPIERS and one LV-N, but balancing the fuel and weight is troublesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T10:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShock cones provide most air per part, while ram intakes provide most air per intake mass.
