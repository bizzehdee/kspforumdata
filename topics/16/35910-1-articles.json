When building a rocket, you can\u0027t just put something in cargo-bay. Everything has to be attached to your rocket. What you can do is attach a docking port inside the bay, attach another one facing it, and then attach your cargo to the second docking port. That way, you can undock your cargo in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
