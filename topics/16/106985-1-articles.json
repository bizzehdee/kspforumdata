It should update automatically.\n\nIf not, like me... I\u0027m also asking if the patcher is working at all?! Same behavior here. Of course we could download the whole game anew. And what then? Maybe unzip to a new folder and manually copying the savegame. Or is it possible to unzip with overwrite (missing any deletions)?"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:54:33Z","Content":"Updater never seems to work for me on Mac either. Re-download whole game or install via Steam are your only two alternative options."}]}
