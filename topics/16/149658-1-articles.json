My ship wasnt turning as I would expect it to. By that I mean, I press D to turn it to the right, but instead the nose of the ship (where the docking port was) would turn like down \u0026amp; to the left. This made it extremely difficult to line up the docking. Anyone know exactly what was happening? Maybe its something to do with having the navball show relation to target instead of orbit or something? Or why else would the ship not control the way you expect it to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T14:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first you docked, then after docking you released from the docking port and then your ship seems to control badly? Am I correct, because I can\u0027t tell by how you told it to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is the case it is possible you had a command pod/probe core attached to the module that you docked, then after releasing a offset probe core or pod or rotated one switched to be the active probe core on the vessel. By the sound of it this is the case and the probe core that becomes active after docking is rotated in relation to your previous probe core (the one you shed during docking I guess)\u003Cbr\u003E\nDepending on the orientation of your active pod/probe part it will change the navball in the direction it is facing. Probably rotating the horizon on the navball. Does your navball switch after you undock? If the answer is yes then I\u0027m 99percent sure this is the case. Potentially this also whacks the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E symmetry of balance because you shed weight, also causing control issues obviously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can still use the vessel in most cases though. You just have to cross translate and rotate against the offset rotation of your probe core.
