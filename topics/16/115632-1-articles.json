Two, because it\u0027s way too easy to break one, so a backup on-site is more than desirable. So they are attached to two radial decouplers for easy transport.\n\n![screenshot23.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot23.png)\n\nNow the funny thing is how that affects their probe cores orientation.\n\nThis is a rover with the decoupler still attached (although decoupled, it just lies on the girder because it can\u0027t get off...) - note the navball. Sideways, pointing at the horizon.\n\n![screenshot24.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot24.png)\n\nAnd this is the same rover (well, the same model), after some rough driving which tore the decoupler off.\n\n![screenshot22.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/screenshot22.png)\n\nSuddenly control scheme changes - formerly S/W turned it around (as turning the wheels does). Now it turns with Q/W. It\u0027s the same probe, same rover, one hard landing after a longish jump, that brought the decoupler on the bottom in contact with the ground and tore it off. The log (F3) showed only the decoupler lost.\n\nCould someone write something more in-depth about the game mechanics of probe core orientation?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T10:49:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T13:09:20Z","Content":"The probe orientation is not the issue here, If you right click the probe core and select \u0022control from here\u0022 it will reset to the probe cores \u0022correct\u0022 orientation which would match the second image.\n\nThe issue is that when you decouple the decoupler becomes the root part and the nav ball orientation changes to that. when you lost the decoupler the orientation changed to the Rovemax. which does not have the ideal orientation for a rover body.\n\nYour best bet would be to add an OKTO2 where you have those Oscar-B tanks to provide a better control point."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T13:23:46Z","Content":"Wait, so until I choose the probe core, the vessel is controlled from the... decoupler?\n\nFirst I made a rocket propulsion out of these.

That is not intended behaviour though, not sure the cause)"}]}
