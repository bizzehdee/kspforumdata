I need a control-from-here point backwards so that I can use the maneuver point on the navball for the LV-N. I\u0027ve tucked a Stayputnik in-between the landing gear pointed aft for that purpose, and the only place to fit that on is via strut. I could have put a mechjeb in the cargo bay, but then I\u0027d have to move the monopropellant tank or battery elsewhere, plus I\u0027d having an annoying red/green light coming out of the cargobay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgbox.com/YnN8Uf4E.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YnN8Uf4E.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T02:13:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T07:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could have fit a docking port jr. in the service bay.
