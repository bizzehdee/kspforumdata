Just when making these things, using the tricoupler method drops my fps and makes docking hell. In all honesty, this thread\u0027s been posted before, but all the ones that I\u0027ve found are dated well before .22 here, so I turn to you now.

It will slow down the FPS by a lot but it will at least make it easier to dock. Also, there are some texture compression plugins around here somewheres, can\u0027t remember where tho, look for those and they\u0027ll help too. Otherwise, your best chance is to go to Graphics under Settings at the Main Menu, not in game, and mess with those. Sad part is, KSP just demands so much and some people keep answering \u0027Get a better PC!\u0027 which is completely uncalled for. Best PC I can think of costs roughly $700 for me, I could afford it, but it will take me months and I have more important things to worry about than buying me a brand new PC rather than play this game on my laptop (its a really good laptop too, quad core and such, sorry not going to dig up the specs, its just really good for a laptop, cost me $500 cuz I needed for college and the current Desktop I had, was garbage.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a gaming PC can range way over a thousand dollars. No one has that kind of money unless you got some high end CAREER job. I\u0027m trying to get such job myself, going in for animations and what not, so yeah, lot of potential there. But I just started college this fall (i been to college before, but dropped out :/ cuz I wasn\u0027t positive on my previous major, this time I am.) So I\u0027m sure I can afford a more decent Desktop in the future, but seriously.... \u0027Get a better PC\u0027 is NOT THE ONLY ANSWER!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...yeah.

If you strut from the center of your ship to the drop tanks, then the strut attachment points will stay visible on your ship/station even after changing scenes. That\u0027s why you should always strut from parts you are going to discard to parts you are going to keep.
