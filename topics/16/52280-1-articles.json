You may be able to edit the .cfg and make it refer to the MkI cockpit\u0027s interior, if you don\u0027t mind it being the same. Not sure if it\u0027d line up correctly though, but something to try. I imagine a full, complete IVA is planned, though of course I can never speak with 100% certainty, as there are many things in development that are tentative.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T22:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this thread come up so often?
