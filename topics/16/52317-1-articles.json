Anyway,After THAT,I have the probe core,an FLT-200 tank and one ant engine.One.ant.engine.And that got me to Jool,No joke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/70tFtfd.png\u0022 alt=\u002270tFtfd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here was my best viewpoint.I had to circle Jool cause i was so far away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L16JI9O.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022L16JI9O.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is,How can I improve on this design while keeping the same\u0022One rocket\u0022idea?Post any suggestions you have Below.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T03:49:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 03:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GamerMitch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T05:06:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore fuel, fewer engines. Once you\u0027re out of atmosphere, you can trade time for engine power. That is to say, burn fewer engines for longer. See how your upper stage has 3 engines? Dump the outer 2 and run their fuel lines to the middle one, then eject the tanks when they\u0027re empty. That\u0027s just one suggestion to give you the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue","CreatedById":1917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T05:21:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless you need lots of thrust fast (such as when you\u0027re inside an atmosphere) excess engines = excess weight = wasted thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once you\u0027ve set yourself up with a transfer to Jool and are on your way out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, set up a manoeuvre node to adjust your Periapsis to be closer to Jool. This is what\u0027s called a mid-course correction. It usually uses very much less velocity-change than the initial departure burn, and can be on any angle. So try fiddling with the different controls on the manoeuvre node to see what results in getting the Periapsis lower. If you get the Periapsis less than 200,000 meters, you can aerocapture into orbit around Jool very easily. If your Periapsis disappears, this means unless you do another mid-course correction later, you\u0027re going to collide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T08:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I used on my first flight to the Jool system using much of the same technique, only I had a live Kerbal in a lander pod. I did this as a test flight to see how many moons I could visit in the Jool system on my first try and possibly land on Lythe. This rocket uses jet engines to reach about 22,000 meters and then the main engine fires as the jets decouple. There\u0027s no asparagus staging in the outer engines so all of them burn out at the same time. Then I used the Ion engines to do all of my maneuvers and orbiting of Jool and Lythe. Just the two Ion engines shown on the craft below had enough power to move the craft well enough in physical time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/1046252431486210894/5162E5C0F79E51E08DC0947DBEB6D78AD12AC31B/\u0022 alt=\u00225162E5C0F79E51E08DC0947DBEB6D78AD12AC31B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first trip to Jool and the maneuver that put me on an intercept for Lythe.

The rule is, do not follow the maneuver blindly when going on interplanetary travel. Maneuvers are very useful in telling you the general direction and dv, but for precise navigation you need to watch what the trajectory is really doing and issue corrections, the sooner the better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Crispy F","CreatedById":91882,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T12:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is actually quite helpful - been playing for a while but I\u0027ve not made Jools yet (vanilla set-up, no mods etc), but I also hadn\u0027t considered using jet engines at all.

If the rocket got out as far as Jool, then there is no need to modify it. It works just fine. The problem you had was in not aiming it correctly so you got a crappy encounter. Probably because you didn\u0027t do enough tweaking of the trajectory while en route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand that KSP\u0027s whole map and maneuver system was designed simply to get you to Mun. Both its ease of use and the accuracy of its representations of your future position fall off dramatically the further from Kerbin you go. Thus, you must accept that if you\u0027ve just completed your ejection burn at Kerbin and see a Jool encounter that looks good, this is a lie. You can\u0027t simply warp out there without doing anything because you\u0027ll be WAY off when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is therefore imperative to do 1 or more minor tweaks to your trajectory while en route. For nearby planets like Duna and Eve, you probably only need 1 tweak at about the 3/4 point of the trip. For everything else, 3 or 4 tweaks are usually necessary. When I go to Jool, I usually make tweaks at each 1/4 of the total trip out. I only try to get close to exactly what I want on the last one, but the others are necessary to stay in the ballpark so that the 4th tweak is still only a tweak instead of a major burn. And even then, you can\u0027t truly finalize your Pe with any planet until you\u0027re within its SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T14:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2 very simple changes will work wonders I reckon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, get rid of that whacking great and heavy RCS tank.
