I would advise mounting some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on your satellites and using that to match speeds as best as possible. Realistically speaking, though, you\u0027re not going to be able to match speeds perfectly and the satellites will drift over time. My best advice for a communications network is simply to throw a whole bunch of satellites into a whole bunch of different orbits and let the laws of probability, combined with some powerful antennae, ensure that at least one is always in range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, wait... are you playing with the stock CommNet or RemoteTech?
