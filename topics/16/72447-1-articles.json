In OS X the detailed log file you want is called Player.log and is located in ~/Library/Unity in the user\u0027s home directory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecent versions of OS X make the user\u0027s home Library directory invisible, so to access it either use launch Console and access it there, or navigate to it by holding down the Option key and selecting Go from the Finder drop-down menu. Holding down Option will reveal the Library file in the list.
