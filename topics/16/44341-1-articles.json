It will then slide and bounce uphill, picking up speed the more parts it knocks off the thing.

KSP\u0027s grip model isn\u0027t really finished yet, and doesn\u0027t work particularly well. What I\u0027ve seen work is attaching a few ion engines and xenon tanks (and lots of solar panels), and using them to provide extra grip by applying thrust downwards (the engines are pointed towards space). Now, this doesn\u0027t work too well for bigger vehicles, but liquid engines can do the same thing (just a lot less efficiently).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t help, you can always try the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35147-Rubber-Band-Inc-Caterpillar-Tracks-Alpha\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etrack mod\u003C/a\u003E. Can\u0027t guarantee it\u0027ll work better, but the tracked vehicles I\u0027ve built tended to have pretty good ground-holding abilities (though that may be because they were insanely heavy, but that\u0027s another story).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T02:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for the ion engine solution, I have a 4-man rover and even a single ion engine providing some downforce certainly helps, as does a nice wide wheelbase.

It also means they roll back onto their wheels more often than not. For the larger ones I provide a mechanism to get them back upright using one LVN-77 on each side pointing upwards (so, downwards when inverted) and a very small amount of rocket fuel, a quick blip of the throttle and it\u0027s right way up again. For smaller rovers I tend to use one or two of the small (not smallest) landing legs to flip it back over.

I especially like the idea of strapping an ion engine to it. I\u0027d make roll cages but I\u0027m trying to keep the part counts down so I can add them to a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn base instead of having them as a standalone vehicle. I do try to keep the base wide and the center of mass low, but it seems like everything that belongs on the bottom is just made of lighter pieces. I have the same problem but to a much greater extent with the mark 3 fuselage. Its center of mass is absolutely bonkers and makes building planes with it very difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xzabath","CreatedById":66393,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T04:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use RCS on my rovers turn the sas on and low and wide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
