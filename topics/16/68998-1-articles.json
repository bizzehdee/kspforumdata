That is, they have a mass listed in the VAB or SPH, but that mass is not calculated when physics take over. Is there a comprehensive list of parts that have this feature? I ask because I just noticed that the small science experiment packages (seismic, temperature, gravioli, and air pressure) seem to share it, which was news to me.
