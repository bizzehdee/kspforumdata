If so, then it is inherently unstable. Think about the fins that used to be put at the bottom of rockets, or the feathers on arrows - if the rocket/arrow starts to turn a bit then fins/feathers drag the back of the rocket/arrow behind the head so it carries on flying in a straight line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow imagine an arrow fired backwards. While the arrow is going perfectly straight then it is OK, but the moment anything disturbs it then the drag will try to yank the feathers round so they are trailing the head. The same thing happens when you put a spaceplane on top of a rocket - the drag on the wings can be so large that nothing can correct things if the rocket veers even a little bit off course - EXCEPT for an even larger set of fins at the bottom of the rocket!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world it is possible to build control and navigation systems that will keep a rocket pointing so very directly ahead that unbalanced drag near the nose won\u0027t destabilise things. (Indeed, modern fighters are designed to be unstable so they are more manoeuverable, and need high-performance computer-controlled stabilisers to stop them tumbling!) However that is near impossible in a simulation game on a PC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJerryRacer\u0027s idea sound best - strap two spaceplanes either side of the lifter, as far down the stack as you can put them.
