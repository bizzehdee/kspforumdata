I put only one vector engine on the orbiter itself and another two under the ET (because they are too powerful and heavy if all three are on the orbiter). It launches quite well if not perfect. The SRBs separate around 12km and it will continue to fly just fine without wobbling or anything. But it starts to get out of control above 30km and really bad above 35km. With the help of MechJeb, it won\u0027t lose control completely but it\u0027s still not a smooth ride (you can see in the pics below that pitch, yaw, and roll controls all go crazy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it has to do with CoM shifting place\u00A0as fuel drained at first so I tried pumping fuel around to keep CoM relatively still but it doesn\u0027t seem to make things any better if not even worse. I tried adjusting the thrust limit of the two engines on the ET to keep the thrust vector point at CoM but that doesn\u0027t seem to help either.
