By doing that you can have them all connected to eachother. To launch them equally, you have to wait till one is about 3/4 to 90 degrees around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize about my spelling and possible grammar mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T22:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TerrificToby\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TerrificToby\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy problem is this: how on earth to do it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook me a bit to figure this out too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The first satellite should go as close to as possible directly above KSC, and you need to get it there before you orbit, or you\u0027ll lose communication. To do this, just make your ascent very steep; do only a very slight gravity turn. Push your apoapsis out to near geo-sync height (2868.75km) then cut your engines, coast there, and burn to circularize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The second satellite should be 120 degrees retrograde from the first satellite. Here\u0027s how to get it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a) Put your second vessel in 100km circular Kerbin orbit. (Don\u0027t worry if you lose comms; you\u0027ll get them back in time for your maneuver.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Set up a maneuvering node at approximately 60 degrees east around your orbit from KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c) Add prograde to the maneuvering node until the apogee is at geosync height (2868.75 km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d) Target the first satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E e) Now grab the maneuvering node ring so you can rotate it around your orbit. Rotate it west-ward until the closest point of approach to the target is about 6000 km. (6000 km is one side of the equilateral triangle of satellites.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E f) Perform the maneuver, then circularize at apokee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) For the third satellite, do it just like the second, but referenced to the second satellite instead of the first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
