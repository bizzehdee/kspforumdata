Dres and Eeloo are far off and their inclination difference can be easily adjusted. I\u0027d like to give you the theory behind the actual maneuver so that you understand it for basically all maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s take the planets out of the equation, let\u0027s say you are just orbiting the Sun at Kerbin\u0027s altitude and there\u0027s a ship where Moho is. What do you have to do to reach it? Well, you\u0027d have to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) correct your inclination of 7 degrees\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) decrease your peri so that it intersects that of the target and do that so that you reach the target\u0027s orbit when the target is there as well, so as to have a rendez-vous\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause orbits are very costly to change in Sun\u0027s orbit, it\u0027s very efficient to bundle these 2 maneuvers into one. And because you can only change the inclination at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E, it takes more than a year (even though Moho orbits the Sun every 100ish days) to get a good encounter. Anything but this, meaning either correcting the inclination or reducing your orbit during your downward trip to Moho, will be less efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow let\u0027s bring in the planets back into the equation. Kerbin is for you just a slingshot so that your transfer costs less.\u00A0If you follow the numbers given by the Transfer Window Planner, you should get similar (but not exactly the same) results. Why similar? Minute deviations on your orbit, the fact that your transfer burn doesn\u0027t happen all at once, things like that. Let\u0027s say you do not get an encounter and do not even get the closest distance markers, pretty common for Moho. Do not despair!\u00A0That means you need to perform a correction burn, big or small depending on your deviation. When is it the right time to do this? ASAP! Meaning, place a maneuver node 5-10-30 minutes ahead of your trajectory and fiddle with the numbers. Have a tool like Precise Node or Precise Maneuver to be able to add ever smaller increments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is the right time to do the correction immediately? We have to look at the big picture. Irrespective where you are regarding Kerbin, you are still orbiting the Sun. Now your orbit is eccentric and your starting point is basically your apoapsis AND your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 (where you presumably started this transfer) is nearby as well. Additionally, you can still benefit from some slingshot effects because you are in Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. Could you have done this correction more efficiently if you were at Kerbin\u0027s periapsis? Yes, but what\u0027s done is done now; the difference should still be marginal because it\u0027s a correction. It\u0027s still the best alternative you got.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really important to understand this theoretically because then, whatever happens, you will be able to adjust your burn to compensate.
