Docking is a great example of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get within 1 km of the other spacecraft, half of the work is done. From here, this is what I usually do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1: \u003Cstrong\u003EKill the relative velocity with respect to the target\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet the other spacecraft as your target and click on the speed indicator above the navball until it reads Target. The displayed speed will now be speed relative to the target (instead of orbital or surface speed) and, more importantly, the prograde and retrograde markers will now be determined by your \u003Cem\u003Erelative velocity\u003C/em\u003E vector. So, in order to kill the relative velocity between the ships, simply point towards the retrograde marker and thrust until the indicted Target speed is close to zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: \u003Cstrong\u003EApproach the target until you\u0027re within docking distance (~50 m is enough)\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that your relative speed is almost zero, line up your ship with the target bearing marker (the purple circular arcs) and thrust in that direction. You\u0027ll move directly towards the target. Don\u0027t move too fast, as you\u0027ll have to slow down to a halt again when you get closer. I find that something in the range 10-20 m/s is enough to cover the ~1 km in a couple minutes (and you can time accelerate if you don\u0027t want to wait that long). Then, once you\u0027re within ~50 m, kill the relative velocity again (by thrusting towards the retrograde marker again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible that your initial thrust was not exactly in the direction of the target ship, so that your closest approach distance is larger than 50 m. If that\u0027s the case, when you see the distance to the target increasing again, stop, and repeat the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: \u003Cstrong\u003EDock using RCS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you\u0027re within 50 m, it\u0027s time to dock. I advise deactivating your main engines, as you don\u0027t want to mess the delicate docking approach by an accidental hit of the SHIFT key. Turn on RCS. \u003Cstrong\u003ECrucial\u003C/strong\u003E: hit V to switch your camera to CHASE view. Without this, using the RCS translation controls is much more complicated, as the view of your ship won\u0027t intuitively match the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow place the view \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E your spacecraft (assuming the docking port is in the front). It\u0027s not necessary to switch to docking mode controls. If you don\u0027t, then AWSD will still control the orientation (i.e., rotation) of your ship, while IJKL\u002BHN will control translation: moving lef/right with J and L, up/down with I and K, and forward/backward with H and N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s just a matter of steering your spacecraft towards the docking port, making sure you\u0027re properly aligned (i.e. pointing parallel to the port). Remember that it\u0027s a 3D thing so keep checking that your alignment is correct in both the left/right axis and the up/down axis by placing the camera to one side or above/below the craft, correcting, and then returning to the back view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick to facilitate docking when you\u0027re learning is to orient the target spacecraft so that the docking port points e.g. South. Then when you\u0027re in the approaching spacecraft, you\u0027ll know you\u0027re pointing parallel to the target docking port by keeping a heading due North. But honestly once you get some practice with this, you\u0027ll be able to orient and align the spacecraft simply by eyeballing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit\u003C/strong\u003E: by the way, you\u0027ll be surprised of the strength of the magnets on the docking ports the first time you dock!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit2\u003C/strong\u003E: I forgot to mention this: make sure the RCS ports on your ship are \u003Cem\u003Earound the center of mass\u003C/em\u003E when you\u0027re designing it in the VAB.

Remember - use RCS for translation, probe torque for rotation, and shut off RCS when you want to rotate unless you\u0027ve got your thrusters balanced so they don\u0027t give any unwanted translation.

So slick. Well, we\u0027re now hurtling through the cosmos on a near-intercept course with our target spacecraft, but we\u0027d really like to stop by for some tea and not zoom past at hundreds of meters per second. So what we\u0027re gonna do here is wait until we\u0027re nice and close (hopefully within the physics load distance of 2-point-something km), align ourselves with the retrograde velocity indicator cause we\u0027re already in target mode (you better be!), and burn to kill our relative velocity. Now, be careful when I say that, cause I don\u0027t mean want to stop entirely - we just need to scrub off enough relative speed that we give ourselves some time to maneuver. Docking is a continuous process, you never just stop completely.\u003Cp\u003ESay we\u0027re coming in at a relative velocity of 120m/s at 2km out. We\u0027re gonna wanna slow down gradually to something more manageable, first like 50, then 20, then 10, then 5, then 1m/s. Our rate of closure is gonna depend on how far we are away, so we\u0027ll slow down more as we get closer. If you\u0027re paying attention to life and the navball, you\u0027ll probably notice that there\u0027s those nice little pink direction-to-target indicators, and also that the relative velocity indicators don\u0027t match up with them. We need to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we\u0027re in the process of slowing down and we\u0027re typically oriented retrograde, we\u0027ll talk about \u0022pushing\u0022 the navball indicators around. If we thrust with our ship\u0027s nose aligned somewhere to the side of our retrograde velocity indicator (green with an X), the indicator will move \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from where we\u0027re pointing. In this way, we can brake AND push that little bastard so it\u0027s more or less aligned with the target retrograde marker (pink triangle-thing). That\u0027s what we wanna do. As we close the 2km or so to our target, we want to be slowing down in a series of steps, and lining those two indicators up at the same time. In no time we\u0027ll be within a hundred or so meters of our target, and since we\u0027ve been making sure the keep the velocity and target markers aligned, we\u0027re heading straight for it. Now all there is to do is find your docking port of choice, swing the ship around in that direction, and finish the job with RCS (which I\u0027m gonna assume people know how to use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you look at that, you\u0027re docked and it took less than 10 minutes to do it!

Lot\u0027s of people will be glad to help you, myself included. I assure you docking stock is quite doable, although no harm in having some mods to help like Docking Port Alignment Indicator for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1613449224\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/40423-131-docking-port-alignment-indicator-version-670-updated-053117/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:213px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-13T23:23:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2017 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
