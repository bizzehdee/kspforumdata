The Moon is only a few days away, the \u0022abort protocol\u0022 was barely different than \u0022proceed as planned\u0022. Moon landing can be cancelled because a stage malfunction would lead to the crew being stranded, but the overall time to return is barely shortened, but is not an issue because it is already short in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s even any meaningful treatement to severe irradiation. The most we can do, be it down on Earth or millions of miles into deep space, is prevent it. So probably kerbalism allows crew to be automatically healed upon recovery, but realistically, the crew is already doomed, even if rapid recovery were possible. And if rapid recovery was possible, I think the abort plan shoud have been triggerd from the first or second coronal blast (evaluating their frequency and your resistance to it probably could have indicated they would not make it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think our (RL) take on this will be to test each subsystem extensively before heading to Mars, precisely because there is no abort plan. Before your second mission to Mars, I advise you to do the same, and send your Mars vessel say, on a mission over an extended period of time around the Moon, where an abort is possible. Also pointing the engines toward the Sun (assuming crew compartiment are at the other end) should reduce radiation, if kerbalism is well coded, and this strategy is what spaceX intends to do IRL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for as salvaging your current mission, well if your kerbals can attempt to go home any faster than following the mission plan, it may be worth trying. If you have a very powerfull rescue craft, you don\u0027t necessarrily have to plan for a braking plan, any Earth flyby is good and the rescue craft can do most of the work (it would need a rescue craft with as much or maybe more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E than the Mars mission itself, but due to the length of the mission, mass can probably be save on life support and Mars playload).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonnally, I think I would carry the mission as far as possible. The kerbals on board were aware it was a dangerous mission. If you got remote control system, the craft can be put in orbit around Mars and be used for its materials by future missions. Without remote control system, you should be able to put the craft in a resonant orbit to possibly retrieve it later, sending a small probe to hack the control system and using the fuel onboard, assuming it won\u0027t disappear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-01T21:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223408411\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176300\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530458445\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022128066\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFunky\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, NFunky said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a heads up, unfortunately it looks like MechJeb won\u0027t plot maneuvers in a heliocentric orbit.\u00A0 The vessel has to be in a planet\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, or the planner gets stuck at \u0022Computing: 2%\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will, you just have to target Earth, and then do a Hohmann transfer.\u00A0 A porkchop planner will only work on bodies outside the Suns \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E in this situation, and well, yeah.....\u00A0\u00A0 I didn\u0027t mention this before, as you didn\u0027t say \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E in the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
