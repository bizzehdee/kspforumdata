I have a small orbital science craft that i\u0027ve been trying to return to earth from LEO (about 200km). I\u0027ve tried setting my perigee to anywhere between 80km to 40km. The issue is that the probe (and everything directly behind the heat shield) is heating up and exploding, in some cases, even before the shield starts ablating. My first thought is that the shield heats up and the heat is transferred to whatever is touching it, so I\u0027ve experimented with putting different things between the probe and the shield but I still get the same result. The probe heats up and explodes, due to it\u0027s much lower heat tolerance. I\u0027m not an engineer or anything but it would seem to me that a heat shield is supposed to, you know, shield things from heat? I\u0027m I missing something?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Human Person","CreatedById":174876,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T00:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223293641\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170851\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518482517\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002265605\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThomJ\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, ThomJ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve experimented with putting different things between the probe and the shield\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, that usually does the trick.
