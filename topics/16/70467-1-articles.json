E.g. you have a stack of capsule, 6-way-hub, fuel tank. Now you take hub and tank and save them as a subassembly. Since you split the sub-tree off at the node connecting the hub to the capsule, the subassembly can now only be attached with that node\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein case \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, you should be able to attach the subassembly with any open node of the root part which can also be normally used to attach that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, keep some things in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) KSP crafts and subassemblies are always structured as trees, and attachment rules are mostly what you would expect from a (abstract and very simply implemented) tree, not neccesarrily from a spacecraft. E.g. there is a significant difference between a part being attached to a craft, and a part being the reciever of such attachement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) for some inexplicable reason, a part can have only two nodes with which it can be attached to a vessel, while a less limited number of nodes can allow other parts to attach to that part in turn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) if you reattach a subassembly it basically behaves as if you had manually attached all the parts of it. Which also means that all open nodes of the subassembly, even if they can\u0027t be used to attach the subassembly, can be used to attach to the subassembly once it\u0027s reattached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) There is a mod, SelectRoot, where you can change the root of your craft-tree and it will rebuild the tree accordingly. It can really help with tricking KSP into creating the structure you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Just a word of caution: Unusual Roots, e.g. building a rocket from the engine up instead of from the capsule down, can lead to weird behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, the crafts being structured as trees, with practically no editor support for reorganizing that tree, is a giant PITA. I can see why they save crafts as trees, and especially now with so much already built based on that structure I would not want them changing it, but a little bit more support in the editor and less hidden implications would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T14:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Osprey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Osprey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could do this with the stack adapters that convert 2.5m to 3-4x 1.25 stacks.
