Don\u0027t ask me why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flight, with radial decouplers, especially the TT-70, there\u0027s not much if any net outwards force if you tie the booster to the center with struts, and you pretty much have to do that to keep it from wobbling and/or breaking off. The decoupler force is pretty much absorbed in breaking the struts, so the booster remains in the same position as before, just not attached, after which wind and gravity dictate what happens next. And that usually means the top end of the booster will pivot in and collide with the central stack, often destroying it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is definitely a change from previous behavior. Prior to 0.24.2, I didn\u0027t have to use Sepratrons at all on 1.25m boosters, SRB or LFO, as they were light enough for the decoupler to toss them aside provided it was mounted about at the booster\u0027s CoM. 2.5m boosters, however, needed a single pair of horizontal Septratons at about their CoM to get sufficiently clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese days, however, I need Sepratrons for all sizes of side boosters. Further, they have to be mounted horizontally at the very top end of the booster to keep that from pivoting inwards. And if the booster isn\u0027t mounted vertically for some reason (say on the tapered SXT 4-5m lower stage), they need a 2nd horizontal pair on the bottom end as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T14:15:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not make any specific tests with radial decouplers and struts yet but I trust reactordrone\u0027s results. It\u0027s a good thing this has been fixed as it was kind of annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current problem (which might be related to the fix) is that the decoupler loses all speed as soon as it decouples. If you decouple just the decoupler, you can see that it does not follow the rocket, it just stays in place and starts falling. That\u0027s why the booster turns inwards - the decoupler gives it rather strong impulse against its motion. This is the case all the time until krakensbane kicks in when the ship exceeds 750 m/s - after that everything is fine again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA wild guess is that the issue might be fixed if we mark the decoupler as massless? Haven\u0027t tried it yet.

The downside is that their mass stays with the rocket, not with the booster. And you need to mount the booster axially to them, not radially - so best approach would be to put a cubic octagonal strut or girder there and attach the booster radially to that. And of course you have to stage using action groups.
