I put the rocket designs I have in my head down on (digital) paper using qCad. This way, when I come home I can start building right away knowing my parts wont clip into each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radius of all rocket parts are easy enough, they are listed right in the wiki. However, the fuselage parts don\u0027t have a radius. I know they are roughly comparable to their rocket counterparts, however it is hard to guess. Does anyone know what the approximate radius of the Mk3 and Mk2 fuselages? And yeah, I do know they are not exactly round. I can fudge that and still be accurate enough for what I need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T21:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Mk2 and Mk3 fuselages are roughly as wide as the large parts (rockomax tanks) at the widest point. The Mk-3 is almost the same height, but the Mk-2 is slightly over half as high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing to watch out for though is that the connection points on Mk-3 components are not in the center.

If you mean you need more horizontal gap between your vertical Rockomax tanks, you can try stacking decouplers (decoupler on a decoupler). Or mount one of the modular girder segments (or cubic struts) to the decoupler, then mount the tank on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
