I sent a probe on a Fly by of Duna, Ike and Eve in a single flight and bought it back to kerbin (and ran multiple science experiments there). I realised that my parachute were not enough to stop my probe, so I loaded a save on my kerbin approach then I put the probe in Kerbin orbit to Rendez-vous with it with a grabbing pod and multipe parachutes. I recovered not even a point of science from all my Probe\u0027s science tools, Why ?? It was so hard to bring it back, I would rather send it to dres and make even more science !\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny clue on why I hadn\u0027t got my science from my recovery ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-14T18:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome to the forums!\u00A0 \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving this to Gameplay Questions, since \u0022Science and Spaceflight\u0022 is about real-world stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224144833\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208593\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221655227544\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022221818\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Procyonite\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n58 minutes ago, Procyonite said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put the probe in Kerbin orbit to Rendez-vous with it with a grabbing pod and multipe parachutes.
