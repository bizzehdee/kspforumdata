It seems that no matter how much I alter the designs of my ships, from tall rockets to wide ones and whatever, I only seem to have enough to barely make it into orbit. I basically think I must be doing something very wrong either build or pilot wise. I\u0027ve attached my latest attempt but I\u0027ve made a few different designs before and all seem problematic. I was hoping anyone could give me advice on what I could do to sort this issue out? Anything to do with build or piloting or any other way to save some fuel would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022Mediafire\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?6tfwag7f57mp2ac\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carthaginian","CreatedById":40635,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T17:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI took me a very big (15 tanks, 5 engines) rocket to get the 3 man pod to the Mun (still not landed it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wound up using four \u0027liquid boosters\u0027 that use up 3 tanks each and each topped by an SAS... played VERY carefully, it gets me (barely) into orbit.
