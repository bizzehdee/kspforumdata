I can barely get into LKO, but its terrible and uneven (I didnt use nodes). Trust me, I\u0027ve watched alot of videos and I cant figure out how to make a node to tell help me get to the mun, or LKO. If anyone can help me it would be appreciated.\n\nThank you very much Cheers!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T03:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gonzxor**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T03:27:04Z","Content":"After upgrading both the Tracking Station and Mission Control to level 2, you can create maneuver nodes by clicking on your blue orbit line in map mode.

You can see your rocket\u0027s current orbit drawn out in blue. Click on the orbit and a menu will pop up.

I was kinda confused on what they are really supposed to do, and how to use them. It seems you have to use them if you want to get good orbits or deep space ^-^..Thanks again Cheers!"}]}
