So I tried it. The problem is that it kept running out of fuel, having flame outs because the rocket was starved for oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I looked closely at the stock design, I see that the jet engines were attached to rocket-style fuel tanks, and that the rocket engine had one large rocket fuel tank as the main fuselage and one small jet-engine fuel tank directly attached to it. It\u0027s as if, in the design, the jet and rocket engines were accidentally reversed.

So I made my own variant of the Aeris 4A, re-doing the tanks so that the jets had jet fuel and the rocket had all rocket fuel.

With that design, I was able to orbit the craft, and also to have enough of both the jet fuel and the rocket fuel to de-orbit and land a perfect 3-point landing at the Space Center runway. It took a lot of tries, and I was only able to orbit the craft by going very fast and very high with the jets alone, before firing the rocket for the first time. I had to get the jets accelerating the craft fast enough at high altitude so that flames were coming off the body of the craft. Very exciting! :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, what I\u0027m wondering is, was the original Aeris 4A designed that way on purpose, with the fuel tanks wonky like that?

I tried doing an orbital flight based on the Wiki tutorial and still couldn\u0027t do it when trying to follow those particular instructions exactly to the letter, but I think that if I had tried harder to get more horizontal speed before switching to rockets, I could have done it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the video and the Wiki make mention of needing to manually transfer fuel before deorbiting. The wiki calls that a \u0022Construction Mistake\u0022, so I see that I wasn\u0027t entirely off-base in wondering if there was indeed something fishy there. I think the whole point of the design was to allow the craft to share the fuel in the tanks between the jets and the rockets over the course of the mission. That\u0027s the part I didn\u0027t understand when analyzing the original design, and which was never quite explained in any of the stuff above.

It seems to be designed so that the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio comes out close in the end, but the pilot\u0027s percentage of jet use to rocket use will always make that a random variable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I prefer my modified version of the Aeris with the jet fuel and rocket fuel kept strictly separate. I was able to get to orbit easier with it, and I didn\u0027t need to transfer fuel.
