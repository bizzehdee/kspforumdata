Having a high aspect ratio wing (long span but comparatively thin, like a glider) reduces lift induced drag, as does having sufficient wing area to avoid high angles of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. \u00A0 Wave drag. \u00A0 Dominant in the transonic flight regieme. \u00A0Optimise your area ruling to minimise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. \u00A0Shockwave drag ? \u00A0Significant at supersonic speeds. \u00A0Keep the wing tips and basically the entire aircraft behind the \u0022bow wave\u0022 created by the aircraft\u0027s nose, to minimise this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there are other aerodynamic qualities an aircraft might design for, but I\u0027m not going to include roll rate or supermanuverability since this is all about space planes not fighters. \u00A0 Of the above, 1) is not so important to me either because of the way I fly - i don\u0027t try to go fast until i\u0027m really high up, at which point the air is so thin, \u00A0i need a large wing area to avoid \u00A02) \u00A0more than i need small wing span to avoid 1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe trouble with FAR, at least to a noob like me, is that Transonic Wave drag is very much thrown in your face, \u00A0and I find myself becoming a slave to it. \u00A0Optimise the heck out of the problem you can see, \u00A0and forget about Lift Induced and Shock Drag because whilst they are modelled, they are buried deep in the UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be more specific, I always end up optimising so that the Mach 1 Wave Drag area is less than 20% of the Max Cross Sectional Area of the aircraft, sometimes much less. \u00A0 \u00A0However, so long as it\u0027s 30% or less you\u0027re likely to find penetrating the sound barrier easier than with stock aerodynamics in 1.05, and certainly much easier than with the brick wall you faced in 1.04.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unsatisfied with the aircraft I\u0027ve created so far because I\u0027d like to transfer some of their excessive performance in the middle part of the speed range, transonic, \u00A0into better performance at the bottom and top end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy am I bothered about low and slow? \u00A0 Because I like to set up IRSU infrastructure and have my space planes refuel and go beyond Kerbin to \u00A0other bodies, eg. Duna, Laythe. \u00A0 There they will need to make off-airport landings, and reducing the stall speed is vital to accomplish this in one piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy am I bothered about hypersonic flight through the Mesosphere? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the way I operate, this is the most critical regime of all. \u00A0 A lot of people fly like an airplane up to 20km/Mach 4, then transition to thrust-borne flight and zoom up to orbit at TWR \u0026gt; 1 in a cloud of burnt LF/O. \u00A0 \u00A0I tend not to use any oxidizer at all however and after getting as high as possible in airbreathing mode, light up the NERV engines simply keep flying ever higher on their meagre thrust. \u00A0 So long as I can keep a good lift/drag ratio above 30km and mach 4, \u00A0thrust will exceed drag and i\u0027ll slowly gain kinetic/potential energy. \u00A0 As we get ever higher, lift will decrease, but since speed is increasing, the centrifugal force of hurtling around the planet will cancel out more and more gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s our design point? \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Well, up to 30km/Mach 4 I still have RAPIERS , so this is the lower boundary. \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0And by 50km/Mach 7 I usually shut down and coast to an Apoapsis over 70km, \u00A0 so we can say the mid point is \u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EMach 5.5 and 35/40KM.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHow do you optimise for low drag here, \u003C/strong\u003Ewhich factors matter? \u00A0Is transonic/area ruling still the most important? \u00A0 \u00A0Does the aspect ratio of your wings still matter at all? \u00A0Presumably we still need plenty of wing area to keep our AoA down to reasonable levels in what is going to be VERY thin air?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, is it at all possible to have the above \u003Cstrong\u003Ewith also a reasonable landing speed, \u003C/strong\u003Eby sacrificing other flight areas \u00A0I don\u0027t find so important? \u00A0 Certain real world strategies aren\u0027t available to us in game, \u00A0eg. Variable Geometry wings, \u00A0flap blowing etc. but we shouldn\u0027t complain too loudly as orbital velocities in KSP are only 1/3 of real life, greatly reducing the speed range we have to get our designs to perform under.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is an example of my last design under FAR with Procedural Wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reasoning went thus -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1144.photobucket.com/user/narostel/media/collage_zpsi1scyltv.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022collage_zpsi1scyltv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/collage_zpsi1scyltv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the aircraft that resulted. \u00A0I had Interstellar mod installed, \u00A0so that thing you can see poking from the forward cargo bay is a pebble bed reactor that doesn\u0027t quite fit. \u00A0 \u00A0At the rear of the fuselage is a hybrid thermal turbojet/nuclear thermal rocket. \u00A0 It operates as a nuclear turbojet in the lower atmosphere, then as a nuclear thermal rocket higher up. \u00A0 Buried in the cargo bay is a mk1 cockpit whose canopy clips through the bay doors, and a mk1 passenger cabin. \u00A0 \u00A0 Crew capacity - 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1144.photobucket.com/user/narostel/media/2016-01-03_00002_zps1jozolcq.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00222016-01-03_00002_zps1jozolcq.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/2016-01-03_00002_zps1jozolcq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1144.photobucket.com/user/narostel/media/2016-01-03_00003_zpsbyynibl3.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00222016-01-03_00003_zpsbyynibl3.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/2016-01-03_00003_zpsbyynibl3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what most of these numbers mean, but i\u0027ve been told that green is good. \u00A0At sea level this design needs AoA of 4.2 to maintain level flight @ 120 m/s, which is as good as anything i\u0027ve made in FAR. \u00A0 The numbers on this screen don\u0027t seem to be affected by me lowering the flaps, but they do seem to have an effect when actually flying. \u00A0 With full fuel, I can stay airborne down to 70 m/s at about 10 degrees nose up. \u00A0After that the canard stalls and the nose drops. \u00A0I suppose there\u0027s not much point going to greater pitch anyway, it would just result in a tailstrike. \u00A0 \u00A0In practice we\u0027d be landing with little or no fuel. \u00A0I\u0027ve found that 3 Vernier engines translating upward can substantially lower airplane landing speeds on Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT - oh yes, the main point. \u00A0The best L/D ratio I seem to be able to get with this airplane is 3, in the \u0026gt;Mach 4, high altitude regime. \u00A0To me , that sounds very low, but can it realistically be made better?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-09T04:45:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2016 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AeroGav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
