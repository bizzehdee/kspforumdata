Having played since about 0.18, I can meet just about any challenge I put myself to. So when my latest career game presented a \u0022land a station on Eve\u0022 contract, I thought \u0022sure, I\u0027ll give it a go!\u0022 After all, my last mission was landing probes on Duna and Ike, and that was almost trivial.\n\nBut Eve is just too big and too hot in 1.0.4. I can\u0027t figure out how to get to the surface. The atmosphere chews through my ablator in minutes, even on the shallowest aerobraking trajectory. I never get a chance to open my chutes.\n\nI\u0027ve looked but I can\u0027t find any guides or examples of an Eve landing since the heating changes in 1.0.3, so I\u0027ve come to ask:\n\nDoes *anyone* know how to get down to Eve\u0027s surface safely? All I can think of is to bring thousands of dv and soft land on thrusters.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T20:10:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kermen**\n  \nanswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:09:11Z","Content":"Air brakes."},{"CreatedByName":"Kermen","CreatedById":131222,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T08:21:40Z","Content":"Slowing down isn\u0027t the problem.

I lost count after the first hour) If it went deeper, it would explode. The overheat temperature would rapidly trigger, and the heat would rise very rapidly. I found it best to actually not use the heat shield in aerobreaking, instead pointing the body prograde, and just rapidly rotating keeping all the parts at 80-90% heat. One of the reasons I had to aerobreak so much was that I hard to burn all of the chemical rocketfuel and half the monopropellent just to manage an orbit, but I had to go for a shallow entry into the atmosphere because Eve\u0027s atmosphere is like a brick wall at high speed. The worry I had near the end was that when my orbit was no longer eccentric, the probe wouldn\u0027t cool down fast enough between dipping into the atmosphere, so I had to maintain a shallow 86-85000m aerobreaking height. It\u0027s when I finally began landing did I use the heatshield.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T16:11:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermen","CreatedById":131222,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:59:26Z","Content":"I did it again with brakes.

Thanks for the tip.\n\nedit: reading some other posts about how Eve is a fiery deathtrap, I think maybe there *is* a glitch in the heating, maybe from having the game open too long, or loading a quicksave?

This is particularly noticeable during the new \u0022turbulent flow\u0022 heating, which is engaged if your craft is moving faster than a certain velocity at a given altitude. This doesn\u0027t seem to have been balanced with interplanetary aerobraking in mind.
