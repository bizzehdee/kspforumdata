Then perform a rendezvous as normal. Maneuver nodes will help. The target markers there are closest approach; you have a lot of time left before the asteroid will be anywhere near rendezvous so you might want to extend your apoapsis towards it.

If you have enough time I would try radicaly different approach. Launch into low circular zero inclination orbit and then perform bi-elliptic orbit plane transfer. With a little fiddling you have much more precise control over final orbit and since you need highly elliptic orbit anyway, you could actually do it with less deltaV than by launching directly into polar.
