Is it simply impossible to install any component during flight that is larger than a Kerbal\u0027s volumetric carrying capacity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-24T08:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it is- go into EVA construction mode and just take the parachutes out of the craft\u2019s inventory and attach them directly, without putting them in the engineer\u2019s own inventory first.\u00A0The inventory range is very limited so this is best done while the Kerbal holds on to a ladder and the crafts are docked (or grappled with a grabber/Klaw), but it is possible to do it with everything free-floating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you pick something up out of a cargo inventory and just put it down, it will adopt the same vector as the Kerbal you\u2019re controlling (both speed and direction), which can be used to cheekily move parts around. Grab the part out of inventory, move in the direction of where you want it to go and just drop it in space, it\u2019ll follow you along and you can repeat this grab-and-drop as many times as you like to herd the part where it needs to go. (This would probably be easier to show with a video but a) I don\u2019t currently have a KSP-capable computer and b) my video editing skills are non-existent.) Just be careful not to go too fast or you could lose some parts, and quicksave VERY FREQUENTLY as EVA construction can occasionally result in vessel-shattering glitches\u00A0that would make your \u201Clack of parachute\u201D issues seem trivial in comparison.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Billbo","CreatedById":216314,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-25T14:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for pointing me to EVA construction mode!\u00A0 All my Kerbals made it home safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
