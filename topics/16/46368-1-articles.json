For the best efficiency you want the low thrust to weight only 1 or 2 will provide. My own recent interplanetary stage had around 7,000 delta v in just the nuke stage.

Increase that total delta v a lot with a couple of grey tanks shoved on the bottom. I\u0027ve had a double orange tank stack with an extra grey tank, to reduce overheating, and still pushed off with a decent thrust to weight ratio. More fuel means more delta v means further travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso also also, those cones might look quite nice but they just add weight right now and don\u0027t help with the aerodynamics at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-24T10:18:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2013 10:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Monkeh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
