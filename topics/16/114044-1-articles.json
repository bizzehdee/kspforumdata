They will radiate more heat than any other comparable part (standard mk1 intake, engine nacelle) due to this, if only marginally. A regular fuel tank plus a radial intake might soak more heat before exploding due to the overall higher thermal mass available, but it won\u0027t radiate any more heat."},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:07:53Z","Content":"I found attaching engines directly to the precoolers is a good way to have them both explode in 1.02. Fuel tanks always seemed to be the best thing to attach engines to. I didn\u0027t notice any huge differences in having precoolers vs. having a radial intake, except for in dV. \n\nHaven\u0027t really tried it yet in 1.04.

Except that if you used a Ram Air Intake and an FL-T100 tank with the oxy removed you would get the same thing with less mass, more fuel, similar cooling, twice the intake air and all in less space. \n\nReally their only selling point is that they are an in-line intake.
