You can usually get about a 15% payload fraction with asparagus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, recently I\u0027ve had some discussion on a different thread regarding serial staging, and one of the designs we came up with for a five tonne payload would up with a 10% payload fraction, if that\u0027s something you might be interested in (simplicity of the design and all that). Asparagus is more efficient, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO (a single-stage booster) is also possible, though those aren\u0027t efficient at all - they usually run around 4% payload fraction. For a 3.3 tonne payload, though, they\u0027re viable and you can\u0027t beat the part count (a consideration for folks with slow machines) - try a Mainsail, Rockomax Decoupler, two orange tanks and an X200-16. 9 struts to stabilize = 14 parts, 4550.664 m/s and 1.398 TWR. Those require you to keep a hand on the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGravity Turn: If you don\u0027t have KER, start by turning to 45 degrees elevation on course 090 when you get to 10,000 m. Watch your ascent in the map view. When you get to the point where you are at least 35 seconds from Apoapsis, turn your ship to face your prograde marker and follow it down. If you go below 30 seconds to apoapsis, return to 45 degrees elevation and stay there until it goes back up past 35 again. Once you\u0027re a minute to apoapsis, turn to burn along the horizon and keep doing so until your apoapsis is about ten kilometers past where you want it (you\u0027ll probably be still in atmosphere at this point, the extra margin will help with losses due to drag). While you\u0027re doing this, watch your gee meter - if it climbs out of the green zone, throttle back until it\u0027s back in there. Preferably you want the gee meter needle to be right at the top the entire way up. Those are good general guidelines if you don\u0027t have mods to handle your ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-20T19:55:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2013 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T21:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the tips.
