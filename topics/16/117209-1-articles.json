(Why they have rockets and haven\u0027t invented the wheel yet is a mystery to me, but that\u0027s a whole different thread.) I\u0027ve made a couple of basic, simple rovers using both the M-1 and whatever they call those little probe wheels. In either case the brakes don\u0027t work! I know how to adjust the torque and all that but can\u0027t get them to work. The landing gears for planes perform great but the rover wheels,,, no, uh uh. Neither the \u0022B\u0022 key or clicking on the parking brake have any affect. Is this a bug? or something I\u0027m doing wrong? No mods, totally vanilla Appreciate any help or suggestions. Moderators please feel free to move this to stock support if needed\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T23:04:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedCowboy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:35:16Z","Content":"Maybe you havent unlocked the action-groups yet, by updating the VAB or SPH?"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:58:13Z","Content":"Nope, both are totally upgraded"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T22:03:03Z","Content":"I believe I read somewhere that the rover wheels are bugged, and in order to brake while moving, you need to reverse until you stop..."},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T22:05:09Z","Content":"The brakes and torque in general on the rover wheels are basically non-existent.

If you can avoid doing thatm the brakes will work fine.\n\nThis means you can never click on the wheels. Not in the editor, not in flight. Once you right click, then save that .craft or the game save, the wheel in question will forever be broken. The only stock fix after that is to remove the wheel and replace it with a new one. No ALT-copy, or simple remove-replace. It must be brand new.\n\nThe ModuleWheelFix in my stock bug fixes will allow you to fix the brake torque for ships in-flight if you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T01:56:41Z","Content":"Reverse power has always worked better than brakes.
