The full deployment altitude is AGL. The change that happened is that the chutes used to require that partial deployment happened before full deployment could happen. So if you set your partial deployment pressure too high (too low an altitude), you could smack\u00A0a tall mountain before partial deployment happened. Now, even if the chutes fail the partial deployment altitude test -- if the full deployment AGL altitude test passes, then the chutes will open right then, despite the partial deployment test failing. So it should always be safe now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Loren Pechtel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0And is there any way to set a drogue to pop as soon as it\u0027s safe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay what?

In old versions of KSP, the chutes would deploy as soon as the partial deploy requirement was met - regardless of whether or not you were going too fast at the time. Nowadays, parachutes can be smart: they will only deploy when doing so won\u0027t tear them off instantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new tweakable option can only be seen when \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 is toggled on in the game settings.
