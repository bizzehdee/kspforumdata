So I figured what a perfect time to test the new Mun lander I had been working on and I sent a ship to the Mun to get Bob, as well as pick up a few of the other Kerbals I had stationed there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell the Kerbals had a little trouble navigating the ladder system so I figured to hell with it, use their jet packs and land them on the ledge. First 3 went just fine, then came Bob. He nudged the hitchhiker pod, moving very slowly yet it was somehow enough to dislodge it from from the rest of the lander below now making him stranded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I stop this from happening? This isn\u0027t the first time a minor bump has disconnected a lander from its fuel tank. And before anyone says struts, this had 16 of the super heavy struts from NovaPunch holding it together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T07:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cant say ive ad this problem.

You could test the design on Kerbin, with and without struts (or an entirely stock game on the side if you have the possibility). Hack gravity and jetpack kerbals into the craft in a similar manner to when your accidents took place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027d just place my ladder(s) carefully and walk up to them, jump (without jetpack) and press F as soon as the text appears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures would help for further diagnosis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T12:16:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022annallia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022annallia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe struts were still intact, at the point of it being disconnected they would have gone as well (as they did when he nudged it).

The struts SHOULD have disconnected if it actually broke off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it just moved a bit when he touched it, well, that happens. The joints flex, parts can shift around, particularly when kerbals start crashing into them.
