(First time on minmus with recovery to kerbin!) Before I shed the LM for return to kerbin, is there any way to transfer the science over to the CM? I don\u0027t want to have to transmit all the lander\u0027s data, thanks to transmission losses. I don\u0027t see any way to do it, but maybe someone has figured something out?
