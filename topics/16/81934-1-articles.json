There are two good spots to issue such corrections, one is right after you leave your starting SOI and enter interplanetary space, the other is halfway during the transfer. If you use transfer with inclination change, perform this tuning as soon as possible after the change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tuning is usually best done using fine maneuvers or even RCS. Focus on your target planet, orient your ship some controlled way (e.g. prograde with north up), use short RCS translation burns (HNIJKL) and watch what is your trajectory doing near the target planet. What you need is periapsis as close to the planet as possible and in its equatorial plane.

Thus, unless it works out that your ship arrives just when Duna\u0027s sitting on the ascending or descending node relative to Kerbin\u0027s orbit, your ship will necessarily be moving somewhat upwards or downwards relative to Duna upon arrival. Furthermore, the axis of every single planet points straight up (IOW, all their equators are parallel) so Duna\u0027s orbit is inclined to its own equator. That means that if you match planes with Duna\u0027s orbit while en route, you will arrive at Duna with the same inclination as the planet\u0027s orbit. So, your pretty much stuck with at least some amount of inclination relativel to Duna\u0027 equator upon arrival and if you don\u0027t want to end up in an inclined orbit, all you can do is fix it once you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it\u0027s a lot easier to fix if your Duna Pe is close to where you want it before you get there. IOW, you have a \u0022good\u0022 encounter set up beforehand. Duna\u0027s SOI is pretty big for its size so there\u0027s plenty of room for \u0022bad\u0022 encounters (retrograde, highly inclined, Pe outside Ike\u0027s orbit, etc.). \u0022Good\u0022 encounters (prograde, Pe at the desired altitude, little inclination) are hard to just get from the get-go back at Kerbin. Usually you have to deliberately make them over the course of the trip by doing 1 or more minor correction burns along the way. Often folks do 1 correction about a week outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, often another about the midpoint of the trip. If done correctly, these will get you a \u0022good\u0022 encounter if you don\u0027t have one to start with, and then you just need a final fine-tuning once in Duna\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make these correction burns, it really helps to be in conic draw mode 0. This will show your Duna Pe right there next to where Duna currently is on the map. So you create a node somewhere along your ship\u0027s path, double click on Duna to focus in on it, then adjust the node to move your Duna Pe to where you want it, then do the burn. Because future paths tend to wobble around somewhat, and crossing SOI boundaries at \u0026gt;1 time warp will make them jump, don\u0027t expect perfection here. Accept something that close enough with the knowledge that it will probably not quite be that way when you actually get there, but shouldn\u0027t be too far off. Then, once you\u0027re inside Duna\u0027s SOI you can do a another tweak of your Pe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the above is concerned mostly with setting your Pe. Your Pe determines whether you\u0027re going prograde or retrograde, your closest approach altitude to Duna, and the general nature of your inclination (equatorial vs. polar). If you want to get into an exactly equatorial orbit, you normally can\u0027t do that until after you\u0027ve captured. So capture into a pretty elliptical orbit, change your inclination at the node furthest from Duna, then bring your Ap down. If you want a polar orbit, it\u0027s the same: capture into a big ellipse that\u0027s close to the inclination you want, then tweak inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: If you plan on using aerocapture, you\u0027ll want your Pe usually somewhere between 11-13km, depending on 1) how fast your ship\u0027s going when it enters Duna\u0027s SOI, and 2) the height of the Ap you want afterwards. The map view doesn\u0027t display the effects of aerobraking on your future trajectory so this is all trial and error, where the difference of a few hundred meters Pe altitude can have a large effect. I recommend setting your aerobraking Pe about even with Ike\u0027s orbit and quicksaving there. Then, if you don\u0027t get what you want afterwards, you can revert back, tweak the Pe up or down a little as desired, and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T13:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always end up with crazy orbits at Duna too, so I\u0027m glad the original poster asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDuna\u0027s SOI is pretty big for its size so there\u0027s plenty of room for \u0022bad\u0022 encounters (retrograde, highly inclined, Pe outside Ike\u0027s orbit, etc.). \u0022Good\u0022 encounters (prograde, Pe at the desired altitude, little inclination) \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy prograde, you mean that you arrive a little behind Duna, so that you\u0027re already heading counter-clockwise around Duna?
