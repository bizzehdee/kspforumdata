Of course you dont want to be there too long so 1 RCS wont be enough tho)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Have again more thrust when landing to mun or something, but mun has less gravity than kerbin so the lander doesnt need that much unless you want it to land on kerbin too or something)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Try to always use as much of all the available engines as possible. Preferably use some fuel lines so that all engines are being used all the time and the fuel comes from the lower/outer stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When you dont need thrust anymore (when you have an orbit), drop a bunch of engines as theyll just waste fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my current rocket i built the mun lander, then 2 liquid fuel stages radially and 1 solid booster stage radially too, then used fuel lines so the fuel always comes from the outer stage all the way to the mun landers engines. Having stages on top of each other is really bad at least with the current aerodynamics and stuff, as youll just be carrying like twice more thrust than youll ever use at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to moon:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Accelerate straight up until apoapsis is at like 40-60k depending on how much thrust you have\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tilt right (i believe its the 90 degree direction?) so youre thrusting horizontal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Keep it there until you have a nice orbit with peri and apoapsis both above 70k\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Keep orbiting until you see mun in the horizon.
