I\u0027ve tried using symmetry to save labor when I add the outer boosters. The problem is that the outer motors are all arranged so that steering results in the rotated booster motors cancelling each other\u0027s steering out during ascent, making steering uncontrollable. How do people get past this issue? Is there a mode switch that will allow me to use symmetry and keep the motors all in alignment too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty new at using the editor and haven\u0027t found a way around this yet.

When I input the steering commands all the engines gimbal\u00A0in a symmetrical pattern just like they\u0027re oriented. And if I use the rotation tool in the editor, the booster that I turn gets rotated around the center of the rocket, not on its own axis. So rotation screws up the entire stage. I\u0027ll try to find out what mod they\u0027re in. I haven\u0027t tried the mainsail but I like these engines a lot. It\u0027s hard to believe how powerful they are.
