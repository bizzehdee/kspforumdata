The landers are made of the lander can and a large fuel tank with the docking ports on the tops of the land cans. Once I dock them I have a horrible time trying to get it to fly with ASAS wobbling the heck outta it, I know this is a huge problem with stations but I need this thing to fly. I can turn it off but its pretty hard to burn to a planet with this off. Anyways I was trying to figure out what is the best way to solve this issue so I can properly fly docked ships\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T23:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstall the mod Quantum Struts, and place them so they will hold the ships together once they dock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E if your ok with mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, the multi-port system will have to do for you!

Often you will get one dock and the other refuses to dock which makes it even more unstable. With QS you can even toggle them on and off with action groups. They make the very weak docking connectors a lot stronger.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycked","CreatedById":55270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T23:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thank you guys so much for the fast replies!
