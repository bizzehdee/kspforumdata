Now you need some winglets/fins to the back of the rocket to increase drag at the back to prevent flipping. You also need to build your rocets to look more like rockets and actually be somewhat aerodynamical. You also need to do yourn turning VERY slowly and gradually while in dense atmosphere.

One way to help guard against this at design time in the VAB is to set the parachute\u0027s minimum deploy pressure from the default 0.04 atmospheres up to something like, say, 0.5 atmospheres. It\u0027s not a perfect solution-- some ships may still be going faster than that when they get to the 0.5atm level, and there are some mountains on Kerbin that poke higher than that-- but it works pretty well for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you can use drogue chutes; there\u0027s actually a reason to use them now (there wasn\u0027t really, pre-1.0). Their minimum opening speed is roughly double that of the \u0022regular\u0022 parachutes, so you can pop them when you\u0027re going nearly 500 m/s and let them slow you down before you hit the other chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tip while flying: If you right-click on a parachute, its menu has an indicator saying whether deployment would be Unsafe, Risky, or Safe.
