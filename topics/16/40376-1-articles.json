The way drag currently works in KSP, including for parachutes, is by multiplying the each part\u0027s drag coefficient (so 0.2 for most parts, much higher for deployed parachutes) by its mass. So if you have more mass of parachutes, when they\u0027re deployed your mass-weighted-average drag coefficient for the entire craft will be higher, meaning your terminal velocity will be lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T01:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe drogue chute (orange) is the MK-25 not the 16XL \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said the two are the same, the only difference is their size which gives the larger one a more aesthetic look when attached to larger modules than the small one would.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T01:44:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot so. 0.2 drag x 1.0 mass = 0.2 dragforce. 0.2 drag x 0.1 mass = 0.02 dragonforce.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T01:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022annallia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022annallia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe drogue chute (orange) is the MK-25 not the 16XL \u003Cp\u003EThat said the two are the same, the only difference is their size which gives the larger one a more aesthetic look when attached to larger modules than the small one would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops...
