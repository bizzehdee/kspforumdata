Yesterday I installed MechJab, and noticed that one of my crafts have deltaV of 9400 (in atmosphere), so I decided to fly to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving read a bit, I knew that I needed a certain angle before I started burning. Having reached that angle, I checked with Mechjab if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s ok (but I always use my maneuvers, and just used MechJab for checking). I then burned and transferred to Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s SOI with ~2200 deltaV remaining. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that it will be a good place to use a couple of techniques that I read on the net. I decided to use both aerobraking and gravity assist to slow my ship down. (I saved here, because I had a feeling that might fail a few times \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ). Now this might be wrong, so please correct me, but this is what I\u0027ve done: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a maneuver so that I hit Duna from the \u0022right hand\u0022 side - the side that Duna is going forwards to, because I think that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s how gravity assists works for slowing down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made periapsis to be ~15k, to slow me down a lot, but not land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked fine and I ended up with orbit around Duna. (However, I tried this several times, as periapsis of 11k landed me in Duna, and periapsis of 20k just overshot me, so trial and error. Is there a way to know this?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving gotten to an orbit around Duna, I proceeded to go to Ide and land there. By doing this, I tried as much as possible to save enough fuel for going back, but the most I had was ~600 deltaV when I came back to Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s orbit. And that wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enough for my maneuvers to get back to Kerbin (I even checked with MechJab, but it needed more deltaV too\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6). So I decided to land on Duna, gather more science. And wait. (Forgot an antenna, so couldn\u0027t transmit, doh...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I\u0027m thinking of sending a drone with an antenna, to transfer science back.

There is no obvious bad practice, but it seems like you could be more efficient with your interplanetary transfer based on your numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. MechJeb has an aerobraking calculator, but I don\u0027t remember what it\u0027s called. It only works with stock aerodynamics, so if you\u0027re playing with FAR there\u0027s no way to tell what Pe you should use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Gravity assists only work to slow you down relative to the parent body of the planet (the Sun if you\u0027re assisting around Duna, Duna if you\u0027re assisting around Ike.) To slow down you must fly in front of the planet/moon relative to its orbit around its parent body. To speed up, you fly behind it. Practice this with the Mun. See if you can fly a free-return trajectory and a gravity assist to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The best way to land on an airless body is to come in with a Pe as close to the ground as you dare go. Then, burn retrograde to slow down. You will gradually pitch up to stay retrograde. In the ideal landing, you finish killing your velocity just above the ground. With experience you will learn how low you can go. To takeoff, do the reverse. Basically, you want to burn as close to the surface as you can and always prograde/retrograde. Landing on a body with an atmosphere, use parachutes to slow down as much as you can. On Duna it should take \u0026lt;100 m/s to land. Mount parachutes on decouplers to ditch them after landing so you don\u0027t have to haul them back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

The most efficient way to return to orbit around Ike is to lift off and burn sideways to get the horizontal velocity you need. Since Ike has some very high altitudes, you need to be careful. If you burn to escape velocity in orbit around Ike, depending on the ejection angle you will either add that velocity to the moon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s velocity, or subtract it from the moon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s velocity around Duna.

The lander guidance has a checkbox that will predict your orbit after aerocapture (I can\u0027t remember exactly what it was called, but you\u0027ll recognize it when you see it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis option does a few things: For starters, it will tell you your ACTUAL landing spot if you are landing somewhere with an atmosphere (it takes into account drag, and paints a big target on the map to see where you\u0027ll come down)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe option you need here, is what it will tell you when you are in the atmosphere, but not deep enough to land. It will give you an orbit prediction after aerocapture. So simply dip your rocket in atmosphere, option the landing guidance, and fiddle around with how deep in atmosphere. The guidance will tell you in real time what your predicted orbit is, if you were to aerobreak at your current periaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want this, you can always google it. I believe the wiki has information on each body with atmosphere, and how deep you need to be for a capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Gravity assist does not actually slow you down the way you seem to understand it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will only notice gravity assists\u0027 effect once you leave the SOI of the body again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you enter a body\u0027s SOI, you will be pulled along by it\u0027s gravity (or pulled back if you are going in oposite direction as it is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I can\u0027t actually explain it properly, but the base line is that gravity assists don\u0027t matter when you stay in the planet\u0027s SOI, only when you leave it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The most efficient way is a suicide burn. Just drop down and burn at the very last moment, so that you lost all your velocity when you reach the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, that means saving, trying, loading, starting abit higher, loading, trying abit higher, ect until you find the sweet spot (or loading and starting lower). If you use Mechjeb\u0027s autolander, it will actually use a suicide burn, but Mechjeb can calculate it exactly. You could to, but that\u0027s boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ignoring that, the easiest way is to rhoughly zero out your horizontal velocity, so that you drop straight down, and slowly bleed off speed. Mechjeb can again help you, by giving you the ACTUAL altitude (so how far down until you hit solid ground, instead of how far down until you hit sea level. You\u0027ve probably noticed already that you often land somewhere with your big altimeter saying there is still 1km to go). Knowing that, you can see how far you have to fall, and how much speed you have to lose per 10 meters to land safely. When you have that number, it\u0027s easy to open the throttle a little bit and glide down. Or free fall a little and break later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way is the easiest because you won\u0027t have to worry about horizontal velocity when you are landing. If you have to much you\u0027ll tip over when you touch the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 again) Get into a very low orbit around the moon (as low as you dare) is probably best. This way you have full control over your orbital transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmAMGJm-bwU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.

Ike costs an extra 1830m/s if you want to land there and back. Offcourse this is the bare minimum, and you should take 10% extra atleast, probably more\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I did not include takeoff from Kerbin. That\u0027s because I always design my interplanetery ships to assamble and refuel in orbit.

You could for example plot your own manouver node, and than let Mechjeb excecute this node. Usefull for when you need exact, very small burns. (for example only 1m/s deltaV, which is the kind of burn you need when you make corrections far away from an encounter. To get that accurate, you\u0027d need to burn half a second at minimal thrust. That\u0027s almost impossible to get right by hand, but Mechjeb can do it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use Mechjeb to make precise changes to manouver nodes (with the manouver node editor), by entering numbers, instead of dragging the points on the node itself.
