You place the KAL anywhere on your vehicle, then you select it and open the editor. Now from the editor you go in the actions menu, and you select the blades. you select the angle of attack, and you put the two extreme values you want (you will have to experiment with those, they depend on how you made the propellers). Now you can open the KAL and mode the bar on it, and it will move all the propellers. Use f12 to activate aerodinamics show during flight, it will show you a bunch of blue, red and purple lines; you are looking at the purple ones, you want them to point forward. move the KAL to make them do so. if they always point backwards, you got the angle inverted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Also, one propeller will cause your plane to spin. You need two propellers rotating in opposite directions, so their momentum will cancel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- to accelerate the propellers with the normal accelerator, you have to go in the action menu, under \u0022main accelerator\u0022, and select the propellers and their torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t feel like i\u0027m doing a good job of explaining.

If you experiment around a little, you will find that \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhen you are static (not moving with brakes set) increasing deploy angle up to around 9\u00B0 keeps increasing thrust but then beyond that, the thrust begins to drop\u003C/strong\u003E - this is because, like a wing, you can increase lift by increasing it\u0027s angle UP TO the point where it begins to stall and results in less lifting force. \u003Cstrong\u003E~9\u00B0 seems to be the magic number for KSP propellers\u003C/strong\u003E.
