But almost every time I descend over this mountain range, the chutes won\u0027t open properly, resulting in a smash into the surface at about 80 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did manage to land it properly on top the mountain once, but the craft sinks deeply (until about half its own height) into a clipping surface and even almost toppled over. EVA-ing my Kerbal lead to an almost instant explosion as he apparently fell off a hidden cliff or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if these two problems may be connected. Is it possible the chutes (that should open at 2,500 and 500 m above surface) misread the altitude, for the same reason that causes the craft to \u0027sink\u0027 and the Kerbals to fall down?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had chutes not opening before, and if I land a few kms away from the mountain, they open normally. Trying to land on top of the mountain resulted in 3 consecutive crashes because of this, so my guess it\u0027s not a fluke, but something related to the environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter about 30 successful landings on Eve I\u0027ve gotten to know that particular craft inside out and I\u0027m sure there is no construction or deployment failure. The chutes are semi-deployed by staging at around 20,000 m with speeds between 100 and 200 m/s, they\u0027re properly animated in semi-deployed state, all chute icons are yellow as if awaiting their automated deployment, but as we near the surface they simply remain semi-deployed until the crash into the surface of the mountain. But this happens only on or very near to Mt. Useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced this? As there have been similar surface problems with the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and other bodies, is this something that may be a more general issue with the surfaces of bodies since .21?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-06T01:25:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2013 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by snepel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eproblem solved by helpful comments\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T14:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never landed on said mountain, nor attempted a return mission to Eve, but landing a rover on Eve wasn\u0027t a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShow me an orbital map view of Mt.
