I\u0027m at 100 Km but falling FAST, it\u0027s like a lost all my orbital velocity or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea how to solve it? (I guess none) or how to prevent this from happening again?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, ok. I panicked. I\u0027ll just hyperedit the thing back to a 100x100 orbitz... Still.

So screw it, I hacked gravity to board poor Jeb back in the ship. That apparently caused mayhem with the ship in orbit. For what I can understand, when you hack gravity, the speed of your ship (and apparently all vessels in orbit) is adjusted to it wont get to escape velocity (because gravity now is really weak). When you unhack, vessels will continue to have the post-hack speed and boom!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T01:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething similar happened to me recently while orbiting Dres, though I\u0027ve never used the gravity hack.
