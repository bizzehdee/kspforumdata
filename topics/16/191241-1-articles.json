So if you have RAPIERs and NERVs in the same stage, then KSP assumes that you\u0027ll want to use both of them at the same time and calculates \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and burn time accordingly. If you don\u0027t want to use the RAPIERs in orbit (which is fairly common) and still want the calculations to be correct, then you need to help KSP understand that you are not going to use them. I myself do that by having the RAPIERs and the NERVs in different stages. Except for activating the RAPIERs the for first time I don\u0027t use the staging system to activate engines on my spaceplanes, I use action groups instead. I also move the stage with the currently active engines to the bottom of the staging list, to help KSP get the calculations right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd welcome to the

thrust compared to the Rapiers.\u00A0 If the choice were between a Nerv and a Terrier (which has the same thrust), then the burn time would be nearly the

are not; I don\u0027t know whether they\u0027ve fixed this in the most recent version of KSP, but it used to be that the calculator could not give you a time until you burned the engines at least once each time you took control of the vessel.\u00A0 This wasn\u0027t an issue for simple missions that you flew in one sitting, but long missions that play out over several sessions suffered from this
