KSP has something called a \u0022physics bubble\u0022 that is a sphere a little over 20km radius, centered on your current craft. Anything inside the physics bubble is modeled. Anything outside is treated as being on a suborbital ballistic trajectory, and when it gets below 25 km altitude, it gets auto-deleted.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you are controlling a craft in the atmosphere, generally you can\u0027t switch control away from that craft. You have to either fly it until it reaches space, or until it lands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally what that means for reusable launch vehicles is that you get your craft and payload on suborbital trajectories and then separate them. Then your payload needs to do a circularization burn, and you need to land your launch vehicle. Sadly, you almost always need to do both of those things at the same time, and you can\u0027t. Once your launch vehicle reenters the atmosphere, and you switch control to it so that you can land it, you are stuck flying it until you land. If you wait too long to control it, it will either burn up in the atmosphere or it will fall below 25km and get auto-deleted. Atmospheric drag will not be modeled unless you are controlling the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to use mods, then something like FMRS will help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your launch vehicle is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you can separate your payload at your leisure, and reenter and land the launch vehicle whenever you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RP1IsSuperior","CreatedById":202667,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-11T23:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit\u0027s a little weird because of the way KSP works. You basically are limited to 2 stage designs. You want to fly a steeper ascent profile than you normally would. You also should have a high thrust upper stage so you can get into orbit fast enough to switch to the\u00A0 bottom stage and then activate parachutes. If you wanna do a boostback burn, ignite your second stage engine and let it go, do your boostback burn, switch back to your upper stage and go into a parking orbit(just get into a stable orbit, you can fix it later) then switch back to your first stage.

And most importantly they lack the majesty and projection of sheer power that accompanies a full-on Rocket Launch (tm) !!! So what I guess I\u0027m trying to say is that there are a number of ways to skin this cat (no cats are/were harmed in the making of my Kerbal Space program).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example of a compromise, my favorite is a core reusable booster that can be supplemented with various \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s (unfortunately -but necessarily- disposable) to accomplish placing various payloads into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E - for instance, I can place 18 tons into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E for a total cost of less than 7,000 kerbucks, and using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, place 42 tons into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E for less than 21,000 kerbucks. De-orbiting the booster can be done \u0027at my leisure\u0027 which enables me to not only deal with the primary payload\u0027s trajectory in a timely manner, but also allows me to maximize recovery costs by de-orbiting such that touchdown is close to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

My personal favourite of those is Stage Recovery as it\u0027s simple (slap some parachutes on, or a control point and extra fuel for a powered landing when the rocket is too big for chutes) but also very configurable (you can change the min/max speed for recovery, % of the value returned depending on distance, speed, risk of stages \u0027burning up\u0027 before recovery and more) and requires no in-flight input- just drop the stages with enough parachutes or some reserve fuel and a probe core and the mod will detect when something drops below the \u0027death zone\u0027 of ~25km and recover it for you. It even works with crewed vessels and science experiments/data stored on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s feasible, but very difficult to do a \u0027proper\u0027 recovery with a rocket and requires either an inefficient launch profile, which wastes quite a bit of fuel, or a landing some distance away from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, which gets less funds from recovery. There is another way, however- build a single stage to orbit (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E) rocket that can reach orbit on its own, deploy a payload and then re-enter to land at/near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; the \u0027Twin Boar\u0027 engine is particularly good for this as it has an unusually high impact tolerance of 20m/s, meaning you can drop it pretty hard and it won\u0027t explode (which saves mass and drag from landing legs) plus it\u0027s a powerful engine with built-in fuel and a pretty reasonable cost making it an economical choice too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you see \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, it\u0027s usually referring to a plane rather than a rocket and spaceplanes are definitely an option worth pursuing to carry payloads into orbit for minimum costs- unlike a rocket which has to fight directly against gravity with thrust, a plane can use aerodynamic lift during the ascent meaning it can carry more mass and needs less thrust; there\u0027s also the bonus of using a combination of air-breathing engines (which are much more efficient than any rocket) and the NERV nuclear rocket engine (most efficient stock rocket engine) which both run on liquid fuel without the need for oxidiser, saving mass which is always a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re looking for a good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E for a career game, I recommend this one- requires only level 2 facilities, cheap to operate,\u00A0can carry 20 tons or more into low Kerbin orbit (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E) and flies well both with and without a payload attached making it a great workhorse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Kronus_Aerospace/Kronus-LowTech-20-Ton-SSTO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/Kronus_Aerospace/Kronus-LowTech-20-Ton-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also this pretty simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket which apparently has a similar payload capacity and can be easily recovered using the sturdiness of the Twin Boar to save on parachute mass, although I haven\u0027t been able to make it work myself (probably due to too many mods in all my games\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002257142\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7836316567\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30639-sstos-post-your-pictures-here~/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3857464\u0026amp;embedComment=3857464\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:298px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-12T21:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe most comfortable way to reuse rockets is to send a big enough rocket to enter orbit with a single stage. then you detach the payload, deorbit the rocket, and recover it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI developed this launcher that\u0027s the best I can do for money effectiveness. with a payload fairing and a good trajectory, it can bring 25 tons in orbit, at a net cost (considering to recycle the rocket) of around 11k kerbodollars, slightly less than 500 per ton of payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002257142\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1099127501\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/30639-sstos-post-your-pictures-here~/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3857464\u0026amp;embedComment=3857464\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:299px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigStar Aerospace","CreatedById":204131,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-10T00:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this thread is a bit old, but recently I\u0027ve been delving into reusable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E core stages for my new career mode which is the hardest one yet.

After those are fired at apoapsis and the airbrakes are deployed before I reenter the atmosphere, I point prograde with the heatshield on top of the booster ensuring that minimal damage occurs during reentry.\u00A0 Then once I get down to 12 Km and I\u0027m going slow enough, I deploy the drogue chutes at 5 Km, then I slowly descend to 2.5 Km to deploy the main chutes, the amount of these needed depends on the boosters weight, I use six for the Clydesdale and 4 for the Thoroughbred. You also want enough reaction wheels in the booster so that when you splash down you can hold radial in to ensure that the booster doesn\u0027t tip over and ruin some of the technology, this can also be done by adding weight to the top of the booster so it always wants to face down, this wastes fuel, but is more realistic. Then once it\u0027s below 0.3 m/s I recover it. Similar techniques can be used with liquid fuel boosters, all though the extra parts can cause some noticeable differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
