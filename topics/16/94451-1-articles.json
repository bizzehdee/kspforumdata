For the octo struts it\u0027s intended behaviour, if a bit strange; parts in KSP can be both node-attachable (anything with those little balls) or surface-attachable (like radial decouplers and so on). Some parts are node-attachable, but not surface-attachable. The not-rockomax micronode is however a bug and it\u0027s known - the 6-way 1.25m hub has the same problem. You can only attach that in certain orientations due to how the vessel trees work in KSP/Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027ll break the process of attaching octostruts in symmetry down into basic steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: place an octagonal strut in the scene, somewhere, so it\u0027s attached properly. i.e. so you can attach other things to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: place ONE cubic strut surface-attached to it (like you attach a radial decoupler)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: attach any part you like to the node pointing away from the cubic strut you just attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: make that part the root using the re-root tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: remove the cubic strut (ONLY that!) from the ship, but don\u0027t delete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. build the rest of your design, keeping the strut \u002B octo piece around (this could technically be done first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. now, grab the cubic strut, and attach it in symmetry mode to whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.
