Except the rovers don\u0027t work very well because of the terrain bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the general principle works better with Kethane (or its eventual stock replacement), because you can get fuel from low gravity worlds instead. Especially if you\u0027re hauling the raw kethane to a refinery station. Which in the past has traditionally been somewhat less efficient than refining it on the surface and hauling the fuel, though the recent changes have...modified that dynamic more than a little. The kethane-\u0026gt; fuel conversion factor is the difference in weight between the two, modified by the efficiency. If the efficiency is lower than 100%, the fuel weighs less than the kethane. If it\u0027s more than 100%, the kethane weighs less than the fuel. The maximum conversion efficiency used to be 99%. It\u0027s now 103% for Liquidfuel, so it\u0027s a bit more complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the key point is the tyranny of the rocket equation. To move more mass you need more fuel, which adds more mass, so you need more fuel, which adds more mass... Apparently the only reason it\u0027s not an infinite loop is that you burn the fuel as you go, continuously losing weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to maximize efficiency you need to move the lighter craft to the heavier one. This is probably going to be the craft that needs to be refueled. And if you\u0027re doing that, your tanker is effectively a temporary refueling station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means, for example, that the most efficient way to launch a tank into orbit is to use the fuel in the tank to launch it, then refill it in orbit (Ideally with fuel from a nearby body with low gravity, as that drastically reduces the cost in fuel to move the fuel you\u0027re filling the tank with).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T12:22:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 12:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HeadHunter67","CreatedById":74121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T12:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built one, but I\u0027m so bad at unassisted rendezvous that I have yet to actually use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T12:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe usefulness of refueling stations depends on what you need the fuel for. There\u0027s not much need of refueling for ships staying within the Kerbin system. Either they\u0027re small enough to get where they\u0027re going unassisted, or they\u0027re a docked collection of such things. And in any case, if you do need to refuel something in the Kerbin system, it\u0027s pretty simple just to send a small tanker up from Kerbin to bring fuel to the stranded ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere fueling stations come in handy is at other planets. There, you can\u0027t just send the odd tanker on the spur of the moment due to having to wait for launch windows, but the expedition always seems to need more fuel than you planned on to start with, due to unforeseen issue, the desire to visit more of the planet than originally intended, and the need to come home eventually. So, it\u0027s always a good idea to include some source of extra fuel in the expeditionary flotilla. There are several ways to do this, ranging from a number of self-propelled fuel tanks that can go where needed within the system, to an immobile orbital fuel depot, to several varieties of Kethane-based things. I personally prefer a combination of all 3, meaning Kethane operation maintaining a small depot, which in turn supplies several self-propelled fuel tanks. That way, I\u0027m not dependent on sending fuel out from Kerbin beyond what the expedition uses to reach the target and get set up. In any case, all you have to bring home are the Kerbals so all of the above is now in place for use by later expeditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, if you want to do the Kethane thing, the best place to obtain the stuff is on the smallest moon of the system, so you burn less fuel lifting it to where you need it. And I think the best place for a depot is orbiting the main planet because its primary purpose is to make sure you have enough fuel to get home, and that\u0027s where you\u0027ll be leaving from. Whether you refine the Kethane into fuel on the moon or at the depot is up to you, and it really depends on what you\u0027re making.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keome","CreatedById":72332,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T14:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find them useful when I need to top off the tanks.

Then I built several small \u0027orbital transfer vehicles\u0027 that I used to ferry station modules from Kerbin orbit to Mun orbit. Then I did the same to create the base on the Mun.

The maximum practical payloads range from about 100T to 1000T, depending on your computer \u0026amp; settings, and anything larger will require in-space assembly of the few remaining parts that aren\u0027t jettisoned to escape the Kerbal gravity well. Things assembled in space which don\u0027t have to deal with 1G static load and 3G dynamic acceleration, because they\u0027re using underpowered engines on huge tanks, also don\u0027t have to worry so much about bracing parts. Complex missions can be assembled and launched with *large payloads* that have sufficient delta V to go on interplanetary return missions - missions that would not be possible in a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find the Kethane mod cool, but somewhat regrettable in implementing simple in situ resource utilization, because it doesn\u0027t require you to have these grand large in-orbit construction efforts to complete a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T23:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Burninate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T23:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use a refueling station as a staging area for tugs that carry my tanker modules out across the system.

It only works reasonably well in a combination entailing low speed and high throttle, meaning a very heavy airplane. Forget using it for an SSTO. And because it can\u0027t SSTO, and because it lacks a rear attachment node, you always need at least 2 engines. So if you have a light airplane, you have to REALLY throttle back because each engine is so powerful, but that means it tends to cut out even more frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
