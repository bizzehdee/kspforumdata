Knowing where it will spin comes handy to rotate the asteroid in the correct direction (and so achieve a desired direction much sooner than using RCS or other means).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, e.g., your CoT is to the left of the asteroid CoM, the asteroid will rotate to the right when pushed. If you use angled pushes correctly, you can rotate your CoT around the CoM and apply spin so to keep the asteroid in a desired direction. It\u0027s a bit like pushing a trailer when going backwards with a lorry, it\u0027s not easy at first but after a bit of practice it can be done without effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T22:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on the design of the ship that is pushing/pulling the roid.

Build multiple engines and attach them to various points on the asteroid so that you have thrust pointed in one general direction.
