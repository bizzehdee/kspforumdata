First I know that TWR isn\u0027t as important in space as it is on the ground but this is a 480 ton ship and I am trying to decide on skipper vs nerva. With 5 Nervas the ship only has a TWR of 0.05 which I am worried that burns may take to long do accurately while the skippers would have a TWR of 0.29.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly I have the question of how to assemble it. I can dock so the linear parts are no problem but the dock on the side while being coplanar with the engine as in the pictures below. I was wondering how in the world would you dock it since all your nav ball markers would be showing as if your were docking with the front of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is where the engines and the main body connect\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yPjIxEp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yPjIxEp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand here is the whole ship. note: its not going in one piece this is just to show how it will look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uwFQDYj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uwFQDYj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho0124","CreatedById":61118,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T19:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENervas are your only real choice for interplanetary travel. No other engine offers reasonably efficient use of your fuel. I routinely do massive station deployments using a single NERVA pushing more than 4 jumbo-64 tanks (TWR of 0.04) and have never had a problem with burn time. Do incremental burns, start burning early, be patient. Use alt\u002B\u0026gt; to do physical time acceleration and you\u0027ll be set. Patience with low thrust-to-weight ratios pays massive dividends in delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the docking maneuver; just eye-ball it. Set your camera to \u0027chase\u0027 with the v key. Keep your view moving; checking different planes and relative velocities.

When I dock, all I do is stare at the nav ball, since that gives me my velocity relative to the target, the way I\u0027m facing, the position of the target relative to the docking port and the direction I\u0027m heading relative to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T01:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you can select a docking port on your ship and \u0027Control From Here\u0027 to set your navball relative to that port. And I agree, NERVAs are really the only good option for interplanetary travel, even if it means having a lot of them (I used 12 to move a 300t ship to Duna, though it did require a small bit of patience on the burns). It\u0027s easy to attach FL800 fuel tanks to the sides of your ship and put NERVAs on the bottom, if having trouble finding places for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redjoker","CreatedById":68444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T16:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your help, Im thinking im going to need more than 5 nervas for a 500 ton ship since with one nerva and an 80 ton ship took 15 min to do a 800m/s maneuver\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T17:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy interplanetary burns commonly take 20 minutes to an hour.

Just take an LV-N, attach it to the bottom of the tanks, then attach four BZ-52 Radial Attachment Points to the bottom of the tank right next to them, and slap LV-Ns on those too. Poof: you suddenly have as much thrust as a single Mainsail and about 3 m/s^2 of available acceleration given your mass.
