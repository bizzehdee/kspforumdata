\u00A0If left unchecked, the Kerbal will slide off the top end of the ladder and then either drift off in space or fall to the ground, depending on where you are. \u00A01.0.5 attempted to fix this but didn\u0027t quite. \u00A0Still, it helped a lot. \u00A0Now this problem only happens occasionally (instead of nearly all the time), the Kerbal doesn\u0027t slide nearly as fast as he used to, and you can stop him sliding with a single tap of the S key whereas before you might not be able to stop it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, you always have to keep an eye out for your Kerbal sliding on a ladder. \u00A0It\u0027s usually best practice to not leave them on ladders for long periods. \u00A0Pop out just before you fly over the new biome, grab the report, and immediately board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, as to flinging the Kerbal off into space, that\u0027s almost certainly\u00A0the result of the spawning Kerbal\u00A0clipping part of the rocket. \u00A0What happens is that if the volume of space that the Kerbal will occupy when he spawns is partially occupied already by part of the ship, the Kerbal will get flung away quite rapidly. \u00A0Normally, you know you have this problem the 1st time you EVA and if you don\u0027t get catapulted then, you generally don\u0027t have to worry about it in the future. \u00A0But sometimes there\u0027s a very small amount of clipping that usually doesn\u0027t create enough force to break the Kerbal\u0027s grip, but which sometimes will when you least expect it. \u00A0The warning sign is a slight wiggling of the newly spawned Kerbal on the hatch. \u00A0If that\u0027s been going on, it\u0027s only a matter of time before he gets flung. \u00A0And perhaps rotating the view at the critical moment when the Kerbal is spawning and getting situated on the hatch ladder caused more clipping to happen (due to draw order) than is usually the case. \u00A0Anyway, a flung Kerbal is usually a clipped Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T19:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways hit F5 before exiting the
