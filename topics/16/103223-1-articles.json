Then strip the symmetry and set each to a different action group. Easier might be to use an airbrake part from a mod pack like B9."},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T12:54:41Z","Content":"Take a look at this\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112327-WIP-FAR-Modified](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112327-WIP-FAR-Modified)\n\nQuote: \u0022Brake Rudder % option for control surfaces, useful for fly-wing aircrafts (best used with Yaw PD Controller and Roll-Yaw-Converter).\u0022\n\nYou cannot do it in regular FAR AFAIK."},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T20:14:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Take a look at this\n\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112327-WIP-FAR-Modified](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112327-WIP-FAR-Modified)\n\u003E \n\u003E Quote: \u0022Brake Rudder % option for control surfaces, useful for fly-wing aircrafts (best used with Yaw PD Controller and Roll-Yaw-Converter).\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E You cannot do it in regular FAR AFAIK.\n\nThat really seems like the thing i\u0027ve been looking for.\n\nI\u0027m going to test it out during the weekends and see if it works.\n\n@Jovus\n\nGreat idea to get the job done. Honestly, I think tapping 2 seperate actions keys for rudder control seems quite a hassle. Especially if you need either fine tuned and/or hard control inputs in the upper atmosphere, i.e. to get into space. Nevertheless I will try this method and see how well it should perform."}]}
