This saves massive amounts of fuel for plane correction etc. My question is, what is the best altitude to do a Circularization burn? Obviously I know to do it at Pe but is a Pe of 100k or 1000km more efficient, and why?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T04:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 04:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funkcanna**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:22:40Z","Content":"It depend on what you want to do once you get there.

While keeping the mother ship in high orbit means your landers need more dV those landers typically need less fuel to realize that dV. For a low number of landings it may be more efficient to park the mother ship in high orbit. It also allows more efficient inclination changes of the lander.\n\nThe orbit is all about where you want your energy. Higher orbits require less change in the ships kinetic energy, but landed is the lowest kinetic energy state you work with. Oberth effect just describes the most efficient way to convert mechanical energy to kinetic.\n\nI tend to prefer mid orbits (a buffer in the 100x accel zone) to shorten lander round trips, but an elliptical initial orbit allows for more fuel efficient visitation of the pole areas while maximizing Oberth effect utilization on insertion. Once the poles are explored, I can hohmann to a lower orbit for near equitorial exploration and eventual interplanetary transfer burn."}]}
