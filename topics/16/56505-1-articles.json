Now i\u0027m planning to enter another probe there to collect DAT SCIENCE... But i\u0027m usin Deadly Reentry. I seriously am SCREWED, because it probably is impossible to land on Eve with DR... I need some suggestions, because i can\u0027t think about an effective and compact enough design to fit in my fairings...
