Because roids have very irregular surfaces, when usually happens is that as the ship comes in perpendicular to the roid\u0027s center of mass, the surface there is very sloped so only 1 corner of the claw will touch the roid and it won\u0027t grab if you stop the ship at this point. You usually have to rotate the ship to bring the whole face of the claw into contact with the sloping roid surface. This of course throws the ship out of line with the CoM, but that\u0027s why you have the pivot. Once grabbed, unlock the pivot, rotate the ship back to line up with the CoM, then lock the pivot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
