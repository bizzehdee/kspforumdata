The only time that would become a concern is if your orbit resembles the orbit of Halley\\\u0027s Comet. If you achieved a basic circular orbit, then you can start your transfer burn right on the Apoapsis. That might even be ideal considering that is where your craft begins to pick up speed on the way to Periapsis, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve mucked up my share of orbits to figure this out. As long as you achieve a decent circular shape with your orbit, it doesn\\\u0027t really matter where you are on it to begin a TMI burn. The numbers take care of themselves from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your first question, just lean your craft easterly as you are launching to achieve an orbit in that direction. That is the same direction the Mun travels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-25T14:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup.

Well, tilt to 90 degrees until in you are in a circular orbit, and when the moon rises, burn until your apoapsis (Ap) is at 11,000,000, give or take a couple ten thousand meters.

Watch for the moon to appear on the horizon and then initiate burn. This works for altitudes up to about 350km, maybe even 500. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get the best munar intercepts by initiating burn at moonrise as observed from a \u002B/- 100km kerbin orbit. I put my AP at 12,1 million meters. This usually puts me on a close flyby (or just impact!) trajectory of the Mun, which is easily modified for whatever purpose you\\\u0027re going there in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T00:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DonLorenzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DonLorenzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclose flyby (or just impact!) trajectory of the Mun, which is easily modified for whatever purpose you\\\u0027re going there in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour purposes are flyby or impact? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing, I\\\u0027ve noticed you can get different types of transfer orbit by delaying a little bit. If you let it rise about 20 degrees and then burn, that trajectory puts you ahead of Mun for something close to free return (Apollo 13) orbit. If you burn while it is right on the horizon, it puts you behind or splattered into Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
