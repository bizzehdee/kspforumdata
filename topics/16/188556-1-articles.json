The middle flaps stay centered. And the bottom flaps go down only. I know who to do the middle. Set it to 0 authority or turn off roll/yaw/pitch. But how can you make it so only the top respond to up and the bottom only respond to down?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is to try to get faster response times for the planes. If you go up only the top layer should move up. Then the bottom layer is rested and neutral authority so it can respond down without having to revert from the up position. I\u0027ve tried inverted and whatnot but can\u0027t figure out a method. Inverted just acted like an air break.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VWRks1Q.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VWRks1Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like the ability to not use some of those wings except if I wish to make an air break out of them. But I am not aware of a method to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fD3ky7R.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fD3ky7R.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy don\u0027t we have advanced aircraft controls. We need support for aircraft. I should be able to all of these functions independently and not be stuck to one simple action for all surfaces. I could do so much more with my planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndependent flaps would also be good. Why do all functions that have pitch have to act at the same time as flaps. Why not real world like controls. I have the same flaps as an aircraft. I need the controls to go with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I literally need it. I can\u0027t do any more with designs to control the craft. I need proper controls to fly this in the most optimal manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we are at it how about more indicators for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and whatnot based on empty full cargo and fuel?! This stuff should have been in game to start. And it\u0027s only something in the vehicle areas atm. It\u0027s not like it\u0027s a major lag issue until you get into the thousands of parts. And still not really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I think part of the problem is that negative authority does not force it to only work in the negative. It literally acts like the positive or a seperate version of inverted. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe need independent negative and positive numbers. Then we could set positive to 0 and negative to -150 for instance.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would need more than that for other functions. But it would help. I would love to stick it in modes as air breaks and set it to other functions mid flight. You could get a lot out of control surfaces that way and actually make worthwhile aircraft. Aircraft are really unsupported in this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact when setting top to 100 and bottom to -100 it acts like inverted. And inverted doesn\u0027t work...
