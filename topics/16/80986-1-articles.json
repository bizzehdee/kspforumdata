Okay, not fooling around, doing a KSP series with the MKS mod, modular colonization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt states, that you can make money by returning harvested, and refined resources. Now I understand how this works. Send up an empty cargo ship, fill it, land at Kerbin, retrieve and than you get money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is, you need to be able to launch a ship with a largo cargo capacity, to Minmus, return it, and make a profit. It seems simple except for the launch vehicle because even though the cargo compartment is empty its still gonna weight a fair amount. I have considered changing the density of the resources but that feels too much like cheating. A SSTO could do it the best (100%) vehicle recovery just minus the fuel. However... It would have a much smaller payload cap and would need to be stable when empty and fully loaded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T22:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry this, it\u0027s 100% reusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027arial black\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EZ12 Medium Lifter\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EDesigner: Zekes\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EStatus:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003ECOMPLETED\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThis launcher is 100% reusable, and comes in two stages.
