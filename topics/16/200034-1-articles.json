I only have about 1500 m/s. i am trying to find gravity assists to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni explored in depth ways to use tylo. unfortunately, while tylo is great for lowering periapsis down to 40M km, lowering it further all the way to duna does not work. it becomes more expensive. i spent a couple hours simulating trajectories there, no success. the very first thing i explored was a duna flyby with gravity assist, but it only lowered apoapsis from 70 to 55M km, not enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfurthermore, i am using kerbalism so i have to provide life support. my ship has supplies for between 10 and 20 years, depending on malfunctions; i can make a convoluted trajectory with multiple orbits, but only to some extent. i can\u0027t gradually lower periapsis over 20 orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnext i tried a kerbin gravity assist, and this looks more promising. getting in a kerbin intercept costs me some 1350 m/s, but the first pass lowers my apoapsis to 35M km. from there direct insertion to duna would still be too expensive, over 1000 m/s. but I can, without additional manuevers, set my first kerbin flyby so that it will send me en route for a second kerbin flyby on the next orbit, and that will lower my apoapsis to 20M km, at the level of duna. periapsis instead will be 9M km. And i still have 150-200 m/s for course corrections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nat this point, i would like to know what\u0027s my intercept speed for Duna. is it low enough that i can aerobrake it? (I can aerobrake up to 200 m/s on a duna flyby). unfortunately, after 2 gravity assists the game cannot calculate the trajectories precisely anymore, so the exact line keeps shifting every time i try to set a new manuever. i can\u0027t even start forcing a duna intercept from here. I know i can get one with limited cost within a few years, \u003Cu\u003Ebut i have no way of knowing how expensive would be the injection. and this is what i hope somebody can help me solve\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best estimate is that my final orbit is similar to an Eve-Duna transfer, so i can expect a similar injection deltaV. and that would be 600 m/s (for elliptic orbit, not counting circularization). too much, even using my remaining fuel for braking. but then, eve has a lot of plane difference with duna, so maybe it will be cheaper?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni certainly would rather not fly my ship all the way to the second kerbin flyby to discover it. kerbalism has some issues with time warp, and some events that require my attention, so that i can\u0027t just time warp my way there; it would take weeks of real time. i\u0027d hate to do all that before finding out if my trajectory is even feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, anyone knows some way to calculate an intercept speed on duna? in theory orbital mechanics should allow that, but i am not so good at using those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-03T01:04:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u00A0just just drop\u00A0link for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73174-win-flyby-finder-v086-ksp13/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Esome\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/33568-winmaclinux-ksp-trajectory-optimization-tool-v167-lvd-kos-integration/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Etools\u003C/a\u003E that are useful for this kind of calculations and back away slowly.

The first has a greater cost up front (1450 m/s), but it looks like it has a better chance of reducing intercept speed. I am also considering to go directly to duna and do some partial rocket braking there, with 300 m/s i would slow enough to get some decent assists from duna. it looks promising on paper, but the orbital times are longer, so it would probably stretch the mission too much. I am also still looking for ways to save a little bit by going in tylo orbit for a while and leave, with oberth effect, when the orbital alignments are more favorable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA more acculate calculation shows i have 1700 m/s, which are still not enough for the direct trajectory, but much closer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-04T16:37:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223919943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200034\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612448478\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni wasn\u0027t able to use flyby finder. when i tried to find a second kerbin flyby, it returned no results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlybyFinder won\u0027t do multiple passes of the same body.\u00A0 It can calculate a J-D-K-D\u00A0trajectory, for example, but not a J-K-K-D\u00A0trajectory.\u00A0 It has to do with the\u00A0 fact that solutions to Lambert\u0027s problem\u00A0break down when considering transfers from a point to the same point (actually from a radial distance from the centre of attraction to the same radial distance, but it\u0027s the same issue as in a repeat flyby).\u00A0 There are ways to perform that calculation, but I\u0027ve found them all to be far\u00A0less than user-friendly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223919943\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200034\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612448478\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently I am uncertain whether to use the J-K-K-D trajectory, or a J-D-D trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere I given the choice, I\u0027d exhaust the possibilities with the J-K-K-D path first, even after accounting for the higher up-front cost, because it allows one to either\u00A0append a second Duna flyby to it if needed, or escape to Kerbin should it turn out to cost too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-06T14:55:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell, i did manage to find a better trajectory. from my current jool orbit i could spend 300 m/s to get captured by tylo in a very elliptic orbit. From there, getting the timing right to launch again is tricky, because the elliptic orbit only saves energy if you burn prograde at periapsis, strongly constraining your trajectories. But i found one where the alignment is just right, that will let me reach Duna intercept with only 200 m/s. The timing is not good for meeting Duna, but i still have over 1000 m/s, which are enough to make a course correction at periapsis to reach Duna in the second orbit. From there it\u0027s 700 m/s for capture, which i now have, because i saved 500 m/s on leaving jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis manuever would force me to spend 30 days around tylo, which in kerbalism is bad because tylo is inside jool\u0027s radiation belts, but i tackled this by putting my crew in an escape pod.
