So your periapsis above its center of gravity needs to be 131 km or more. But that is not the number the game shows you. If you had such an orbit, you would see a periapsis of 1 km instead, because 130km above the center of Ike is considered \u0022sea level\u0022 (regardless of the fact that there are no seas on Ike).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the game only shows you distances above sea level, you need to find out what the tallest point on Ike above sea level is. The wiki says that it\u0027s 12.75km.
