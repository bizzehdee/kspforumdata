I have satisfied all the parameters of my contracts save get into orbit within the specified parameters, but my satellite orbit is practically sitting on top of the desired orbit with both the apoapsis and periapsis on the same points and virtually zero angle between the two orbital plane, but the game will still not award me the contract. Its getting to the point where my burns are less than 1 second on minimum thrust. How precise does this game expect me to get these satellites?\n\nThanks for the help."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T00:34:45Z","Content":"There is a surprisingly large leeway in orbital parameters for the satellite contracts (although it gets smaller as the \u0027prestige\u0027 rating gets higher).\n\nIn the situation you describe, the most likely cause is that you\u0027re going the wrong way.\n\nCheck the ascending and descending nodes displayed on the orbit; if they\u0027re close to 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 you\u0027re going the right way, if near 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 then that\u0027s the wrong way.\n\nYou can also see small coloured dots moving around the orbit indicating the correct direction."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T01:07:46Z","Content":"^ It takes not putting your sat into orbit backwards ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\\*edit\\* Don\u0027t feel bad; we\u0027ve all done that once or several times.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T01:39:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T01:22:48Z","Content":"Assuming you ARE in orbit backwards, probably the \u0022cheapest\u0022 way to reverse is to raise apoapsis as high as you can, thrust retrograde (to start, but switch that to holding your heading) there to reverse the orbit, then bring the orbit back down."},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T03:28:22Z","Content":"You\u0027re either backwards, or your satellite needed something equipped that you forgot to add in the VAB.
