I have tried rebuilding the payload, changing the separater for a decoupler and a docking port, altering the fuel lines, exchanging the payload for a fuel tank and even building an entirely new plane but nothing has made any difference. Has anyone got any suggestion on how to get the plane to work without using the fuel from the payload.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
