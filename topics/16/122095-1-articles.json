It also makes precision landings somewhat less critical. All my rovers on Minmus have always been lacking in traction due to the low gravity, so here I\u0027d probably equip the fuel truck with RCS thrusters to aid control. Hanging around a fuel refinery, operating in this way is hardly a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T17:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is my Mining Facility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LbjPXNR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LbjPXNR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is the rover that brings the processed Fuel over to the Ascent-Craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a claw to attach to crafts that have no docking port, but as everything is alligned on the same height i could just dock them together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor driving and braking I use only RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MxJ48Sd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MxJ48Sd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is the Ascent-Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bfwscY1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bfwscY1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gilph","CreatedById":150861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T17:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have taken the road less travelled. The mining bases are very cool and can generate a lot, but very awkward and complicated without KAS (as mentioned above). My needs are more modest, and it has been infinitely better to land a miner with about 2700-3300 ore capacity, fly back to an ISRU station with 5 orange tanks and docking ports and just fill them up. Docking to refuel in space is easy with mechjeb docking autopilot, it\u0027s easier than trying to attach stuff on the ground. To date, I never has a scenario where I needed that much fuel that this system could not satisfy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Shirt","CreatedById":147465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T18:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently using KAS pipes to transfer from the mining platform to the resupply ship. I highly recommend this for the sheer panic attack it causes when you first attempt to EVA place a connector and realize you have no idea how KAS works, even though you read the instructions. I almost turned the platform over and did manage to knock an engine off of it. Great fun. I did get everything fixed... eventually. Future plans involve a rover/hauler, so dangerously close landings aren\u0027t necessary. I haven\u0027t tried docking ports or the claw yet.
