So I built a probe piloted rocket to put an escape vehicle into M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit and then drop a FASA Gemini lander down so Sidford could ride it back up, EVA into the escape vehicle, and go home. I successfully placed the Gemini lander on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn \u003Cem\u003E25 clicks away\u003C/em\u003E from Sidford. So now I\u0027m trying to drop a probe piloted rover for Sidford to ride to the Gemini lander because, after an hour of walking, I realized that I wasn\u0027t going to get to it on foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of my designs have worked, and the best one ran out of fuel and crashed and burned on the surface of M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.
