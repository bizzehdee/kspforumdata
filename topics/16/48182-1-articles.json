I was terrified of it but forcing myself to try one evening made me realise it was a cinch. Its mostly just timing and matching orbits. Practice in Kerbin orbit with a space station or something, and lots of RCS fuel \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt opens up so much of the game and really increases the scope of your space program.

Learning to dock successfully was one of the most important requirements to get to the moon, and the Gemini program taught us how to do it in the (relative) safety of low Earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf history\u0027s not your bag, think of it this way: short of cheating/hyper editing or melting your computer with a massive part count, docking is pretty much the only way to get the really cool space ships built and onto fun missions. If you can master that, you can do some really neat stuff in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue","CreatedById":1917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T19:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is hard enough to build an Eve-lander that\u0027s capable of returning a single kerbal to orbit, launching from high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPacking interplanetary capability onto the launching payload of such a lander is just self-inflicted cruelty in terms of difficulty and complexity.
