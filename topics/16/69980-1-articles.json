I\u0027ve had a similar one where a Minmus intercept simply would not show up. If I was on the edge of the SOI, it would, but bringing the PE down to a low altitude made the encounter disappear. I had to guess the right amount to burn in the end. Also, setting up my recent Duna mission, the intercept was flickering on and off like crazy which would be ok if it weren\u0027t for the fact I was making refinements with MJ and told it to refine closest approach to target \u003Cem\u003Eto be a collision course\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as an aside, I certainly would not call the OP intercept \u0027on the edge of Tylos SoI\u0027... look at it! Yeah, the it\u0027s near-polar so the angle isn\u0027t ideal but look at how long he\u0027s in it! That kind of time does not happen if you\u0027re only just inside the SoI.

If you consider at 1000x warp, the game is calculating position and velocity 1000x less frequently. 10k warp is even worse. This means the SOI transition may occur much later than it should.
