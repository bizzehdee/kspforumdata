If you build your rocket tall instead of wide, and put nosecones on everything, you can forget about terminal velocity altogether - it\u0027s the heat that will cause you problems way before you notice any atmospheric losses.

As a related question, is there a list of terminal velocities by altitude and planet anywhere?\n\nIt is not as critical to watch out for terminal velocity. What has become more cumbersome is torque in the nose of a rocket from induced drag - particularly when the rocket is not headed directly into the air-stream. Without tail-fins this torque is strong enough to overwhelm any control input flipping your rocket over. Also note, the torque increases with air-flow (i.e. velocity). If you don\u0027t have tail-fins keep your nose pointed into the wind!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. Is there a way to see the temperature of various parts in stock KSB?

Since terminal velocity is a component of atmospheric drag, and NuStock aerodynamics have changed, what terminal velocity ***is*** has changed, but it\u0027s no less important. Simply, the nature of that change makes it less of a practical concern for most early-tech launches.\n\nTerminal velocity, in any aerodynamics, is simply where acceleration force going forward is cancelled by drag forces working in opposition. Skydivers have this very simple, since their \u0022accelerating force\u0022 is always gravity (1G) and always in a straight line toward the hard deck. As they initially jump and enter freefall, wind resistance is negligible in comparison to their body weight, and as such, their downward velocity increases steadily along a linear progression of ~9.8 meters per second in downward velocity for every second spent in freefall -- abbreviated as meters per second squared, or m/(s^2). (Their *cumulative vertical distance travelled* is an exponential affair, since speed is constantly changing, but that\u0027s outside the scope of the question here.)\n\nIf they were in a vacuum, they\u0027d literally continue accelerating at the same rate literally forever until something changed that -- most likely, impact with the hard deck. (It should be noted that if they began freefall in a vacuum from \u0022really far away,\u0022 for example the altitude of the moon, their initial numbers would be different, since gravity decreases the farther out you go, so it would initially be less than 9.8m/(s^2), and gravity from other bodies would affect things, but for our simplified purposes here, the underlying truth remains valid: at time of impact, a skydiver would theoretically be travelling at many hundreds of thousands of miles per hour, likely appreciable fractions of the speed of light by that point. Impact energies of a human-sized impact like that would in all probability be the equivalent of a small to medium sized nuclear bomb going off.)\n\nNow, that digression seems absurd, and totally ***is*** absurd, for the simple reason that people don\u0027t skydive in a vacuum -- they do it in the atmosphere. Now, just sitting there at your computer reading this, air is flowing over you, either from the breeze through an open window, maybe you have a small fan on your desk at work, or even microscopic air currents from people in the next room a-la the butterfly effect. All of those air currents across the surface of your clothing and across your skin imparts a very real, very measurable, amount of force -- usually in such tiny strengths that we simply don\u0027t notice them. At sea level pressure (which we\u0027ll call \u0022100%\u0022 for the time being) air has a specific consistency, a specific viscosity or \u0022goopiness coefficient.\u0022 In other words, it\u0027s a lot heavier and harder to push around than pure helium would be, but a lot less substantial than molasses. This becomes important when masses start moving around at higher velocities.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t matter if the mass is moving or stationary, or if the air is moving or stationary -- it just matters that there should be relative motion between them. For example, getting strapped into a harness inside a wind tunnel, where you are stationary but large fans blow hurricane force winds, causes a lot of air turbulence on the human form. The same thing might happen on movie sets simulating dangerous thunderstorms. This principle is harnessed on aircraft carriers, too -- standard flight operations dictate that the flight deck be steered into the wind whenever possible, so that whatever ambient wind speed there is will only make aircraft flying easier, even if only by a margin of however many knots the windspeed might be that day, so that heading into a 15 knot headwind at a ship speed of 15 knots yields a flightdeck headwind of 30 knots -- this means that an aircraft with a stall speed of 70 knots only has to worry about that 40 knot difference when taking off or landing into that headwind that\u0027s been artificially inflated up to 30 knots. Aircraft can then land at higher throttle settings, an important safety consideration if the plane misses the deck and needs to accelerate and climb for a go-around and another attempt, and it\u0027s easier to hit that flightdeck at a relative approach speed of 40 knots than it would be to do so at 70 knots.\n\nBack to the skydivers, though. Ignoring the original flight speed of the aircraft they jump from, since the planes tend to slow down just before a jump happens anyway, the initial \u0022air speed\u0022 relative to the skydiver after a few seconds in freefall gets pretty fast rather quickly -- generally, five seconds in, the airspeed is around 50m/s, which equates to 180kph or 112mph -- a healthy gale, trending toward strong tropical storm-force windspeeds. Anyone who\u0027s flown a kite, anyone who\u0027s stuck their hand out a car window while driving on a highway, anyone who\u0027s seen what happens when a bird flies headlong into a window, knows that those kinds if airspeeds can become rather undeniable. In our skydiving case, they actually start to cancel out the accelerating effect of gravity -- the rate of acceleration slows down, and overall vertical speed levels out. Eventually, an equilibrium will form, and the skydiver will just drop at a constant rate, with no significant speed fluctuations or increases; acceleration will ***terminate***, hence the term, ***terminal velocity***. Most skydivers spend MOST of their time around these speeds, generally. A trained professional can go into an intentional nosedive (unrecommended outside of emergency situations to catch up with someone ahead who needs help) and achieve speeds in excess of 115m/s downward travel, but the massive tradeoff for such a maneuver is that it consumes altitude *very* quickly.\n\nRocket science introduces some extra variables, but the physics remain unchanged. Now, instead of ONE direction (downward) with ONE constant force (gravity) you have all sorts of directions (with vectored thrust and control surfaces) and all sorts of accelerational possibilities (different engine configurations, the ability to change engine throttle settings, different types of fuel problems which would DECREASE thrust, on top of always-present gravity itself) and also the simple fact that you\u0027re playing in a wider range of atmospheric possibilities. Generally, skydiving happens within the bottom-most 3,000 meters of altitude or thereabouts. Much higher and you start requiring special equipment to be able to breathe, to say nothing of the potentially dangerous low temperatures at those altitudes, wind shear, and other factors that make non-military skydiving at higher altitudes generally impractical. While it\u0027s true that the air density and air resistance values at 3000 meters up is measurably different at sea level, the changes are surprisingly small in the grand scheme, and in any even, the skydiver is VERY quickly returning to sea level conditions as they fall anyway.\n\nWith rockets, you have to worry about things like the jet stream, global air currents, and the fact that not only does air density decrease rapidly as you go up (which affects air resistance and therefore terminal velocity calculations) but that the atmosphere is really divided into measurably distinct LAYERS, kind of like layers of oil and water in an unshaken bottle of salad dressing. Where those layers have a meeting between boundaries can have some pretty intriguing physics regimes, which can sometimes factor into flight planning. (Indeed, the space race took almost two decades of people working very hard to figure out all of these considerations before we could reliably call our shot and send humans to orbit and back again, whereas here in KSP we can do so in career mode sometimes in as few as 4 launches across less than a day of in-game elapsed time.)\n\n**That\u0027s all interesting, bruh, but what\u0027s your point?**\n\nMy point is this: terminal velocity is a LOT higher (and therefore much more difficult to attain with early-career tech levels) in NuStock than it was in oldStock. And really, this was the primary complaint about oldStock aerodynamic modeling anyway -- it more accurately modeled flying through some sort of *digital mayonnaise* than it could ever have modeled air resistance. Think about it -- how fast can you \u0022run\u0022 through water at the beach, without lifting your legs completely out of the water with each step? Now, imagine that same practice, but instead of running through water, run through mayonnaise. You\u0027d go a lot slower -- because your terminal velocity would be a lot slower.\n\nTerminal velocity also depends on shapes, yes. This is why a skydiver can still fire a rifle downward without the bullet coming back to hit the shooter, because the streamlined bullet has much less air resistance, and therefore a much HIGHER terminal velocity, than the diver that fired it. Wingsuits, on the other hand, allow a diver to intentionally increase one\u0027s air resistance, thereby reducing terminal velocity, allowing one to bodyglide and steer. Streamlined phallic-shaped objects can cut through wind resistance more effectively, such as arrows, missiles, and vertical rocket stacks. But the underlying physics remain the same.\n\noldStock aero allowed us something redonkulous, like ~150m/s or something, in sea level terminal velocity for the average vertical stack rocket (calculated strictly on mass, not on shape). nuStock on the other hand models closer to ~380m/s terminal velocity at sea level for the average vertical stack, which no average rocket would ever attain or bump up against, because by the time you\u0027re going that fast, you\u0027re high enough so that atmospheric density has dropped, and THEN your new tV is \u003E600m/s.\n\nAs long as you remain prograde, terminal velocity will never be a significant issue in nuStock aerodynamics during a normal career-mode ascent program. Sometimes to do things you NEED to divert from prograde, but then it\u0027s not really fair to call it \u0022lateral tV\u0022 or \u0022collateral vector coefficients,\u0022 it\u0027s just \u0022drag.\u0022\n\nFly safe!\n\n/lesson"},{"CreatedByName":"Drethon","CreatedById":100831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:40:06Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t done extensive testing yet but I got to orbit with a fairly small craft using my FAR approach of follow the prograde.
