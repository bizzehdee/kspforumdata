In the picture below you can see my 14 parachutes. Is there a way to combine them into 1 icon? I need to separate the parachutes from the engines in this stage, but I can\u0027t get to the top engines because of all the single icons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VAB-stage_combine.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022760\u0022 src=\u0022http://users.frii.com/viciii3/VAB-stage_combine.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s amazing the little things that show up even after years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks gang!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-29T00:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey combine if they\u0027ve been placed according to symmetry. So the most that will ever combine at a time is 8. But this looks like a rover that was built in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E? So max symmetry there is only 2. Just switching focus from one stage to another and back again in the staging stack will combine all the ones that are combinable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, to solve your real problem, if you click on the staging stack then it will scroll with the scroll wheel,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor you can grab the entire craft below a decoupler and detach it. That will \u0022ghost\u0022 the entire bottom half of the ship -- but it makes all the stages of the upper half much easier to access.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you are going to have to grab the engines one at a time anyway, to move them out of that stage.
