For highly efficient designs, I recently abandoned R.A.P.I.E.Rs altogether. For a 30t craft, two turbojets paired with two LV-Ns are always sufficient. You can make do with a single turbojet until around 27 tons (using high lift wings), though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My last two sentences from above also show the impact the engine layout has on the ascent profile: Two turbojets usually deliver a TWR that allows for a quick 20 degree climb. A single turbo is much slower but may be equally efficient (low thrust in low atmosphere = low fuel consumption \u002B only a single engine \u002B less weight) --\u0026gt; 7-12\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 climb angle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When dealing with moderate TWRs Profiles for ascent from my experience should always include a sea-level acceleration phase to at least 250m/s (for the ram-effect) and another acceleration phase at 10kms (Turbojet) or 12kms (Rapier). When parts start to overheat, do not adjust thrust but increase the angle of attack to climb more quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Small SSTOs with a Rapier or a Turbojet \u002B a few of those small orange radial engines can be around 8tons and thus have tremendously high TWRs. Just lift off, at 250m/s pull up to 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and reduce thrust until your acceleration is around 10m/s. When at 7500m, revert to full throttle, slowly reduce AoA until you hit 1300 (Turbojet) or 1400 m/s (Rapier) and climb out at the edge of overheating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When acceleration comes to a halt with turbojets, additionally switch on your LV-N or LF-O engines until flameout. For Rapiers, switch to closed cycle as soon as you begin to lose speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps. If you need any example craft designs for ascent profiles, just write me a PM.

If you\u0027re not concerned with keeping the \u0022White Knight\u0022 in existence, then that method is kinda easy to do. You build a small spaceplane \u0022upper stage\u0022 that\u0027s all rocket, and carry it to high altidude with a large \u0022lower stage\u0022 that\u0027s all jet.

You need both jets and rockets in the same vehicle, fuel for both, fuel for both, both having enough TWR to do their jobs before they run out of fuel, and enough wing to land safely at the end. While the general parameters of such a spaceplane are fairly tight, you do have some wiggle room within them that will give the ship somewhat different performance in the various regimes of the ascent. This means your ascent must be tailored to suit the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T15:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, technically, both of these are multi-stage vehicles, not SSTOs.\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ESSTOs were not mentioned in OP.

Do not believe anyone that a rapier cannot lift 30 tons, provided its low drag and has enough wings on it. Also, it was my 1st post 1.0 SSTO style craft that is 100% legit. The only non stock things are fuel switching mod (so those stupid FLT-100s can have 100 LF instead of all that worthless OXY), and i also used ALOT of part clippoing to achieve said looks, there are 2 bombs in the bomb bay, with at least 20 FLT-100s sideways stacked in teh center, all in that short bay, yes clippiung can be considered cheaty by some, but ive goven up caring about clipping since my designs process is: [1looks, 2armor, 3weapons, 4make it fly, 5give it the range i desire by spamming fuel tanks somewhere where they can fit in].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANyways, if anyone is interested in slow and low accel approach, most excessively bad TWR craft will work like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Get off the runway alive, and build speed to ~300m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 Climb to ~5-7 km, making sure to not drop speed too much or you will never be able to recover it (regardles sif its a jet or a rapier, the faster you go the more thrust you get at a given altitude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Level out so that your craft is just keeping altitude and boost up to at a minimum of 450m/s (if you can get through the transsonic region and get to 500\u002Bm/s, a single rapier will push 50 tons easily), this also means if your craft refuses to pass the transsonic, you need to dive somewhat and loose altitude to break through, or worst case, light the rocket engine for a temporary boost, it is better to eat more fuel to break through faster then spend 10 minutes trying to burn through to mach 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 Gain altitude till you are near 10-15km and level out (this depends on your build, the less draggy you are, the lower you can start to gain speed, you will gain it faster and use less total fuel, but if you are more draggy then higher is always better).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 Maximize your speed without cooking your kerbals (as much as the kraken enjoys eating kerbals, deep fried kerbal doesnt really suit him very well), aim to be going at a minimum 1300m/s before you start to angle upwards, although the faster you go, trhe less dV you will need to eat in rocket mode (it is far better to spend an extra minute or two in atmo gaining speed slowly, then it is to use rockets to gain that speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 Angle up slowly and try to get your trajectory to around a 20 degree angle when your jets/rapiers run out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 Engage rockets (if you have alot of thrust in rocket mode like LFO engines, just aim for prograde until your AP is whatever you desire it to be, if you have low thrust, aim at 30 degrees above horizon at all times until you are above 1900m/s after that prograde provided you are still gaining altitude at that point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8 Point yourself prograde to cut down needless drag, burning occasionally if your desired AP drops below acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9 Do the usual stuff you do to circularize or attain orbit or whatever you fancy doing once out of atmo (go buy your kerbals some coffee).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis approach works for 90% of my very bad thrust SSTLs (single stage to laythe surface and back). It is highly recommended to have some oxy for a rapier if you have very bad TWR with the space engines (ions, nukes, ect), since oftentimes you cannot gain enough speed fast enough to punch out of atmo with these engines alone, and an extra 300 or so m/s after jets die goes a long way to keep you afloat until the speed rises to orbital velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T19:08:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 07:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T19:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHas anyone built a true SSTO spaceplane.

This particular craft is able to SSTO, then proceed to do a Mun fly-by and return. It was built with space tourism in mind, and can carry 8 passengers and 2 crew (or 9 \u002B 1 if I really want).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt usually takes off with approx 0.7 - 0.85 TWR, depending of the particular engine arrangement and fuel supply. My ascent probably isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethe\u003C/em\u003E most efficient, but it works for the designs I\u0027ve built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll usually keep an eye on my Thrust readout, and adjust my ascent so that it\u0027s consistently rising. If the thrust is not increasing, I\u0027ll angle down a degree or two til it begins slowly rising again. Biggest issue is often in the 200 - 350 m/s range, wherein there often isn\u0027t enough speed to keep the positive feedback loop going, resulting in decreasing thrust. Some spaceplanes need to do a shallow dive at the point to build speed past the barrier, then pitch up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically, I will never activate my LF\u002BO engines unless I am \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E 1100m/s (1300\u002B preferred, but not always possible) and 20km\u002B altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy end goal for this was to be able to SSTO, then perform both a Mun and Minmus fly-by, and return to KSC.
