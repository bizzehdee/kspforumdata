The ascent procedure you provided is generally what I would aim to follow in the past, so I guess I\u0027m not too inefficient in what I\u0027m doing. However I would typically reduce my thrust to avoid overshooting my target orbit Apokee, and by no longer doing that, I might see an reduction in the delta-v required for orbit. I find KSP to be more enjoyable when I\u0027m guessing my way through things, and more often than not I have ample delta-v to do what I want to do anyway. I suppose the 3,400 m/s is just there as a rough target for reaching orbit, and after reading your post, it\u0027s pretty obvious now that that figure can\u0027t possibly apply to every vehicle design due to factors like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and atmospheric drag. For now, I\u0027ll work on improving my ascent profile, and ensure my designs have a sufficient \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Since I started using Kerbal Engineer years ago, I always based my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on the Saturn V, as I saw that as the staple launch vehicle. Anything with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.15 or higher I thought was more than enough, but after reading some posts I now realize that you should aim for something closer to 1.5.

A rocket with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2.0 will require about 200-300m/s less than a rocket with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.2 - again this isn\u0027t to say it\u0027s better to have a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, it requires going very engine-heavy, but it does result in lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit numbers (not necessarily lower cost per kg to orbit though). The cheapest way to get a high launchpad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is adding small SRBs like Hammer or Thumper, and actually happens to be pretty economical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up is streamlining, which is very important if you\u0027re going to make good use of a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Every m/s lost to aerodynamic drag is another m/s to orbit. Streamlining is usually a fair investment, though in challenges to launch mass as cheaply as possible streamlining usually isn\u0027t used because it\u0027s cheaper to buy more boosters than to add more streamlining parts.

Like for example the Swivel has rather bad ASL \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E vs Vac \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, a reasonable Swivel rocket can easily take 3600m/s to get into orbit just because it makes significantly worse use of fuel when low in the atmosphere. This is not saying whether or not the Swivel is bad as a launch engine (though it is), just that a large difference between ASL and Vac performance strongly distorts the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit which is measured in Vac \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, an engine like the Twin-Boar has a practically flat \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E curve, meaning it almost makes equally good use of fuel at all altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next factor is launchpad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. A rocket with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2.0 will require about 200-300m/s less than a rocket with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.2 - again this isn\u0027t to say it\u0027s better to have a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, it requires going very engine-heavy, but it does result in lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to orbit numbers (not necessarily lower cost per kg to orbit though). The cheapest way to get a high launchpad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is adding small SRBs like Hammer or Thumper, and actually happens to be pretty economical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext up is streamlining, which is very important if you\u0027re going to make good use of a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Every m/s lost to aerodynamic drag is another m/s to orbit. Streamlining is usually a fair investment, though in challenges to launch mass as cheaply as possible streamlining usually isn\u0027t used because it\u0027s cheaper to buy more boosters than to add more streamlining parts.
