Unfortunately, all the old tricks I knew about building heavy-lift and long-distance SSTOs no longer work. Multiple intakes per engine, turbojet/nuke combos, etc are all off the table. Reading around, the vast majority of SSTOs people are showing off lifting payloads to orbit or visiting minmus, etc. feature RAPIER engines. Since RAPIERs are now at the far end of the tech tree I can\u0027t utilise them. Is it possible to build a non-RAPIER SSTO that can do useful work any more? I\u0027ve managed to get one into orbit running with quad turbojets and dual reliants but with no cargo and barely enough Delta-V to de-orbit, let alone travel elsewhere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T10:00:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 10:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shyrka**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:15:30Z","Content":"It\u0027s definitely doable.

I am using FAR these days, but I played in the new stock aero while ferram was still building Euler and I can definitely say that there\u0027s not as wide of a gulf between stock aero and FAR these days as there used to be. A Turbojet engine in FAR still produces 166.77 kN of thrust on the Runway, so at 25 tonnes you\u0027ve got a TWR of 0.71 and with thirty tonnes you\u0027re at 0.57. The wiki puts the figure for a single Turbojet at a nice, even 180 kN, and that would be for the stock game, so the TWRs there would be even higher. Half your mass in rocket fuel gives you somewhere in the neighborhood of 1800 m/s of delta-V (with the Twitch engine\u0027s 290 Isp), which is what I\u0027ve seen folks recommending lately.\n\nEDIT: Told you guys wrong in that first post - it\u0027s not eight Twitches; it\u0027s sixteen. You can get the same amount of thrust from a pair of Thud (Mk55 Radial) engines if part count is an issue - they have higher Isp but the increased mass will offset that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T15:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:53:53Z","Content":"A turbojet based spaceplane is definitely doable.\n\nCheck out the [Single Turbojet Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123114-Single-Turbojet-SSTO-Spaceplane/page2) thread.\n\nAs Slashy pointed out, you\u0027re not going to get much more than LKO and stay cost effective.\n\nIf you **are** going just to LKO and back, there\u0027s no reason they can\u0027t be a viable solution.

I wouldn\u0027t bother with a spaceplane, certainly not a Mk2 as they seem to be the most difficult to build. I\u0027d try to build one for fun and frustration, but wouldn\u0027t see it as a need.\n\nLifting kerbals to LKO or rescuing them from the Kerbin system is a perfect job for a spaceplane and they can do that very well even on a single TurboJet though for greater carry capacity i prefer 2 TurboJets \u002B 1 T-30/45/Aerospike (the spike is far up the tree, behind a 550 science node and a 3.5 mil R\u0026D upgrade)\n\nIt\u0027s possible to place a satellite anywhere in Kerbin system for slightly more than 10.000 which is easily offset by the contract. Using a spaceplane would offer marginal savings and i\u0027d not want to bother saving a few thousand with one.\n\nThe perennial disadvantage of a spaceplane is allways that it has to carry all wings, tanks, athmospheric engines and other doodads with it wherever it goes. With LKO refuelling and an Aerospike or Poodle it\u0027s possible to go places and i do like the idea of an all-in-one craft. However there will be a price to pay in efficiency. Spaceplanes that only reach LKO suffer less from efficiency penalties, but they seem to be limited to taxi service or light/medium cargo. Once you need to burn absurd amounts of fuel, you\u0027re no longer saving as much. It\u0027s also neccesary to land on the runway to get 100% cost back, minus fuel, and re-entry can be very annoying or difficult.\n\nI think there are roles that can be better served with a spaceplane but going that route just to save money can lead to madness as they are frustratingly difficult to build. Better to make money with rockets than save with planes i say. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n@moronwrocket\n\nThat is a very nice looking plane.
