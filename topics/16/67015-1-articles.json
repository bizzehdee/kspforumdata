There was a challenge to that effect a few months ago. I seem to recall the winning combination was a Stayputnik, a small battery balanced with an unshielded solar panel, an FL-T200 and a 48-7S. Made Kerbin orbit easily. It was SRV Ron\u0027s design; he might have the pic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you\u0027re talking about launching a full space station in one thwack, it depends on the design, as Specialist290 has indicated.
