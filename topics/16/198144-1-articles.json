The horizontal lander is a bit unusual, in that it has a centre-mounted, downwards facing engine and also it can safely roll over onto its back to offer various different height with which to mate to other craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think they\u0027re close enough - have I fitted the docking connectors properly (eg not backwards??)
