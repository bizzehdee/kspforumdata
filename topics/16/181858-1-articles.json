The plane was more than 170 parts, probably around 200. When I first experienced the plane falling apart, it was just some clipped parts falling out of the main plane. I fixed this with a few structural connectors. I launched again and when I tried to pull up off the runway, my wings just went crazy and blew the plane up. I thought I might try again but not pull up so hard. So I reverted to launch, and my plane immediately.. well it\u2019s kind of hard to describe. The parts were all separated from each other, but still seemed connected via invisible joints, and then separated and fell apart, some parts were sent away at extremely high velocity. After falling apart, the remains violently exploded along with the runway. I am on my phone so I do not have a screenshot. I will try and get some screenshots next time I\u2019m on my PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T12:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis request for help playing the game has been moved to Gameplay Questions - the forum section where this sort of thing resides.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T12:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMOAR STRUTS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhotos and craft files will help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratfarts","CreatedById":195033,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T13:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223532181\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181858\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221548937383\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188222\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xd the great\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, Xd the great said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMOAR STRUTS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThing is, I have no idea where I can put the struts without destroying the sleek shape I\u2019m going for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso everyone that says to just add a ton of LONG BIG STRUTS everywhere, I am trying to make a sleek spacecraft called the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E-1 from the movie\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EVenom\u003C/em\u003E, so I can\u2019t really add much more than those structural bar thingies which you click a place and then another place and it makes a strut bar thingy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-31T13:06:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2019 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Ratfarts\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ejust edited the wording\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rauko","CreatedById":188489,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T13:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo pic, no tip\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T13:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, so the MOAR STRUTS thing is kind of an in-joke around here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf something doesn\u0027t move, but it\u0027s supposed to, you add MOAR BOOSTERS, and if something doesn\u0027t stay together, but it\u0027s supposed to, you add MOAR STRUTS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, joking aside...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the old days (pre 1.0) the aerodynamic model was extremely simplistic and struts were commonly used all over the place to hold things together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNowadays, we have a much more sophisticated aero model and drag matters a lot.
