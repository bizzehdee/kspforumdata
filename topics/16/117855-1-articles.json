The best spt is to get the encounter when the body is very near the Kerbin plane.\n\nFor Moho, this can go up to 2500m/s more. As you get a log of window for moho, select the correct one with care.

You want your transfer orbit to just touch Kerbin\u0027s orbit, not cut across it. If you\u0027re bang on the transfer window it should also just touch the destination planet\u0027s orbit, but some variation is common there."},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:30:32Z","Content":"You can\u0027t use conventional Hohmann transfers to get to Moho easily. The best thing to do is wait until Kerbin is at the ascending/descending node of Moho\u0027s orbit, then make a transfer burn that matches your periapsis with the orbit of Moho, at the AN/ DN. (This way you are guarenteed to cross Moho\u0027s orbit w/o a plane change) You can save some DV by launching into an orbit that matches Moho\u0027s inclination at that time or adding in a plane change with your ejection burn. When you reach Pe, set up a maneuver that creates an intercept with Moho, and wala! Should be self explanatory from then on."},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T19:56:32Z","Content":"Use Moho for gravity assists to lower your orbit and only after you have a low velocity intercept try to orbit capture"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:11:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to know how to calculate proper transfers, and maybe gravity assist planning too.\n\nThe basics of gravity assistance are thus: if you pass through a planet\u0027s sphere of influence in front of its orbit, you will lose some energy, while if you pass through behind its orbit, you will gain some energy. The closer you can get to the center of the sphere of influence without actually crashing (or aerobreaking in the cases of planets with atmosphere) the bigger then change in energy you get from passing by that planet. \n\nThe tricky part of gravity assists when planning your course is that you effectively have to try and intercept each planet in orbits between you and your target, assuming they will even be in a position to practically do so by the time you cross their orbits. Make sure to plan your maneuver nodes to sling around the planet very carefully. Treat it like you are planning to visit that planet and want to enter a specific orbit, except you will be leaving again instead of actually orbiting, and get the exit vector to match the general direction you want to go as you leave. Then set up other maneuver nodes on the periapsis of your course around the planet, using that node to adjust your course to target the next planet in the sequence, and maybe do a little forward velocity adding burn while you are at it (lots of bang for your buck at low periapsis.) Repeat as necessary as you cross orbits.\n\nWhile this method might extend your total range, letting you get out further for less fuel, I have found that in practice it does extend the time the mission takes. You often end up going out of your way to maximize fuel economy, but at the cost of longer total distance you have to coast."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:16:29Z","Content":"This thread has been moved to the how-to subforum.
