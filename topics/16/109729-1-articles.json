Regardless of what I try to do in order to reduce speed and protect them, they still somehow manage to burn up right before reentry ends. I have 2 parachutes on the side of the command module and a Mk16 on the nose. Both are rated for 2000 degrees but they never survive reentry, even when I have my pod positioned with the heat shield down and away from the chutes. I\u0027ve even tried a more gradual approach but they still burn up.\n\nI added a terrier with a small fuel tank in one of my stages in order to help reduce my speed, and no I am not going straight up and straight down. I am just trying do some tourist contracts right now but I\u0027ve been having this issue. I wasn\u0027t having this problem a couple days ago.\n\nCan anyone help me? I\u0027m at my wit\u0027s end at the moment. Maybe I should try sticking a parachute in the little storage thing? Does that even work?\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T04:35:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anrui**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T23:36:44Z","Content":"The temperature rate is for when they are closed.

Like, right as I\u0027m leaving reentry my chutes always go out. Chutes were working fine for me a few days ago, now they are burning up a lot suddenly. And no, I don\u0027t have any mods that affect how chutes behave. No deadly reentry, FAR, or anything game changing like that.

So I should have a stage before my parachute deploy stage so they stay in stage 1 during reentry? Before I had my decoupler for my little terrier engine and fuel tank set to decouple while the chute\u0027s launched, which was probably a poor way of staging.\n\nStaged but not deployed is the stage where the chutes are basically the next stage to come right? I have noticed my parachute icons in staging being a blue color a bit before reentry, is this an indication of the second phase for the chutes?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T00:54:28Z","Content":"Phase 1) unstage means they are in the stage above your current stage and just the normal gray color.
