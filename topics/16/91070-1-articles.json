I have successfully launched a Mir style satellite, a science satellite and several communications satellites. Now, I\u0027m finally getting ready to start working on my space station - no, I haven\u0027t left Kirbal orbit yet, wanna get to the moon soon. Anyway, I was wondering, after I finish construction of my space station, is it possible to build a rocket at the space station so that I don\u0027t have to deal with terrestrial-based fuel costs and just launch from space? Any help would be greatly appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I could even just build a space shuttle with some extra fuel and a rover in the hanger for a Mun expedition at the space station...?

It will depend on your specific ship design, but I can normally separate it into several modules joined by large (2.5m) docking ports. This is practical if your ship is of longer shape. If it\u0027s a wider design requiring you to place modules radially around the main module, it will start getting tricky with multiple docking ports and such. Anyway, after I have my ship assembled (all docked together), sometimes I will use the EVA-placeable struts from Kerbal Attachment System mod to reinforce certain key areas while in orbit. This helps with the wobble of your ship and it also adds to the realism of actually going out on EVA and assembling a craft in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main consideration I have to make on how many modules I can separate it into is the weight of each section. Fewer modules means fewer launch vehicles, and less wobble of your finished ship, but those individual modules may be very heavy, requiring extremely robust launchers. If it\u0027s a heavy module and contains fuel, defuel it in the VAB and launch a fuel lifter later to fuel the ship after assembly is finished. Defueled modules are also easier to move/manipulate during docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all about cost vs benefit of your designs. It\u0027s why KSP is so fun.
