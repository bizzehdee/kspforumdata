I did it the first time, which is good, as you should. But once you know you can keep them alive, can save money, and play safe, don\u0027t ruin a super super intensive, solar system wide game with hard modes and no income. Hard mode is to prove to yourself you can do it or have fun trying. But once you have the skills, let yourself be flush with reasonable amounts of money and go from there (e.g. turn up the income per contract to 300%; have max starting cash and even consider cheating with alt12 to get enough cash to upgrade all buildings all the way or to where you want, then ditching the money; give yourself free science to be somewhere on the tree rather than the very start (important when you use 50\u002Bmods as your tree becomes hard to deplete in acquisitions)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust try something new each time. You do the tedious stuff enough and it takes no effort. For example, the only tedious thing I do now is setup my satellite network for RemoteTech. First time was fun/hard; launched one at a time.
