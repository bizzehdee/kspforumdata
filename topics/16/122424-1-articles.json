I\u0027m now looking to retarget my observatory at a safe distance (seemingly 750Mm), but this means I\u0027ll probably have 15kdV to spare once it\u0027s circular... maybe I\u0027ll try to put it in a polar orbit \u0026gt;89 degrees at 750Mm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any experience with craft closer than that and surviving the new heating mechanics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So for 16 of the 20kdV I have I can put it directly into a 800Mm circular polar orbit. I\u0027ll probably do that. Might have to build another with radiators and the like and see how close I can dive it before it burns up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T07:37:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 07:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temporal Wolf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T07:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124522-Solar-Limbo-How-Low-can-you-Go\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echallenge thread\u003C/a\u003E if you haven\u0027t found it already...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temporal Wolf","CreatedById":117332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T07:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETake a look at this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124522-Solar-Limbo-How-Low-can-you-Go\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echallenge thread\u003C/a\u003E if you haven\u0027t found it already...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, awesome.
