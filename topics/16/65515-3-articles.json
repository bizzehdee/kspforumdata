Drag is still quite significant, but as the terminal velocity starts rising rapidly, you need high thrust to keep up with it. You can keep accelerating and pushing your apoapsis higher even with low thrust, but what you really want to do is to keep the climb rate high enough while gaining horizontal speed, so that time to apoapsis keeps increasing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, you don\u0027t actually want to keep up with terminal velocity the whole ascent. Its most obvious in the upper atmosphere where escape velocity is lower than terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally you want the dV losses of gravity drag to equal the dV loses of atmospheric drag. However, the dV loses of gravity drag correspond to the sin of your angle relative to the surface. When you thrust parallel to the ground, you have no gravity drag - of course in the case where you still have atmospheric drag, this is not good - they should be equal, so you should still be pointing up, rasing your apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut assuming a proper ascent path, at the higher altitudes, well into your gravity turn, gravity drag becomes quite small due to your angle with respect to the surface, and as a result, you should also be travelling much lower than terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that generally speaking, you need a TWR of 2:1 to maintain terminal velocity (whereas a TWR of 1.5 should get you 70% of the way there), as at that point the force of drag = the force of gravity. Once you\u0027re thrusting at 30 degrees from the horizon in your gravity turn, you\u0027d only need half the thrust to maintain a given optimal velocity - however its true you don\u0027t need to just hold one speed at one instant, but you need to accelerate to reach the ever higher optimal ascent velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m not sure what the TWR you really need for the upper stages is... if you were already at a given optimal velocity, you need less thrust to maintain it than when in the vertical part of your ascent, but you also want to accelerate quite rapidly\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T10:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe new tweaks may have given me the delta-V I need, but I notice that it\u0027s now nearly impossible to steer.
