The V-tail, however, was a spur of the moment decision.\n\u003E \n\u003E This design was *almost* successful - it made it into orbit under its own power and launched a fully-loaded payload without issue. But, it didn\u0027t have enough Oxidizer afterwards to de-orbit. I\u0027m guessing my flight profile had something to do with that, though (maybe I lit the rockets too low), so I\u0027m going to try again tonight.\n\u003E \n\u003E The main thing I\u0027m worried about at the moment is whether or not the plane will still be dynamically stable after fulfilling its mission (i.e. during descent and landing). It strikes me that the main wing may be a bit too far forward, and RCS Build Aid is telling me the CoM is going to shift back quite a little ways (the RCS you\u0027re seeing in the SPH screenies is for the probe; the plane itself has no RCS capability). Makes me wish I could rely on the CoL marker to be accurate. FAR green lit me up to 30k/M4, but that was with tanks full. I might see what it says with tanks empty before I try the next launch. Maybe put the wing a little further back (it\u0027s not like I don\u0027t have plenty of room to do that) and move the Mk1 Fuselage tanks forward.\n\u003E \n\u003E I am pretty sure something was borked with my instance of KSP last night - I had some weird behaviors going on later on when I switched over to my career game. The NaN readings I was getting from KER were not a good sign either. Couldn\u0027t tell if the voxels I was seeing with the Ballista\u0027s wings were good or not; I know there have been issues between B9 Procedural Wings and FAR.\n\nA bit of advice on the design that may help a bit. \n\nIf you sunk the radial fuel tanks into the hull a bit more to give it a more streamlined shape it would smooth out the overall airflow issue. Also if you were to extend the point of the nose a fair bit more, try adding an antenna on the tip of it to give you a point in the airstream. DONT extend the antenna it will just blow off. Lastly move the solar panels behind the wings or into your cargo bay so that they are not blocks metal in the airflow."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:28:04Z","Content":"This past weekend I was able to unlock enough technology in my career game to start seriously utilizing spaceplanes in it. Just a quick status update there.\n\nSo I figured the first thing I\u0027d try to do in career was build a manned rescue plane, the Night Hawk 7 - just a simple little two-seater design. Here\u0027s its drag profile:\n\n![twFMwib.png](http://i.imgur.com/twFMwib.png)\n![gve5McK.png](http://i.imgur.com/gve5McK.png)\n\n![ZbIddIF.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZbIddIF.png)\n\nWhat the crap is going on there around the cargo bay? Is that a known bug? It\u0027s like it\u0027s treating the bay as being non-existent - I\u0027ve got a Reaction Stabilizer, a couple of batteries, some solar panels, two roundified RCS tanks (it\u0027s a rescue craft so it does have RCS capabilities) and a quad of linear RCS ports in there (two forward, two back, don\u0027t know why it took me this long to come up with that particular idea - and it works, BTW). \n\nAnyway, I had some serious problems with this design. First, FAR borked; gave me NaNs on lift and drag and try as I might it went into the drink. I would\u0027ve reported that one to ferram but it hasn\u0027t happened since and I don\u0027t know how to get the error log he needs to fix these sorts of things anyway. After restarting KSP, it was pretty obvious the CoL was too far forward; it see-sawed up and down until parts started flying off. No problem - I moved the wings back a bit. Then I started experiencing parts breaking off at low altitudes, by which I mean the elevators. I repurposed the flaps to serve as an auxiliary pair, which worked on a relatively successful flight; it tells me I need to tone down the pitch control of the main elevators. Got it up around Mach 3.8 at 20k. Lit the rockets...and failed to make orbit. I made orbital altitude but didn\u0027t have enough juice to circularize.\n\nPost-mordem then - What\u0027s wrong with the design? FAR gives my Max Cross Section as 3.59 square meters and the wave drag area as 3.25 square meters, critical mach is 0.768, if that\u0027s at all helpful. Only other thing I did to the design after making those screenies was to put a small antenna on the nose (which incidentally overheated and exploded during the flight - so I guess I might need to work a bit more on my flight profile).\n\nI suppose I could fill in the little gap there between the fuselage and the wing towards the tail. The fin probably needs to be redesigned to a more traditional fin-and-rudder; I don\u0027t really have a reason to have an all-moving fin (I was being lazy again there).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T14:31:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 02:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T14:34:10Z","Content":"The main thing wrong with your design is a bug in FAR: the voxelisation isn\u0027t picking up the bottom half of the cargo bay.

Makes me wonder how many more of the problems I\u0027ve been having of late have been due to that bug with the Mk2 Cargo Bays...\n\nI got to say - I\u0027ve only used Kerbal Flight Data just this once, but I likes it...\n\nAny suggestions for what I could do with the tail? I\u0027ve still got a pretty big dip in the yellow curve going on there. Also, I\u0027m finding it hard to pitch up during the speed-up part of the flight - you know, the part where I\u0027m trying to get to Mach 4 (which is finally happening!) before 20k and stuff starts to overheat. Last night I blew a Pegasus ladder off the side of that same plane because I started getting temperature warnings and couldn\u0027t steepen my rate of climb sufficiently. At least it wasn\u0027t anything critical, but it did make getting Diissa into the ship harder.\n\nShip made orbit but it still took almost all the juice it had available to do it; I had something like a 4% oxidizer reserve after orbital insertion. Made the rendezvous on RCS thrust alone, which was further complicated since I switched out the mid-line rocket fuel tank with a full-size Mk2 rocket fuselage and forgot that I\u0027d mounted the forward firing RCS ports to the thing (so I couldn\u0027t do any RCS reverse thrusting; good thing I wasn\u0027t actually doing any docking with this plane). Something I\u0027ll fix before the next flight of the craft...\n\nNext up is re-entry to landing. I\u0027m hoping I\u0027m not too out of practice with that bit.

But you can usually make them work by cranking up the maximum deflection on the elevators.\n\nIf you\u0027ve already maxed out the elevator deflection and still can\u0027t lift the nose, then you either need to add canards or shift the wings forwards a bit.\n\nIf you spend some time fine-tuning the tail drag, you can probably cut a fair bit off it. Shift the vertical stabiliser back and forward by the smallest possible amounts; find its lowest drag position. Then do the same with the Thuds, the wings, the intakes and any other widgets you have in the region. Then do it all again because any changes you made late in the process will disturb the positions set early in the process...\n\nYou can see where the big wiggle in the yellow line is, and how it relates to the peak of the cross-section curve.

Ideally, full stick should take the plane close to its g and stability limits, then stably hold it there.\n\nFinding the exact settings for that is a matter of fiddly trial and error. Dynamic Deflection helps (it allows you to have effective deflections in thin air without them being overpowered in thick air), but so do the assorted stability-inducing build tricks. Position of lifting surfaces, control surface settings, etc.\n\nStalling is only an issue at low speed; once you\u0027re comfortably supersonic, you can get away with huge AoA so long as you remain stable. Forward surfaces (canards etc) stall more easily than rear surfaces. There are two responses to this: set the max deflection on forward surfaces lower than the rear ones, and/or use negative AoA settings on the forward surfaces. This will also improve stability at high AoA, but if overdone and not balanced against powerful rear surfaces, may make it harder to keep the nose up when you want to.\n\nYou need to mess around with the settings to get a feel for them. Build a basic mid-wing plane with canards and a tailplane. Set it up with various patterns: deflections high rear / low forward and vice versa, positive AoA vs negative etc. Take them for short test flights and see what happens.\n\nRun a static analysis at a speed that requires a decent AoA for level flight; maybe Mach 3 at 20,000m. Watch the control surfaces as you do so; the AoA settings will kick in and move the surfaces to match the level flight AoA. This should help you get an understanding of what they\u0027re doing. You can also test spoilers and flaps like this."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T01:18:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Highly recommended.

There\u0027s a story there - last night I did the fourth attempt to bring the two of them home in the Night Hawk. The fourth re-entry went pretty much the same as the previous entries, where I tore the airbrakes off as the Q got too high. But, I managed to get the temperature under control and brought them into subsonic flight about a hundred klicks downrange from KSC. As I closed to fifty klicks, I did a quicksave and then tried to make an adjustment to my course to align with the Runway and the plane came apart, with the expected end results (it wasn\u0027t that violent of a maneuver either, just a quick little tap on the elevator to bring the nose up - at a Q of about 28 kPa). When I did a quickload, the Cockpit promptly exploded with the plane dangling in mid-air. Reload and this happened again - I did this three times before I finally said \u0022screw it\u0022 and went to the space center. Naturally, I\u0027d lost the money for Diissa\u0027s rescue contract, but I noted the Astronaut Facility listed her and Jeb as MIA - so I knew I had been hit by a Kraken, and I still had access to both of them. The game gave me a new rescue contract shortly thereafter - Pepe\u0027s contract - which gave me an chance to make some key fixes to the Night Hawk design (among them, adding struts to the inside of the cargo bay and adding a few cooling fins to the Nacelle). \n\nPepe\u0027s contract only took two tries to get right; I promptly whacked the damn fins I\u0027d added when I took off and still cooked the ladder off the side of the cockpit, but otherwise there were no mishaps in the ascent. Ripped off the spoilers on both re-entry attempts (the second time while trying to retract them at Q=9 kPa), and both times I got the plane subsonic and to the KSC Runway; the first time I botched the touchdown and destroyed the craft, the second time I was able to produce the screenie above.\n\nSo I\u0027ve got some testing and a few more tweaks to make to the design at this point; I\u0027ll take all your advice to heart and we\u0027ll see what happens.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T01:21:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"}]}
