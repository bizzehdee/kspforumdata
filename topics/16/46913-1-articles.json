So I\u0027ll basically be climbing at the max angle that I can still accelerate at, until I\u0027m at a height that is just under the spaceplanes limit (which so far has been roughly 10-13km). Then I tend to level out so I\u0027m flying relatively flat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T02:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was messing around with this exact thing earlier. With 5 intakes and 1 turbojet, I could fly a plane up to 47km and over 2100m/s. Bear in mind that aircraft in these situations are absurdly unmaneuverable. Still, with less than 400 fuel (and some very sloppy flying) I circumnavigated Kerbin twice in 78 minutes, and could have been a touch faster yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a few things I did to help this along. I mounted vertical stabilizers well-behind the CoM. to keep it stable. I angled up both the wings and horizontal stabilizer 30deg, so that they would provide maximum lift when I was flying straight-and-level (air intakes lose air as they spin away from forward). However, this made it fly very awkwardly in thick air (it would point about 20deg below the horizon, which meant landing needed to be very slow), so that was a little bit of a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to keep backing off the throttle as then engine flames out (this is why it is good to have just a single engine, or at least have an odd number and make sure that the center one will be the one to flame out). When I was up above 45km, I was at maybe 4% thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, however, that you aren\u0027t missing much above 25km. \u0027Planes\u0027 up there act more like rockets (and certainly can\u0027t maneuver) because of the high speed necessary to keep air going through the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess is often more, in this case. My ship was under 4t after I had burned out all the fuel. The main thing that determines max altitude is your intake/mass ratio. In air-starved environments, air is thrust and (as always) mass is drag. If it still won\u0027t go high enough, try bigger wings. At 45km, my engine was delivering maybe 6kN of thrust. More engines would just add drag, which would slow it down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pariah89","CreatedById":76673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T02:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is the best tutorial out there, how to build them and how to fly them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelped me big time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39141-Tutorial-How-to-make-your-first-SSTO?highlight=ssto\u002Btutorial\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39141-Tutorial-How-to-make-your-first-SSTO?highlight=ssto\u002Btutorial\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T03:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ea lower rate of climb helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou basically want to get to ~1.5km/s (orbit) before switching to rocket, because you need a ~2.2km/s for a 75x75km circular orbit and you probably need ~1-1.2km/s of dV to get from 1.5km/s to 2.2km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe lower the rate of climb, the more time you can buy for your plane to accelerate before the jet flames out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, lowering the thrust when the intakes are getting low helps too,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou should start throttling down a bit at around 0.2 intake and then at ~0.12 intake, you should be running both the rockets and the jets at fairly low thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand when the jets die, throttle the rockets back to the max and pitch up a little (or not, depending on the altitude you are at).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy experience is,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe number of intakes doesnt really matter (of cos spamming intakes make it A LOT easier) as long as you manage to get to ~1.5km/s (orbit) and have ~1km/s rocket dV left, you will definitely be going to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother tip is, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor planes, the smaller it is, the easier it flies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etry to take a look of the stock Aeris 4A, and note it\u0027s parameters,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emass, jet thrust, rocket thrust,rocket dV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe Aeris 4A is a good start for flying/building planes, you can get into a 100X100km orbit with it with some fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(tho\u0027 you may want to tweak the wings a bit as the stock tends to flip if your maneuvers arent too gentle)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-30T03:27:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2013 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by lammatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T12:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience, there are two cases we have to distinguish here: a plane that \u0022only\u0022 flies at very high altitudes (let\u0027s say, 60km), and space planes that actually achieve orbital velocity.
