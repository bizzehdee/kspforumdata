So I have two questions: how to edit specific parts in the save file (and does it need to reconcile with the persistence file--if so, how?). Second, I had thought to just launch the craft once fixed in the VAB and paste it into the corrupted craft\u0027s place--instead, the only part that exists by that name is \u0022debris\u0022--a docking clamp and decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my haste I modified the persistent file without backing it up, so woe to me. I\u0027m really really really upset at this, because this specific project is about 80 hours of game time invested, and this is the farthest I\u0027ve gotten. Anyhow, tips or guides on how to transpose craft files or fix broken parts within craft files would be appreciated. the next time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astronut25","CreatedById":9000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T02:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend using Notepad\u002B\u002B, it makes editing a whole lot easier.
