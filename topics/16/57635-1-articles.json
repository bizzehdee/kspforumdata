If you\u0027ve never landed on the Mun before I might suggest leaving out the Science Jr for your first attempt, that will reduce the weight (fuel will last longer) and make the lander shorter which makes it easier to land without tipping over.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-24T22:03:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2013 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dave Kerbin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T22:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethat will reduce weight (fuel will last longer)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually AFAIK you\u0027ll burn your fuel faster (higher twr) but you\u0027ll get more delta v out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my pickiness and merry xmas!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T22:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel will burn at exactly the same rate regardless of the weight it\u0027s pushing, that\u0027s just down to the ISP of the engine.

For boosting and making the orbit, have on the four lander engines another double tank setup. Radial mount to these four, eight triple tanks and finish with SRB to assist.

It can be tricky to maintain control when you start to spin because without any struts, the engines pivot outward applying a rotational thrust.
