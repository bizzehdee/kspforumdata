The drills are on the two landers over on the left side of the screenie; those are two are identical to one another. Granted, I did take a winch off the tipped lander and stick it on the one set of drills, but this rig was acting up before that happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEast Crater if that\u0027s relevant. 1.0.2 if that\u0027s relevant too (just haven\u0027t ever gotten around to upgrading to 1.0.4 and I probably won\u0027t given that 1.0.5 is in experimentals already).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s happening is that with this particular set of drills, they won\u0027t continue mining if I go focus on something else and come back to them later. They do mine ore just fine when I\u0027m present and focused on the rig. They\u0027ve got plenty of power to operate, there are fuel cells on the one lander tipped on its side for night operations, there\u0027s plenty of ore present in the area. I\u0027ve got a rig almost identical to this one on Minmus, and it continues drilling when I\u0027m not around just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas as to what might be happening with this particular rig? And, more to the point, what should I do to try and correct it? I don\u0027t like having to stay focused on this rig just to get it to work right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T22:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven that 1.0.5 is going to be out Real Soon Now, might be a good idea to just wait for that, upgrade, and then see whether you still have the issue.
