The Mun causing trouble is even less likely, especially if you also have relay sats at the Mun.

For interplanetary relay purposes, you really only need one satellite, in a large circular orbit that\u0027s steeply inclined from equatorial. Kerbin\u0027s SoI has a radius that\u0027s a large multiple of the planet\u0027s; the chance of Kerbin or one of its moons getting in the way is tiny, and even if it were to happen, the outage would be brief. All you need to do is to make sure that the relay has good connectivity to the satellites in LKO or keosynchronous, which is pretty easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy network in late-career RemoteTech games generally looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Low, reliable near-Kerbin network\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Interplanetary relay in very high Kerbin orbit, as described above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each explored planet gets a single high relay of its own, like Kerbin (that\u0027s usually the first thing I put in place)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design of a high relay satellite is typically to be festooned with lots of antennas of varying ranges. My network is typically a star formation (with Kerbin as the central node), but l also add some cross-links (e.g. Moho and Eve connect directly to each other), so that if the sun ever occludes Kerbin, the network will automatically switch to a roundabout path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guiding philosophy is, don\u0027t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
