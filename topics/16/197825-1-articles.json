I put a rover on Duna after extensively testing it on Kerbin but something is off. When I start accelerating I tip to the left. I have pictures but they are subtle so you might have to squint. Here is my rover at rest:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RvNOFxs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002268.75\u0022 height=\u0022275\u0022 width=\u0022400\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RvNOFxs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I push forward this is what happens. The wheels spin as expected, then the springs extend on the right side and contract on the left side, causing the right side to start tipping off the ground:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022h3cOOYV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002257.00\u0022 height=\u0022228\u0022 width=\u0022400\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/h3cOOYV.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I try to reverse the opposite happens. The left side extends and the right side contracts causing the left side to tip upwards:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002275Fo5mZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.50\u0022 height=\u0022250\u0022 width=\u0022400\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/75Fo5mZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of this I tip my rover over if I try to move even a little bit. I can\u0027t break at all because if I push hard enough to slow down then it flips.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think what happened is that my symmetry got broken when I put it on the rocket. I noticed the mirror symmetry started pairing things front and back instead of left to right . This means it may think the left side is the front and the right side is back. This would make sense because you would expect the front of the vehicle to tip down on acceleration to maintain friction. I could go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and try to fix it but I would have to revert my mission. I\u0027m wondering if there is anything I can do with wheel settings to fix it or if I\u0027m just out of luck and have to restart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-31T00:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, it\u0027s probably not the symmetry, it\u0027s almost certainly a reaction wheel somewhere on the craft generating torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the default setting, the reaction wheels and the rover wheels use the same keys.

I think you are right about the reaction wheel but it is also a symmetry issue, or rather a directional issue. Because I rotated the rover while placing it in the rocket, it thinks the left side of the rover is the front of the craft. As a result, when I push forward, the reaction wheels tilt it left instead of forward. I rotated it back to fix the orientation and did a test run on Kerbin. It worked normally. In the proper orientation there shouldn\u0027t be any issue with a little tilt from the reaction wheels, since it may actually help a bit with balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wobbly Av8r","CreatedById":206697,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-31T03:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure it will help, but under the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E menu item [for the Probodobodyn Rovemate, if that is what you used, just above] \u0022Control from here\u0022 there should be a few options to change orientation of the probe - maybe you can utilize that?
