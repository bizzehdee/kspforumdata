If AN/DN are 90 degrees, it means you\u0027re going perpendicular to the correct direction -- For example if I said \u0022Go North!\u0022 and you started going East, you\u0027d be 90 degrees off. 180 degrees off means you\u0027re going in the opposite direction.

If the inclination value is between 0 and 89 degrees that orbit is counterclockwise when seen from the top. This is the normal orbit players will usually use and is commonly called a prograde orbit. If the inclination is between 91 and 180 degrees, the orbit will be clockwise when seen from the top. This is usually called a retrograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you look it the orbit in the map view, there are small beads of light moving around.
