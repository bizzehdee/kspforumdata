This can happen if you\u0027re launching things that a really lightweight with a really powerful engine. The engine wants to detach and go it\u0027s own way. It also depends on what you have this mainstall attached to. If you have an orange fuel tank with a 1440 grey fuel tank on the bottom and then attach the mainstall to that, it shouldn\u0027t shake. You can also try using struts to strap the tanks to each other to prevent separation. If you have multiple mainstall engines on a craft, you want to strut the tanks that they\u0027re attached to together at the bottom and top of the tanks to prevent vibrations or movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be helpful to see a picture of your craft that way people can suggest solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T02:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou could also get the Kerbal Joint Reinforcement plugin (on my phone or I would have a link) it will help with wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T03:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBracing is needed to hold things together.
