Will it be a simple case of finding the docking port attached to the orange tank and rotating that or will I need to rotate the port, the tank and everything else with it?\u00A0It needs to be aligned perfectly, for reasons..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S just in case the insert media link didn\u0027t work...\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/kuQLH5j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/kuQLH5j\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T17:19:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MR L A\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T17:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\npossible yes. recommended ... \u00A0no.Editing the persistences file like that is difficult\u00A0and black magic. you will need to find the port, adjust it\u0027s rotation. from there you will most likely need to adjust the position of every radially attached part, and so on down the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy suggestions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. undock and try again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. hyperedit up the assembled pair from the vba/sph\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. investigate some of the docking assist mods that will end up being suggested below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR L A","CreatedById":150940,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T18:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222569226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462728920\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277368\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steuben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n43 minutes ago, steuben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npossible yes. recommended ... \u00A0no.Editing the persistences file like that is difficult\u00A0and black magic. you will need to find the port, adjust it\u0027s rotation. from there you will most likely need to adjust the position of every radially attached part, and so on down the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmy suggestions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. undock and try again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. hyperedit up the assembled pair from the vba/sph\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. investigate some of the docking assist mods that will end up being suggested below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately undocking and trying again is out of the question (the rcs units tugs are gone).
