The idea is to shave time off the transfer (and depart a good ~80-100 days before the planets are \u0022ideally\u0022 aligned)\u00A0by spending a lot more delta-v than would be \u0022optimal\u0022. I\u0027m about to unlock the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter and build out a Mun mining base with Extraplanetary Launchpads, so my thinking is \u0022fuel is cheaper than time\u0022. (I don\u0027t want to time-warp through the long coast because I\u0027ve got lots of contracts and station stuff to keep me busy in the meantime back in the Kerbin system.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built a ship with about 5300 m/s of delta-v, and have been doing dry runs of the mission in a sandbox save. Figuring I could use aerocapture to avoid the most expensive part of the trip (the braking burn at Duna periapsis to get into orbit), I put almost all of the delta-v (5000 m/s) into the ejection burn from Kerbin and used the rest to fine-tune my approach, getting a ~13km Duna periapsis on the flyby, which I\u0027ve read should be enough to aerocapture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, my best-laid plans were shattered when I actually hit the atmosphere and my entire ship burned up almost instantly. :-) In retrospect this shouldn\u0027t have been a surprise, since the navball told me my orbital speed was well over 8000 m/s when I hit the atmosphere. (Yeah, this was probably a terrible idea.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tweaked the design and practiced a few more aerocaptures. I found that if I use the engines to brake down to an orbital speed of 2600 m/s when I hit the atmosphere, my design can survive (even without any heatshields). But that needed a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of delta-v, and the rocket was getting ridiculously huge; I wanted to do better. So I slapped one of the big 10m (stock)\u00A0inflatable heatshields on the bottom of my lander and tried again. However, it still burned up almost instantly. It\u0027s like the heatshield wasn\u0027t even there. :-( (In fairness, some non-critical bits of the lander were\u00A0clipping through the bottom of the heatshield, but if that were the only problem, I\u0027d expect everything behind the heatshield to survive.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I missing here? I was sure the heatshield would solve the problem, because I\u0027ve seen a Scott Manley video where he was playing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and aerobraked at\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E10 km/s\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on Earth coming back from a lunar free-return; surely 8 km/s at Duna should be easier???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks. :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-19T23:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve never tried such an aggressive aerocapture myself but 8 Km/s does seem to be way too fast, and a periapsis of 13 Km seems too steep as well.

This actually seemed promising...for about 10 seconds. :-) It lasted that much longer than the one with the inflatable, which was pretty good considering the inflatable burned up within 5 seconds of passing through the 50km atmosphere line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Instead of the big awkward lander I\u0027d designed, a simple craft consisting of a Mk1 command pod with a parachute on top and a 1.25m ablative heat shield on the bottom. This did about as well as test #1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Same as #2, but with the 2.5m heat shield. Seemed to be about the same; it might have lasted a little longer but I\u0027m not sure. In any case, the result was the same (boom).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Same as #3, but with 3.75m heat shield. Didn\u0027t seem to improve over #3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Repeats of #4 and #2, but with the periapsis bumped up as far as I could take it and still get captured (according to the Trajectories mod\u0027s prediction for a retrograde reentry). With the 3.75m heat shield, I was able to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E up to about 23-24 km (versus the 13-16 km in the previous tests); it seemed to last a few seconds longer but still ultimately went boom. The 1.25m heat shield version had the opposite effect: I had to go with a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elower\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to ensure aerocapture, because there\u0027s less blunt surface slamming into the atmosphere to slow me down. This, of course, exploded about instantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I observed through all the tests is that the heat shields actually did a great job insulating the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Erest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the craft from heat - there were no temperature bars\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for the heat shields themselves (at least until they blew up :-)). The \u0022only\u0022 real problem was that they were simply absorbing heat much faster than they were rejecting it. I noticed that the \u0022Thermal\u0022 tab on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s Flight Engineer shows \u0022Convection Flux\u0022 and \u0022Radiative Flux\u0022 readouts - for the best of these tests, the\u00A0radiative flux (which I\u0027m guessing is how fast the spacecraft is rejecting heat, since it was negative) was only half the magnitude of the convection flux (this was positive, guessing it\u0027s the rate at which I\u0027m being cooked by the superheated plasma in front of me). If these numbers mean what I think they mean, then the problem is clear:\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ethese heat shields simply don\u0027t reject heat fast enough to offset the heat that\u0027s being pumped into them.\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0Regardless of how small or lightweight the craft is, it just isn\u0027t enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you noted, the same speed was survivable at Kerbin, but higher (relatively speaking) in the atmosphere. If I could pass through Duna\u0027s atmosphere less steeply, I could probably survive there too. However, I would then not get enough aerobraking to slow me down from escape velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is the real difference between the Kerbin-free-return and Duna-aerocapture situations: for Duna aerocapture, it\u0027s critical to get rid of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that excess velocity\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eright away\u003C/em\u003E, because you\u0027ve only got one shot at it. Whereas for just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elowering\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0an orbit, it\u0027s acceptable (assuming life support considerations don\u0027t prevent this :-)) to be patient and make multiple, gentler aerobraking passes. Indeed, even if you set the Kerbin periapsis low enough to come all the way down on a single pass, that one pass gives you a lot more time in the atmosphere to slowly shed velocity, since your trajectory is far less eccentric (i.e., you \u0022hug\u0022 the planet more closely), and is becoming rapidly less so as you lose velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps even a Kerbin\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eaerocapture\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(coming in from escape velocity) would be easier to pull off than Duna\u0027s, at the same velocity, since the gravity well is deeper and thus escape velocity is lower, i.e. you don\u0027t need to shed as much velocity on that one pass (and thus can use a higher periapsis). Kerbin\u0027s escape velocity (3431.03 m/s) is a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0higher than Duna\u0027s (1372.41 m/s).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh well...guess I\u0027ll just have to use fuel to brake. Or do a less ludicrously fast transfer. :-) Maybe I\u0027ll try an aggressive aerocapture on the return trip to Kerbin! (Or save it for Jool or Eve - they\u0027re a lot easier to get captured by.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T07:56:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProviding some data for \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/134040-a_name/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022134040\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/134040-a_name/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@A_name\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s answer...
