I just does not seem fair. I have a fuel cell and a rover body and both generate drag.

I\u0027m pretty sure the bays DO work on surface-attached objects, as long as the center of the object is inside the bay. The \u0022center\u0022 is not necessarily the visual center, so try tucking it in farther, or flipping it around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luz.tolentino1126","CreatedById":223889,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-22T01:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10pt;\u0022\u003EI think it creates drag just because of its mere nature.
