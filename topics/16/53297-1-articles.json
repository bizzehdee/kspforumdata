It just seems unusual. When I activate my aerospikes and click on them, this rocket roars into the sky and hits terminal velocity fast.

Aerospikes are different, they don\u0027t use air intake, they\u0027re liquid fuel oxidizer. I\u0027ve used air lifters on a lot of small designs but the best option is asparagus, either regular or with drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an air lifter that shows you what it takes to lifter something else. This is a extremely light payload with an orbital engine/transfer stage in the middle. Take this as a reference on how many jet engines you need to lift a payload. Also, you\u0027re using way too much fuel for the max height of the engines. The maximum fuel you\u0027ll need is in the small fuel tank that has 45 liquid fuel oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/902138605368513635/245AE4BE8A99CC0A34DEAE5C53BE185998B2DB03/\u0022 alt=\u0022245AE4BE8A99CC0A34DEAE5C53BE185998B2DB03\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what it takes to lift a heavy payload, note that these are the different jet engines and there\u0027s a lot of them.
