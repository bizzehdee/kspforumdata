On top of this is a decoupler that connects to my LM. This has a mechjeb on it so i can take control of it after it has been jettisoned. However th LM also contains a decoupler to allow me to disconnect the ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that when i disengage the LM from the service module the decoupler on the LM gets activated as well since it is no longer part of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried switching the command pod to the LM but then i had the same problem with the decoupler between the SM and CM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if there is any way to decouple a section that itself countains decouplers without these decouplers activating?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky Visitor","CreatedById":32304,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T02:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you move the decoupler on the jettisoned part up the list, does it still happen?
