Every single time I\u0027ve done it, I\u0027ve blasted them away from their ship and lost them in space with no hope of maneuvering them back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a trick to keeping them under control and getting them to move slowly and carefully where I want them to go? I even tried it with KAS. I stuck ladders all over the ship so I could walk my kerbonaut down to the winch and attach the connector to him. So far so good. But when I tried to use the jetpack to fly him slowly over to the target ship 5 meters away, I lost control completely and had to use the winch to reel him in. I just can\u0027t keep them oriented correctly or anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike so many other things with this game, it seems impossible until I figure it out, and then I wonder why I thought it was so difficult in the first place. But can anybody help me get to that point with my poor guys on EVA?

R is to toggle their RCS packs on and off, WASD is to move them forward, left, back, or right, respectively, SHIFT is to move up, CTRL to move down. Be sure they have their packs on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T16:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGah, I hate to be the first one to say it but you are right. Practice does make perfect. For me, I got used to the eva by firing up the jetpacks and just learning to move up, down, right, left.. etc. Just one direction at a time. And as I\u0027m sure you have noticed a little jetpack can go a looooong way. Small moves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T16:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETip number one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EW always makes the kerbals move away from the camera.

Because of the low gravity you can actually fly pritty easy over the surface (you can also on the Mun, but the gravity is higher so you get pulled back harder).
