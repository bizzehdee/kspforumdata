A 0 degree ascending/descending node is orbiting on the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T17:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you click on your orbit, you can create a maneuver. The gizmo that appears consists of 6 icons, placed along 3 axes. You can also grab the center of the gizmo to move your maneuver node around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow icons are the prograde (circle) and retrograde (crossed circle) axis, which is the direction of your current velocity vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blue icons are the radial in and out axis, which is the normal of your velocity vector, contained in your orbital plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe purple icons are the normal \u002B and - axis, which is the product of the previous two vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you select a target, the ascending and descending nodes will appear: these are the points in your orbit where the orbital planes cross. If you burn along normal\u002B at the descending node (and vice-versa) you will align the 2 planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the radial axis, it will alter the general shape of your orbit, while the velocity vector will tend to affect the opposite side of your orbit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso try to look for tutorials on youtube, you will probably get a better explanation than words can give.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IsaacHeron","CreatedById":57174,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T17:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Maneuver_node\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BaneOfPilots","CreatedById":61884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T17:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I think I get it now.
