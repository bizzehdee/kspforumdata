Say you escape Kerbin into a slightly eccentric orbit in the vicinity of Kerbin\u0027s, so that about a year later you intercept Kerbin. When you do, you come in under the south pole or over the north pole so Kerbin gives you as much plane change as possible. You might have to do this several times, meaning small burns to get the intercepts, and you\u0027d probably have to burn some to keep your Ap and Pe in the right general area, but if you don\u0027t mind waiting a few years you might could get the desired orbit cheaper this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T12:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a Kerbol-Polar orbit, you would need to exit Kerbins SOI at a velocity of 9284.5*sqrt(2) m/s (=13130 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the scenario that you burn in a 100km LKO (and assuming that you have the correct inclination and ejection angle) you will need a LKO velocity according to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVis-Viva equation\u003C/a\u003E of 13505,9 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the usual LKO velocity of 2250 m/s you have to burn about 11260 m/s in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared with a 13130 m/s burn outside of Kerbins SOI you get away with around 1900 less dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T12:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@mhoram : So I should even start burnig inward as if I was going to Eve, because I\u0027ll need to cancel my (Kerbol prograde) velocity ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T12:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mhoram\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mhoram\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBased on the usual LKO velocity of 2250 m/s you have to burn about 11260 m/s in LKO.\u003Cp\u003ECompared with a 13130 m/s burn outside of Kerbins SOI you get away with around 1900 less dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you can do better than that with gravity assists.
