He\u0027s in ragdoll mode apparently after slipping/falling off a radial tank and getting stuck against the core. He won\u0027t move, and won\u0027t use RCS. He just won\u0027t move. The lander doesn\u0027t have a probe core so I can\u0027t move it while Bob is on EVA to shake him loose. He should have lots of life support but power will run out on him first. He\u0027s on suit power so it doesn\u0027t even matter that I haven\u0027t researched solar panels yet. The only thing I can think of is sending up a rescue mission to try and knock him loose, his power ought to last long enough. I restarted KSP and that didn\u0027t work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other ideas for freeing him?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Here\u0027s a pic of his predicament:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GPvMy8q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GPvMy8q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-04T15:45:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2014 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T02:44:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok download hyper edit ONCE and choose him- ship lander- set to current- land/drop ONCE\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

Kerbals have 12 hrs of life support on their own, so 5x should do it. Since Physics isn\u0027t calculated during Time Warp he should just fall through your tank.

Time warp didn\u0027t work so I edited the persistence file by truncating the lat and long to the hundredth decimal place which moved him about 100m clear of the lander, where he fell and landed and was able to move!
