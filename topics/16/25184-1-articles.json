Circularising and interplanetary transfer are both low TWR manoeuvres so you should use the same set of LV-N engine for them.

But seriously, that\u0027s good advice, it seems to me like you are missing out on a lot of central space in your design. The most stable place to put an engine is in the centre, as you won\u0027t have to worry about structural failures* and flipping out of control if an engine breaks off on the other side. I would suggest putting a fuel tank below your lander\u0027s engine and putting the LV-Ns radially off that.
