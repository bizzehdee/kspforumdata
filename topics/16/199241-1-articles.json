Before, you could just select them from your Kerbal\u0027s backpack, \u0026amp; then click the arrow to set them down, \u0026amp; they would turn on. I just tried that now with a solar panel (had an engineer pop it down) but it doesnt open or turn on? Same if I try to get my scientist to put down a control station (but obviously that doesnt want to work because the power isnt coming on.....)
