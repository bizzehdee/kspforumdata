My mod list isn\u0027t all that long - MechJeb, Proc. fairings, Kerbal Alarm Clock \u0026amp; KIS/KAS so there\u0027s not a huge amount to trim there! I had this issue a while back (pre .90) with just proc fairings and mechjeb installed. Building and Testing an 8 module station without Mechjeb is going to be a PITA. Anyone know if this bug also occurs in pure stock before I sink too much time into this?
