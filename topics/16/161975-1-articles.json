My guess is that you were playing your previous game with commnet turned off, and the new game defaulted to have it turned on. So, I would recommend going into Settings/Difficulty Options, and click the button to disable the \u0022Comm Network\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the Debug menu goes -- no, it\u0027s still there, right where it was. Alt-F12 on Windows, and Mod-F12 on linux (is that R-Shift?). But there are some companion apps that run on those systems that can eat those keystrokes and not pass them through to KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Human Person","CreatedById":174876,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T07:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Alt\u002BF12\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: You obviously misst the 1.2 update.
