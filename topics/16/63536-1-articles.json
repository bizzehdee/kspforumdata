If the part doesn\u0027t have an interior yet, then you get no portrait. In such cases, you do as Claw said and left-click on the part\u0027s hatch, which will bring up a pop-up menus showing which Kerbals are inside, and you can select the name off that for the guy you want to EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, I think the new Mobile Lab is the only stock part currently without an interior. It\u0027ll get one soon I\u0027m sure. The Hitchhiker can only got an interior in 0.21 or 0.22 I think. There are also quite a few mod parts without interiors. The main issue with such parts is forgetting where you put the Kerbals and having to knock on many doors until you find them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T02:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you could use the Crew Manifest Mod to move kerbals around in a ship or station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meatballcannon","CreatedById":57514,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T04:52:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor an unknown reason, I cannot get the left-click menu to appear.
