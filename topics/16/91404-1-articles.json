I want to do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially create a plane (ex. 747) And be able to attach a smaller more nimble plane to the top or bottom. Top would be easier though due to ground clearance with low gear. Why? Well I can make a space plane. However it usually does not have a whole lot of fuel left afterwards. Not enough to carry its cargo to its destination. What I am trying to do is use this large (747) to carry this small craft into the higher parts of the atmosphere. (30-35km) at which point it would detach and fire into orbit on its own fuel at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother concern I have is... I don\u0027t want to loose both planes.

I could use stage recovery but that wouldn\u0027t work well as it wouldn\u0027t give me a 100% refund because it would be many kilometers away from the KSC when if I were to pilot it, it could fly back to the runway and get a 100% return value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newnard","CreatedById":89168,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T18:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no advice for the construction half of the question, as I\u0027m bad at spaceplanes in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the recovery of both parts to work, you need to fly a steep enough trajectory to put BOTH vehicles above the atmosphere long enough that you can circularize the smaller one\u0027s orbit, then switch back to controlling the bigger one before it re-enters the atmosphere to guide it down.

You do need to master twin-boom lifter design first, of course. Dropping the inert payload is easy, as long as it has less wing-lift than your carrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img12.nnm.me/6/f/b/9/4/c13d513117886d79fe3656b7355.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c13d513117886d79fe3656b7355.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, i prefer the x37-on-AtlasV approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple tech, symmetrical load, neatly packaged in a payload shroud.

As your lifter is likely jet-powered, it has the fuel efficiency to manage this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe x15-under-wing approach works fine, but only if the carrier outmasses the payload by MANY to one. Otherwise you end up with some gnarly off-balance torques.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the orbital vehicle is small enough, you could try the Pegasus-under-TriStar approach.
