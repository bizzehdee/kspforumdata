Like many bodies, Earth\u0027s orbit is very close to the standard along the plane of the ecliptic. This is the plane along which most of the junk in the solar system orbits, and most of it in the same direction around the sun. This plane of our solar system also is very close to the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. Many solar systems are likewise not very inclined, while some are more inclined than others. You can see this effect on a smaller scale with the rings of Saturn, pretty strongly inclined with respect to the rest of the solar system and the Milky Way, but all those ice bits orbit along one flat plane, right along Saturn\u0027s rotational equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s what causes everything to line up so nicely: rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T18:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd that\u0027s what causes everything to line up so nicely: rotation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, more precisely it\u0027s that if you have a lot of dust particles in \u0022random\u0022 orbits, then over time they\u0027ll bump into each other and gradually average out into a nice, clean plane orbiting in the same direction.

The sun rotates and has poles, so the 0 inclination plane can be set at the sun\u0027s equator (where the solar surface travels fastest) or perpendicular to the poles.
