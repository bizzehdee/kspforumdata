I actually launched it and have it in high orbit. I did dock a vessel to the top of the station, but I cannot get the refueling to work. I can Alt-Right click two canisters next to each other on the outer ring to move fuel in and out, but I can\u0027t get fuel down to the little fuel bubbles that are on the bottom near the docking ports. I also couldn\u0027t get fuel to the poodle engine on the bottom to do some orbital fine tuning. I double checked that every component on the station allows for a fuel crossfeed (the girder struts, the fuselage in the center, and the observation pods. I\u0027m not sure why I can\u0027t get fuel down there to the engine nor to the docking port at the top of the station. I\u0027m sure I can dock to the sides and refuel, but haven\u0027t gotten that far yet. Any thoughts??

Structural tanks don\u0027t carry fuel at all. The radial RCS monopropellant tanks shouldn\u0027t need any fuel crossfeed, it doesn\u0027t matter where they are on the ship they can transfer monoprop. However like the structural tanks, they don\u0027t carry rocket fuel either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the Cupola module fuel-crossfed. Try attaching the engine directly to a fuel tank, or connecting a fuel pipe from a tank to the engine directly. Although there is literally no point for that cupola pod: it is incredibly heavy, it is pointed the wrong way -- the windows are blocked by structural tanks and garbage, and it is yet another part which slows down the physics calculations. But judging from the insane amount of useless parts on your ship I\u0027m sure your computer must be monstrous and you aren\u0027t really worried about high part counts...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T00:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo half reply to the previous post, I think the goal of this refuelling station was the looks, not the efficiency.

Well like said earlier, those \u0022bubbles\u0022 are RCS fuel tanks. And the cupola module does allow crossfeed. Your problem might be that you created a fuel flow loop up there with all the fuel lines and the game doesn\u0027t like it. It\u0027s probably your problem, you should keep the sections independant one of each other and make them only connect via the center module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T07:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think RCS tanks give functionality to fuel lines.
