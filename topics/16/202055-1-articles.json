The core module is made up of 4 science modules, and a structural space station creator thingy, with cupola module and 2 storage containers. It is encased in a large 3.75m payload, but when I launch, at around 6000m, it starts wobbling and the spacecraft tips over. The rocket is 57m tall (roughly) but I have made bigger rockets that don\u0027t wobble. It seems that the Space station\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einside\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethe payload it causing it to tip over as it tilts, even when I have secured it with structural space tape.
