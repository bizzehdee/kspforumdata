Great way to start.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Yeah, like others have already said, 10,000 metres is pretty much it for Juno\u0027s, Weasley\u0027s, and Goliaths. You may be able to squeak it to 12,000 metres, but the plane\u0027s design and balance has to be dead perfect. Also it will take a long time to sneak up from 9500 to 12,000. 5 to 10 m/s vertical velocity. Up in the thin air wings are your friend, and do your best to get your velocity up as high as possible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) The engines may not flame out, but they will produce so little thrust that they might as well be off. The sweet spot for these engines seems to be between 5000 and 8000 metres.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Yeah, I have to agree with Nich on the LFO engine. It will definitely help getting your plane up to ideal velocity at higher altitudes, and if you get going fast enough the engines may get a small boost in thrust. You don\u0027t need big LFO engines, but a pair of tiny ones will do the trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-15T01:27:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2016 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GDJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-15T19:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy best effort was about Mach 1.3 at 12km on 10 (!)
