Naturally, I did both the prograde and normal components at the same time to get that \u0022Pythagorean\u0022 savings. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, after the first pass, much to my chagrin, I realized I had done the WRONG\u00A0normal direction, so my orbit was now inclined further in the wrong direction, and would seemingly require a huge burn to fix. \u00A0I had just quicksaved, so I\u00A0despaired having to load a much earlier save. \u00A0But then I thought I might as well check how much the plane change would cost at the Mun-ish apoaspis in between my periapsis kicks. \u00A0And it was VERY cheap, as such burns tend to be very far out. \u00A0Like 80-something m/s to flip my inclination in the opposite direction -- i.e., to get twice as much plane change as I did in my first periapsis kick. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looked like the apoapsis burn was so cheap, it came out of ahead of doing the plane change burn at my Kerbin periapsis, even after factoring in the Pythagorean discount on the latter. \u00A0So this got me\u00A0thinking: should I ONLY do the plane change this way?\u00A0 That is, do a pure prograde burn out to the Mun-level or so (any further and I really don\u0027t like the delay before your second pass), then do ALL of the necessary plane changing, then do a final all-prograde burn to finish your ejection. \u00A0It seems like, in addition to being cheaper, this shortens the further splits up your primary\u00A0burns, which is good if you have a low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and/or are using ions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone do it this way? \u00A0Am I missing something that makes it less effective? \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo other side notes: First, you could probably save further by launching into an inclined orbit. \u00A0But for some reason, I never bother to do this, due to the hassle of figuring out when you need to launch and how much to tilt your orbit. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, when I was doing the maneuver at apoapsis, the normal burn pushed out my periapsis a but further from Kerbin. \u00A0It appeared to be worth it to include a bit of retrograde in the plane change burn, to get that peri back to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and maximize Oberth for the final ejection burn. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-01T21:42:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2017 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T07:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re probably right about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, is it worth the hassle in most cases?

If you need to burn for 10 minutes, then a lot of that 10 minutes is going to be significantly off prograde, and you don\u0027t have the option of going round again once your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is in interplanetary space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T07:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOberth does not help plane changes at all.
