I see that the Kickback SFB isn\u0027t there anymore and hasn\u0027t been autorecovered either, *it just vanished*. And I can\u0027t exactly keep my camera on the jettison while I am flying a rocket.\n\nI want to recover the SFB, like it says I am supposed to do.\n\nWhat do I need to do to make jettisoned parts not automatically vanish? The kickback is too expensive to just go to waste."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:13:05Z","Content":"Use a mod like Stage Recovery.
