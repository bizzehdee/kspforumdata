A direct landing will cause you to suffer gravity\u0027s effects every step of the way while an orbital landing will cause you to use deltaV to cancel out horizontal velocity. \n\nI have hundreds of hours in this game and I still have these relatively simple questions. I believe that the answer is somewhere in the middle, as eliminating horizontal deltaV is unique to landings and not ascents. \n\nAny explanations/experiences would really be appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"laythelover17","CreatedById":130302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:38:54Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure that for saving delta V you would want to go with orbiting but the more direct approach would be effective too. as it would mean less time to get there and land. However I do think that the landing would be harder to estimate but it would be easier to land when orbiting as you can go down as gently as you want. so I would say that if you have a lot of thrust and Delta V then go direct but if you have very little thrust/Delta V then go with orbiting."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T18:39:54Z","Content":"You mean how efficient it is to perform direct drcents as apposed to entering into orbit first? I\u0027d say it\u0027s just a tad more Dv needed for a direct descent. Unless you position your pe real low and burn just a few thousand meters above the surface I imagine it might be around the same. \n\nI do know that it\u0027s been done in real life with the first us probes to the moon.

It\u0027s very difficult to take off at just the right time so that your ejection angle will end up taking you where you want to go. It\u0027s much simpler to create an orbit and then set up your timing for your ejection from there.\n\nNonetheless, the opposite of the process described above would be the most efficient landing on an airless body. You would adjust your trajectory from your original ejection such that you have an extemely low periapsis. Very close to the surface while still clearing terrain.\n\nYou would then \u0027suicide burn\u0027 at the appropriate moment (near your periapsis) such that you are just above the surface as you finish removing all your horizontal velocity.\n\nOnce again, it is almost universal practice to circularize first for several reasons. Not least of these is that orbit is a stable situation, whereas a hyperbolic trajectory is not, requiring you to finish the landing before you can turn your attention elsewhere.\n\nStarting from low orbit will allow you to start with much lower relative velocity and you won\u0027t have as long a burn required for landing.\n\nStarting from orbit allows you a choice of landing sites.\n\ntl;dr Mathematically it\u0027s more efficient not to circularize, but in practice circularization before landing is the way to go.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:38:17Z","Content":"It\u0027s normally optimal to circularize and come in as low as possible to land, as you\u0027re working with gravity, not fighting against it. \n\nIf you come into the Muns sphere of influence in a collision course, approximately 2Mm away, traveling at 300 m/s - you will have gravity pulling on you the entire 2 million meters, leading to a massive sustained suicide burn in the end. I think I saw in some thread recently that someone calculated this to around 2,700 m/s of dV - and that doesn\u0027t sound too far off the mark (though I haven\u0027t done the calculations myself). \n\nAlternatively, you could come into a high orbit at low speed, circularize for 50-100 dV, transfer to a very low orbit for 100 dV, then suicide from that orbit with around 550-600 dV. Quite a bit of savings."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T17:53:49Z","Content":"Details below, but the TL;DR version is: on an airless world,\n\n- The theoretical best is to come in almost horizontally (so that periapsis just barely kisses the surface) and then suicide burn to land.\n\n- However, in practice, a more useful option is typically to come in with a very-very-low periapisis that doesn\u0027t quite touch the ground, circularize into the lowest possible circular orbit, then to land do a light retro burn followed by suicide burn to the surface. It costs a teeny bit more dV to do this than the theoretical optimum, but the difference is quite small, and in return you get a lot more flexibility in choosing landing site.\n\nThat\u0027s the \u0022what\u0022; the \u0022why\u0022 is a bit more lengthy, details below.\n\nThe main principle for dealing with an airless body (whether you\u0027re landing or taking off):\n\n1. Do as much of your burn at as low an altitude as possible.\n\n2. Always burn prograde only.\n\n3. Burning horizontally at low altitude is better than burning vertically.\n\n#1 is due to Oberth effect.\n\n#2 is to avoid cosine losses; it provides for the most efficient conversion of thrust to kinetic energy.\n\n#3 is due both to Oberth effect and to minimize gravity losses. If you\u0027re burning horizontally, it means you can do a long burn while still at low altitude (thus maximizing Oberth effect); it also means that your burn is mostly at right angles to gravity rather than fighting directly against it, so you minimize gravity losses.\n\n#1 and #2 apply equally to all rocket designs regardless of TWR. #3 becomes less relevant as TWR increases; the higher the TWR, the less of a difference it makes.\n\n#1 and #2 simply say that a suicide burn is the best way to land; they don\u0027t make a lot of difference for vertical-versus-horizontal trajectory on land, or should-I-circularize-or-not.\n\n#3 is where the difference comes in. For sizable bodies with significant orbital/escape velocities, a burn will typically take at least a few dozen seconds unless you have a freakishly high TWR.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T18:32:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:22:34Z","Content":"I can\u0027t believe that this has been going for two pages without one of the elders chiming in.... what you are looking for is called a\n\n***constant altitude landing***(at least in the KSP world)\n\nAnd the OP is right, this has been investigated to death several times over.\n\nThere\u0027s a nice demo video from Kosmo-not, here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBa4c-YA3g8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nData tables: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39812-Landing-and-Takeoff-Delta-V-vs-TWR-and-specific-impulse](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39812-Landing-and-Takeoff-Delta-V-vs-TWR-and-specific-impulse)\n\nAs a rule of thumb: plotting a collision course, then suicide burn is acceptable if you have a very high TWR.
