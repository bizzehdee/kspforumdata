The burn was done. I engaged time warp and kaboom!! No more probe. Flight results is telling me it was due to overheating. I don t understand. That engine is ridiculously not powerful. It worked very well and got me through the whole joolian system doing much bigger burn at full throttle. And then this. Can t really say I got too close to the sun as I was orbiting Pol.\n\nIn the list it shows a xenon tank or landing strut in first position for the explosion. \n\n![KSP_OverheatingBug.jpg](http://www.lacroixdidier.com/temp/KSP_OverheatingBug.jpg)\n\nWould this be a bug related to time warp?"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T14:08:43Z","Content":"It looks like your entire probe exploded, even some fairly heat tolerant parts.

That s what it looked like indeed. Are those creatures only active when time warp is on or they can do their evil stuff even without time acceleration?"}]}
