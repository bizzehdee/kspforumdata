That 150m/s would also take you out of the atmosphere within 5 minutes or so, while milking the jets even further can easily take another 20 minutes -- most of that not for the milking per se, but because even after you\u0027re done, the shallow ascent takes about half an orbit until you finally leave the atmosphere and can timewarp. A case could be made that in this example, the extra rocket thrust would be fuel well spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, you can and should start working on circularization while you\u0027re still at an altitude where the jets work well -- that what all this \u0022getting speed\u0022 stuff really is about, after all. Then again, it\u0027s a diminishing returns thing -- Compared to the first 100km of periapsis altitude, the last 100km require a lot more patience and save a lot less fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo unless you\u0027re doing a challenge, the question of when to ignite the rockets (\u0022let\u0027s get this over with\u0022) can to a large part be decided by taste. But if you\u0027re using the jets for the sole purpose of getting to space, you\u0027re doing it wrong: Just compare the delta-V requirements of a rocket that can take you \u0022to space\u0022 with that of a rocket that will put you in a proper orbit.
