I tried my usual 15-20 degree ascent, couldn\u0026#39;t get past 3000m. Then tried the 5 degree ascent everybody else uses, still had a max speed of about 250m/s. Even when i dived to gain speed, the max i got was maybe 300m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes, i know i\u0026#39;m using a panther, but i did the math and it should have a thrust to weight ratio of about 0.7. Considering that people have made functioning sstos in the past with less than 0.4 twr, i find this especially strange. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was eventually able to break the sound barrier, but it took a stupidly large twr (over 2). But that added so much more engine weight that i couldn\u0026#39;t get to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, what gives?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T23:12:01Z","Content":"\nAre you using the afterburner ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nSubsonic jet engines (Juno, Wheelsey, Goliath, and Panther w/o afterburner) will lose all their thrust when approaching transsonic speeds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven if you use engines designed for supersonic speeds (Rapier, Panther w/ afterburner and Whiplash), there is a very strong augmentation of drag when approaching the speed of sound (see [URL=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_drag\u0022]wave drag[/URL], I think this is the actual phenomenon).

You want the nose pointed exactly prograde around Mach 1, not above it. This gives you the smallest, cleanest profile and allows you to cut through the sound barrier.
