Probably balancing an extremely long and light payload on the top isn\u0027t helping either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe usual approach to making your craft aerodynamically more stable is to either keep your center of mass up by having a heavy upper stage that you your first stage will carry to around 20-30km or by adding more surface area on the bottom of your rocket in the form of fins or by doing both. I\u0027d always advise against asparagus staging for beginners because like in this case it usually makes everything just unstable. If your payload isn\u0027t too light and long a simple solution with two liquid stages on top of each other will get you reliably to LKO. Use SRBs only to support a first stage that carries too much fuel to clear the pad on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-06T07:44:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2016 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Harry Rhodan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T08:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a _lot_ of fuel and engines you\u0027re taking up - what sort of solar array are you building? \u00A0I put a pretty bigone up (A docking port with attached pylon holding, I think, 6 or 8\u00A0gigantor arrays \u002B batteries) last year, and did it by sandwiching it\u00A0in-between two heavy lift stages, rather than having the payload at the top\u00A0- it was fiddly to build (the symmetry)\u00A0but flew fine and worked well to limit the scale of CoM changes that took place during the launch phase. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looked gorgeous with two of them attached to my station, but was complete overkill - really didn\u0027t need that much power at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWemb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_Danger","CreatedById":159757,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T16:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPressing the F12 key while in flight will show the drag and lift forces affecting your craft.
