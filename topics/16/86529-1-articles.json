Too little funds mean you loose money to do some part contracts (test separators in flight, meaning that you\u0027ll loose them, and get paid less than the part\u0027s cost) and too little science means going to the Mun without a ladder.

Hadn\u0027t occurred to me to wreck the joint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole campaign paradigm is bad as is. Hopefully the specifics are all placeholders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I was thinking the \u0022strategies\u0022 stuff was going to be grossly different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strategies should really be the type of space program you are running. It can be \u0022sliders\u0022 so obviously \u0022gray,\u0022 but in broad categories the choice at the start of a campaign should be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENational Space Program (i.e.: NASA or ESA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gets a budget, with the possibility of some launch contracts (add some prebuilt satellites or something to place into orbit (or even probes to be places with escape velocity for Kerbin, or even Kerbol)). The player could set objectives within that budget. There would be things pre made like \u0022explore the Mun\u0022 but they would be renamed \u0022goals\u0022 and have an alternate reward structure. Each tech tree node could have 2 values, one for \u0022experimental\u0022 and the final to get it outright. Goals would give Experimental tech points based on the goal difficulty. You\u0027d only get a few of each though (and you still need to buy them). One of each X tech used must succeed in a mission goal (achieve orbit around the Mun, for example) or there is some failure penalty. As it is bankrolled by the government, this can have high reputation to start, perhaps (make this meaningful). Assuming we build the space center at some point, you can go aero, or astro first (VAB vs Hanger).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrivate Space Program (SpaceX)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis program could have an initial seed based upon difficulty settings (how rich Elon Kerman is, basically). This program could set goals like the National Space Program, but would get more contracts that look like the current career. Private entities want to test stuff. Unlike the current career, if there is a goal of Minmus from some private entity, whatever the goal is must include that entity\u0027s parts in some fashion. So the guys that make the lander can 2 pay, but their can is the lander, period. The startup starts with no rep, so doesn\u0027t get the kind of launch contracts KASA does until they have high rep. Some goals might be things like Mun landing just to get rep. Not fleshed out, but you get the idea, actually different programs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
