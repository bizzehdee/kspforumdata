I\u0027ve used the Convert-o-tron 125 continuously, unmanned, without serious problems. However, it is extremely slow if unmanned, and producing liquid fuel and oxidizer together isn\u0027t workable. (I forget why.) When producing a single liquid at a time, it will trickle along at about 96% efficiency. (This is with ambient temperatures of Kerbin or Minmus.) As for speed when unmanned, it takes somewhere in the region of a whole Kerbin year to fill two Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tanks. Those are the largest 2.5m tanks. When controlled by a maximum-level engineer, it took about 2 weeks if I remember right. (I can\u0027t find my notes.) I can\u0027t remember if it can produce \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002Box together when manned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA note on cooling: Radiators don\u0027t have to be physically near the part to be cooled. They do have to be attached to the part itself or the part which it is attached to. In 1.8, I found ore tanks wouldn\u0027t pass heat, but this seems to have been fixed by 1.11. For my vehicle on Minmus, 2 small radiators attached directly to the converter are quite enough. The only time the radiators heat up is if I time-warp while \u0027flying\u0027 the vehicle. That must be a bug because they don\u0027t heat up at any other time. The bug is with the radiators themselves; the drill\u0027s radiators heat up too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-16T14:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223955434\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201464\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221618578445\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211180\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eekee\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, eekee said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used the Convert-o-tron 125 continuously, unmanned, without serious problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the original question was about cooling, but I see your point.\u00A0 It is not necessary to fully cool the converter in order to use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the \u0022Thermal Efficiency\u0022 in the right-click menu actually indicates the percentage of full conversion rate.\u00A0 When the converter gets hot, and the \u0022Thermal Efficiency\u0022 goes down to 50%, the rate of electrical use is also 50%.\u00A0 \u00A0Once I discovered that I could turn off some the the radiators to slow the process and avoid the converter shutting off due to lack of electricity.\u00A0 For me, though, playing a game where I don\u0027t know the rules was more frustrating than fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
