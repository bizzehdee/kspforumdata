(I\u0027m generally not an airplane guy, but that Juno is just adorable. Couldn\u0027t resist). It was small enough that I was using the little 25-fund Basic Fins as canards and vertical stabilizers (I was using the Advanced Canard as primary wings, this thing was the tiniest craft I\u0027ve ever flown).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I did several water landings, and invariably ripped off the Basic Fins while leaving everything else intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also did some playing around with ditching an airplane (which wasn\u0027t designed as a seaplane) in the ocean and then taking off again. My design couldn\u0027t quite get out of the water, but it did get up around 100 m/s in the water without damaging itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo 95 m/s sounds doable, but could depend on your design. I expect it just needs some experimentation, just try it and see. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T17:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETop speed is pretty high now, though control turns out to become a bigger issue.
