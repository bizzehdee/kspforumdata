I tested this design on Kerbin, and it worked fine. The idea was to use the lander legs to push the docking port up to a uniform height for surface docking in the standard way. So, I designed the legs to reach down lower than the wheels as in this picture in the VAB. You can see that the feet are a good distance lower than the wheels:![jglaxg.jpg](http://oi59.tinypic.com/jglaxg.jpg)\n\nOn Kerbin this design tested fine, presumably because the weight of the craft pushed the wheels higher in relation to the legs, but on Minmus, this happened:\n\n![207ujwk.jpg](http://oi58.tinypic.com/207ujwk.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, my extended legs are now floating very far above the wheels, completely ruining the design. This won\u0027t dock with anything on the surface.\n\nThis is actually not the only problem. I\u0027m not sure why, perhaps because I designed this in the VAB instead of the SPH, the wheels on opposite sides from each other rotate opposite from each other, making it uncontrollable. (\u003C-- Not sure about this actually, might just be uneven traction on Minmus.)This confuses me because everything was fine on Kerbin. I think the problem has something to do with the fact that before landing on Minmus, I had docked to another ship to transfer some excess fuel. I think the docking somehow messed up the orientation of the wheels.\n\nIs there any way I can salvage this craft without spending my last dime on a do-over?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T22:17:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:03:29Z","Content":"If I am not mistaken, wheels in the VAB are shown with their suspension in the \u0022stowed\u0022 position.

Usually it is the pod of the ship or the command seat (with an EVA Kerbal) and may change by docking/undocking.\n\nHowever there is a manual override: You can find in the context menu of docking ports and pods an option to steer the vehicle from this part.\n\nUsually I place a dockingport or pod on the rover for exactly this reason and switch to it while driving and verify on the Spaceport before the launch, that it\u0027s orientation is correct.\n\nThe navball on your picture shows that the part you control the rover with has a wrong rotation. On the navball the sky should be on top.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T09:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mhoram**"}]}
