FYI no physics mods except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read up and looked at videos about gravity turns and I think I grasped the basic concept, but mine seem to be inefficient. I can get into orbit, I\u2019ve orbited and returned from the Mun, yet I still seem to get pretty inconsistent or inefficient results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying career mode the rocket in question has 2 stages, starting with 4 BACCs, 3 T400\u2019s and one LV-T45, followed by a Terrier with 2 T400 fuel tanks and two passenger cabins plus MK1 pod. The BACCs are throttled back to 80% for a stage 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2. I\u2019ve had it into orbit, but it seems to be quite an inefficient gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither I:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Turn relatively slowly, then end up with a high Apoapsis\u00A0 (150k\u002B), coast to it (whilst decelerating) and then fire the remains of the first stage \u002B second stage while falling like a brick and taking forever to accelerate. This seems to work, but makes it a highly eccentric orbit, especially if I burn up a bit to stop the rate of the descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Turn more aggressively, ending up at 45 degrees towards the 10k mark and an ~80k Apoapsis. I coast to it, losing all my orbital velocity and then when it\u2019s time to get the Periapsis up it takes so long that I end up back in the atmosphere unless like above I burn up. This doesn\u2019t always work either due to hitting the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth options seem very inefficient and the second doesn\u2019t always work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third option I just tried seems to be the least inefficient. I try to do a gravity turn as best I can, then when the Apoapsis reaches around 80k I keep on burning, but pitch down slightly towards Kerbin. This keep my orbital velocity increasing whilst maintain the Apoapsis where it is. This seems to give me a reasonably circular starting orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo questions then..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Is my gravity turn too inefficient, or is the 2nd stage underpowered for the payload thus needing another stage. The upper stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 1.76.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If it\u2019s the gravity turn, how do you work out on the fly (by dead reckoning?) the ideal angle for the most optimal trajectory. Or at least something that comes close!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I sometimes get either white streaks on the rocket which presumably means parts approaching the speed of sound, or red streaks from heat. If this means I\u2019m going too fast, should I throttle back or turn less? I thought a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 2 was pretty reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA bit of a wall of text with questions but I\u2019d really appreciate some guidance (pun intended).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-12T22:23:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2019 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by The_FD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFormatting..\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-13T00:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are feeling a desperate need to circularize, then yes the stage you are using to circularize is underpowered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving white streaks or red streaks in the atmosphere on ascent is normal, has very little effect on your ascent, and should either be ignored or celebrated. You need that velocity. Do not, under almost any circumstances, slow down to avoid aero effects (unless the aero makes your rocket unstable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get above 35km or so, it may be helpful to you to just point your rocket straight at the horizon by hand, and forget about pointing prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E gets to 80km, you can kill your thrust, flip to map mode, create a maneuver node at your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, and pull the prograde tab until it shows a \u0026gt;60km \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E. This maneuver node will do two things. It gives you a total burn time, and a marker on your navball. If you point at the marker (which will be slightly nose-down) and burn for the required time, you will circularize fairly efficiently -- even if your engine is underpowered. But the important point is that doing this\u00A0will prevent you from waiting too long to burn, which is what causes you to reenter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHowever,\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0the most important thing of all is that circularizing is overrated, and mostly just gets you style points. In general, the reason to go to orbit is because you want to go further than that. So you are going to eventually need a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E anyway. So having a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Egood thing\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, just so long as it\u0027s pointed in the right direction. Because of Oberth, you will want to do your next burn at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E of your orbit. Which means you want your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to be exactly on the opposite side of that. Or, in other words, you need to know in advance which direction you want your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E to point -- and then you time your launch so that your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E will point in that direction. And then it doesn\u0027t matter how high your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is, because it\u0027s already pointing in the right direction and all you need to do is add to it. So you burn and burn and burn prograde until you are almost in orbit, and then you stop. If your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E ends up not pointing quite right, then burning prograde before your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E pushes it forward, and burning after your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E pushes it backward. Burning exactly at your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E only raises your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-13T00:11:37Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2019 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-13T17:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223686289\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188860\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221570913512\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200254\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_FD\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, The_FD said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Turn more aggressively, ending up at 45 degrees towards the 10k mark and an ~80k Apoapsis.
