The same thing works for engines. I\u0027m working with a larger asteroid and have 15 parachutes attached to it, 5 orange and 10 blue. Now I\u0027m just attaching engines to it so I can pilot it accurately down to the KSC and land it. The asteroids act like ships with unlimited docking ports for the claw. So everything that you attach to them can be activated in stages and controlled the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fdiFeIT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fdiFeIT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T15:01:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need parachutes to land asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids don\u0027t break!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(maybe they will in 0.24?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
