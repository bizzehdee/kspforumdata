Technically you are still using the same amount of DV to get to orbit, just using a much more efficient engine. However, although I see your point here, you wouldn\u0027t actually gain much from this. Frankly, if you want to lift kethane, your best bet will be to use a plane, not a rocket, because planes allow you to gain a massive of speed while still in the atmosphere, so a significant amount less fuel is needed than a rocket. Jets are best used to gain a lot of horizontal velocity incredibly efficiently, as opposed to rockets, which need to get up and out of the atmosphere as quickly to be as efficient as possible. I know this kind of thing is possible, as people have done it before, but I am saying that this particular design and plan you have is not the best way (In terms of efficiency) to go about what you want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say you would shave an alright amount of DV off of your rocket stage, but not an awful amount of fuel. Simply: Although you would be using less fuel in the beginning, due to the high efficiency of the jets, you would then have to carry much more fuel to lug those jets to orbit. Net result would probably be about the same, probably leaning to slightly lower consumption from the jet based lifter, but the most efficient thing to do would be to drop the jets once they run out of fuel or are about to flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T11:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do vertical takeoff with jets as long as you have enough of them.

If you\u0027re asking about rough rocket dV requirements using TurboJet lifters off of Kerbin, I find that I usually need around 1700-2000 dV with rockets to get into orbit AFTER the TurboJets. Up until then, I find the dV estimates for TurboJets will be overly generous because the fuel available will inflate the estimated performance. This will depend a lot on your ascent profile and rocket build, but I can get about 20t payload into LKO with a 65t rocket (about 30% payload). I only use 1 intake per engine, but get going a lot faster than 800m/s before firing the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, whether you decouple the TurboJet boosters or keep them for orbit, the dV requirement will be the same. What will change is needing to carry more fuel or use a more efficient rocket engine to get to orbit (giving less payload). You can typically get better payload percentages with space planes, but they\u0027re also trickier to design (IMO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- By the way, I DON\u0027T limit myself to terminal velocity when ascending on TurboJets.

That wipes out a basic assumption of the proof that terminal velocity optimizes the Goddard problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the Goddard problem says that gravity loss decreases with speed but drag loss increases with speed, and the optimal tradeoff between those losses is at terminal velocity (where gravity loss in m/s == drag loss in m/s, pretty much by definition). For standard rockets, drag loss in m/s is directly related to drag loss in units of fuel. But that\u0027s not the case for KSP turbojets because the engine becomes more efficient when you go faster. Example: if you\u0027re going 500 m/s rather than 400 m/s, your gravity loss goes down by 20%. Drag loss in m/s goes up 56%, so with a rocket, by speeding up you burn 56% more fuel to fight drag and 20% less fuel to fight gravity. But with a jet, drag loss in fuel terms only goes up 12%. So the optimal tradeoff point will make you want to fly faster than terminal velocity -- at least until 1km/s. By that time, you\u0027re no longer flying a vertical ascent, so the Goddard problem no longer applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not able to perfectly quantify the tradeoff with jets. For the most part, it\u0027s not really relevant: the Goddard problem assumes you have infinite thrust and want to minimize fuel usage, but in fact, extra thrust capacity is very expensive in terms of mass. So your real mass-optimal solution will have you going less than terminal velocity, with engines at max throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T17:28:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022numerobis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022numerobis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebelow 1km/s, the fuel efficiency of your engine grows with your speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh, you mean thrust, right?
