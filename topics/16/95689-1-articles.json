As your engines are thrusting mostly horizontally most of your acceleration will also be horizontal and as you get higher (air thinner, Terminal Velocity higher, drag lower) you should aim for something like another 100m/s horizontal velocity per 1km altitude; 1,100m/s at 21km, 1,200m/s at 22km, etc. to 2,000m/s at 30km - roughly. If your horizontal speed isn\u0027t keeping up with your vertical speed then you\u0027re climbing too fast and not getting the most from your jets - which means needing to use more rocket-power, which is less efficient. If you can accelerate faster than that horizontally then you can afford to ascend faster as well, but the idea is to try to get to/above orbital velocity (~2,200m/s) before you get so high you have to throttle-back the jets so much that they\u0027re not really helping any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpamming intakes the way I do helps with this because you don\u0027t have to throttle-back so much or so early but if you fly a jet-powered vehicle properly (I must practice more!) you can get away with way less than the 8 I suggested; it all comes down to regulating your vertical speed to get the best horizontal acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T03:12:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T05:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on what you\u0027re doing. If you\u0027re very patient you can get a light, high lift plane into a 150km/35km orbit purely on the jet engine. That\u0027s with one turbojet and two ram intakes. The key is the faster you go the more air goes into your intakes, even at higher altitudes - you can still get some thrust over 50km if you baby it. A plane like that works just fine for rescuing stranded kerbals and dumping out light satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can\u0027t haul a full orange tank into orbit with one turbojet.
