In other words, moving your elevator control farther back (aft), or putting a canard pitch control on the ship as far froward as you can make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have the right idea placing the COL behind the COM. However, for such a short craft, your COM is too far back. Yes, moving the COL closer to the COM will make the craft less stable, but this is unavoidable in a very short ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, you can place the COL above the COM will no ill effects, I do this often. However, again because your ship is so short, having the COL so far above the COM is causing pitch moments which your elevators can\u0027t compensate for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think if you move the COL closer to the COM, that plane will fly well, and be extremely maneuverable. One suggestion to make the plane more stable: Use some structural fuselage sections to make the plane longer. They don\u0027t add much weight or drag, and having a longer plane makes it easier to have a stable plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see you have 4 sepatrons powering the command pod- I bet that\u0027s an exciting ride!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank327","CreatedById":115926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T16:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think making your plane so short is a bad idea in general. It decreases the margin for error between it being flip-happy and being uncontrollable. With longer planes you can have more distance between your pitch control and COM while still putting your COL and COM relatively close together. It makes them more stable. The air intake body is a really useful part for early airplanes behind the fuel tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not an expert on this stuff though.
