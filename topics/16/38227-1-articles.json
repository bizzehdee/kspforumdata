Remember, a positive gravity assist will eject you from the sphere of influence with a higher velocity than you came in with, because momentum is transferred between you and the object you are assisting with. KSP models gravity assists, or at least positive ones where you go around retrograde side (trailing edge) of the body in a counterclockwise orbit. Negative gravity assists exist as well, where you swing around in front of the leading edge of the body in a clockwise orbit, which gravity assists to \u003Cem\u003Ereduce\u003C/em\u003E your velocity.
