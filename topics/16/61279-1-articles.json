Speaking of the impossibility of perfectly circular orbits, orbits exactly matching a desired semi-major axis or a period, even with readouts from mods like Engineer Redux or MechJeb, are also, in principle, impossible because of the floating-point calculations. The issue is negligible in the beginning but if the player spends long enough with a save (e.g., multiple interplanetary missions could make you time-warp for tens or even hundreds of years), the errors start to show up as they propagate. Therefore, I\u0027d say it is impossible to make maintenance free orbits currently in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that, I\u0027d go for keostationary orbits for low latitude coverage and Molniya orbits for polar coverage (and that\u0027s what I have done).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor low(er) latitudes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, geostationary orbits have a big practical advantage for communication uses over other type of orbits because they appear to be stationary to a ground observer, which means that as long as there is a satellite visible high enough above the horizon, an antenna can be pointed at it from a roof of any building anywhere in the world. On the other hand, in KSP, unless you are setting up ground stations around Kerbin, the KSC is the only place you want to keep 100% connection to, and the antennas at the tracking center are \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1rml0r/tutorial_complete_novices_guide_to_remotetech_2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eomni-directional with a range of 75 Mm\u003C/a\u003E, so it doesn\u0027t really matter whether a satellite remain stationary to KSC as long as there is another one to take over when it goes below the horizon; you may as well decide the altitude of your network to be, say, 1000 km, as a round number. My choice of the stationary altitude (2868.75 km) is because it is easier to launch very first few satellites if you\u0027re doing it unmanned -- if the first one is \u0022always\u0022 in front of KSC there is less panic to set up those behind. Another reason is that the orbit is quite far out so the LKO region remains quite clear for me to see. So I could say it is entirely up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor polar coverage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use polar Molniya orbits because I want the satellite to spend most of its time above the poles (besides the coverage advantage, you can also bring less battery because the satellite spends less time in an eclipse). But then again unless you\u0027re flying unmanned in a very low orbit or you want to communicate with something on the ground near the poles, these are less important. Also, if you\u0027re apoapsis is too high up the Communotron 32 stops working and you have to use dishes. You either need pointing from the keostationary ones (if you have bring extra ones on board), or from the ground by setting up a station at intermediate latitudes (so the signal goes Molniya probe \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; ground station \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; keostationary probe(s) \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; KSC).

Remote Tech adds a new dimension to the game, but sometimes it becomes a burden. It would be fine if we could program a satellite to fire its RCS in the background to keep orbit, for instance, and you retire them when the RCS fuel is over. That would be realistic, fun, and interesting in the career mode, since you could have generations of satellites according to your tech tree evolution. Maybe I\u0027ll end up writing a plugin that does something like that in the background, reset the satellite back to the preset orbit and remove the equivalent delta-v needed from the monopropellant resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermunist","CreatedById":63745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T17:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this could be done fairly easily with a plugin.
