I made a perfectly stable, easy to fly \u0022thingy\u0022, but for those long trips i can\u0027t just trim it to maintain a certain altitude... it\u0027s always \u002B/- 10m/s or so... and i would like to avoid having to trim up and down every couple of minutes due to this... I tried FAR\u0027s helpers and they work awesome, but they don\u0027t maintain altitude... I tried MJ, but it wobbles around like a sheep that was slapped in the butt, obviously not maintaining anything... HAHA... any way to adjust the Trim to move less when i\u0027m trimming, i mean, any way to press ALT \u002B S and make it move half of what is currently moving, in other words even finer trimming? Is there any file i can edit to make this, any mod that can help me trim it or maintain altitude without the wobble??? In other words, Vertical Speed 0m/s!!!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be grateful if anyone can help me solve this... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS1: i also looked the kOS to scrip an autopilot but i guess it\u0027s too hard for me, i don\u0027t have the will to learn how to script that, and as far as i know it\u0027s a new scrip for every plane/ship, and the guides i found about that are not as clear as i would like... i guess i need to know some programming to use that, and i don\u0027t, at all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS2: i just need this for atmo\u0027s airplane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS3: i just studied the trim in a quicksave with an airplane on the runway prelaunch state... and it\u0027s not like everytime the same, it seems that depending on how many microsecs you keep your finger on there, that\u0027s the amount it will modify this, not like a real trim setup that you have predifined notches at which you stop, for instance, every time 0.001 or something... so i\u0027m pretty much lost... i wonder if using a 360 controller would work better...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-01T06:44:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2014 06:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GabeTeuton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Edon\u0026#039;t need an answer anymore!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
