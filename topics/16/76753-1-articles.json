I should have mentioned struts, as I do use them, a lot. I put radial decouplers up on some of my larger builds, which allows me to place struts and build a support \u0027cage\u0027 around stuff. After launch and leaving the atmosphere, before orbit, I stage the decouplers and release the cage... debris falls back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
