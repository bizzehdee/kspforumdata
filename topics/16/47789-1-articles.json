I recently docked a habitation module to my space station with room for 20 Kerbals. I intend to crew it with 7 to 14 Kerbals. So, I thought that rather than launch a series of small SSTOs and rockets, I would build a large space-shuttle like Spaceplane with room for 6 or more Kerbals to minimize the number of missions the drop off crew. The Spaceplane is launched from on top of a vertical rocket but comes back down by landing on the runway like a real spaceplane. I have had success with much smaller 1 and 3 man spaceplanes in doing this. However, while I can launch and perform orbital manuvers with this \u0022Jumbo\u0022 shuttle rather well, I cannot land it. Every time I renter the atmosphere, no matter how shallow my trajectory is, my spaceplane always and inevitably points downwards. I will post a picture to show what it looks like. What do I need to do to stop this and land my shuttle safely on the runway and how? More lift? More thrust? Less weight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot336_zpsbb047f79.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot336_zpsbb047f79.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot336_zpsbb047f79.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot339_zps18241b77.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot339_zps18241b77.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot339_zps18241b77.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot342_zps20570c99.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot342_zps20570c99.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot342_zps20570c99.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot344_zps0be029a0.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot344_zps0be029a0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot344_zps0be029a0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot345_zpscbca824a.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot345_zpscbca824a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot345_zpscbca824a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot346_zpsc42e414a.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot346_zpsc42e414a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot346_zpsc42e414a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot347_zpsc70a2b0f.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot347_zpsc70a2b0f.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot347_zpsc70a2b0f.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1069.photobucket.com/user/Carter938/media/screenshot348_zpse1a55a76.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1069.photobucket.com/albums/u464/Carter938/screenshot348_zpse1a55a76.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot348_zpse1a55a76.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T01:01:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Carter938\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T01:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo it sounds like you burned all the fuel in the back and your center of mass shifted too far forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try adding canards near the nose or maybe adding more weight in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starglider","CreatedById":82321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T01:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to do canards, you can move your wings forward (imo canards are better though).

I redid the design into a NASA Space Shuttle clone (though it launched like the one above) and it works better, at the cost of crew space.

This is actually much safer as although the Shuttles look very interesting upon reentry and a nice smooth landing at the runway, 3-man ones are the highest I can get. Soyuz Orbiter clones do much better because they are so much more reliable, safe, and can carry more men into orbit.
