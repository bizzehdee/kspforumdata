At what height are you putting your periapsis when you reenter Kerbin? Are you coming in with the heat shield below you all the way in, or are you flipping around nose first at some point? What is your approximate speed and altitude when you explode? Is one part overheating before the others, or does it just all explode at once?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most likely scenario is that you are simply coming down too steeply. You don\u0027t want your periapsis to be near or below the surface before you enter the atmosphere. A periapsis of around 25 or 30 km seems to be the preferred reentry method. If you come in too much steeper than that you might still be going too fast when you hit the dense part of the atmosphere and the shock will blow you up. That usually happens if you are still going more than about 3000 m/s below 20km. Unless your craft is very heavy, though, this shouldn\u0027t be a problem. I think you\u0027re pretty light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple of other design considerations that might be causing your problem. The science jr. cannot take much heat before it explodes and it\u0027s doors will extend beyond the protection of the heat shield if you leave them open. Always right-click the science jr. and close the doors before you reenter the atmosphere. It\u0027s even better to put the cargo bay between the heat shield and the science jr. because some internal heat will still be transferred up the stack and could cause weak parts attached right behind the heat shield to explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the octo probe core is very sensitive to heat. You cannot allow it to contact the heating effects if at all possible. If your craft is not coming in very straight with the heat shield down then your probe core may be exposed to too much heating and explode. It\u0027s best to put them inside cargo bays if it will fit. If you still need the probe core exposed on top then just make sure that you have enough control to keep it out of the flames of reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll other things being equal, you want the center of mass of your reentry vehicle to be as close to the heat shield as possible. Otherwise you might flip over and come in nose first which could fry your parachutes, science experiments and probe core.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-17T05:06:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2017 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chads","CreatedById":178893,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-17T06:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks very much for the quick responses!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/Retrograde tracking during the descent. \u00A0It seems that Science Junior blows up, without ever being listed as the \u0022hottest component.\u0022 \u00A0I believe I\u00A0had it adjacent to the capsule, with the cargo bay then between it and the heat shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing I was coming in too steeply, though, based on your comments. \u00A0I do typically aim for about 30km for my periapsis on re-entry. \u00A0I was closer to 5km, though. \u00A0I thought I needed to be steeper due to the extra speed, so as not to bounce off the atmosphere. \u00A0I thought that due to previous failures, where I did indeed bounce off, orbit again, bounce off again, etc., until the heat shield was out of ablator. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0Not the worst experience ever, but it may have set me up for failure this time around, as I took the wrong lesson away from that. \u00A0I\u0027ll be sure to pay closer attention to that as I move forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Materials experiment would blow up, it would throw the rest of it end over end, and eventually everything would go. \u00A0I did manage to keep the capsule and pilot, though. \u00A0So, while I lost a little bit of hardware, at the end of the day (and 3-4 restores from save) I had recovered the kerbonaut.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, thanks! \u00A0I look forward to both learning more, and ultimately contributing in the future!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChads\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-17T08:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that there is no need to bring anything back to Kerbin other than your capsule, heatshield and parachute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour Kerbal can collect the results from the experiments and they will be saved in the capsule when he re-enters.
