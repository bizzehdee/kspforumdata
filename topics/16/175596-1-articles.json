It is the third hardest body to return from, after Jool and the Sun. And unless you\u0027re crazy you don\u0027t try to return from Jool or the Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long time, Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E vehicles were thought to be impossible, until someone made one, which involved a mammoth engine, at least 3 of the large fuel tanks, and taking off from Eve\u0027s tallest mountain. He barely made it into orbit, and was pretty much completely out of fuel by the time he did so. It also carried one Kerbal, and would have been pretty much impossible to re-land on Eve, even with refueling, due to the lack of control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then, the community has managed better, especially with the update that nerfed drag. One guy managed to drag a set of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E equipment to orbit. Then, someone managed an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E from Kerbin to Eve and back using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E as well as dragging an asteroid to Low Eve Orbit. Two more designs come to mind, while not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, they were fully reusable. The first is one that launched to a suborbital trajectory and then was caught by a ship already in orbit, but that requires insane rendezvous skills, as well as precision ascent. The second was a stratolaunch type design, with the first stage being a plane powered by stock propellers that took a crew rocket up above the lower atmosphere, and it could \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E from there, but he needed a stage recovery mod to get the plane back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most practical design would probably be something like this, but scaled up (longer, maybe 3.75m) to carry 3 Kerbals:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q-PJ4FgWpg?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBottom line, Eve \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScratch that, Eve Ascent Vehicles in general are hard. It\u0027s generally regarded that once you return from Eve, you\u0027re an expert at the game, and are in the top 0.1% of players. So in general, I\u0027d suggest that you start with disposable vehicles, they can be tricky enough, especially landing in one piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure how experienced with the game you are. If this is going to be your first interplanetary mission, I\u0027d suggest going to Duna first instead, it\u0027s harder to land on, but 50x easier to return from. SSTOs there are no problem. Plus, it has a conveniently placed (annoyingly placed if you\u0027re coming in from a transfer) moon similar in gravity to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at your profile, you seem dead set on sending a submarine to another world. If you\u0027re not already focused entirely on Eve, might I suggest going to Laythe instead? It is much more similar to Kerbin, and is in the most interesting place in the whole system IMO, right next to four other moons. If this will be your first Jool trip, don\u0027t worry, just pack a lot of extra Delta-V, install a transfer mod, and realize that Jool\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E is a lot bigger than it seems initially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour other objectives, a refueling rover, base, and transportation plane, are much simpler although anything on other planets is tricky. A refueling rover will be straightforward, as will the base. Good call on the aerospikes on the exploration plane, they are one of the few engines that produce any thrust at Eve\u0027s sea level, although if I were you I\u0027d use a Vector (maybe limit the gimbal) and add more fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-04T04:05:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might also be an idea to put a satellite with a resource survey scanner in polar orbit first - to make sure you don\u0027t land somewhere with 0% surface ore.
