But it is always nice to have some drones placed at locations that help you guide your plane. Maybe somebody has some other nifty ideas that don\u0027t require mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome might be unnecessary, but it gives you things to do for your career/sandbox purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so there are different fun things we can do to help us land a plane and such. Such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(and correct me if I am wrong)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The classic 90\u0027/270\u0027 runway beacon drone\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA helpful target for giving you nice range finding and runway alignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCome to think of it, maybe one can add a few more that are well parked, to give you target markers that can act like\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://image.slidesharecdn.com/newl-13240988702398-phpapp02-111216232447-phpapp02/95/airfield-lighting-introductory-7-728.jpg?cb=1324078090\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApproach Side Row Lights\u003C/a\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are mods like Kerbal Konstructs/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002B\u002B/Airport that bring all those neato approach lights, but they are hard to see from afar. The hardToSee part kinda brings us to...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. PAPI/VASI via lights\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPAPI mod obviously makes more sense over building something alike\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR-tSJRTbTAcBPDIN3TSIRI3qkiuGnuFiDx2vQJb-95ALomb1ck\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0or\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VEVuQ1e.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E , as the render distance makes it too hard to see the lights until you are some 500m away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Single/dual drone beacons/buoys\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother interesting idea is dropping off drones that act as landmarks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually make a plane that flies straight off the runway, maintaining a 90/270\u0027 course and some 500m. With the help of the runway beacon, I toss off a parachute-buoy at some 10km and 30km. Just to get some pre-alignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also like dropping some two very-separate beacons that act like slalom poles/waypoint guides.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 1/2. Selfmade runway lights\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake a marked runway on such regions like polar caps for your ice base. I\u0027ve yet to make a deployable drone with a long strut and lights that project runway lights. Anyways, small drones with lights pointing at the ground should it do, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust be sure to set them far enough apart, unless you like crashing in such like lvl3 runway lights \u003Cspan\u003E:D.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, these are roughly the silly things I setup for career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there other cool things to place or do, that could be useful? Doubt I covered all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
