My Kermen are on the surface with their rover having fun. But soon it will be time to send them home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir lander has probably enough fuel to launch back into Duna orbit, but probably not enough for a full burn back to Kerbin. Not to worry! I parked a booster rocket with some fuel left (really, it was more or less my third stage) in orbit around Duna. It has a docking ring and everything. Before making the Duna trip, I practiced docking with it in Kerbin orbit. (Detach from the booster, rotate my capsule around, then dock with the docking ring on the booster.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, now that I\u0027m on the Duna surface, I can\u0027t figure out how to locate it and rendezvous with it. I can see it using the Tracking station at the space center, it registers as a piece of debris. It\u0027s among a few pieces of debris currently drifting around Duna. A bit of trial-and-error and I can get the thing on my screen. Looks good, orbiting there, waiting for me to fly up and dock with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I can\u0027t figure out how to do is, when piloting the lander, how to set that thing as a Target. If I could do that then I could use the map view to time my launch and burn to rendevous with it. Problem is that I can\u0027t figure out how to mark it as a target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T04:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to map view and click on it. It will offer you two choices: Set Target and Switch To.

You should then be able to at least see a target designator in your external view (when close enough) and a target marker on your nav ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the future, you should think about adding a remote guidance unit to your booster, so it\u0027ll register as a probe, not debris.
