Since i had standard docking ports all over, i designed an additional part, which was designed to snap to 3 docking ports at different points of the station. When the first docking port started to attract its desired counterpart, the whole module was pulled in position and the other 2 docking ports also snapped on their counterparts, resulting in a successful installation of the whole module. So it definitely works. And since i also had a problem with senior docking ports not working at all (in 0.20), i still use the standard docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing more docking ports instead of a big one (right next to another, on the same part) worked only with 2 std ports for me - 3 didnt work somehow in my case (I tried to connect multiple vehicles on kerbin base, each having a 1-to-3 adapter and 3 std docking ports). I dont know why...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: The three marked docking ports were used to connect one big structural part, so the upper \u0022arms\u0022 will get more stability.
