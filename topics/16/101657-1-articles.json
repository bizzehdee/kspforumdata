I am trying to do the mission where I place a satellite over a fixed point in synchronous orbit. I can get it to syncronous orbit, but I cant figure out any good way to get it over that point!! \n\nright now I am starting from a 90km round, equatorial orbit, do a Hoffman to the synchronous altitude, and then round it. Works well, but I cant control where the satellite will be over. Is there something I am missing? I found a great chart for calculating rendezvous between orbits, works great, but I cant use it here since the point is not on orbit, but on ground...\n\ncheers"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T06:52:16Z","Content":"Hi ragusila. And welcome to the KSP addiction. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFrom your starting orbit set up a manoeuvre node for your transfer burn. Position the node on your current orbit so that the Ap for it is over the point you want to be in sync orbit over. Then set up another manoeuvre node at the Ap and perform your circularisation burn. That should get you pretty close.\n\nWith gentle tweaking you should be able to fine tune your final orbit if it\u0027s not close enough initially. You can use RCS if you have it, or right click the engine and reduce its power to give you finer control.\n\nHope this helps. \n\nPandaman.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T07:05:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 07:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T07:43:43Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums,\n\nyou already have your target orbit, now you can do the following:\n\n- if the target on the ground is ahead, lower your periapsis a bit, do some circulations in order to \u0022catch up\u0022. Once it is in sight, raise the periapsis again to the target orbit.\n\n- if the target is behind, raise your periapsis and let the ground target catch up with your sat.\n\nIt\u0027s a bit like with a normal rendezvous, just with a ground target. Same mechanics."},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T08:33:57Z","Content":"The time it takes to complete one orbit is a function of the \u0022semi-major axis\u0022. The major axis is the orbital distance between Pe and Ap. If you increase that distance, the orbit takes longer, if you decrease that distance the orbit is faster.\n\nThere are probably more efficient ways to do it, but this method gets the job done: First, get onto your desired orbit. It doesn\u0027t matter where you are relative to your ground target. Check to see where you are. If you are ahead, you need to slow down. If you are behind, you need to speed up. To slow down, you need to increase your orbital period a bit, so burn prograde to raise your Ap a bit. Now, to get from where you are (now the Pe), to the same point on the next orbit, takes longer than the target orbit, so you will arrive there \u0022behind\u0022 where you began. Keep going round until you reach your Pe over the point on the ground that is your target, and circularise. To speed up, burn retrograde, and drop your Pe below the target orbit, and the Ap will remain on it. Each time round you will gain some ground, so keep going round until you arrive at Ap over your target, then circularise.\n\nBe careful not to overdo the burns, though. You need to complete one full orbit to arrive back at your target before you can circularise. If you go too far on your adjustment, you may find you overshoot your target. It\u0027s easier to make a small adjustment orbital correction and have to go round a few times before reaching your target than to repeatedly overshoot. With practice you will get a feel for how to fine-tune it."},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T09:32:25Z","Content":"Hello and welcome to the forums!\n\nAs the previous posters have pointed out, easiest way is to just get to the desired orbit, and then fine tune the orbit to the desired point. In simple terms:\n\nif your ship is ahead of the desired position, burn prograde a little to raise apoaps and wait a few orbits. The higher the periapsis, the more distance relative to the ground the satellite will be moved per orbit.\n\nif your ship is behind the desired position, burn a little retrograde and wait a few orbits. As before, the lower the periapsis, the more distance relative to the ground the satellite will be moved per orbit. Use longer burns if you\u0027re impatient, but then you\u0027ll risk overshooting the desired point.\n\nOne more addition: always remember that the planet is spinning under you while you are performing a maneuver. While going from a lower orbit to a kerbin-centric orbit, the planet will spin with you. That means that if you use a maneuver node no get you exactly where you want to be, you\u0027ll end up behind the position you wanted. Aim ahead of the desired position. The lower your starting orbit, the mor you\u0027ll have to compensate. How much exatctly is up to practice.\n\ngood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T12:07:52Z","Content":"It\u0027s one of the many epiphanies you\u0027re going to have about orbital motions while playing this game.

You are now in what is called a Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO, or even KTO if you wish). However, instead of circularizing at AP right away, you should instead wait until the desired point is underneath you when you\u0027re at AP, and then circularize. Barring some rare timing coincidences where your period is an exact multiple of Kerbin\u0027s, it will eventually happen. If you want to make it happen faster, you can even do a bit of math involving orbital periods, and then performing a prograde burn at AP that doesn\u0027t fully circularize, but changes your period so that the desired point will pass under you the next time around.\n\nI believe that in real life, this is exactly how multiple Geo-synchronous satellites are launched at once -- they all get released into a GTO, and each satellite performs circularization at different times to put the satellites over different points over the Earth."}]}
