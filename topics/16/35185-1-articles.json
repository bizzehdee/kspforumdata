The Ap/Pe\u0027s don\u0027t need to be exact, just close enough, and mostly it\u0027s just that you need the Semi-Major axis to be the same. Of course at 10km separation, that\u0027s only about 5 second apart from one station passing overhead to the next, and any orbit will eventually drift a little.\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to avoid the lag, then I\u0027d put them in different orbits, that are at least 4-5km apart in their Ap/Pe, as then you\u0027ll never be in range of both at the same time. You can adjust the orbital period to something in resonance, like 40 minutes and 60 minutes, which would give you 2 \u0026amp; 3 orbit windows, but really, how often do you need the windows to happen? 35 \u0026amp; 42 minutes should get a sync every 7 or so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as long as your transit bus has a few hundred delta-V for the transfer, even a station on the other side of Kerbin is only one outside orbit to an RV away, allowing a transfer at anytime within an hour or for a daily commute time, in which case all you need is the altitude separation to avoid the lag, and the timing and resonance becomes moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I thought of first, and it\u0027s an elegant solution, but there\u0027s a tradeoff: the less delta-v you make for the transfer burn, the less transfer windows available to you. The delta-v needed to go between a 35 period and 42 period orbit is 129 m/s (appreciate that number: I used windows calculator to get it). That may not seem like much, but considering the sheer amount of fuel I\u0027m going to transfer between the stations, this will add up. You can see why two stations 10km apart would be appealing to me: at that range one just needs to point and burn essentially, you can get there as slow and efficient as you want. I could have two stations at 80km and 85km, but then the transfer windows are four hours apart or so. That wouldn\u0027t be a problem if only KSP would let me fast-forward more than 50x that close! And it has to be that close because of the Oberth effect, moving the stations higher would cost me a lot more fuel in the long run than it would save in LKO maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-29T12:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\u0027t you use Zenith Rockets Family?

I just had a lot of screwing around with them back in the old versions when we had only few parts in the game. I got so bored with abusing those mods that I stopped playing for 2 months or so. Now I set challanges like colonizing Duna or building big interplanetary ships with resources I have in-game only.

But right now I\u0027m more satisfied with emulating a space program as accurately as I can in KSP than I am with difficult challenges. I start with atmospheric rockets, move through the historic missions like Vostok, Mercury, Gemini, then up to Apollo and beyond. Takes a damn long time but is very satisfying seeing a whole space program grow like that under your maintenance. Sometimes KSP has trouble doing things that would be pretty trivial in real life (like having two space stations near each other) and I have no problems using mods to overcome these limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
