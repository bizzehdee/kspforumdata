Can I put docking clamps or crew-capable modules at any end?

Monopropellant for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters does the same, no need to attach those directly to their fuel tanks, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters will drain from across the entire craft ignoring crossfeed rules (e.g. across decouplers) so just keep an eye on it so you don\u2019t run out on a later stage. Fuel cells, on the other hand, need to be attached to a fuel source to work and will obey crossfeed rules when draining fuel and oxidiser, however the power they produce can flow anywhere; the \u2018Puff\u2019 monopropellant engine behaves like other (bipropellant) engines and will obey crossfeed rules, but it\u2019s not a commonly used part and you can probably ignore it entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP also doesn\u2019t model any kind of internal structure, so docking ports and crew parts don\u2019t need to be attached to each other. As long as they\u2019re on the same vessel (and docking multiple crafts together makes them \u2018the same vessel\u2019 until they undock again), a Kerbal can transfer between any crew parts on that vessel with no problems- even if they\u2019re attached via a grabbing Klaw rather than a docking port, through some metal girders, an engine and some fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: Power generation and storage, docking ports and crew parts and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters can go anywhere on a craft.
