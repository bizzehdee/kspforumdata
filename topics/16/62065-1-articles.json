I would assume that you would want to face them towards the prograde marker at high altitudes. Really, you don\u0027t need too many intakes, as long as you can reach a sufficient speed at the allowed altitude, and your NERVAs can take over. Just add MOAR if you aren\u0027t getting the speed/altitude you want. But don\u0027t overdo it. If push comes to shove, you may have to ditch your design if you can\u0027t get into orbit with enough fuel. Also, pics would help.

I usually use around 3 intakes, but have plenty of space planes that only use 1 intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do want it to be pointed toward your prograde marker, but sometimes your prograde marker can be significantly below the level axis of your craft. So for looks, most people just place the intakes pointing straight forward on their aircraft. You cannot place it facing backward and get air intake. Also, if put your aircraft in extreme pitch maneuvers, you can risk premature flameout at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one example of stacking intakes that isn\u0027t a complete eyesore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uMABEpJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uMABEpJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso realize that any intakes you have will feed whichever engines are running. So for example, say you have three intakes and three TurboJets you have a 1:1 ratio. If you shutdown the two outboard TurboJets, you will end up with three intakes feeding one engine (3:1 ratio). Depending on the weight of your plane, you might not need three engines to begin with. You can get 12\u002B tons into LKO pretty easily on 1 TurboJet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kinnison","CreatedById":68083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T07:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso what is a good ratio of ram intakes to to turbojets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thiosk","CreatedById":81242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T07:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei had no idea you could stack them like that. i\u0027ve been using side boosters and quad couplers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T07:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea this is what is called air hogging.
