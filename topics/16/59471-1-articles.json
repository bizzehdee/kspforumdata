Just think of it as dipping your toes in the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to launch some rocket with a good TWR and maybe about 5-6 km/s delta V capability. You may see where I\u0027m going with this. I don\u0027t want to land and risk getting trapped on the surface- no that\u0027s for another day. I want to do a manned atmospheric exploration. I want to get that EVA report, crew report, Goo, Materials study, etc while \u0022flying in Eve\u0027s atmosphere,\u0022 and I want to return it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already done the parachute landers on land and into the water, and gotten all I\u0027m going to get from the transmitting of the land and air SCIENCE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to launch a rocket into the upper atmosphere, and have it do a high altitude parachute just until I hit the upper edge of \u0022flying over Eve\u0022 then rocket back into space while the atmosphere is still thin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my question has two parts: What altitude do you start to see the \u0022flying over Eve\u0022 biome? Is there a way to get the parachutes to open higher? The tweakables don\u0027t give me much leeway on the deployment altitude. Would I have to aim for the highest mountain, and then have the 5000 meter (or whatever the max tweakable was) AGL opening to get results?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T13:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 01:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T22:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse a drogue chute. Those open the highest, and you have a HELL of a lot of drag with them on Eve due to flying through the soup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, \u0027upper atmosphere\u0027 is in the atmosphere and sub-orbital, though. So you may not need a chute at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, maybe a spaceplane.

Will the drogues fully deploy that high up? Or maybe the reefed chutes will be enough for a short stabilization. I agree, unmanned test first will be the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplane sounds fun... then again at that altitude I may be able to \u0022brute force\u0022 it, just shoot for a super low aerobrake, and boost prograde to get back up as soon as I quickly get all the readings. Though without the chutes, the EVA may be hard to get as the deceleration will rip them off the ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chair- does that give an EVA or crew report?

That chart is a huge help. I think I can reach orbit with something from 40,000 meters up, not requiring a full parachute deployment. I\u0027ll try it both ways- I\u0027ll do both the original mission now that you gave me the chart, and send my SSTO (with an extra command chair duct taped to the top for the EVA report) over there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
