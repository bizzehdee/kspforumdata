Quicksave first in case something explodes. Press \u0022[\u0022 to jump to the other vessel, that sometimes triggers another docking check. Try it a few more times. If it still won\u0027t dock, turn on a bit of timewarp, cancel timewarp, and the little jump that surface parts do exiting timewarp might trigger a successful docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to use the Kerbal Planetary Base Systems (KPBS) mod for surface bases. It has a new docking port profile and retractable wheels for maneuvering parts together on the ground. Retracting and extending the wheels several times can sometimes help a stubborn docking attempt. The KPBS wheels and attachment points guarantee that both sides of the docking port are at the same exact height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-26T17:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a folding base core with multiple docking ports that face upwards, that way I can use the hinges on the base to make sure it\u0027s horizontal and then plonk the next module down on top.\u00A0 A set of standard modules means I can\u00A0tailor the base to whatever need without having to design new bits.\u00A0 It does mean getting good at precision landings though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a previous game I had a rover with a docking port on a short rotating arm, so it could be set at a range of heights.\u00A0 Looked ugly but worked well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
