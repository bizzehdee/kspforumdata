The compairison between ram and cicular seems obvious to me, ram is better because more intake area. But what about the radial one? It has more mass, less intake area, but more maximum intake. So which is good for what?\u0060And why should I even use the radial or the nacelle, are they purely for asthetics?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T16:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe radial ones store more air than the other ones if I recall correctly. Storing it is useless however! If it doesn\u0027t ruin your plane completely always use the ram intakes.

So the only real reason to choose radial over ram is aesthetic. The nacelle can be used as an air brake by opening/closing the intake; when closed it doubles as a lighter structural fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy old \u0022jets compendium\u0022 thread is gone, but all the information is encoded in my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/numerobis/KSP-scripts/blob/master/jets.py\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP-scripts\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T17:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything other than the ram intake is currently worse than useless, I\u0027m sure proper stats will be added as development progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T17:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re designing a spaceplane, only use the ram intakes.
