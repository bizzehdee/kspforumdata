Even if it doesn\u0027t, you may experience near-lethal heating, yet extremely minimal drag (making aerocapture impossible).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E no tipps?\n\nThe simplest solution is to turn down the atmospheric heating slider (or edit ReentryHeatScale in your save game). 20% heating should work better, still provide some challenge, and not auto-incinerate your craft. Turning this down doesn\u0027t bother me personally, since it\u0027s obviously currently broken.\n\nA workaround at Jool system is to aerobrake off Laythe (which has a marginally more forgiving atmosphere), or try to gravity brake around Tylo.\n\nThe only workaround I have at Eve is to spend more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to slow down before atmospheric contact, bring a heat shield, and brake very high using multiple passes to slow yourself down. This basically means you need to budget the extra \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to slow down to capture on your engines.

Now it\u0027s much harder, as every part has a complicated drag (and heat) profile. So, unless a calculator prog knew every part on your ship and their orientation then its not going to be possible to calculate aerobraking nodes. For instance, two craft of the same mass but one wider than the other will get more aerobraking than a skinny craft. \n\nSo, really, your only choice now is to suck it and see. This is painful for those who like to do their missions the right way around, with a launch, flight and landing as their whole mission. Personally I now do every long mission backwards first by testing the landing, the descent, the orbit etc first with hyperedit before committing a whole mission.

I remember one of the early games I\u0027ve played I tried aerobraking at Laythe at 30km, but I was going in too fast and I just blew right past, nothing the Nuclear engines could do to stop me flying right out of the Joolian system.\n\nThere is no fixed answer. Each ship design is affected differently by the same air so there\u0027s no way to predict the outcome. Trial-and-error in each individual case (via F5/F9) is the only way to find out. But in general, all altiudes used 1.0.4 are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than they were before.\n\nAlso, aeroBRAKING and aeroCAPTURING are different things. The former is when you already have a closed orbit (such as when returning to Kerbin from Mun), the latter is when you don\u0027t (first arriving at another planet after an interplanetary trip). The former USUALLY involves much less speed (unless your Ap is way out near the SOI boundary) so is relatively survivable although the ridiculously steep (essentially vertical) atmosphere density cutoffs everywhere but Kerbin mean still can\u0027t go very low so it takes many tedious orbits to do you much good. The latter always involves about the highest possible speeds and, in 1.0.4 with 100% reentry heat, is quite problematic to do at all.\n\nIf you insist on using 100% reentry heat, then you have basically 2 options for interplanetary aerocaptures (at least at Eve and Jool--Duna\u0027s not much of a problem and Kerbin is somewhere in between):\n\n1. Build some ridiculous heat shield on your ship and accept that no ship can aerocapture more than once, so no more reusable tugs cycling between the planets and Kerbin.\n\n2. Don\u0027t touch significant atmospheres at interplanetary speed. This necessarily involves bringing a lot more fuel and enough TWR to use it in the time available, regardless of whether you capture (and lower your Ap significantly) via thrust alone or manage to gravity brake off a large moon. \n\nEve doesn\u0027t have a large moon so there, you\u0027re pretty much stuck with lots more fuel.\n\nOr, you can just turn reentry heat down to a reasonably level. The system is clearly quite broken at present. Only Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere gradually fades to nothing over a long distance. All the others, although they do technically fade away, drop off so quickly they they\u0027re effectively oceans rather than gaseous envelopes. That\u0027s just wrong.\n\nBut right now, no matter what you do, you\u0027ll never like how the system works everywhere in the game. Making Kerbin a challenge totally eliminates the ability to aerocapture at other planets without designing the ship around some monster heat shield. OTOH, making aerocapture survivable at Jool and Eve (say with a 20% heat setting) makes reentry everywhere else such a doddle you probably won\u0027t even need heat shields there.\n\nHowever, that\u0027s what you get with a broken system. So pick your poison.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T12:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T12:52:38Z","Content":"85km periapsis is still risky.

Not just aerobraking will be tedious - everything will be tedious. It\u0027s not a game problem, it\u0027s a play style problem where you bury yourself in micromanagement all by your own.\n\nAnd how often does your tug perform so intense aerobraking that it needs a new shield? Your part count rises by **2**. The docking port on your ship and the docking port on the shield. If raising the part count by **2** in order to make a craft reusable is an issue to you, then you have far more serious problems than aerobraking. And if docking itself is so tedious to you, get MechJeb for goodness sake. Expensive? Large heatshield is 900![Fund_char.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/8/8a/Fund_char.png). A common docking port is 280![Fund_char.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/8/8a/Fund_char.png). Again, if this kind of costs is an issue to you, your gameplay style bears some serious problems.\n\nAnd yes, 1.0.3 broke the atmospheres of other planets leaving them with a sharp cut-off instead of the thin layer. It requires more planning and more cautious gameplay. What you used to achieve by descent to altitudes where density would be optimal, now you achieve by timing your presence in atmosphere precisely. With periapsis 2km below the upper border you\u0027re maybe 30 seconds in the atmosphere and it\u0027s too short to be damaged. It makes the game less realistic, but not unplayable - just more challenging.\n\nBTW, the only time I ever burned up in the atmosphere was when I pushed the throttle to the max in my SSTO plane while in a level flight 2km above Kerbin on my way to KSC (70km away).
