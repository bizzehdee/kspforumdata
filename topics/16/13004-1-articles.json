But I was wondering how people are actually landing their craft within a few kms on the mun surface, is it simply a case of orbiting until you\\\u0027re close and do a deorbit burn? Or am i making mistakes with my transfer orbit? I\\\u0027m not waiting for munrise, I just hit the AP to 11.4 and wait until the mun captures me, takes a few orbits but *shrugs* I got time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duckunlimited2","CreatedById":14973,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T01:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst order of business: welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, if your trying to land on the mun, you should, once captured by the mun\\\u0027s gravity, create a stable orbit. I like 30-40 thousand meters above the surface. Then, retrograde until your orbital path takes you straight down. Another way to know if your going straight down is if you look on the north pole of your navball, your retrograde marker should be on the north pole. When your sure your going straight down, point your engines down and and thrust periodically to control your fall speed. (100m/s for my preference, when i reach 5000 meters, i slow to 50m/s.) right before you land, slow yourself to 10 or below m/s for a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Hope that,s what your looking for\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-21T01:20:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022count23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022count23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not waiting for munrise, I just hit the AP to 11.4 and wait until the mun captures me, takes a few orbits but *shrugs* I got time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you doing that?

Make sure your orbit crosses over your desired landing site. Then, before you cross over it, retro burn until you de-orbit and your trajectory takes you onto a landing site...

If you don\\\u0027t like waiting around without time acceleration, just make your orbit over 120K so you can use a higher amount. You can do 240KM orbit for max time compression but then you might need to time your burn slightly differently (though I think Munrise is still fine at this alt).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T09:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there, I have gotten pretty good at clustering my structures.

This will help you keep track of which way you will need to bank in relation to the ground. The horizontal landed ones in the pics were the easiest because I could pitch forward/back/side for thrust much easier since I could better reference to the ground. Easiest way is to use of the spaceplane cockpits, an extra rcs or something that won\\\u0027t throw off the mass/thrust bad on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond, capture a nice and round orbit with plenty of fuel. This will allow you to get a good alignment to where you want to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, it can be difficult to get a perfect close landing. If you have to, land a little away, then can make some hops a bit closer to where you want it to be.
