Literally every mission I send to anywhere is preceded by about 4 probes or so wich I scan the planet or moon in question with. They\u0027re also great for satellites and such obviously since you wouldn\u0027t wanna put a Kerbal in space on satellite duty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027d!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yea ... Like the previous poster said higher level probes have SAS capabilities.

It\u0027s nice to have one that can hold normal when you\u0027re trying to put a satellite into a particular orbit and its apses are already more or less correct. I agree with 5thHorseman that it\u0027s largely asthetics though - that\u0027s what most of the parts in the game wind up being in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T01:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent probe cores have quite different capabilities now.
