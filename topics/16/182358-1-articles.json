My findings are that a deflated 10m heatshield has relatively low drag but more so then a dedicated nosecone or fairing. What I ended up with was not a Eve re-entry vehicle but a long 2.5m stack with a 10m deflated heatshield on the nose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeatshields are the most heat protective parts and can withstand up to 3300K of temperatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 10m inflatable heatshield on the other hand does better and can withstand up to 3500K temperatures.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003EIn your case:\u003C/u\u003E Then there is the bowshock of the heatblast. Generally parts exposed x meters behind the inflatable heatshield will be heatblasted. Other parts can also increase bow shock like upside down vector engines behind the heatshield...\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause the cross section of the vectors is behind the heatshield it\u0027s still protected from overheating.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy all luck the bowshock is such that it overcompasses the wider stacks behind the heatshield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes the bowshock gets around, but, if you place a ablative heatshield in between the tanks where the bowshock ends the fuel tanks x meters below the heatshield will also be protected. Remember that you can empty the ablator in which case the heatshield weighs next to nothing. The reason parts below a ablative heatshield within a stack are protected is likely because of the white checkerboard shroud around a heatshield when it\u0027s attached within a stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately I ended up with a long 2.5m rocket with 1 LV-N at the back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EResult:\u003C/strong\u003E I could punch into Eve\u0027s atmosphere as low as 50-52km at usual encounter velocities from a hohmann transfer trajectory from Kerbin. Normally a unprotected vessel would rip itself apart several hundred meters below 90km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see use for it, in your case it protects the re-entry vessel without requiring to inflate the shield. As a consequence you can inflate later to re-orientate the vessel for landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother use I saw is that because I could use this setup to get deep into a atmosphere I could do more aggressive gravity assists by punching lower into an atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 90km periapsis Eve gravity assist or a 55km periapsis Eve gravity assist. The drag losses are negligble and especially when doing plane changes for destinations such as moho a 55km periapsis eve gravity assist can really achieve a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E payback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-22T11:30:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2019 11:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T17:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting idea.\u00A0 My experience has been that if your ship is too pointy, you won\u0027t slow down enough by the time you hit the really thick atmosphere, and things will get crazy hot.\u00A0 But doing this, with an inflated heat shield at the BACK of the ship, could be a great way to maintain stability.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, there\u0027s also the issue of covering up all the stuff in front.\u00A0\u00A0And since an uninflated heat shield only covers a 2.5m cross -section, if you never inflate it, you might be better off with the regular 2.5 heat shield.\u00A0 I imagine it\u0027s draggier, plus it can probably dissipate more heat through ablation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reinhart Mk.1","CreatedById":194521,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-22T21:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwow did i actually discover something new or is it just a random effect being that my ship is so pointy and heavy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheTripleAce3","CreatedById":188116,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-19T16:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does still protect you, look at \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/108287-stratzenblitz75/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022108287\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/108287-stratzenblitz75/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Stratzenblitz75\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and his videos on land speed records and you\u0027ll see he uses them quite nicely with a rotated ablative shield too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat might be fairing though, not quite sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
