They tell you if the orbit is retrograde or prograde. You can also double check if your orbit is wrong by hovering the mouse over the asc./desc. Nodes. If it is close to 0degs you\u0027re good. If it is close to 180degs you are going the wrong way. After eliminating that as a possible cause, double check that the contract doesn\u0027t require a thermometer or goo canister, etc. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordCurlyton","CreatedById":125432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T05:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESigh, I was afraid of that.
