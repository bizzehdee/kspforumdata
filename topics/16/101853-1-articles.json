I\u0027ve had Kerbals explode from relatively low-velocity collisions on the Mun, yet **survive free fall from 35 km on Kerbin.** \n\u003E [...]\n\nWhat explain the 35KM altitude survival is the terminal velocity.\n\nFor those who don\u0027t know, terminal velocity apply to every bodies with an atmosphere and designate the maximum speed you can reach during a **free fall**. This maximum speed is caused by the drag: as you accelerate, the drag increase which cause you to \u0022slow down\u0022; basically, the terminal velocity is the equilibrium between the force of gravity and your drag.\n\nSo, no matter how high you fall, you won\u0027t go faster than the terminal velocity(\\*), which explain why you can survive a 35 KM fall on kerbin: as Kerbin has an atmosphere, you reach your terminal velocity before touching the ground: you would reach the exact same speed if you started your fall from 10KM. However, as the Mun don\u0027t have an atmosphere, there is no drag which mean you\u0027ll be alway accelerating(as long as you are into the good SOI).\n\n(\\*) of course, you fall from high enough, your inertia could permit you to touch the ground faster. that\u0027s not because it \u0022disable\u0022 terminal velocity in any way, but because the drag didn\u0027t have enough time to slow you down."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:19:24Z","Content":"I seem to remember DasValdez saying that a Kerbal\u0027s normal impact tolerance is 40 m/s.
