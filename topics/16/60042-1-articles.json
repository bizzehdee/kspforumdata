Then build up as you need to add more. What you did build is huge. You didn\u0027t say what the intent of this huge plane is; as-is, it serves to fly a Kerbal around the world once while burning a lot of fuel. You have far more engines than you need for the mass you\u0027re hauling; if you had just two engines, you could fly your cockpit and fuel tanks vertically like a rocket and leave behind all the wings and structural bits. You have too few intakes to get up to very high altitudes, although there\u0027s enough rocket fuel to make up for it. Speaking of which, there\u0027s no rocket engines.

Although the nose feels heavy and the pitch trim was working hard at the end. Your CoM is nearly in the center of your ship, which is actually pretty good, and you have a LOT of wing and engine mass behind your CoM. But your CoL is so far forward because you\u0027re using wing sections to create the forward hull. This is going to be a problem with this design and you might have to find something useful to use as ballast up front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: By the way, I flew in stock Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I recommend more intakes. Four intakes for eight engines is not enough. I\u0027m not saying you need to cover your jet with intakes. I find three per engine to usually be enough, but some people use a lot more. You should probably have at least one per engine though. You could slide a couple radials in between the wings or in that little pocket between the main body and the inboard wing engines. Remember, they don\u0027t have to be directly connected to your engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t think you have enough pitch control. You have a lot of elevons on the wings, and they are what is causing your wings to flex so much during takeoff. However, they are closer to your CoM and aren\u0027t giving you nearly as much pitch as the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I locked the outboard most elevon on the top and bottom wing and the wings didn\u0027t flex nearly as much on takeoff. If you offload some of the pitch control from your wings, they won\u0027t flex as much and you might be able to delete some struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Try adding some inline reaction wheels somewhere (maybe in the nose?). They may help your pitch trim keep up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You could consider adding a canard design and that would do wonders for your pitch, but I think this is a bad idea because it will shift your CoL forward a lot. However, depending on how you do it, it might also shift your CoM forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your CoL is sitting a little high compared to your CoM. I think for a ship this heavy and draggy, having a high CoL is causing what little pitch control you have to work extra hard. Try shifting the wing (or tail, because it\u0027s probably easier) down to lower your CoL and see how that works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Recess your cluster of four engines forward into the main body some. This will move the CoM forward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Your ship is so large, you actually don\u0027t need as much ballast as you have up front. You can fly it mostly neutrally stable (with the CoM and CoL in the same spot). Your ship has so much inertia that if you improve your pitch control, you will be able to hand fly and keep it from going out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make a sandwich tail (similar to your wings) or add more tail area (with control surfaces).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Replace the large control surface on the tail with 4 or 5 small control surfaces. This will boost your tail lift from 1.4 to 5.0, which will move your CoL back some and increase your pitch authority at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. I don\u0027t know if any of that will be helpful, but you have a beautiful ship and it flies pretty good below about 18,000 m. I tried adding intakes and messing with the tail a little and managed to get it up to 28,000 m at something like 1450 m/s. So I think you have a solid design that you can work off of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-16T03:50:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2014 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
