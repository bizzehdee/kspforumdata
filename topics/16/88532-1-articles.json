I noticed the wings on the first craft are at a slight upward angle, this means the landing gear mounted on the engines are out of alignment, the camber on them are most likely canted outward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with that said, the last aircraft will not fly well at all, due to the CoL being so far to the rear of the craft. I would see about getting some of the mass to move towards the rear of the craft, if you want to maintain that design shape, otherwise you would have to move the wings forward to a more \u0022traditional\u0022 design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the landing gear being to close to the back of the plane on the first one, its a tail dragger people. As long as the main gear are longer than the tail gear it will have a positive AoA for take off.
