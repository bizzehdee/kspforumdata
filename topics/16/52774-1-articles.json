When you activate them the covering blows off in two directions, so when you have them grouped like this the covering from one engine can slam into another and destroy it. I\u0027m not sure exactly what direction they need to be rotated, just use Q and E or Shift\u002BQ/E to rotate them and keep trying it out until you get them in the right orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnthinkableThinker","CreatedById":83885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T01:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry using docking ports instead of decouplers on the bottom, it might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T02:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERefer to bellow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NSl8X\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

They aren\u0027t that powerful, sure, but when you\u0027re in space, you\u0027ve got all the time in the world because there are no drag losses. I only use more than two if I\u0027m moving something HUGE (more than one orange tank worth), but at that point a lot of people switch over to Skippers or Mainsails.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T01:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI liked having three LV-N on my orbital tug, but that was an orange tank body \u002B framework AND whatever it was pushing around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I got it into orbit with a kludged framework and radially-mounted decouplers that actually had my tug\u0027s engines free-hanging over the body of the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
