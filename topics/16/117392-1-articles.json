It\u0027s body lift, which is slightly different. Think of it more in terms of blutly ramming any object through the air at high enough speeds, vice a specially shaped aerodynamic body.\n\nAlso, can you be more specific about it becoming unbalanced?\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"ayana","CreatedById":105618,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T20:14:33Z","Content":"Going fast enough got a cyan arrow to pop up on one side of the craft, before things got really bad.

Which is... Interesting, considering it should be on both from what I see.\n\nI notice, however, that you have wings stuck to wings without strutting. That could be another cause of the crash.\n\nHave you tried using more struts? Because I think you should try more struts to see if it\u0027s a rigidity problem. But that\u0027s just my .9x thinking.\n\nAny input from someone who knows about spaceplanes?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T22:44:17Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t looked into the asymmetric lines from these pictures yet, but I can say from experience that the lines from the Aero overlay aren\u0027t exactly perfect. There are instances where the lift lines will go out the side. So if the craft isn\u0027t actually reacting to the lift in that picture above, then it\u0027s not really getting asymmetric lift.\n\nThe aero overlay was a debug option that ultimately was left available for users. So while it\u0027s handy, it won\u0027t always show exactly what the forces are doing. Though I think it been improved a bit from the 1.0.0 release.\n\nIt\u0027s important to note that there are lots of effects going on at high speeds. So seeing this one picture from low speed doesn\u0027t necessarily convince me of asymmetric reactions at high speeds.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Signo","CreatedById":103766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T23:06:53Z","Content":"The asymmetric lift from mk1 fuselage is a kind of bug I encountered myself and there are a few topics around about it.\n\n[Here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130344-What-s-going-on-here-Aero-overlay) you can have another example of it and [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129181-Aerodynamics-bug-discovered!?p=2114060#post2114060) the \u0022bug report\u0022.\n\nMy issue below.
