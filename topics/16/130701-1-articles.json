Since I might be travelling a lot with this, I\u0027d want it to have sufficient power during the long nights on the Mun. The drills are to add fuel for the fuel cell arrays, but it is also meant as a refueling station for any landers, which is why it will have the fuel tanks. It will have the solar panels for daytime travel as well, obviously. But primarily the fuel cells are to keep a constant power supply, since the wheels will drain a lot of power. If I am correct, the amount of all the wheels operating should provide enough torque when climbing hills(?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the metalwork is also meant as a landing platform, in case for some reason I want to add a docking port on the tops to utilize smaller landers, but I\u0027m probably willing to do a redesign as you have suggested. Since I am playing career mode, I haven\u0027t unlocked the large ore tank, which is why I have the small ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ll admit... the metal work is somewhat meant for looks.

Yeah, I remember visiting that page before I even joined the forums. I thought it looked familiar.\u00A0Actually, I was somewhat inspired by that design when I came across that. I tried to build large rovers before, but they were always impractical in my opinion. I guess you can tell by the way I added the platform and solar posts on mine... \u00A0not that I was blatantly copying, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMainly why I am asking how to land my design now is because we have to consider now the new aero and the fact that we may want to use fairings (or not). There\u0027s a lot of new stuff to consider so launching absurdly large rovers like that now seem significantly more difficult or impractical when trying to get it off of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T10:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew aero does mess with things a bit.

I then hang onto the 2nd stage and dock the rover to my propellent depot to refuel that upper stage, putting 1381 m/s back in its tank. I then fired up the 2nd stage again to get the rover to Mun orbit, do the deorbit burn and get it close to the surface. Then the 2nd stage runs out of fuel and it gets cut loose to crash onto the mun while I switch the rover to belly landing mode (there\u0027s a probe core under the rover\u0027s belly), do a 90 degree flip in the air and fire up the integrated landing engines to soft land on the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i64.tinypic.com/2607fbl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222607fbl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FyunchClick","CreatedById":143109,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T13:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to land a huge rover on the Mun once for a contract, that required 4.000 units of Liquid Fuel and house 7.
