The game isn\u0027t smart enough to determine the starting position of the landing gear \u0026 legs at this time. So, it defaults to having the landing gear light ON because a plane taking off from the runway must have the landing gear down. Unfortunately this carries over to the launch pad as well.\n\nBefore you say \u0022why not have it up for the launchpad and down for the runway\u0022. I have craft that launch from the pad right off the landing legs too, by default their legs need to be down. So it all boils down to Squad needing to add some detection algorithm that determines what state the gear/legs are in before launch.

Even if you used the state of the first leg or gear placed on the craft to determine the state of that button, that would still result in the button being correct more often than it is now. \n\nWith a lander, the legs will either be retracted for a rocket launch or deployed to launch right off the pad. It\u0027s not going to be very typical to have more than one set, since most people would choose launch clamps so they aren\u0027t carrying extra mass (not saying it won\u0027t happen though).\n\n With a plane, as you said, a tailsitter or a lander in a cargo bay is much more likely, however most likely the plane\u0027s landing gear would have been placed first, and even if it isn\u0027t skilled builders can use the game mechanic to get the behavior they want. (we do it for air intakes now, and that is much more complicated)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T17:21:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mythos","CreatedById":137308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T11:40:43Z","Content":"I\u0027m also annoyed by this double-keypress gear deployment.

If this is not intended you should use action groups.\n\nIt does sync. And a funny twist, the \u0022Landing Gear\u0022 function itself **is an action group**. It is located in the same tab as custom action groups (under the name \u0022Gear\u0022). The game defaultly places every landing gear in that action group and you are free to remove any gears from there, or add any parts in there.\n\nOne important thing is that all of the non-custom action groups behave differently, regardless of the action of the part itself (e.g. the landing gear has a \u0022retract/deploy\u0022 action in the gear action group, but gets synced with the group). These \u0022syncs\u0022 work only on toggle actions - if you put a \u0022turn on\u0022 action in there, the action group will simply trigger the part\u0027s action regardless of the \u0022sync state\u0022 (e.g. put a \u0022Turn light on\u0022 action into the gear category, launch - the gear says \u0022On\u0022, the light is off - press G, the gear group goes \u0022off\u0022, light goes on at the same time without waiting for sync).\n\n**Quick overview of what I\u0027ve tested and found out:**\n\n**Stage:** works the same way as custom action groups (triggers part action without any changes)\n\n**Gear:** starts on, syncs every toggle action in the group to the same state\n\n**Light:** works the same way as Gear, but starts off\n\n**RCS:** same as Light\n\n**SAS:** same as Light, BUT has an optional \u0022pulse\u0022 mode - can be turned on by the F key, and will stay on until you stop pressing the key\n\n**Brakes:** same as SAS - but this one can get more use as brakes are (at least in stock) only relevant with wheels and while on the ground. You can easily set up retro engines that will fire only when you hold the B key - which is usefull! Also, unlike the SAS, you can take out the brakes of wheels from here (so it does only what you want it to) \u003Cedit\u003EThe same with RCS - that stays linked to its primary function in the same way that SAS does \u003C/edit\u003E\n\n**Abort:** Same as Light\n\nWhile this might be kinda unintuitive, it is also a very powerful tool the designer can use to fine tune his craft\u0027s handling keys. Also remember that you can use one part\u0027s action in multiple action groups, creating a whole new mess level of depth! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T15:40:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 03:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneCash","CreatedById":81605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T01:20:09Z","Content":"Right now, the fact the parts start in a mixed state is a problem.
