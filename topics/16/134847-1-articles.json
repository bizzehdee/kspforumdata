I\u0027ve had this happen under Windows on a fresh sandbox game, just because the PC in question is the definition of slow and unresponsive due to who-knows-what background processes hogging the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the game slows down to deal with all the junk you put up into space, high part-count vessels, proximity to other bodies and so on, it starts missing clicks and/or generally reading your mouse input buffer badly. It therefore reads a click and a mouse movement as happening at the same time (even though it was separated by a significant amount of time) and thinks you\u0027re trying to click-and-drag the view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully the second problem will be sorted in 1.1. In the meantime, you could maybe try turning down mouse sensitivity (so that it doesn\u0027t register a shaky hand as being a click-and-drag). Otherwise you just have to be super slow and careful. I\u0027m not even sure you can turn off the (single) right-click-and-drag function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
