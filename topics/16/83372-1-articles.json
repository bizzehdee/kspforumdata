I am using BDArmory, BDynamics, Skillful (only the dll for switching when in flight) and SP\u002B (and some other mods) and Im building a Low-Medium (10km max or so) altitude Ground-Attacker airplane. It\u0027s quite large, and without weapons weighs 14.44 tons/tonnes.

It flies 200-250 m/s at low altitude (\u0026lt;1km) and turns very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s my question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I leave the engines where they are, or move them udner the wings? What difference will it make, if any? As long as it keeps it\u0027s manouverability and speed, and wont flip when taking off, im going to change the engine locations. The only fear I have is that if I do, it will be harder to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T13:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference is that putting the engines under the wings will change the angle between your center of mass and your center of thrust.

So the position of the engine on the wing changes how the different forces affect the aircraft. Not sure why, but I think it has something to do with that. Also thrust force is different. when flying straight there even. But when u roll one up and then bank to turn. I imagine the two engines would create two separate circles for turning, the one in the middle would want to go faster, pull against your own turn rate. don\u0027t know that much about aircraft, just guessing, always a chance like Jeb I might be right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Melfice","CreatedById":3143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T15:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming Moonfrog\u0027s theory is correct (which I think it is), then it may help to throttle back when doing turns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T15:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoving the weight of the engines on to the wings WILL increase the moment of inertia, so slow down your rolls, but that wouldn\u0027t directly affect the pull-up component.
