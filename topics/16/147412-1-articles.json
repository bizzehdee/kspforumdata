I don\u0027t know how you got down to the surface because I get zero fuel flow to the Thuds. I tried from the earlier quicksave but there is only just enough fuel in the previous stage to circularise, not a drop more. So that\u0027s a mystery. And the landing was heavy and broke all the wheels on the rover*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the Rover core works fine, gets electricity and can manipulate its experiments.
