You\u2019ll probably want a few degrees of angle on your wings so that the front edge is slightly higher, this generates \u00A0ore lift at low speeds but will eventually produce more drag at very high speed. You need to keep going forwards to stay airborne, but turning a plane is relatively easy- bank the wings using roll controls and it\u2019ll tend to turn on its own- and going up or down is even easier- just pitch up or down and keep an eye on your speed, too slow and you run out of lift, too fast and you could pull the wings off if you pitch up too sharply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding can be tricky even for an experienced pilot, so the best way to land a small plane is to stick some parachutes on it and pop those open when you\u2019re near where you want to land\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.

You\u0027ll need both horizontal stabilizers and a tail fin of some kind near the back, and sometimes a canard on the front can be quite helpful as well.\u00A0 Also, surfaces that are meant to control your pitch should be either well forward or well aft of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Put most of the weight on the rear wheels, but don\u0027t have your tail sticking out too far. Takeoff and landing are much easier if your rear wheels are relatively widely spaced and just a little ways behind your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, while your nose wheel is as far out in front of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E as you can put it. This also puts quite a bit more weight on your rear wheels, so they should often be one notch beefier than the nose wheel.\u00A0 The front and rear wheels should also be mounted so that your plane is pitched slightly up on the runway, so that your wings generate lift as soon as you get rolling. As was mentioned before, tilting the wings slightly up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E is often a good idea as well, as it allows you to generate lift while your fuselage is pointed directly prograde, which minimizes drag in flight. Having said all that, make sure your tail section doesn\u0027t protrude so far behind the rear wheels that it will hit the runway when you pitch up for takeoff!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Familiarize yourself with \u0022absolute\u0022 vs. \u0022local\u0022 mode when using the \u0022rotate\u0022 tool in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.
