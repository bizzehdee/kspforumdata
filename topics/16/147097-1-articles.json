\u00A0This is one of the major challenges of the game, but here are a few guidelines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Lighten everything you can, especially the stuff at the top of the rocket. \u00A0Payload weight exponentially affects the weight of every stage down the line. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Effective staging is crucial. \u00A0Dropping stages lets you lose dead weight of spent fuel tanks, plus the heavy engines that were needed to propel that fuel. \u00A0If you\u0027re building an Apollo replica, you\u0027ve probably already done some staging, but it takes a lot of trial and error to figure out how big to make each stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Generally speaking, when designing a craft, work backwards from the top. \u00A0Put together your payload, and figure out how much fuel and what engine you need the final stage to do its part. \u00A0For example, for a Mun lander you\u0027d need enough delta-v to get from Munar orbit to the surface and back. \u00A0And you\u0027d need enough trust not to crash into the surface. \u00A0Then figure out what kind of stage you\u0027d need to get that lander from Kerbin orbit to Munar orbit. \u00A0Then figure out how to get that whole thing from the launchpad to Kerbin orbit. \u00A0Note that your stages don\u0027t necessarily need to break when you move from one action item to another, though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Using the most efficient engines possible. \u00A0As I mentioned above, engine fuel efficiency (called Specific Impulse) is one of the key variables of the rocket equation - but it\u0027s not the only one. \u00A0More efficient engines make everything better, but you have to balance this against the amount of thrust you need, the engine\u0027s weight, cost, and other factors. \u00A0For example, nuclear engines are extremely efficient, but they\u0027re heavy enough to not be worth it for very small ships. \u00A0Terrier and Poodle engines are some of your best bets for general purpose, Kerbin/Mun/Minmus vacuum work, but they\u0027re not good in lower atmosphere. \u00A0I\u0027ve noticed that lots of new players (including me) used way bigger engines than they needed, adding a lot of extra weight. \u00A0But that may or may not be you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-When all else fails, you can add MOAR BOOSTERS to the final stage, so what was originally your launch engines and fuel\u00A0can start later. \u00A0But again, this stuff works exponentially, so this technique may not work for very long without getting into ridiculous size and cost.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to post any screenshots of your existing designs, folks would be happy to give you tips on small tweaks to make your ships go further. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-05T07:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a sneaking suspicion that spacecraft construction is not the only thing holding you back.

Essentially on non-atmospheric bodies the flight profile still matters due to gravity losses. You can very easily try this out by just hovering over the ground: the fuel will be depleted soon. The same principle applies if instead of hovering, you try to make a \u0022slow\u0022 descent (i.e. constantly keeping your vertical speed under some maximum). Or, to put it yet another way: if you come to a full stop (also vertically) 1km over the Mun\u0027s surface, you will accelerate again and have to burn yet again before impact, wasting fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you want to do, therefore, is to burn as late as possible with maximum thrust.

KSP is replicating a real-life problem in this respect. I also find that MechJeb\u0027s non-autopilot tools allow me to fly a more precise ascent than the keyboard alone, and for some of my rockets this makes the difference between orbit and a rapid unscheduled return to the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDelta-V numbers from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E will also help people give you more specific advice. There\u0027s loads of good stuff above about about reducing the payload weight, solid rocket boosters for the first stage, and so on. If you can give a breakdown of your delta-V expenditure (how much at launch? in Kerbin orbit? in M\u00FCn orbit? and on the M\u00FCn?) then people can look at a particular stage of your flight and see what they can suggest. For me, getting the ascent right and consistent took some practice, but the single biggest step I made was changing how I thought about landing on airless worlds: lower the periapsis of your orbit as low as you dare - 5km, maybe? - and come in mostly \u003Cem\u003Esideways\u003C/em\u003E rather than down. The lower you are in your orbit when you start to decelerate to sub-orbital, the less fuel you will use. Have a look at some YouTube players and, ignoring their rocket design, see how low they are when they fire the lander engines, and how they\u0027re skimming sideways over the M\u00FCn at hair-raising speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222742807\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147097\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221473082464\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144187\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ForScience6686\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, ForScience6686 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many legs are you using? \u00A03 should be sufficient for a small lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing in low, fast, and sideways for a fuel-efficient landing, I found it helpful to stay with 4 legs until I had several successful (as in, can use the rocket again \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E) landings.
