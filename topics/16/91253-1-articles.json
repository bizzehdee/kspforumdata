They are twisting due to the torque of the boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T21:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, here goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket is twisting because the amount of thrust and mass are high compared with the rigidity of the design. You can improve the rigidity by using struts to hold the tops of your radial SRBs straight and parallel to the inside stack. Basically, every join between parts is a place where your rocket can bend slightly, so the more places that each part joins to other parts the more rigid it is - hence, struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t unlocked struts through the tech tree, there are a few other things you can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse a gimballed engine or winglets near the bottom of the rocket, or add a reaction wheel or two. These will allow you to make corrective steering when you start to stray off course. However, if the design is too floppy, you could end up making the problem worse by adding to the torque between parts and making them twist further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to reduce the thrust limiter of the boosters. This will reduce the amount of force being pushed through the joints and decrease the amount that they twist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the same tack, drain all the solid fuel from your payload SRB - you don\u0027t need it to actually burn fuel to complete the test contract, it just needs to activate. Reducing this mass will again reduce the force transmitted through the joints and reduce the amount they twist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T21:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOff the top of my head, I got two hypothesis - I realize this is early career so not all goodie parts are available to you:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: The radial SRBs are not strutted up, so their thrust vector veers off a bit as they are not held firmly in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: The LFO engine, is that the LV-T30 that do not have Thrust vectoring or is it the LV-T45 that do? If the former, you have no way of controlling the craft as you got no engines that vector thrust, and the little reaction wheel torque on the capsule simply can\u0027t counter the force of the engines to adjust direction. If the latter, then I don\u0027t know. The LV-T45 should be able to keep three SRBs under control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deseoso","CreatedById":117455,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T22:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.

It\u0027s been found through playing, mainly from people doing big starting tech rockets, that the 3-way symmetry results in rotations like you see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA wild guess as to \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E 3-way symmetry gets phantom rotational forces while 2-way and 4-way don\u0027t is that the game\u0027s physics work in rectangular co-ordinates.

One of the things with early SRB \u002B Pod rockets is that the Pod torque can somewhat handle some of the forces to keep things straight, but once you throttle down the VT, there\u0027s no power generation and your torque wheels will loose effectiveness when it runs out of charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs was already suggested though, tweaking down the thrust level of the initial boosters will probably do wonders to get you higher and further without as much bending.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
