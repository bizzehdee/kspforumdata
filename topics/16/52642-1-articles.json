I finally figured out this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this an acceptable solution to landing gear issues? Does this count as part clipping and such, or is there a roleplay thing u can say that its built as part of the landing gear?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know i\u0027m just being fussy, just wondering what others think. Took a bit of normal rotating to get them forward facing, but worked on the runway. From the image u should be able to see what I did with the landing gear. The girder is simply rotated 90 degrees to lay long ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/1628/0ayn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220ayn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-11T13:13:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2013 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Moonfrog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Traches","CreatedById":79229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T21:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you didn\u0027t go into the debug menu and turn on part clipping, then it\u0027s not part clipping if you ask me.

A way to fix this issue is to just use struts on the wings so they don\u0027t flex. Otherwise, it looks like you found a good solution for a thin plane design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
