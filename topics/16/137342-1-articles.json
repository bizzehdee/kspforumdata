It only takes a second or two before I disintegrate. This typically happens around 22km, when the air starts becoming much thicker.

I have been adding reaction wheels to this final payload where I generally had them lower, on a part of the ship that would be jettisoned before re-entry, and it has mostly fixed the issue.

Some parts may create asymmetric lift even though they\u0027re behind the heatshield (F12 to check that). Wide and low ships are better than narrow and tall, but I know very well that it is impossible to launch such spacecraft easily. Instead of reaction wheels you can use Vernors on a long arm at the top (to increase torque, proven with Eve manned landing). MechJeb autopilot is much better at re-entry than stock SAS. If it is possible, consider splitting your craft in a few parts and landing each individually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Higher PE is better unless you would skip on top of the atmosphere a few times.

If you could do a retro-burn to slow your craft to ~2000 m/s that might be advantageous if your ship is only mildly unstable.

Also increase your periapsis around the 40k mark (such is substantially lighter than 31k). This will give you two passes more in order to do the complete insertion, but at least gives you a smoother increase of temperature than going into the atmosphere at 2800m/s (you probably will bleed 300m/s to 400m/s speed the first time to get to 31k assuming your speed was 3100m/s at the time you got to 70k mark - your speed will increase between 70k to 60k). After that you should be able to readjust your periapsis to have less elevation and come into full atmospheric insertion.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can also play with thrusters to control your temperature, avoiding scortching temperatures... but this is risky and forces you to have to extra fuel just to control your descent...\u00A0When I send probes to Eve I tend to set it (for instance) at the 80k mark with thrusters pointing retrograde. This allows me to decrease faster my speed when the temperature starts to rise, allowing me to do a single pass or two around the planet before the insertion (sometimes without having the need of heat shields... although I like to always have it as opposed to losing my probe when worst comes to worst.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes speed plays a significant role?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepends on the shape of your probe.
