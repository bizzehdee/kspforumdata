It has PB-Ion propulsion for interplanetary travel (not test yet). Of course, it needs refueling once in space, but that\u0027s not hard. Notice the wing surface area. 1 extra ton of weight can really cost you in the amount of fuel you need to start with and how big your craft will grow. In my case the plane needed to be SSTO.

You want the probe to be as close to CoM as possible, to minimise the change in balance after it detaches.

I didn\u0027t have any trouble with the above plane. But I kept the nose pointed into the wind at all times. After the flames are gone, I\u0027d give about 10 degrees up so I could keep about 8000 meters altitude to fly home. I know planes of just about any kind will flip out sometimes if you come in with crazy attitude angles. The one above does have a slight slip problem due to lack of large rudders. But rudders are really needed much for doing the heavy lifting. So I opted for not using large rudders. You can barely see them but there are four rudder control surfaces close to the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to keep in mind, is that this plane was designed to also go and take off again on Duna. I know the jet engines can\u0027t be used on Duna (no oxygen). Because Duna has very thin air, you need very large wing surface area in order to fly and land at any decently slow speed. That plan can take off at about 40m/s and land at about 28m/s on Kerbin. So I\u0027d estimate about 60m/s landing on Duna, hopefully slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t get into why my Duna mission parameters eventually changed to a rocket SSTO instead of a plane, so-as I don\u0027t pollute your thread with counter-plane ideas and arguments. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LegitBro","CreatedById":52801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T12:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the comments, I learned alot! though the plane I need only has to lift about 1ton into LKO.
