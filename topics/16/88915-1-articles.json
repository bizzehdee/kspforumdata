No asparagus-staged pancakes: have a slender ascent rocket which lands on a wide but short base. If it\u0027s hard to get the entire rocket to orbit with such a weird shape, you might have the bottom attached via a docking port.

I can never find a level enough place to land something that top heavy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeah, that was not easy. Took me 1.5h driving around in that little rover to find that spot. And landing on it was (like I wrote above) the most difficult thing I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve ever done in this game. Got square eyes, cause my nose was glued to the monitor that evening. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHilltops are often pretty falt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn another note:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally found some time to play today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after my first manned landing on Gilly ever\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IBziS7m.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IBziS7m.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attempted to rescue Jeb from Low Eve Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h0wg7pW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h0wg7pW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original plan was to take both vehicles back home to kerbin (that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s why the gilly lander\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s got chutes). But the inclination of the target was to steep, and the little tug didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t have enough juice.
