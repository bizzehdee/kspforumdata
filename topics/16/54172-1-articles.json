If you intend to drain a jettisoned tank in orbit later, a docking port will be needed. Otherwise, there\u0027s no way to get it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not know if there are any mods that may get around this (either by having a fuel hose that can be attached by an EVA-ing Kerbal or by some other method).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: ninja\u0027d - and with a mod suggestion, too.

If it\u0027s already up there, you\u0027re basically out of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use mods, there are several parts that can be used to transfer fuel. KAS (a mod with winches, fuel pipelines, etc.) can place a temporary docking port on the surface of a vehicle, and once connected you can transfer fuel through it. The robotic arm mod connects the mounting vehicle to whatever it\u0027s grabbing, which makes it even easier (although it\u0027s cheating a bit). And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, things like this are why I always put an unmanned control node, batteries, solar panels, and a docking port or two on everything I launch; all of my boosters are designed to de-orbit themselves using whatever little bit of fuel is left after delivering the payload. Those parts require very little mass, but they make this sort of thing much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T04:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts always an good idea to add docking port if you leave the stage with fuel. Add small probe and a couple of solar panels in a stage you might leave in orbit, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis make it easier to dock and it can also be used for deorbiting, 50 m/s is enough from low orbit or an transfer orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKas can be used to transfer fuel if you don\u0027t have the port.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sarke","CreatedById":93011,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T04:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys, I\u0027ll be using more docking ports from now on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
