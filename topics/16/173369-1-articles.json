I would love things like tips, advice, even some landing maneuvers for water. If you can help me, I would LOVE to hear what you have!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-02T01:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need enough wing on your plane to have a stall speed less than 60m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKill most of your speed, down to 120m/s. Descend to 20 meters altitude. Level flight. Engines off.

Raise the nose again. You should be flying at less than 80m/s by now. Now every time you see it drop another meter, fight the nose up. When you touch the water, if you do it well, it will barely make a splash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-02T01:24:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2018 01:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
