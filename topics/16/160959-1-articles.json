When your Kerbal gets close enough to an instrument, right-click it and then hit \u0022take data\u0022. You can get one of each experiment from each biome and store them in your capsule. You can also transmit the reusable experiments (not Goo or science Jr) to get some science, then bring the hard data home to receive full value for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, if you\u0027ve unlocked it, you can just use the data collection box (experiment storage unit).
