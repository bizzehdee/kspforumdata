However the volume of the ALSEP equipment from FASA is beyond the volume limit of the containers. Even in the biggest container there is just enough space for one ALSEP experiment. So I tried to change the volume limit in the KIS files, but there are some problems. I looked in the KIS folder for the same part, but in the partfile it says maxvolume = 1000 ,while in the game it is 425. Regardless I changed\u00A0the value, but there was no difference ingame. Any other way to solve this ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPartfile:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1yixp0fjqlp9glg/part.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1yixp0fjqlp9glg/part.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reaper_Works","CreatedById":160425,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T04:25:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfuel tanks have a glitch were they INCREASE the volume of containers... but the add mucho mass \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
