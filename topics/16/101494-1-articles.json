Aside from the fact that crew pods have some monoprop (which i myself drain as nothing uses it on most of my craft), is there any good reason not to use a vernor thruster? It doesnt even weigh much more (.08 vs .05, not that being massless matters at all), provides much more utility, and can be used as a backup engine when you have had your main engines shot apart by enemy ships.\n\nNow for very very small craft i guess they make some sense, but above 10t i fail to see why anyone would use the smaller rcs. Had they been more fuel efficient perhaps, but both have the exact same isp (vernors are better near the ground, not that youd use rcs on ground).\n\nSo, since i clearly dont get it, what are the advantages of the old monoprop RCS thrusters above the new vernors, which at least for me have more or less replaced the old rcs, as now i only need 6 at most for 90% of my craft, just 1 per direction, with reaction wheels for rotation (im not going to use fuel to rotate a ship if reaction wheels exist), whereas some larger craft such as capital ships before needed many smaller rcs engines, the 100-300t ships needing 100s of em just to rotate the thing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T01:48:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T01:14:24Z","Content":"well if you\u0027re someone who prefers running refuel missions, monoprop rcs is preferred (at least for me) so that the fuel payload is still full by the time you arrive on the ship to be refueled.\n\nmonoprop RCS are still useful for 2m crafts and small 3m stuff, but for massive ones, vernors are to go."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T01:15:51Z","Content":"Agreed.

I like the freedom to do my own missions and do whatever im in the mood for, making career not really that fun for me. \n\nThe extra fuel inadventently being burned isnt that big a deal, as 90% of teh time if im docking its to refuel, so if i do waste a hair more fuel, so be it. If you dont have any monoprop, that means that mass = more lfo, which means even more total dV, or docking, whereas monoprop is worthless for moving yourself unless its like 10-20m/s or something of the sort.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The only think I\u0027ve used a vernor thruster for so far is getting the nose of some spaceplanes off the ground quicker.

I also tend to build very few craft that are light enough that the monoprop engines end up underpowered for most of my deisgns anyways.\n\ni guess monoprop stil has its uses, but i guess for anythign but very lightweights, vernors are both less parts total (heavies need multiple monos per direction at a minimum), and dont require me to use rcs fuel, making my ships have one unified fuel system for everything from main engines, to maneuvering, to firing the mass driver cannons.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T01:36:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 01:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T01:38:53Z","Content":"You missed \u0022Monopropellant is extortionatley expensive compared to monopropellant liquid fuel.\u0022 (although Vernors are significantly more expensive than monopropellant powered RCS ports).\n\nI would have thought that the \u00224 port RCS thingies\u0022 are better for docking as they give omnidirectional thrust.

Then youd technically only need 1 more to get the last axis, making 2 parts to control an extremely lightweight craft. Still, vernors are 5 parts to control any ship up to the 200t levels. 1 backwards, and 4 to each side (forwards can be achieved via main engines). Also, the 4 directionals dont give thrust in any direction, just in 4 directions. From a part count perspective this can be good or bad, depending on what else you need to bring along (monoprop needs dedicated fuel tanks, whcih can be extra part count if you need enough of em).\n\nThe center of mass in my designs isnt usually an issue, as many of my craft have offcenter thrust to begin with, forcing em to use at least 2-3 reaction wheels to keep it going where i want to. So at least for my construction style, making 100% sure i have a thruster in like with cog isnt really important as odds are, the entire craft is already going to have some offcenter issues in teh 1st place."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:07:32Z","Content":"Two words: fuel flow.\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever used the Vernor Engines for anything.
