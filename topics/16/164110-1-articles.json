For those, you get full credit on the first transmission. For some others, each\u00A0additional experiment that you get back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (no matter how) will give you an incrementally smaller\u00A0boost. Generally, it\u0027s worth transmitting one copy of the experiment (then resetting the experiment, if necessary) and then redoing the experiment and recovering that second copy of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T05:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are pros to bringing along multiple copies of the same experiment, even on a simple flyby (but only two).\u00A0 If you don\u0027t have a scientist on board who can grab the data and reset the experiment (Materials Bay and Goo) bringing along one for both high and low space flight can let you get a larger science recovery then doing both in the same biome.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, the Goo Bay gets 10 units of science per experiment (leaving out biome multipliers here).\u00A0 Maximum value per biome is 13.\u00A0 Transmission efficiency is 30%.\u00A0 So, to expand on what Bewing said above, transmitting 30% of 10 (3 units) and then resetting the experiment with a scientist and recovering it will max out that biome in a single pass, bringing you up to 13 units.\u00A0 Mat Bay is similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you don\u0027t have a scientist to reset the experiment, you\u0027ll need two goos to get the full 13 units of science from the biome.\u00A0 Better, though, would be to use those two goos to get 10 from high, and 10 from low, and get 20 total science from the trip, instead of 13.\u00A0 To get full science without a scientist to reset, you\u0027d need 4 goo canisters, 2 for each biome, for a total of 26.\u00A0 Usually not worth the weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-06T08:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223141056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164110\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501973684\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166782\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RonnieThePotato\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, RonnieThePotato said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is my first time playing career mode, and I\u0027m wondering if I bring two of the same experiment and transmit both, will I get the same amount of science that I would get if I recovered one experiment.

The second transmission gets much less science than the first. Combined they yield less than recovery of the experiment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the most you can suck out of a biome is to do all the experiments and transmit them, do them all again and transmit again, do them a third time and recover them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first transmission will yield\u00A0another 5% science compared to recovery alone and the second transmission will give another 1% i.e. not really worth the bother. Whether you consider the extra cost/bother of making the craft capable of transmitting\u00A0results (power generation, battery, aerial, relay) worthwhile is up to you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever you decide, I strongly suggest using the mod \u0022ForScience!\u0022.\u00A0It runs any available experiments for you, resetting them as required if you have a scientist onboard. It won\u0027t cheat your way to more science than is available manually but it will ensure you get any science that is available without all the tedious clicking.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
