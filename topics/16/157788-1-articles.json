This flexibility allows the aspiring mod developer to make things work exactly the way he or she wants them to, given enough time and effort, and without that, we may not have had such a\u00A0great variety of mods available. But it also means that there are no practical limits to the \u003Cem\u003Enegative\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0impact a flaw or bug in a mod can have; your frame rate might slow down, your crafts might disappear for no discernible\u00A0reason, your save might be corrupted,\u00A0or your game might crash. A particularly common problem is for heavily modded installs to experience a \u0022stutter\u0022 every 5-20 seconds when the Mono/Unity garbage collector runs, because so many mods are running so much code and generating so much garbage that it takes a painfully noticeable amount of time to clean it all up. When this happens, uninstalling some mods can help, but you can\u0027t uninstall certain\u00A0mods without breaking your\u00A0save, so it\u0027s better to exercise caution up front.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T00:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222987567\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489704291\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175942\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crycyrc\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, crycyrc said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you all for your answers and precious time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71395-jarin/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002271395\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71395-jarin/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Jarin\u003C/a\u003E I might be interested in some information showing mods actually.
