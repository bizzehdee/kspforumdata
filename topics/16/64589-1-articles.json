I didn\u0027t think it disappeared, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, you can check if it\u0027s running out of power by opening the resource tab in the top right of your screen. It will show your electrical charge. If it hits zero, your probe will sometimes die even if you have solar panels if there isn\u0027t enough charge to complete the transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your probe is disappearing from the map mode (or tracking station), you can see if it\u0027s still actually there somewhere by moving your mouse to the top center of the screen. A series of buttons will pop up (as mentioned above). These filter the view to show you probes, manned missions, and a host of other types. You can click on each type to show their map icons, and each button has a little number to tell you how many of that kind of craft are active in your game. If your probe is showing up as debris for some reason, you can find it here (with the left most button).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could be more specific about what you\u0027re doing just before and after the transmission, or provide a screenshot of your craft, it will probably be easier for us to help you figure out if it\u0027s a craft design problem or a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-01T15:10:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2014 03:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gnaar_Mok","CreatedById":85261,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T17:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo strange.
