I have a rocket which i am using to send a fuel storage up to my station. The launch vehicle is well...terrible. It shakes all of the time and its not reliable. Anyway the Fuel line and strut problem. When i go to the pad sometimes a fuel line or a strut has not been attached. When this happens i go back to the VAB and the fuel line or strut is there, but it just didn\u0027t go on the rocket at launch! This causes great problems further on if you have asparagus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERob\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bogpad","CreatedById":70927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T11:43:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eare they \u0022just not there\u0022, or do they get a \u0022breaking\u0022 entry in the mission report?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only had stuff like that happen to my struts when they broke right after loading the vehicle, I didn\u0027t see or hear that either, but it was at least mentioned in the mission report. Parts not showing up on the launchpad isn\u0027t something I have ever encountered for my ships, though I might have missed it aswell, I rarely use fuellines, and I often use so many struts that I might oversee it if 1 or 2 are missing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T12:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robbii6\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robbii6\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe launch vehicle is well...terrible.

I\u0027ve had an actual bug where stuff looks attached in the VAB but aren\u0027t properly so at launch but a redesign or just a relocation of the offending pieces solves that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to reiterate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
