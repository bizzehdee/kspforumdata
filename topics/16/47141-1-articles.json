Well, Specialist290 and I have been working on a piece of code that was originally meant to simulate aerobraking, but recently we\u0027ve also made it work with a promising level of accuracy to predict surface impacts. It wouldn\u0027t be complicated to include the option of simulating the deployment of parachutes at a given altitude and have the program include the additional drag. However, at the moment the simulation is 2D, so that would restrict its usability to close to equatorial (zero inclination) trajectories. It would have to be expanded to full 3D for inclined trajectories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine that one way in which it could work is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You input your current orbital parameters (your current speed, altitude and periapsis are sufficient) while out of the atmosphere but on a reentry trajectory, and you gauge (by eyeballing) how far your current orbit\u0027s predicted impact point (shown ingame by the blue line, which doesn\u0027t account for atmosphere) is from your desired landing site, inputting this distance as perhaps an angular distance (something like: \u0022my current orbit would impact 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of my intended landing site\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The program then simulates the reentry a few times and tries to determine the periapsis that would minimize the actual impact point distance to the desired landing site. This would account for planetary rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) With this information, you change your current periapsis to what the program reported by means of a burn perpendicular to your current trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this would be feasible right now using the stock aerodynamics. Using FAR the problem is much more complicated, as drag coefficient (\u003Cstrong\u003Eedit:\u003C/strong\u003E) and cross-sectional area depend on ship orientation and geometry I believe. That would require calculating the torques produced on the aircraft, which is a whole different ballgame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the process I just described, while feasible, is rather cumbersome in that you have to pause the game and switch to a different program (or use a second computer). What would be awesome would be writing a mod that can show the aerodynamic prediction ingame. If anyone has some mod-writing experience (I have none) and believe it\u0027s possible to have the game display arbitrary trajectories calculated by a mod, I\u0027d be happy to collaborate to adapt the simulator for that task. I imagine activating the mod and have the game display the predicted airborne trajectory as a dashed line or something, in addition to the current orbit already displayed. Then, as you applied thrust, it could re-compute the prediction in real-time and show it to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-02T17:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2013 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Meithan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T17:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually have tried MJ2\u0027s landing autopilot.

Assuming that the craft is initially in a circular orbit of given altitude, I can play around setting the periapsis to several values within the atmosphere, simulating the descent, and reporting how short the actual landing site was of the impact site predicted by the game. That could function as a rule of thumb in the game: set up a maneuver node, lower the periapsis to the one specified by the simulation, and move the node until the predicted impact site in the game is X km ahead of your intended landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T01:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass is 16723 kg, according to KER.
