But if you want to orbit around a planet really fast, you can in principle thrust inwards while keeping a high prograde speed. From any High School textbook, the force needed for a circular motion is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nF_circle = m*v^2/r\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere F is the radial inward force needed to keep the circular orbit, m is the mass of the vessel, v is prograde velocity and r is the distance to the center of the circle. From the law of gravity, you get an inward force of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nF_inward = G*m*M/r^2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nM being the mass of the body you orbit, and G being the universal gravity constant.
