When loaded onto the launch pad or runway, it bounces/shimmies until the TR-2L ruggerized wheels break, or in a few cases the launch pad explodes. The base masses 46.5 tons, and there are 40 wheels in 4 banks of 10. Pictures below of the the base and the wheels. I have another similar mobile base with the same wheel arrangement that does not bounce until it explodes.

If you do this, you really have to make the middle set of wheels the first ones that you surface attach, otherwise you\u0027re creating a long lever arm of girders to support the weight of the craft.

The top middle cockpit and are attached to the battery in front of them, offset upwards, The tanks are radially attached around a central I-Beam connecting the two halves, and are in no way load bearing parts.
