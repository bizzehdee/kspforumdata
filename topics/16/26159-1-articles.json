Not long after landing, my Kerbals got into their rover and went off on an excursion. Little to my knowledge, it appears my lander landed in quicksand, and is now ~8.4 km underneath the surface of Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how can I get out of this predicament? Not sure if this bug is all that rare, has anyone dealt with this problem before?. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m guessing I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to enable console commands to disable clipping and infinite fuel?
