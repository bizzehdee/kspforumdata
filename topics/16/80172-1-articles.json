I can align the plane of my next orbit with Mun (to hopefully take advantage of some gravity assisted slow down?) or I can leave Minimus orbit, then do a second burn later to align orbits. Or I guess a third option to make both the orbit burn and the inclination burn at the same time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR, which I just thought of, screw it, and just leave Minimus orbit and just burn to orbit Kerbin directly and skip Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?
