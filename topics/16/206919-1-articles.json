It shows 11d, 03:50:30. But it is already 12d(shown in the top time box near to the warp indicator). It turns out the difference is exactly 1 day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked a couple of times with freshly created nodes and the behavior is consistent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the screenshot I caught a moment when the ship is on the maneuver node, so you can compare times. It is not a huge issue and possible to work around. I basically wanted to check, do others have this bug? Is it a known issue? And please let me know if you know how to make these values aligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002288.11\u0022 height=\u0022400\u0022 width=\u0022454\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/CwySW4q/image.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-15T20:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the off-by-one bug in the days and years has been there since the manoeuvre editor was introduced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"serg.bloim","CreatedById":143535,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-15T20:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-20T19:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe the UT counter is counting up from the start time with a zero index, but the calendar is date-based and starts on the first day of the first year (what\u0027s the 0th day of a month?) so T \u002B 0 years, 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes and 1 second is the same as Y1, D1, 00:00:01.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
