As i do this, I notice that if I burn RETROGRADE at the Mun periapsis (behind the Mun) I loiter in the Mun\u0027s grav well longer and the exit orbit looked higher. higher = closer to my destination of minmus so I figured this was correct... I had though, however, going in, that it was the other way around, that I basically peri-kick off the Mun and get higher that way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, while fiddling with the burn to come out closer to proper incline I scored a minmus encounter! SWEET!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I looked at the Mun and saw my trajectory and... that just looks FUNKY... is this about right for grav assists with plane changes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/35xpwIZ.png\u0022 alt=\u002235xpwIZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a consistent way to optimize these kinds of maneuvers?
