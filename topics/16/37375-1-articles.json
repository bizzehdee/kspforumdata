In other words, orbiting a satellite or station so it stays in Kerbol\u0027s (the sun\u0027s) light. This would be most helpful. Also, all other planets SOI would be useful too.

If you put your ship into a polar orbit, it will be in 24/7 sunlight for approximately half a year per year, split into quarter years. So following an Earth year, it would be in direct sunlight for 3 months at a time, for 6 months per year total.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T00:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe sun-synchronous orbits are possible in KSP because in real life they depend on orbital precession to keep the orbital plane perpendicular to the direction to the sun (so the satellite is always orbiting over the night/day terminator).

The orbital precession that sun-synchronous orbits depend on is caused by the fact that Earth is an oblate spheroid (its equatorial radius is bigger than its polar radius; it bulges due to the centripetal force of its own rotation). This means that a craft in a circular polar orbit experiences a slightly higher gravitational force when it passes the equator, and at the right inclination this can cause the orbit to \u0027rotate\u0027 about the planet. Kerbin is more or less a perfect sphere with a uniform gravity well, so these orbits are not possible. Venus, in real life, has a similar issue, because its rotation is so slow it\u0027s nearly a perfect sphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
