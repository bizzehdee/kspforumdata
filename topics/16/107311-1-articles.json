For instance, I\u0027m doing a normal career game, and I\u0027ve never gotten a contract to explore the Mun. Is this because I might have done some Mun exploring before the contract came up? I think I got an orbit or flyby contract first and did that.\n\nRight now I have a Minmus flyby contract. If I made a probe and orbited it instead, will it preclude me getting an \u0022explore Minmus\u0022 contract?

Given there are other threads reporting this - and its always the Minmus contract that\u0027s reported as missing not any other body - I think there\u0027s something off with that specific contract.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation: the contract system picks randomly from the list of contracts it has available to it, including Explore contracts. The list of contracts available to the contract system have prerequisites before they can be added to this list, and those prerequisites can include progress milestones, technology research, or facility upgrades. As the player progresses through career, this list gets bigger, and therefore the chance of any particular contract type appearing gets smaller.\n\nExplores will not appear once you have visited a planet, and given that your average player spends quite a bit of time in the Kerbin system, they have a decent chance of visiting Minmus before its Explore contract pops up, especially if they have unlocked rescue contracts, tourism, base and station contracts, etc.\n\nSo to summarize, the chance for this to appear is equal to any other particular contract, unless you\u0027ve visited Minmus, in which case the chance is zero, but by the time you visit Minmus, you\u0027ve unlocked enough types of contracts to make this chance much lower, resulting in players perceiving that this chance is any lower than it is for other planets, when it is not. The reason this isn\u0027t a perceived issue for the Mun, is because the player will not unlock as many contract types before that has a chance to appear. It similarly isn\u0027t an issue for Duna, because the player will pause for a long time before going interplanetary, giving Duna a greater chance to appear in time even given the lower chance to appear.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T01:00:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide**"}]}
