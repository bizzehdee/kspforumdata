You also use the 9:1 wet-to-dry mass ratio for most of the liquid fuel tanks in the game (say M=9Mo) so you get your final value in terms of dry mass.

While I usually just bludgeon my way into orbit, I do know that you could try making each succeeding ring of booster stages have more fuel than the inner rings. I\u0027ve made some with 4 and 5 rings; so in this case the outer ring has the \u0022tallest\u0022 set of tanks and each succeeding ring inward is less tall (has less fuel). This will help get you to a greater altitude than if all rings are of same sized boosters, as the outer engines get to work longer before time for jettisoning.
