So now with KSP 1.02 are multiple docking port configurations better / easier to (successfully) make? And if so whats the best way to set one up? I gave it a try and it didnt work....not even a little bit....but I\u0027d like to give it another shot."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T04:46:18Z","Content":"Short answer: No, it\u0027s still not worth it. (Or at least, it\u0027s not worth it any more than it used to be.)\n\nNothing changed about docking port physics in 1.0.2, so anything old you read is still relevant.\n\nThe easiest setup for multiple docking ports is to use one of the multi-couplers (the structural components that go from a single node on one side to 2, 3, or 4 on the other side), so that you can dock several ports at once.\n\nIn my experience, it\u0027s not really worth the bother, but YMMV. If I want a stiffer connection, I just use a Clamp-O-Tron Sr. instead of the plain-vanilla variety, and I find that that\u0027s generally good enough for what I need to do."},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T15:06:30Z","Content":"Alright, thanks. I use the Clamp-O-Tron Sr. too, and find that while it works decently well it doesnt completely remove wobble from larger ships, but I guess I\u0027ll just live with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:46:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alright, thanks.

Then you have a stress concentration with a big moment of inertial on each side of it. So if you limit the size of your modules, you\u0027ll usually be OK. However, a cross-shaped station is always going to wobble because the arms are heavy and way wider than any port."},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T19:14:02Z","Content":"My main motivation for this is connecting a lander to a main engine block on an interplanetary ship. While the main engine block is about the size of the docking port (a little wider since i use a Mk3 fuel tank), the lander is considerably wider (it has to be wide to be stable when landing). Initially struts keep it stable during launch, but after the first disconnect those struts are gone for good (at least on stock KSP they are)."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T20:13:59Z","Content":"My standard example for a three-port connection: [This vessel](http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/screenshot155.png) is just as rigid as if it was built in one piece. A good deal of that is due to the three colums strutted against each other, though.\n\nBuilding multi-port connections has become a lot easier with the rotate and offset gizmos.\n\nUsing them is as difficult as ever: you have to get the rotation just right. I wholeheartedly recommend Mechjeb\u0027s *Smart A.S.S.* for the purpose.\n\nYou don\u0027t have to use several senior ports as I did in that picture. However, the amount of thrust a port can take is limited; if you want to put more than a Skipper behind it, there should be a senior port in the center. The surrounding ports may be small or even tiny.\n\nFor stability purposes, it\u0027s not important to have many ports. Besides, you have to unbotton all ports when you detach the vessels. What\u0027s more important is the distance between them: the further apart the better. That comes easily if your craft happens to have outriggers anyway -- if it doesn\u0027t, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s really worthwhile to add them.\n\nAlso keep in mind that only one of the docking port connections will allow fuel flow, and there\u0027s no telling which one it will be. My experiments with a pilot connection that sticks out a little farther have worked more often than not, but it\u0027s still a gamble. This may give you the oddest fuel flow, leading to imbalance, leading to your craft going in circles.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T20:20:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T20:53:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also keep in mind that only one of the docking port connections will allow fuel flow, and there\u0027s no telling which one it will be.

Thanks Laie.\n\nJust came in to point out that TAC Fuel Balancer makes it possible to mitigate this problem."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T21:11:53Z","Content":"The docking port sr has all the connection strength most craft need. The issue comes when you have forces that result in torque at the more elastic connection docking ports give.\n\nIf possible, tug your lander while it has a lower fuel load. Also, unless your drive vessel lacks sufficient reaction wheel torque, disable reaction wheels on the payload. Having two reaction wheels on opposite sides of a flexible connection leads to positive feedback control loop if they are sufficiently more powerful than the connection.\n\nI once had a LKO pod retrial mission. After capture with the Klaw (on a sub tonne orbiter) I disabled pivot lock to align target CoM with the thrust vector. I forgot to disable the freshly revived pod\u0027s reaction wheel first. I thought I was going to shake myself to light speed!\n\nEdit: derp! Forgot to answer OP question.\n\nSimply make a sub-assembly with some form of symmetry for the multi ports. Then just use said sub-assembly for both craft. Any ports not placed at the same point (center vs others) will need distance adjusted, but alignment will always be correct.\n\nRelated: how do standard docking ports handle shear forces. I have this crazy idea to make a Mk2 tug design that can radially dock with sister/cousin ships for increased payload capabilities. Such a system would dock with a pair of inline Mk2 docking ports separated by a fuel tank. Would that idea be practical in game? I\u0027m worried about the shear forces either breaking the connection or allowing engine play and steering losses.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T22:39:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 10:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"}]}
