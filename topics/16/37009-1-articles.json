Get into a sun orbit and at a maneuver anywhere, that approximately intersects with Moho\u0027s orbit. Set Moho as target. You should now see Moho\u0027s and the spaceship\u0027s positions at closest approach. Now hold the left mousebutton while clicking on the maneuver star and drag the star around your current orbit to find the place where the closest approach is optimized.

This is possible, but it\u0027s very tricky to do well with Moho. Even small deviations from an ideal transfer between Kerbin and Moho can lead to very high delta-v requirements for the injection burn (I\u0027ve seen anything between 2300 and 5000 m/s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been to Moho many, many times, probably more than any other planet. For almost every attempt I completely ignored transfer windows. There are some tricks for dealing with the inclination change that have already been mentioned, like waiting until you are at the ascending or descending node to do the ejection burn. Those help, and can save you some delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the most important thing, at least I think so, is to just treat a Moho transfer like an orbital rendezvous. Do your ejection burn in LKO until your solar periapsis crosses Moho\u0027s orbit (it\u0027s best to do this so that you intercept Moho\u0027s orbit near its own solar periapsis). Then do multiple shorter burns at periapsis to bring down your apoapsis down a bit. You might have to make a few orbits around the sun to get a good intercept. But by doing it this way you can insure a near ideal intercept, one where you meet Moho at, or very close to, your own solar periapsis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, this method means that you don\u0027t get much benefit from the Oberth effect; some, or most, of the injection burn is done in solar orbit, far away from Moho. But I can almost guarantee you that you won\u0027t get an ideal intercept by setting up the transfer the traditional way. This is especially true if you are using a large lander, or other heavy vehicle, that requires very long burns. This method also means that your final injection burn should be much shorter, which is much easier than trying to deal with a single 4000 m/s burn near Moho. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use some tricks to deal with the inclination change, some are described in my Moho thread, others have been mentioned here, but those really only save about 500 - 600 m/s of delta-v. Setting up transfers the way I described above I was regularly able to go from LKO to a stable, 100km polar orbit above Moho using under 5000 m/s of delta-v, my record was around 4300 m/s. And this was done using all manner of different vehicles, from relatively small and easily maneuverable crafts, to ridiculously heavy things that took 15 minutes for the ejection burn (and took 5 minutes just to turn around).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
