I\u0027d gotten enough parts to make it to the Mun, and I managed to collect a ton of science points on the trip. I was keen to get some particularly big groups of science points back home in full 100 percent force rather than transmitting them at a reduced percentage, so I was planning my return trip carefully. I was able to fly the ship back from the Mun successfully, but just barely. I ran out of fuel with my Kerbin perigee pointed at 50k altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50k is fine for a return to Kerbin, because the atmosphere starts at about 70k, so it means that I was aerobraking on each orbit and would eventually reach Kerbin. The problem was, the air at 50k is so thin that it was taking far too many orbits to get any serious amount of altitude reduction. Pass after pass, and my altitude would only decrease a small amount each time. It was taking forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ship had no rocket fuel left, and no RCS thrusters because I hadn\u0027t gotten that far in the tech tree yet. So I couldn\u0027t use direct thrust to get my perigee any lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried something that I wasn\u0027t sure if it would work: I got out and pushed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pointed the ship in the retrograde direction at apogee, did an EVA, jetted around the to tail end, bumped up against the engine nozzle, and just thrusted forward with the jetpack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did take me a few tries of going back into the capsule, checking my perigee, then going back out again. Also at one point I had pressed CTRL-ESC so that I could get back to the Windows desktop, and this left me with a stuck CTRL key in the game, and since CTRL is jetpack-thrust-down, it made Jeb shoot away from the capsule at high speed. It was a tense moment getting him back to the capsule, but I made it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, it worked. At apogee, it took just a few rounds of jetpack thrusting, getting back in the capsule and checking my perigee, then going back out again. I successfully reduced the altitude at perigee a few K, enough so that the aerobraking had some bite to it, and I reentered normally and landed safely with parachutes. I landed the entire lander from the Mun surface, including landing legs and everything, landing vertically in a gentle touchdown. Total science points from the trip: 900! I had a great shopping spree when I got back. It only worked, though, because I was already on a reentry orbit path that was good, and all I needed was a slight tweak to the overall orbit. And small speed changes at apogee result in big altitude differences at perigee, and vice-versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it made me think of Leia chiding Han in TESB: \u0022Would it help if I got out and pushed?\u0022 \u0022It might!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"epima09","CreatedById":90003,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T02:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, i tried it too and it definitely have an influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i don\u0027t think it will help that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was above 150km trying to push my ship back to kerbin, but it\u0027s push was too small for me to continue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T08:23:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t saved any missions this way (one I did salvage by using the RCS fuel, after the main tanks had run dry), but I have seen a few forum posters who have.
