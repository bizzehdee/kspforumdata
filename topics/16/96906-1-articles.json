I\u0027ve found a lot of great tutorials on KSP, but the topic of properly figuring out such low trajectory (max altitude, speed and landing point) was somehow omitted by tutorialmakers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric drag makes things very complicated. For example, on a \u0022fly above this point\u0022 mission I tried ascending to 15 km and from there targeting the destination point, but the once atmosphere became dense enough I started to spin rapidly and got completely off-course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, can you provide the equations related to getting to a certain speed/altitude in the atmosphere, or just general tips on how to choose the right parts and control the vehicle?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bryce Ring","CreatedById":129673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T00:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to do empirical testing in sandbox mode.

I\u0027ve never really needed to use equations for them before. I usually just eyeball them (it\u0027s the kerbal way), or use space-planes, but that can take awhile to get a feel for. But now that you bring it up, I\u0027d like to know as well. I think the problem is that the KSP aerodynamics model is unique, and I don\u0027t think equations for other models are going provide the level of precision your looking for (could definitely be wrong here). A quick search surprisingly didn\u0027t bring up anything, which I suppose explains why you made this thread. Hopefully someone reading this knows the equations offhand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for tips, well, one thing to keep in mind is to ensure that as your ship uses up all of it\u0027s fuel, the center of mass stays in front of the center of lift/drag, otherwise it will constantly want to flip around. Another way to combat this is to use an excessive amount of RCS or SAS torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, if you are not opposed to mods, I know there are several that give you this information.

You just need to tweak the fuel quantities to avoid hitting 11km on the first flight, and adjust the thrust limiter to get the rest.
