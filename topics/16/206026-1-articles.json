So instead of putting two decouplers on each engine followed by bi-adapter I wanted to put these engines in an interstage which can be decoupled. Bellow is a screenshot so that you can see what I am talking about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DKQZltF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DKQZltF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow my problem here is I dont know how to decouple the interstage so that I am left with the clean lander above with engines ready to fire. I guess that I need to insert the decoupler but I dont know how. I tried inserting a 2.5 decoupler in one of the interstage nodes between the lander and the interstage plate but that did not work. Any suggestions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-18T12:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decoupler needs to go between the bottom node on the lander (probably the Rockomax-8 fuel tank) and the node you\u0027re attaching it to on the fairing. It might be easier making the fairing the root part, attaching the decoupler where you want it then turning off the additional nodes and reattaching the lander, then re-rooting back to the command pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have the Making History DLC you could use a 2.5m engine mount instead, set it to have two attach nodes for the engines and the bottom node has a built-in shroud (like engines do) which will work as an interstage without needing to use a fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-18T14:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something for which there is no straightforward way to do it in the base game. As Jimmy said above, the engine plates included in the Making History DLC are specifically meant for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have them, you need to use surface attachment to circumvent the lack of dedicated parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart by attaching the fuel tank of the lander to a fairing truss node, with a full size decoupler in between. No bi-couplers or anything here, don\u0027t ever use them in between stages, it never works. Just lander tank -\u0026gt; decoupler -\u0026gt; truss node.\u00A0 This leaves you with a clean, full-size node stack top to bottom without any of the engines getting in the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, rightclick the fairing and turn off the interstage truss. Not the nodes, just the truss, so that your attached lander is magically free-floating but still attached. Yes, it looks stupid, don\u0027t worry, it\u0027ll be fine later. Then, you surface-attach engines to the bottom of the lander\u0027s tank inside the hollow decoupler, in such a way that they won\u0027t catch on the decoupler ring during stage separation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if you want engines that cannot surface attach? Well, that\u0027s what the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/BZ-52_Radial_Attachment_Point\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBZ-52 Radial Attachment Point\u003C/a\u003E is for. You surface attach a pair of those to the bottom of the tank, which gives you extra nodes outside the main node stack to attach the engines to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, switch to the Move tool, select the decoupler, and move it down towards the fairing base until the engine bells are nice and close to it. Don\u0027t clip into it, that may not end well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, build the interstage fairing. Once it is closed, you\u0027ll no longer be looking at a magically floating lander - it is now (at least visually) supported by the interstage. Set the fairing to Not Staged, and it\u0027ll remain a fixed structure that never gets ejected until you leave it behind when the lander decouples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-12-18T14:57:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2021 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-18T15:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224066944\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206026\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221639839403\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if you want engines that cannot surface attach?
