Instead of having all fuel tanks directly attached to the \u0022engine block\u0022, consider adding them instead with docking ports. This way you can enlarge or swap your fuel compartment for different mission. The same goes for every other functional part of your mothership. It\u0027s a shame you if have to build a new one from scratch when you just want a larger crew compartment/need more docking ports/require a stronger engine cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Take into consideration re-usability. If you use decouplers to dump empty fuel tanks, you can not replace them on future mission.

You can place your engines in behind your mother ship in a conventional way, especially if your using standard sized docking to attach landers and stuff, can make your vessel wobbly. Placing your engines in front makes this less of an issue, but puts constraints on the future design of the rest of the mother ship since the engines \u0027backblast\u0027 can not of course not be obstructed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Think about calamities.

Be sure that you like this before you commit a lot of infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, nothing prevents you from reusing the kicker stage as well. See my own Jool-5 entry for an example (the design has flaws and I\u0027m doing it wrong, but it\u0027s an example). Returning it immediately (like I did, wrongly) will cost more dV than the initial burn. It\u0027s not that much fuel, on the face of it, but toy around a little with locked tanks and you\u0027ll see how it impairs your outgoing TWR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe better way is to still let it go off on a long voyage, but to reduce solar apoapsis just a little, so it\u0027s trip around the sun will last exactly \u003Cem\u003EN\u003C/em\u003E full years, give and take only a few days. That way, when it comes back from it\u0027s round trip and touches Kerbin\u0027s orbit again, Kerbin will be there for capture. It may be away for years, but it will still be home before the mothership comes back. If you budget 600m/s for the whole recovery thing, that will be plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T00:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general you want plenty of fuel, efficient engines (probably atomic, though ion can be fun if you\u0027re willing to turn on the engine and go do something else for half an hour), crew quarters, a mobile lab if you\u0027re going to do any science, batteries, solar panels of your choice, maneuvering jets, monoprop tanks, and enough docking ports for whatever shuttlecrafts or probes you\u0027re bringing along. Beyond that, it depends on your intended mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne very important thing to keep in mind is that your fuel tanks need to supply not only the mothership\u0027s \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v needs, but also refueling for any reusable landers. Even an ion-powered mothership needs some rocket fuel tanks if that\u0027s what the landers run on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally build interplanetary motherships for ongoing missions of exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations, boldly going etc etc etc rather than a specific there-and-back-again jaunt, so I don\u0027t really start with a specific \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v budget in mind; instead I pack as much fuel on as I can reasonably get up to orbit and then send tankers to rendezvous with the mothership at its current location whenever it runs low on fuel. If I\u0027m in a planning-ahead sort of mood I send a tanker to the mothership\u0027s intended destination ahead of time so it\u0027s already there when the mothership needs it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample for your perusal: This is the Phoenix III, a nuclear-powered mothership from two versions ago that I took to Duna, Ike, Dres, all the moons of Jool, and back home. It has eight orange jumbo tanks, each with a nuclear engine on the aft end and a medium docking port on the fore. The central column includes two giant monoprop tanks (primarily for restocking the landers, which need it to re-dock effectively), a probe core for autonomous operations, a large docking clamp (to dock with tankers and refuel), a mobile lab with all the latest science equipment, and a cupola for the pilot. The crew section (lab and cupola) is detachable and has parachutes and landing gear in case of unplanned lithobraking. During its original mission it carried one single-occupant crew lander and three uncrewed probe landers; my general method was to enter orbit around a planet or moon, send a probe lander down to the surface and bring it back up to make sure it could be done with the available \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v, and if so, send down the pilot in the crew lander. Ended up leaving probe landers behind on Laythe and Tylo; everything else was able to make it back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pFh60RpWnkI/VLHJbO1iTgI/AAAAAAAABRI/TrPulEYYwig/s800/P3_museum.png\u0022 alt=\u0022P3_museum.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnexpected bonus: I realized that by removing the crew section (leaving just the tanks, engines, docking clamps, and probe core), I was left with a reasonable utility tug for interplanetary hauling. Over time I launched five or six of these P3-Class Atomic Tugs and used them to carry orbital stations and ground outposts to Gilly, Duna, and Laythe.
