Unfortunately, I can\u0027t because balloon buoyancy. Is there any way to get to the space center at any time via messing with the files or a mod, or am I just gonna have to land the base on the ground whenever I wanna do something else?

But regardless one of the annoying problems everyone experiences in the game is that sometimes it locks you out from being able to switch craft or go to the space center based on rather unfair criteria. (i.e. the ship breaks, the game put your focus on a bit of debris instead of the part with controllable actions you could take to save the rest of the ship, and it won\u0027t let you use \u0022[]\u0022 or space center to do so until the current part it picked stops moving, by which point the attempt to control the other part to save it is moot because it already crashed while the game had you locked onto the wrong part.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only solution I\u0027ve found to this that sort of works is to autosave and then after you\u0027re sure it finished writing the files, kill KSP the violent way (i.e. in Windows, with the Task Manager, or in Linux or Mac with the \u0022kill\u0022 command in a terminal window.) Then restart the game and as fast as possible before the on-rails calculation crashes the ship, go to the tracking center and take control of the piece you wanted to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the game has no choice but to let you pick which ship to control by YOUR criteria, not its.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very crude solution and I\u0027ve only had it work some of the time. I don\u0027t recommend it unless there\u0027s no other way and the only alternative is disastrous for your whole campaign anyway so it can\u0027t make things worse. (Especially since the potential exists to kill the program before it finished getting all the final writes into the save file.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-03T19:12:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2013 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelled \u0026quot;it\u0026#039;s\u0026quot; when I meant \u0026quot;its\u0026quot;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T19:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using Hooligan Labs\u0027 airships, then you can\u0027t leave them in flight and go to the space center or another ship.
