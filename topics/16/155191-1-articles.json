If you look at the stats of the radiators in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, there\u0027s a number called \u0022max core xfer\u0022, expressed in kW. This is how much \u0022core heat\u0022 (which, again, is a different thing than \u0022regular\u0022 heat) the radiator can extract from things which produce core\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Eheat. It has nothing to do with how much heat (any kind of heat) the radiator can dissipate into space; that\u0027s a completely different thing and it\u0027s usually (always?) much greater than the heat it can extract via core transfer, so actually getting rid of the heat once you\u0027ve gotten it into the radiator is almost never a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you look at the stats of the drills/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, there\u0027s one \u0022required cooling\u0022 and one \u0022max cooling\u0022 number, also expressed in kW. Required cooling is how much core heat you need to remove from it with radiators to keep it at optimal temperature, while max cooling is how much core heat it is actually possible to remove from it with radiators. On drills, these two numbers are the same, so you just need to match radiator core transfer to drill cooling 1:1. The converters on the other hand are more complex. First off, they use the number stated as required cooling multiplied by the number of processes running, so you can max out at four times that number if you run all four processes (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOX, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E, OX and monoprop) at the same time. The small converter is designed to always overheat since it requires 100 kW of core cooling but has a max cooling of only 50 kW, while the big converter has 200/500 so you can run two processes indefinitely, but not three.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere used to be some weird things going on with foldable radiators, drills and converters, which led to fixed radiators being the preferred way of cooling (you wanted to separate the core transfer \u0022circuits\u0022 so the drills and the converters didn\u0027t interact), but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s been fixed or not. Either way though, I like using one large radial mounted radiator (the fixed, non-folding one) to cool two drills, or two to cool one big converter. I tend to do my mining on bases where there\u0027s truss or girders parallel to the ground, so I just put the radiators on the underside of the piece(s) the drills/converter is mounted to - discreet, takes no useful space, stays in the shade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I\u0027m not sure how engineers interact with this - they reduce heating, don\u0027t they, but by how much?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Can the core transfer stat be reduced by the radiator getting too hot?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Does core heating actually cause regular internal heating these days? If it does it\u0027s gotta be a pretty small effect, but I haven\u0027t really tested it - I don\u0027t have any mining bases at the moment in my current save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Is there anything in the stock game other than mining equipment that produces core heat? \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
