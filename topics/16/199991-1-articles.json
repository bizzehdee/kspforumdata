Can I do this, or will it invalidate the contract?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, it will make what I\u0027m soon going to do a whole lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, I have to figure out how to get a 100\u002B ton payload to the surface of Eve, back into orbit, and then to multiple other destinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfernoSD","CreatedById":208873,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T01:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes. You just can\u0027t discard the relevant parts of the vessel. The orbiter by itself will not retain credit for going there. That credit is retained within the lander. It would probably be sufficient if the only thing you retained from your lander is the probe or command pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T03:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically when you finish the grand tour, you must have a part on the ship that has done each of the things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be one part that did everything, or multiple parts that each did a single thing, or anything in between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can verify each step is successful in the contract widget while in flight.
