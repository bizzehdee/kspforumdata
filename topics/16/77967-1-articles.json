Now I want to bring it down. Is there any feasible way of doing this? Would it be just as simple as bumping it along retrograde with some kind of space-tug kind of craft that has a bunch of girders on it for the bumping?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what\u0027s a good way to ensure all my non-payload stages end up falling back to Kerbin? I like to design my rockets in such a way that the final payload stage ends up in orbit with a full fuel tank. So that of course means the second-final stage needs to do the orbital insertion, and once it\u0027s in orbit it\u0027s not coming back down. I COULD time it so that it pumps me up to just below orbit, and then do the final bit of dV burn for orbit with my final stage, but the timing on that is tricky and I like to keep things simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould some Sepratrons pointing in the retrograde direction be able to slow it down enough to come back down?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-17T22:24:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2014 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by guitarxe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RenevB","CreatedById":110395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T18:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I personally can help you much with the second part of your questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first part: well, that isn\u0027t more difficult than docking. If you have access to the claw, you can use that to deorbit debris. Just bumping it sufficently along the retrograde vector would work equally well, but is slightly more difficult, as you can easily send it spinning.
