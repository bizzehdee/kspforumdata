The CanadArm2 from the ISS and the Buran manipulator from the shuttle with the same name. The arms comes with a camera attached to the tip of the arm. This interface is also the one you will use to move the arm around. In order to grab other vessels both arms are equipped by a magnet. Whenever you grab something both vessels will automatically dock with eachother. This is necessary in order to be able to save and load properly. The arms are also warp capable, with and without load. Keep in mind that the arms can not handle excessive loads within a gravity field. Accelleration is also not reccommended. And finally, the arm will produce force according to newtonian laws, if you experience too much wobble, use the slow speed setting.
