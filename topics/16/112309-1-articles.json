I think its main purpose is to detect ejected parts, determine if there is a parachute, and if so to refund a percent of the amount spent on that part. So I\u0027m guessing that no, it would not work like that, because it probably doesn\u0027t save the debris in memory longer than it takes to catalogue what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s there.\n\nAll this is 100% guess on my part; a test or two would straighten it out pretty quick ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T02:54:29Z","Content":"No, Stage Recovery doesn\u0027t actually land anything.

However after my second post I kind of realized maybe he was talking about the other method, the one where you just put parachutes on and switch vessel focus so the actual ship will land.\n\nI unfortunately have no concrete knowledge on that. My guess that no, there is no way to accomplish what he wants. But I could be wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T03:25:49Z","Content":"It looks like Stage Recovery does some parts checking and some math in the background.
