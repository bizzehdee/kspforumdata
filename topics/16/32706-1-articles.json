You could always send a new kerbal crew up for your lander, as I believe the flags are sent with each kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you want to try editing, try searching for the flag\u0027s filename and replacing it with the filename of a different flag.

But editing it is pretty simple. Naturally, back it up first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flag for a vessel is stored in its command pod part. So search for your VESSEL, then within it look for the PART that matches the command pod that you used for it. Inside that you\u0027ll see a \u0022flag =\u0022 line. This is a path to your flag, relative to your GameData directory, minus the file extension. The default value is \u0022Squad/Flags/default\u0022. If your flag is stored in GameData/myflags/Flags/leetflag.png then set flags to \u0022myflags/Flags/leetflag\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth pointing out that Kerbals on EVA are considered vessels in their own right, with a single part (and that part has its own flag variable). You might want to get all your kerbals inside before editing the savefile so they all have the new flag. Also, this won\u0027t change any flags that are you\u0027ve planted already. Either take them down or update them too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T04:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
