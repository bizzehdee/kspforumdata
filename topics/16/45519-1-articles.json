Okay - this is a fairly common problem, and you have to treat it like a game of golf a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what you need to do is make sure you set your maneuver node about 150 degrees from the prograde direction of Kerbin\u0027s orbit (about the 5:00 position or so). Start yankin\u0027 on the prograde marker until you get a Kerbin escape. Zoom out, and keep pullin. Eventually when your path starts crossing Duna\u0027s orbit, you\u0027ll see the little encounter chevrons appear (provided you\u0027ve selected Duna as your target, of course). At that point, you\u0027re going to want to see what happens to the distance of closest approach when you fiddle with the node further. If you pull prograde more and the distance decreases, great. If you pull prograde and the distance increases, pull retrograde. I find that I often have to pull radial-in burns to get an encounter with Duna; that can be avoided by adjusting the position of the maneuver node itself, but you have to zoom all the way back down to your orbit around Kerbin to do that. I\u0027ll just say if you can avoid a radial burn, good. Now, Duna is in a slightly different orbital plane that Kerbin, so you should also play with the normal/anti-normal nodes as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t get an encounter on your first go but are getting awfully close, or if you do get one, pull your burn and discover after the burn that you don\u0027t have a Duna encounter anymore, DON\u0027T PANIC. Hitting another planet is kinda like a game of golf - you\u0027ve teed off, now you just need to evaluate where you are and plan what you need to do to get on the green (in this case, in the target\u0027s SOI). That means a correction burn. There\u0027s no shame in correction burns; hell, NASA did that all the time with Apollo. Same deal - though the earlier you set up the correction burn, the less delta-V you tend to spend in the process. Me, I wait until the ascending/descending node regardless of where that\u0027s at. Same deal - set up the node, play with it and see what it does with your orbit. Oftentimes you won\u0027t need more than 100 m/s of delta-V to correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about all the advise I can give you. Only other thing I would mention is that until you get it down pat, pack some extra delta-V into your transfer stage...maybe as much as 150% of the amount indicated by the wiki\u0027s delta-V map. The delta-V map assumes optimal conditions/a best case scenario, which a novice is not going to be able to affect (not without mods anyway). Extra fuel gives you room to screw up and still get there and back. Worry more about optimizing things when your skill has improved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerobraking for Duna works well at 12,500 m. Don\u0027t go below 11,000 or you\u0027re going in whether you want to or not.
