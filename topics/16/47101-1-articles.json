The engine has a very high ISP but a very low TWR, so it\u0027s mostly used for interplanetary transfers. RTGs get put on craft when solar panels would be less effective or just too much of a pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketScientistsSon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketScientistsSon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy second question relates to the science equipment.

The DSM mod has one, but it is very unrealistic for space exploration- no thermal panels. Alchemy Labs has a very W.I.P. mod for a nuclear reactors that does attempt to simulate the cooling aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith nuclear reactors, you can make big, very long range, high delta-V nuclear ion propelled ships. Actually no mods out there have realistically-sized xenon tanks, so I had to make my own mod to give me a realistic quantity of xenon (liquid xenon is 3X denser than rocket fuel, so a tank the size of a Jumbo 64 can hold nearly 100 tons (1,000,000 units) of xenon fuel!). I\u0027m using the nuclear reactors from the Alchemy Labs mod for these ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I just landed a nuclear-electric airplane on Eve that has infinite endurance and range, as it\u0027s driven by a nuclear reactor that generates electricity for electric propellers (the propellers are from the Firespitter mod, and I am using the reactor from the DSM mod- since there is no need to simulate radiative cooling as the aircraft flies in a thick atmosphere). I\u0027m hoping that the nuclear-electric airplane will be able to hoist a rocket up to a high enough altitude to get above most of the atmosphere, which is the primary challenge in launching from Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-01T20:15:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2013 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
