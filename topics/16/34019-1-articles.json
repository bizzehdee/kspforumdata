Not too far forward and not too far back. Basically if your center of lift is behind your center of mass then your plane wont pitch up as easily during takeoff. The same is true if your rear gear is too far behind your center of mass. AFAIK this causes the plane to veer off to one side because rounding errors in the physics engine accumulate to a degree where they create phantom forces. IIRC taking pressure off of your nose gear, will take care of that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: ....rear gear is too far behind your center of mass.... not lift sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-21T01:28:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2013 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.
