The Jool system is 100% conquerable without mining. Now, to the estimates. Looking at some rough Hohmann transfer window numbers, I would ballpark 5,200 m/s (assuming you start and end at Vall), not including delta-V required to get to Jool and get back. Breaking that down, that\u0027s Vall-\u0026gt;Laythe, 900 m/s , Laythe-\u0026gt;Tylo, 1500 m/s , Tylo-\u0026gt;Bop, 1300 m/s , Bop-\u0026gt;Pol, 600 m/s , Pol-\u0026gt;Vall, 900 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, for getting to Jool, you should consider figuring out gravity assists. A Laythe or Tylo gravity assist can mean a free capture into the Jool system, which can save a couple thousand m/s. Using gravity assists to get there can save another thousand or so, but is both difficult and mind-numbingly tedious, so I don\u0027t recommend it if you\u0027re willing to just throw some more delta-V at the problem. For getting back, it\u0027s advisable to try and take advantage of the Oberth effect and eject straight from low orbit of some moon, to the tune of more delta-V savings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope these things helped. The Jool system is one tough cookie to take on all at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"captainb","CreatedById":116685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T00:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm. \u00A0That\u0027s pretty close to my worst case scenario estimate of 5500 m/s. \u00A0I will have to give this some more thought. \u00A0 Is aerobraking at Jool/Laythe worthwhile or not really?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-09T04:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223049914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160372\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494290391\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022116685\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022captainb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, captainb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm. \u00A0That\u0027s pretty close to my worst case scenario estimate of 5500 m/s. \u00A0I will have to give this some more thought. \u00A0 Is aerobraking at Jool/Laythe worthwhile or not really?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerobraking at Jool is impractical to the point of uselessness.
