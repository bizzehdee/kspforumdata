This used to be a stable SSTO until the ever-heavier payload attached to the front forced me to add more wings at the back. It was only recently this instability happened, and I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a design flaw involving aerodynamics, game mechanics, or the new 1.0.3 areo model involved, or the fact that the MK1 LF fuel tanks are now way heavier, but if anyone can give me advice, I\u0027d appreciate it.\n\n![WFWuipEi.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/WFWuipEi.jpg)\n\n![TIMWz7cs.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/TIMWz7cs.jpg)\n\n![hwYCKqL0.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/hwYCKqL0.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T05:21:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T11:31:43Z","Content":"Larger vertical stabilizers required at the back.

The primary problem I found was the forward T-800 fuel tanks, when I removed them, became more stable. I add 4 more tail fins and a Elevon 1 on the wing (and have them only control yaw, the horizontal Elevons now only control pitch and roll, now when the plane cartwheels, it\u0027s mostly recoverable, but I still don\u0027t understand why the plane keeps spinning horizontally from medium left-right rudder inputs. FYI it mostly spins out of control when mostly empty of fuel, and payload detached. When heavy, the controls are sluggish and difficult to keep steady unless I\u0027m moving straight or pitching.\n\n![JV2Zw39M.jpg](http://i.imgbox.com/JV2Zw39M.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T03:27:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:06:34Z","Content":"That sounds like an issue with shifting center of mass - center of lift relation.\n\nTry [RCS Build Aid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-1-0-2-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-7-2).\n\nIt can show you your vessels center of mass and center of lift markers when out of fuel (and lots of other useful features to balance RCS and whatnot).\n\nOr, if you don\u0027t want to use mods, show us a pic with the CoM, CoL markers enabled, maybe once with(without the payload).\n\nThe issue is most certainly that the craft is not balanced when you you eject the payload - and as you burn fuel it can get unbalanced as well.\n\nIn order to balance your vessels, try this:\n\n- balance the payload on its own, make sure the CoM is a bit ahead of the CoL and that it stays there, even when fuel is low.\n\n- balance the carrier ship on its own\n\n- try to find an attachment point where both combined are balanced\n\nIt\u0027s not easy what you are attempting there ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nTo the cartwheel issue: try to move the tail fins as far back as possible.

I have a ram intake for every turbojet engine. Maybe the air is entering unevenly?\n\nThe cartwheeling happens pretty much at any low to middle altitude. I usually run an airworthiness test with the payload detached, and the fuel in the back drained so that the center of mass is slightly ahead of the center of lift (this also simulates reentry where I pump all the fuel forward). It\u0027s during these tests that I keep cartwheeling. I suppose I can move the tail fins further back, but because there\u0027s a slope on the surface area of the plane, would having the tail fins at a 20 degree angle would cause stability issues?\n\nWould it be better if I posted a video of the cartwheeling?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T16:54:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:59:43Z","Content":"Also maybe a thing to think about. Most planes (I think all of them but I will not state that here since someone will make a point of proving me wrong ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) barely use the rudder. You do not turn a plane using the rudder. If you want to turn left you roll the plane a little (or a lot, depending on how hard you inted to turn) to the left and then pull up gently. This is where the rudder is used, to prevent the plane from sideslipping toward the left too far since rolling to the left will make your nose slide to the lower left side. You can test how much your plane sideslips by switching off ASAS and rolling to one side, then watch what happens.\n\nWith the amount of vertical stabilizers you have sideslip should be very managable via control input. Trying to steer with your rudder is generally a very bad idea (exceptions are eg. final approach to the landing strip at low velocities or IRL countering crosswinds). I would recommend taking a finished craft file (doesen\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s one of the example crafts or from the spacecraft exchange here on the forum) of something that looks similar to a jet fighter craft and getting some practice with that. You will quickly notice that on most craft the rudder has very little authority when trying to steer, however depending on how well they are built you might be able to pull six or seven Gs when rolling ~75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and then pulling \u0022up\u0022 hard.\n\nAlso angling your tail fins should not be a problem as long as you do not rotate them relative to your airflow. What I\u0027m trying to say is tipping them forward our backward, left or right should not be a problem. However rotating them left or right will dramatically increase drag and might do funky things with your flight profile.\n\nA video would definetly help, as that would maybe let us see whether it is your input or something about the way the plane is built that is making it flatspin.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T17:06:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 05:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T17:34:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I suppose I should mention that I used to have 4 tail fins on this Spaceplane, but I removed 2 of them because they were unable to correct an uncontrolled spin, so I viewed them as dead weight (though removing them may have made the problem worse, I just don\u0027t know.
