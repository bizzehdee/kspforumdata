MOAR STRUTS is the usual answer; I\u0027d also build it so that the engines are sticking slightly into the floor of the VAB. When the game loads it, it\u0027ll automatically adjust it to set the engines directly on the pad. Some TT-18-A Stability Enhancers (launch clamps) wouldn\u0027t hurt either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wager you\u0027re using the large RCS tank. Those things have given me headaches in the past. Try strut-stitching your RCS tank to whatever\u0027s above and below it; that sounds like the point of failure. Alternatively, take it out and replace it with three or four RCS cylinders (four\u0027s got the same amount of mono as the big tank).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pupu","CreatedById":76649,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T13:45:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThx for all the help.
