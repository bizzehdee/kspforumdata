They are too high up on the rocket. Simply moving them farther down will give you a HUGE boost in stability. Your problem is likely that as they burn out their fuel the center of thust is moved ahead of your center of mass, which makes for stability problems on a rocket without control surfaces while in atmosphere (in vacuum it tends not to pose a problem).\n\nIf you don\u0027t wish to move your huge boosters you can also try adding some fins to the main center stack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T04:02:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Blu\\_C**\n  \nPicture provided"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T03:29:59Z","Content":"There are a couple of new videos focused on adapting to the new aerodynamics system in 1.0 as well which may help\n\nKerbal Space Program 1.0 - Launching Rockets To Orbit\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_q_8TO4Ag0E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nKSP 101: Very Basics and Orbit - Kerbal Space Program Tutorial\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLfOAoszOvg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"DrinkV0dka","CreatedById":69402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T03:30:30Z","Content":"From what i understand making the ship top heavy doesn\u0027t t help. To help you can press the modifier key (alt) and f12 and bring up the cheat menu. Then go to the aero tab and turn on an option that says something like, show aero forces. With that you can see the forces acting on the rocket, its represented by arrows. if the arrow show too much force one way then the air is pushing the nose down because of the weight.

In this picture is your payload something other than the capsule?\n\n-Unless you absolutely need it for large payloads, go for serial staging, meaning don\u0027t strap boosters on the sides and instead put them on top of each other, think Saturn V.\n\n-You want all of your mass at the top of the rocket, so that all of the drag will be at the bottom of your rocket.
