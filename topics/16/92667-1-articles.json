You are far more likely to waste more deltaV than you would have saved making course corrections to time your rendezvous perfectly. Another possible issue with doing it that way, especially if you are trying to reach a fairly high orbit, will be that the larger deltaV required to match velocities at the rendezvous point will require a longer burn, which will make timing everything perfectly so that you don\u0027t over or undershoot that much more difficult. Optimizing your ascent to the lowest, best-aligned pre-transfer parking orbit possible is a much easier and likely more fruitful exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-15T17:25:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2014 05:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T23:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022herbal space program\u0022 data-cite=\u0022herbal space program\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022psyper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022psyper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I use the distance from target to get it about 450Km away from my craft and then launch \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edo you wait untill the target has already passed you overhead?

I\u0027m sure it makes a triangle somewhere that you could work it out. I think if you go in to map view and look down over the north pole with KSC at the 6 o\u0027clock position I think your target needs to be about 9-8 o\u0027clock position. It does matter how long your ship takes to get in to orbit of course so theres that to factor in. Its always best to launch too soon than too late as you can go above your targets orbit and wait for it to catch up to you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust do a launch when the target is about 8:30 position and when you reach 10km do your gravity turn as normal. If you don\u0027t use mechjeb switch to map view until your rendezvous markers start to show up. The should start to show you the distance at closest approach from one of the markers - once it comes to about 20km you can go back out of map view and then switch your navball to target mode. You need to push your retrograde marker towards the retrograde marker or your target this will close the gap between your closest approach - keep them on top of each other and you will automatically circularise in line with the target - switch back to map view every now and then to check your closest approach time - you want it to be about 2minutes away - if its less keep burning full throttle and once it starts increasing start to drop off your thrust (remember dropping tanks will also drop your twr!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlyingPete\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlyingPete\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m starting to get better at timing my launches for a rendezvous.

Especially handy if your target it in LKO as you don\u0027t have to go in to the atmosphere to chase it down! If its too far ahead you can do a Hohmann Transfer where you circularise 10-20km outside your targets orbit - this will allow it to catch up with you. If you\u0027re able to - drop a manoeuvre node on your path and pull retrograde until the predicted path hits your targets path - then click on the node and move it around until your closest approach markers meet - thats where to drop down on to the targets orbit (DEATH FROM ABOVE) and dock with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T04:43:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a great video I just saw tonight on some real techniques the Soyuz uses for its redezvous procedures.
