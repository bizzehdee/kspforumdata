Although I would say you do not need 4 of them. You can get away with 1. Or use 2 at the most if docking an unbalanced system is too troublesome for you. If you have 4, it might be wildly uncontrollable at that size. I only use two when docking 40 ton modules to my station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, your real problem with orbital assembly is that you will not be able to get those docking ports lined up well enough. It\u0027s going to cause you control issues in flight, because the canards, wings, and tail will likely be misaligned. You might have an easier time later if you can figure out a way to get that thing into orbit as one whole piece. (There are lots of ways to do that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind that if weight is your concern, RCS thruster blocks are massless in flight. Also, monopro does not require fuel lines. So you can attach some monopro tanks onto decouplers on the first section you launch. Do all of the docking with that first section as the maneuvering module. Then decouple the tanks after docking operations are complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-04T17:30:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2014 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luckyhendrix","CreatedById":78280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T17:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the suggestions, I didn\u0027t know the claw could attach to everything,and the idea of using KAS might be feasible as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso for the alignement of docking port , I use the docking washer of infernal robotics to line up everything after docking \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luckyhendrix","CreatedById":78280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T22:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELittle update, I have constructed a tiny rcs space tug with a claw in front, I have touched part of my ship in every way possible , but not grabbing :/ ? are you supposed to come in slow or fast when using the calw ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T00:45:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EArm the claw (so that you see the grabby bits), come in slowly like you would for a docking, and be sure the claw is pointing at the surface it\u0027s going to be clawing, not angled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T00:50:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to be going fairly slowly but, more importantly, I believe that all 4 points of the claw need to touch the target for it to grab hold.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T01:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a ship that small, I would actually recommend keeping the speed up just a little so the claw makes full contact.
