However it is option 1 that is slighlt more efficient. Launch as if you were going into LKO but once your apoapsis reaches LKO alltitude just keep burning horizontally. Your apoapsis will then swing round to the farside of kerbin and you just need to push it up to GKO (Geostationary Kerbin Orbit) altitude. All this can be done whilst your periapsis never leaves the atmosphere (Therefore at apoapsis it requiring less Dv to raise it past LKO alltitude).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the difference is only small, as the benefit arises from the slightly lower altitude at which you make the burn to reach GKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Set Mech jeb to reach GKO orbit in the ascent guidance, with a turn end altitude of 80 km to see an illistration of the ascent profile i\u0027m talking about)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T10:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost efficient approach (but hard to pull accurately and not very practical) is bielliptic transfer with direct launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ launch, raise your periapsis to about -100 km (minus one hundred, i.e. still under the ground) and your apoapsis all the way up to the SOI boundary\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ coast to apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/ raise your periapsis to the stationary orbit level\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4/ coast to periapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5/ circularize\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-28T11:29:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2014 11:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T11:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOberthing it eh Kasuha?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wrexecute","CreatedById":75580,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T11:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, I was just firing them straight up like the first way. That explanation helps a lot. Kinda combines both ways, skipping LKO circularization. It even trimmed down my rocket a little, as it was slightly overpowered for the sake of just getting to 2868km very quickly before any major longitudinal changes relative to KSC. With a normal-ish launch profile, some patience and a 4hr period at 2868km, I only need to wait a few orbits before I\u0027m back over KSC at the right altitude for an initial release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T14:55:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBielliptic transfers do minimize delta V usage but they are tedious for what amounts to at most 3% savings versus a similar Hohmann transfer.
