I max out the speed modifier and weeks go by with the ship just sitting there making noise and nothing else happening, fuel isn\u0027t draining and it isn\u0027t animating any rocket exhaust, but it still makes noise and shows indicators. Pressing space bar again makes the ship then fall off of its launch stilts...
