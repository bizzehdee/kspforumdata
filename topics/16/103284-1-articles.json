I\u0027m trying to get 6 satellites into a hexagonal arrangement in a 6000km orbit, and launched them into as close a position as I can get given our standard floating-point, velocity changes depending on orientation nonsense. To get them locked into a constellation that won\u0027t drift into uselessness within a couple years, I\u0027m trying to lock down the orbital parameters in the persistent.sfs file. Did a bit of figuring, and worked out that the target orbital period is 56690s, and (obviously) there should be a 60 degree angle between the sats. Here\u0027s an example of one of their entries:\n\n    ORBIT\t{\t\tSMA = 6600000\t\tECC = 0\t\tINC = 0\t\tLPE = 0\t\tLAN = 60\t\tMNA = 0\t\tEPH = 9448.333333\t\tREF = 1\t}\n\nI entered the appropriate LAN values as multiples of 60, the EPH values as multiples of 9448.333333 (56690/6), and the \u0022lon\u0022 values in the VESSEL section equal to the LAN. This resulted in all 6 satellites being in exactly the same place in the orbit in a giant pile-up. I\u0027ve found lots of guides for 3 satellites in a kerbosynchronous orbit, but I\u0027m having some trouble working out the equations that will help me calculate the relevant values to get an arbitrary number of satellites at an arbitrary altitude.\n\nYes, I know I can use HyperEdit to get them there more easily, but I like doing the math. Yes, I know that some people will consider this \u0022cheating\u0022, but I rationalize it as automated, preprogrammed station-keeping.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T00:01:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RabidMonkey**"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T23:50:54Z","Content":"The game ignores surface Longitude and latitude when you\u0027re orbiting.\n\nWhat you want to do is keep all the orbit shape and orbit-orientation parameters the same (Semimajor Axis, Eccentricity, Inclination, Argument of Periapsis, Longitude of the Ascending Node) and only fiddle with the ones that set an object\u0027s /position on its orbit/, (Mean anomaly at Epoch, and Epoch).\n\nFor six satellites, it\u0027s easiest to do one of two things.\n\n1.

Reading your post, I realized - if the LAN was offset by the same arc that would be traversed in the EPH, of course I\u0027l get a pile-up. Set the LAN of them all to 0, left EPH alone, and they\u0027re in perfect alignment.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"godefroi","CreatedById":101728,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T04:22:45Z","Content":"Also, see my proto-mod, OrbitSnap: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113592-WIP-OrbitSnap-Keep-your-RemoteTech-commsats-in-proper-formation%21?highlight=orbitsnap](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113592-WIP-OrbitSnap-Keep-your-RemoteTech-commsats-in-proper-formation%21?highlight=orbitsnap)\n\nThis mod will keep your satellites in perfect formation, even if you visit them (for example, to re-point dishes).
