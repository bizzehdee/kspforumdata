I shouldn\u0027t have had to google to this thread to figure this out.\u00A0 May I suggest the description of this as \u0022alpha1\u0022 is horribly bad. Abbreviating \u0022alphanumeric\u0022 to \u0022alpha\u0022 when actually referring to something that is numeric instead of alpha is a lot like abbreviating \u0022yes or no\u0022 to \u0022yes\u0022 when what you actually mean is the \u0022no\u0022 part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
