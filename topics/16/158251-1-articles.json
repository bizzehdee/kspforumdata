As a note though, this shuttle has a nice bit of energy in it. While fiddling around I was getting orbits out past Duna before dropping he main tank- I like the design!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you mention, the main issue is the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E trying to manage the gimbal, and this isn\u0027t the first large craft I\u0027ve heard of that\u0027s become trickier to fly in 1.2. Control of yaw and roll are all heavily coupled with the vectors\u0027 gimbal, and KSP is getting in to harmonic oscillations trying to damp both of them at once. I was hoping that tossing some vernors in key places (wingtips) would give the craft enough control to not get into the wiggles to begin with, but no such luck. I have found a handful of incremental improvements to make it a bit more manageable though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe main tank has a flat bottom, which has become far draggier in the latest version. Putting an empty but somewhat pointy fairing on it helps reduce its drag, which seemed to help the wobble slightly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can increase the flow priority of the main tank\u0027s lower sections to help keep the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E more inline with the thrust. You can do this by right-clicking the bottom section and increasing the flow-priority by 2 and the middle section by 1. It helps a bit, but not much.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe vectors can be tilted one tick further down (more straight) without hurting launch conditions at all. It helps later on a little bit if the wiggles get more severe.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried a handful of other things, but nothing in my toolbox is getting rid of the wiggles satisfactorily. I hope the little improvements above make it a bit more manageable for you. And hopefully someone will have a magic bullet for this problem. There\u0027s a huge amount of expertise in the help forums, so I\u0027ll keep my fingers crossed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Inspiration struck, and I found an ok solution. Turning off the gimbal on the lower two vector will keep it from rocking too much on the way up.

Rotating this into the tank above it will keep it aesthetically pleasing and aerodynamically streamlined. You\u0027ll notice the batteries placed every 4, it\u0027s important these are strutted (which is tricky) or autostrutted (which is easy) in order to keep it from producing its own oscillations. If you don\u0027t want these providing undue advantages to your maneuverability in orbit (assuming you haven\u0027t dropped the tank yet) they can be put on a toggling action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot the most elegant solution, but it makes the launch a gentle and pleasant one!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still hope someone has a more direct solution...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mart","CreatedById":104289,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T20:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell yeah this might just be on the edge of being cheaty but if you take a look inside the nosecone you\u0027ll find 2 wings clipped so....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is great, thanks for all your investigations and time !!

If you don\u0027t mind your drop tank being a bit larger, you could actually leave the reaction wheels hanging downwards and just cover them with fairing to look nice. You have plenty of thrust and deltaV and thrust to get away with the added weight and drag. That would spare the moral crisis of clipping, which is nice. Ok, that\u0027s it!
