But I can\u0027t find the exact pictures anymore. Just try to forget that heatshield is on there and focus on the rest of the design as in how it looks aerodynamically. Without that heatshield that one glides farther then my new design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I made something similar, that glides just as straight, but a whole lot less far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo test the glideability of the vehicle I hyperedit it 10000m above the runway coordinates and add 400m/s velocity with hyperedit in all my test runs and aim for the runway island to see how far it can glide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10000m altitude with the given speed is about the same altitude and speed whereby I know I can detach my inflatable heatshield with a rocket and commence gliding operations.

A action group will fire away that heatshield and reveal the nosecone underneath.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn my old design this was a flat surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the first picture you can see that I build the main fairing into a bulletshape. My logic that this would push airaway, also reducing aerodynamic load on the fairing below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I did some tests.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems that fairings do not interact with aerodynamics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I do a test flight whereby I jettison the lower fairing (the wide one) there is no change to my gliding velocity at all. It\u0027s as if fairings do not induce aerodynamic load at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this a joke or something, shouldn\u0027t there be interference between my fairing and the air.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn any way, why could my old design glide further, which to me looked less aerodynamic, and this on glides 7 kilometers short.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe fun thing is, this design is lighter then my previous design. It did had other wings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I realized I couldn\u0027t use the FAT-455 Aeroplane wings because they would burn up during Eve re-entry. So I needed the BIG-S ones as you can see on the pic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are angled, but they do have a few more Lift rating when put together then the FAT-455 Aeroplane wings.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd since this vehicle is lighter, I would actually need less lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happens is that this vehicle slows down to around 100 m/s up to 45 m/s in between 10000meters up to sea level. A little more slow then my previous design.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich means it\u0027s somehow less aerodynamic, even although it looks more aerodynamic.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I don\u0027t expect such a monstrosity to glide far, but I would atleast want it to do similar to my old design.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd my question is, if you can see it (I don\u0027t) why this design glides worse and what I may be able to replicate as I did on my old design to meet the same gliding specifications.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-25T15:59:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2016 03:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T17:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has been a bug with struts that make them cause an immense amount of drag.

Like more than 30%. \u00A0 \u00A0Control surfaces are like small wings and drag goes up exponentially at large angles. \u00A0 To keep the angle of deflection down, fit more canards. \u00A0It this results in the plane being able to overstress itself and break up at high G, or stall itself too easily at low speed, then right click and lower the control surface authority in the tweakables. \u00A0 \u00A0Two canards at 50% authority generate\u00A0less drag than one at 100% if it\u0027s mostly maxed out. \u00A0 \u00A0Obviously make sure this doesn\u0027t move your centre of lift too far forward ofc, you might need to shift the wings back to allow for the extra canards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, this is where it helps to have a CG that doesn\u0027t move much as the tanks empty that way you can be stable throughout the flight without being excessively nose heavy at any point and suffer with trim drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I\u0027ve never come up with a mk3 design that could manage this and still be able to flow fuel to all its engines without ducts or game mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-25T22:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152027-aerogav/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152027\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/152027-aerogav/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@AeroGav\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a issue, with the aerodynamics overlay function.
