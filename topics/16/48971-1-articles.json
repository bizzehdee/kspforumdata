Unlocked it last night but just started messing with it. I designed a craft, but the nose cone in front and straight to the runway...

Recovered the craft without flying it only to find that on the recovery screen it says \u002714 science added\u0027 , only 10% of what I should have got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother try, flew the craft over the ocean east of KSC, ran the experiment, kept the data, turned around, landed and recovered the craft.

I\u0027ve sent a ship to orbit Kerbol and when it reached it ran a gravity scan. Scans revealed a total output of 660 science points with 60% transmission efficiency and 120 (can\u0027t remember the exact number) mits of data. After transmitting the data I got 36 science (or even 12.4, maybe it was an another experiment). Also not only scientific output seems to be decreased, but also data transmitted. After executing transmission the data transmitted in report was 36 points instead of 60. At first I thought it depends on the antennae type\\stupidity\\distance but neither of them affects it because even recovery gives the same low result as that.
