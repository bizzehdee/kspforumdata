Kerbin surface velocity changes the angle slightly, adding a bit of prograde velocity to your orbital velocity relative to surface velocity.

The most efficient way to do a 90 degree plane change from a circular orbit to another circular orbit at right angles would be:\n\n1) accelerate prograde to escape velocity - 0.000000000001\n\n2) wait until apoapsis is achieved. Enact your plane change, the cost should be ZERO (or a very good facsimile of it).

After reading MartinKitFox\u0027s (absolutely correct) post, I went back and reread what you were trying to do: Get to low Kerbol polar orbit. I missed that.\n\nThough correct, I didn\u0027t think MartinKitFox\u0027s post was relevant because you said you didn\u0027t want to burn way out of the way (ie, to Jool) to reduce delta-v costs.\n\nTurns out his post is actually on the money because for a Kerbin to low Kerbol orbit, you are already on an extremely elliptical orbit at apoapsis.\n\nWith no fancy slingshots, just a single ejection burn:\n\n1) LKO to LKerbolO. Use the vis-viva equation. \n\nAP = radius of Kerbin\u0027s orbit\n\nPE = radius of Kerbol \u002B 1000 km\n\nv = sqrt(mu (2/AP \u002B 2/(AP \u002B PE)))\n\nv = 1807 m/s\n\nSo when you exit Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you want to be going 1.8 km/s on a 90 degree inclined orbit. (Might want to check my math.)\n\n2) To get to a Kerbol polar orbit going 1.8 km/s at Kerbin, you need to shed Kerbin\u0027s 9.3 km/s (9284.5 m/s) orbital velocity.\n\nSo before crossing Kerbin\u0027s SOI, you need to be going 9.3 km/s west, 1.8 km/s north = 9.5 km/s inclined by 169 degrees.\n\n9.5 = sqrt(9.3^2 \u002B 1.8^2), 169 = atan2(1.8,-9.3)\n\nJust trig.\n\nSo the plane change is cheap (9.5 - 9.3 = 0.2 km/s) since we combined it with a huge change in periapsis.\n\n3) To get to the target velocity at SOI, you need to be going the target SOI velocity plus Kerbin escape velocity from LKO of approximately 1km/s.\n\nSo launch into a Kerbin orbit inclined at 169 degrees. Burn approximately 9.5 km/s \u002B 1.0 km/s = 10.5 km/s.\n\n4) If you want to circularize, ouch. At Kerbol periapsis you\u0027ll be going:\n\nv = sqrt(mu (2/PE - 2/(AP\u002BPE))) = 93.6 km/s\n\nand to circularize you need to be going\n\nv = 66.8 km/s\n\ndv = 26.8 km/s\n\nYup. 26.8 km/s circularization \u002B 10.5 km/s LKO ejection = 37.3 km/s. Ouch.\n\n-------------\n\nInstead of 1000 km PE, let\u0027s change it to 1,000,000 km PE, the limit of low Kerbol science:\n\nPE = radius of Kerbol \u002B 1e9 m.\n\nv = sqrt(mu (2/AP \u002B 2/(AP \u002B PE))) = 3.8 km/s outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\n\nInside Kerbin\u0027s SOI: v = sqrt(9.3^2 \u002B 3.8^2) km/s = 10 km/s, inclined at 157 degrees.\n\nAdding LKO escape velocity, 11 km/s delta-v along a 157 degree inclined orbit.\n\nAt PE, delta-v = sqrt(mu (2/PE - 2/(AP\u002BPE))) - sqrt(mu (1/PE)) = 41.2 km/s - 30.5 km/s = 10.7 km/s\n\nTotal delta-v from LKO: 21.7 km/s. Save you about 16 km/s over 1000 km PE.\n\n-------------\n\nThat\u0027s the cost of going direct. Not cheap. I\u0027d be inclined (heh) to use another method.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThird option, still with the inefficient direct method.\n\nDon\u0027t completely circularize. Shrink your orbit to 1000km x 1000000km.\n\nThis would only cost 10.5 km/s ejection from LKO \u002B 7.6 km/s apoapsis shrinking.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T21:03:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 09:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yasmy**\n  \nNumbers"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T21:40:34Z","Content":"First test images.\n\n![0099EF8DA8F23651E98EC19176C4678099835703](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/535138528796971340/0099EF8DA8F23651E98EC19176C4678099835703/)\n\nSeems legit from out here. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![DA4C21FAB11B20B1478B861A9D9566755EC0414C](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/535138528796903868/DA4C21FAB11B20B1478B861A9D9566755EC0414C/)\n\nOh. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI think this image shows I need to launch into an inclined orbit going SE ( to preserve some orbital v ), coming over the top of Kerbin and initiating my burn there- and we\u0027re going to need a bigger boat (LV)/ higher LKO.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T22:09:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon**"}]}
