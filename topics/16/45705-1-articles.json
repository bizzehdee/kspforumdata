Beyond what has already been suggested by Monkeh and Temstar, you can also build your launch vehicle around your payload, rather than under it, that way the fairings don\u0027t appear in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of a launcher built around a interplanetary drive stage and the resulting interplanetary craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jbuiB0O.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jbuiB0O.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DSytll0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DSytll0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
