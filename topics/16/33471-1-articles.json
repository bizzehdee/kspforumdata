Surface pressure on Duna is about 10 times lower at \u0022sea level\u0022 (0m) than on Kerbin, this means far less drag and thus parachutes are less effective. However the gravity is about four times lower which lessens the negative effect of the thin Duna atmosphere on parachutes. In general though aim for the low lands since they have the highest pressure and thus parachutes are more effective there, the darker areas of the surface (marias probably, but what do I know of dunar geology) are the lowest ones. You also want to be coming in at a shallow angle so that the parachutes have enough time to slow you down as much as they can (also so that the forces when they deploy don\u0027t tear the lander apart, although strutting the parachutes to the rest of the craft helps with that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way in my experience, even with heavy landers, you can slow down the craft to about 30 m/s at least just using the parachutes. Usually it\u0027s just below 20 m/s for me, sometimes less. Few manage to slow down below 10 m/s although I did see it happen. Overall landing with just parachutes is doable for lighter and more sturdy craft (landing legs tend to break anywhere between 5 to 10 m/s landing speed depending on the leg type) but there are diminishing returns to adding more parachutes. The simpler solution to just adding enough parachutes for that to work is to just add a descent engine for the last 500\u0026gt;meters to assist them in slowing down the lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want fairly high thrust (for Duna, which is anywhere between 0.5 to 1.0 Kerbin TWR IMO) and just enough fuel for about 5 seconds of burning. That may not seem like much but the truth is the parachutes will kill all horizontal velocity, so you\u0027ll be falling straight down thus steering is not an issue, and you can focus just on pressing shift and ctrl while watching your velocity and nothing else. Just remember that it\u0027s called a suicide burn for a reason, so wait until you are close enough to the ground or the tanks will go dry before you are safely on the surface. That\u0027s why you need good thrust, to decelerate fast as close to the ground as possible and thus save on the needed fuel (since the parachutes did most the work). Still I find landing on the razor\u0027s edge so to speak quite fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-17T23:31:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2013 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Pulstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SDIR","CreatedById":59117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T03:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for landing having an ASAS module helps to keep the probe from tipping over during landing if you come in too fast or slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T04:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna\u0027s atmosphere is thinner, but it has a lower gravity that partially cancels that out.
