One 1.25m jet fuel tank should be fine for your jets. Another thing you want to consider is leveling out at about 10km to build horizontal speed. Most people say wait until 20km, but at that point there\u0027s not enough time to get your apoapsis up high enough before you start to run out of air at about 25km. Also, throttle back as your air gets low, and shut down engines you no longer need. The longer you can stay on jets the better."},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T22:35:38Z","Content":"Your SSTO should only need 50-100 dV to circularize if you push it to the limits of the atmo (in stock).

It all comes down to flying the right profile. Don\u0027t just aim for space as soon as your AP gets high enough. You should be skimming along in the atmosphere, building up speed and climbing relatively slowly. Towards the end, when you\u0027re suborbital, you should be pitching down slightly to keep within the atmosphere. The faster you go, the higher you can keep the jet engine running.\n\n![IMu24Xu.png](http://i.imgur.com/IMu24Xu.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T22:42:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlyingPete**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T04:34:25Z","Content":"^ What he said.\n\n Limit your climb rate to 200m/sec up to 20 km altitude.\n\n Limit your climb rate to 100 m/sec up to 32 km altitude.\n\n Limit your climb rate to 10m/sec up to 36 km altitude.\n\n The idea is to let your turbojet do all the work and build speed. So long as you can hit 2,175m/sec ground speed at 36km, you will establish an apoapsis in space just from the speed. Circularizing from there doesn\u0027t take much.\n\n ![turbo1_zpswhy1hnwm.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/turbo1_zpswhy1hnwm.jpg)\n\n This little guy demonstrates how little is needed to make it work.\n\n ![XL%20Series_zps7iaxcdes.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/XL%20Series_zps7iaxcdes.jpg)\n\n These monsters are more practical examples of the same thing.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T17:42:31Z","Content":"A SSTO:\n\nStayputnik, small IRW, FL-T200, 48-7S.\n\nFor useful payloads, given the appropriate fuel and assuming 200m/s for de-orbit/landing, a T30 will SSTO approx 1.4t, a Skipper 5t, Mainsail 11t and KR-2L 26t.

I always run out during circularization.\n\nYou\u0027ve seen some good advice and some very pretty ships--now get in that SPH! There is no substitute for trial and error. Build a ship that looks the way you want it to look, probably around a single jet engine to start. Concentrate on making the jet work first, that\u0027s the hard part. Do your best to fly a profile like the one Slashy cited. Then:\n\n--Did you run out of air before you got to a good altitude? Add intakes, climb slower and build speed.\n\n--Did you run out of jet fuel too early? Add more, or climb faster.\n\n--Did you lose control of the ship? At what altitude? Try to simulate the conditions (fuel distribution, etc) in the SPH. Check your centers of mass, lift and thrust again.\n\nOnce you can tweak the above well enough to go about 1500 m/s at 20km or so, you can reach orbit with a good push from a rocket engine. The faster and higher you go, the less rocket you need. \n\nAnd if you really want to learn spaceplane SSTO I would stay away from the RAPIER engine. Learning to balance your jets and rockets \u0027the hard way\u0027 will give you more real understanding.\n\nSee you at 70km!\n\nETA: I see you made it in a subsequent post. Well done!"}]}
