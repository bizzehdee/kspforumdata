I can close to within ~200m but when I go to stop my movement to the target, I can\u0027t seem to get it below 2 m/s. It\u0027s like I\u0027m flying circles around the target. I know I must have missed a step but I\u0027ve watched tons of videos on this and can\u0027t figure out what I did wrong. If I turn on mech jeb to get me there I can dock just fine without help, I just can\u0027t figure out this last little bit of the Rendezvous. I really want to be able to do this on my own.

That might help us be able to diagnose specific issues with the craft design, if there are any that might be causing you problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to zero out your velocity \u003Cem\u003Eperfectly\u003C/em\u003E, as such -- 2 m/s is actually fairly decent. The important part at this stage is to make sure that you\u0027re lined up with the target docking port, which you can achieve largely with your RCS thrusters and the Navball. Use your RCS to \u0022push\u0022 or \u0022pull\u0022 the prograde marker (i.e. the open yellow marker) onto the target indicator (i.e. the pink circle with the dot in the middle). Putting the camera into Chase mode by hitting the \u0022V\u0022 key a few times and positioning it behind the tail of your craft will also orient your view so that up, down, etc. on the keyboard automatically match those directions on the camera as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T00:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean when you\u0027re close to the target?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to stop all relative velocity for some reason make sure the velocity on the navball is in \u0022target\u0022 mode, point your chevron (centre of the navball: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Level_indicator.svg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:Level_indicator.svg\u003C/a\u003E) at retrograde ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/0/02/Retrograde.svg/120px-Retrograde.svg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/0/02/Retrograde.svg/120px-Retrograde.svg.png\u003C/a\u003E ) and accelerate forwards.
