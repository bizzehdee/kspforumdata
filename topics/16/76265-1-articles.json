If you build a modular ship and refuel it before the launch, higher orbits may be better, depending on the target planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this assumes that the ship has a reasonably high TWR, allowing it to complete the transfer burn in 5 minutes or less. With low TWR, interplanetary launches from low orbits can be very inaccurate, requiring you to do significant course corrections on the way. In such cases, it may be preferable to start from a higher orbit with a longer orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T17:26:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other option is multiple burns, but even so you\u0027ll probably want a BIT higher orbit, and you\u0027ll only be able to safely add about 800 m/s of delta-v before you risk getting caught up on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T17:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re looking at strictly the amount of delta-v to go from your parking orbit to the planet, then there\u0027s a peak efficiency orbit that tends to be fairly high up. For example, for Duna, the orbit is somewhere around 9000-9100 km. This orbit gets lower as you need a higher ejection velocity. For Jool, the orbit is in the 380-390 km range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you\u0027re looking for total delta-v from launch, then the lower the better for the most part, as the amount of delta-v you\u0027ll save over launching from a low (80-100km) orbit is generally less than it will take to transfer to and circularize in the higher orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is basically because of the Oberth effect. The actual reason that the Oberth effect exists is because delta-v is delta-v regardless of your velocity, but the amount of kinetic energy is based on the square of your velocity, so 1 m/s of velocity means more kinetic energy the faster you go. This is important because escaping a planetary SoI is basically trading kinetic energy for potential energy, so the cheaper you come by the kinetic energy, the less delta-v is required to achieve escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your mind doesn\u0027t wrap around that description easily, there\u0027s another way to think of it. The faster you leave a planet\u0027s SoI, the less time the gravity of that SoI has to slow you down, allowing you to keep more of your base velocity. So, if you find the exact velocity it takes to escape an SoI from a low orbit, then add 1 m/s on top of that, you\u0027ll escape the SoI with more than 1 m/s left over. The lower in the gravity well you start, the stronger this effect, so the higher the magnification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also one of the resons why if you want to change your apoapsis, it\u0027s most efficient to do so from your periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T18:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing at a higher orbit makes the planning and execution of interplanetary transfers easier, as the slower orbital speed allows a better approximation of \u0022instantaneous burn\u0022 that most calcs assume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in terms of pure delta-v, you will benefit more from starting at as low an orbit as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore precisely, starting at as high an orbital speed as possible, so as to get maximum benefit from Oberth effect \u0022amplifying\u0022 the efficiency of your maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor example: Achieving kerbin escape velocity needs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom 100km LKO: about 920 d-v\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efrom 1000km circular orbit: about 600d-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to get to the 1000km orbit from 100km, you already burned 730 m/s, so you total usage is 1330m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr how about this for a nice shiny example.

In a similar way if you start a transfer from a high orbit - near the edge of the current SOI - you know you\u0027ll only need a small extra push to reach escape velocity. The least-fuel burn would be maximising speed by falling from an apoapsis at the edge of the current SOI to a periapsis as low as possible above the current planet, thus needing least extra push in the first place and taking maximum advantage of Oberth (as has been mentioned).
