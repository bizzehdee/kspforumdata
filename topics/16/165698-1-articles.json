Last time I did, boiloff was a moving target (too much, too little, somehow odd, changing with every release of RealHeat). It didn\u0027t properly work at warp, or (especially) when coming out of warp. Which isn\u0027t the mods fault, btw, but a side effect from how heat ceases to exist at higher warp, only to come back with vengeance when you return to real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever... exposed surface was very much taken into account since, like, forever. Pointing your Centaur into or away from the sun mattered. Earth itself also radiates heat, though. The best way to store your hydrogen would be a long stick, far from earth (at least GEO, preferably translunar), showing the smallest possible profile to the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadiators were ill-configured for the purpose.
