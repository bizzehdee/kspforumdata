Sometimes the decouplers attach inside the engine instead of where it should, and its very hard to tell the difference. I had a rocket that should have released 4 engines between 2 stages. The first set of two engines, perfect. The second set EVERY TIME would stay on ship hanging with struts just like two swaying, highly explosive, anchors. I tried EVERYTHING to get them to work. I even attached 16 (Yes 16) Sepertron engines just to ENSURE it wasn\u0027t the struts. In the end I trashed the two non working setups and copied (alt\u002Bleft click on windows) the two correctly working setups and after a lot of pain re-struted everything. Worked first time.

The only thing you can do now is to edit the save file. When you\u0027re building though, disconnect and reconnect decouplers and test every decoupler out by launching it. If there are decouplers that don\u0027t work, attach and reattach and test it again. If it automatically snaps in and it is clipped into something, attach it, detach, and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Euel","CreatedById":74093,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T00:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...to all those who replied to my post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll try as many of your suggestions as I can.
