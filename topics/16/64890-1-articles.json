What you do is chose a starting coupler and mount it right-side-up to your stack. Then flip your choice of couplers up-side-down and mount it on one of the slots with symmetry on. Then connect another coupler of your choice to the up-side-down free slot. You\u0027ll have to conduct plenty of tests to figure out where to place your fuel lines, I\u0027ve never had every engine light up on the first go.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehm now that I look at it again this should really work... usually when one puts adapters together so the stack branches out and then merges again there are all sorts of problems but this seems to avoid the issue entirely, must try =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arise257","CreatedById":104506,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T18:53:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis technique certainly is aesthetically pleasing, but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s inefficient.\u003Cp\u003EImagine I built the same rocket but attached the nukes directly to the quadcoupler beneath the core stage and put the LV909s on bicouplers under the radial stages.
