\u00A0Answer: \u00A0nothing whatsoever. \u00A0All you\u0027ve done is add some extra parts to your ships and your bases, which you can then totally ignore while you go on with other things. \u00A0IOW, for all the difference it makes to you, those parts might as well be doing nothing. \u00A0This means you get the exact same net effect on your gameplay if those same parts are there but not actually doing anything. \u00A0Then you just pretend you\u0027ve got life support.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOption #2 is my preferred method these days. \u00A0And that\u0027s my reaction to all the so-called \u0022realism\u0022 features. \u00A0Take reentry heating becoming a thing. \u00A0OK, I just stick a heatshield on the pod and problem solved. \u00A0My rocket is a bit heavier and more expensive, and has 1 extra part, and that\u0027s it. \u00A0No other impact on my gameplay. \u00A0So why bother? \u00A0It\u0027s exactly the same with life support. \u00A0If it were possible to make bases truly self-sufficient, you\u0027d design them to be that way and never think about life support again. \u00A0Which is why the more complex mods don\u0027t allow you to make bases self-sufficient, and why they require constant tinkering. \u00A0You want \u0022realistic\u0022 life support, you get \u0022realistic\u0022 limitations. \u00A0And they absorb your whole attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E logistic system, that\u0027s an interesting feature with several layers. \u00A0First off, there\u0027s a short-range thing (a few dozen to a few hundred meters) that allows separate but nearby base units to exchange resources for free. \u00A0It assumes there are underground pipes, electrical cables, etc., linking them. \u00A0This is so you can avoid the pain of docking modules, and also makes the base more Kraken-resistant because the more parts you connect together, the more likely the base is to spontaneously explode. \u00A0At longer ranges, including up to orbit, you can add another part (a \u0022logistics hub\u0022 IIRC) to carry resources between separate bases and stations at the cost of fuel. \u00A0Basically, this assumes that there\u0027s a fleet of little drone cargo ships flying around, burning the fuel. \u00A0So you have to make enough extra fuel for these transfers. \u00A0And last time I messed with this, you had to manually schedule all the transfers instead of them being automatic, and they took time both to start and to reach their destinations, and they don\u0027t happen at all unless you have the fuel available in the right places. \u00A0Thus, it was still a lot of micromanagement (you had to know what you wanted when, which required paying close attention to your bases). \u00A0All it saved you was actually having to fly the ships yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPathfinder has its own logistics system. \u00A0In that, everything within physics range can share resources automatically and pretty much instantly, for free, once you tell them to do so. \u00A0But physics range is its limit---you can\u0027t send stuff to or from orbit this way. \u00A0However,\u00A0you can refuel ships without having to dock them or use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E pipes, just land within physics range of a fuel depot and voila, which is pretty cool. \u00A0But this system only works between parts from \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022106975\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Angel-125\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s mods (Pathfinder, Buffalo, MOLE, and DSEV) and I think a few parts in Planetary Bases. \u00A0Still, those mods have tanks of all shapes and sizes\u00A0for any and all resources and the various resource converters for anything else, whether life support, ISRU, or Extraplanetary Launchpads, so this isn\u0027t a big restriction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
