Switch to the sats from the tracking center, then press Alt\u002BF12 and use the debug orbit editor to set the parameters live. I just got done using that tool for some research, and it\u0027s fantastic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust set the parameters to be exactly the same except for the mean anomaly and you\u0027ll be pretty close, keeping in mind the satellites will be moving while you switch and edit, so you may need to account for that between your four sats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, don\u0027t make them exactly perfect - add a tiny eccentricity and inclination or else the LAN and argument of periapsis (called LPE in the editor for \u0022longitude of periapsis\u0022) will be non-unique and the orbit markers will start jumping around due to physics simulation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd keep in mind that inclination, LAN and LPE are measured in \u003Ci\u003Edegrees\u003C/i\u003E, but your anomalies are measured in \u003Ci\u003Eradians\u003C/i\u003E. it\u0027s kind nd of annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T00:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, for the original problem of satellite drifting, it can be solved\u00A0without \u0022cheating\u0022 like this - bring one Ant engine, set thrust limiter, use throttle, pointing to any 4 of the directions other than prograde/retrograde (maximizing cosine loss, essentially).
