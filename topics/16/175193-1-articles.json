When you pop the doors off, anything attached to the doors comes off too. So the game thinks your tanks are attached to the doors. To make it not happen, move the tanks farther from the doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_Pi","CreatedById":108099,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-22T16:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDidn\u0027t expect the would work like that, But it fits perfectly with what\u0027s going on.
