The only cockpit IVAs I am having this problem with are the MK1-2 Command Pod and the MK1 Cockpit. Strangly, the MK1-2 has the navballs except in the bottom, centre seat. I hadn\u0027t really noticed this until one day I wanted to pilot something from the inside, then I realised they were completely gone! Is it a rendering error or what? It isn\u0027t that it looks glitched or bugged or unrendered, but rather that there is simply an awkward smooth panel, as if a kerbal engineer either forgot to install the navball or was lazy and decided not to implement it."},{"CreatedByName":"Lindy","CreatedById":68803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T04:59:59Z","Content":"Do you have any mods installed?

Because of it\u0027s RPM integration it could have very easily deleted or overwritten the navball prop placement. I suggest getting RPM anyway, but if you delete the JSI folder you should be OK."}]}
