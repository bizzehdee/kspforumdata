I\u0027ve been tooling around on Duna with my latest rover design. I tried to make sure it had as low a center of gravity as I could without problems bottoming out. When I drive, I try to keep the speed down... But it still tends to lose control and flip when hitting even the smallest bumps. Sometimes it\u0027s recoverable with the RCS I attached specifically for that reason, but sometimes even the smallest bump while inverted and it blows up in fairly spectacular fashion! Any suggestions on design changes? I\u0027ve got a decent 2-rover delivery rocket, provided the updated design is similar in mass.
