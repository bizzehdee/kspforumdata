With stock aero, you\u0027re probably looking at an asparagus-staged pancake for maximal efficiency and a wide landing base: try to land it on elevated terrain, so you\u0027ve got less souposphere to fight through. Eve ascents are one of the most difficult things in KSP, so don\u0027t feel disheartened if you can\u0027t manage it. One important consideration: you probably do not want to try a direct return from Eve; you should rendezvous with a separate return stage in orbit, Apollo-style. This keeps you from needing to bring the return stage down, and then painfully bring it back up through Eve\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR/NEAR, stuff gets very interesting, because the ascent stage should preferably be slim and aerodynamic, but you still want a wide landing base so as to avoid tipping over; the probable solution to that would be having most of the ascent stage be a narrow rocket, with its first stage being a short but very wide landing base.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerrM\u00FC","CreatedById":78387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T20:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get a Kerbal back from eves surface just last thursday.

After that, you need another ~5000m/s to make orbit. You also need a pretty high TWR all the way. On Kerbin, you can easily get away with TWR\u0026lt;0.5 on the upper stage.
