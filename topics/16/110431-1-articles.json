You can put parachutes on your boosters and trigger them in the same stage as the decouplers, and then if the booster stays within physics range the parachute will function normally. The \u0022old\u0022 physics range was 2.5 km; I believe it\u0027s been increased by quite a bit, but I don\u0027t know by how much.\n\nIf the booster lands before your ship leaves physics range, then it will remain landed when your ship leaves, thus allowing it to be recovered. If the booster is lofted into a suborbital trajectory (\u003E 22 km altitude before leaving physics range), then it won\u0027t be considered \u0022crashed\u0022 until it returns to the 22 km border; this means that if you put your ship in orbit before this happens, you can then switch the view back to the booster and watch it land, preventing the system from crashing it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E n3310 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so, I have some questions:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E am I wrong about anyone of these points?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E does someone know anything else?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E are there any suggestions on how to recover debris?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E are there any mods which allow debris to be tracked futher than the default distance (and be considered with their parachute opened)?\n\u003E \n\nI find that boosters tend to be cheap anyways - if they\u0027re not, you\u0027re overbuilding your spaceships. You can look at the [StageRecovery mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/78226-105-stagerecovery-recover-funds-from-dropped-stages-v158-11915/\u0026page=1) if you really truly want the game to \u0022recover\u0022 your boosters instead of \u0022crashing\u0022 them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-30T12:29:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2015 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DeMatt**\n  \nNew forum formatting."}]}
