I have restarted the game several times and switched craft but still i can only put maneuver nodes on the purple(next) orbit. So how can I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T19:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown bug.

Place node by your ship. Turn around 180\u00B0 and burn the same amount back.
