Since Minmus has no atmosphere, you don\u0027t have to worry about reentry heating at all.\n\nIf you\u0027re talking about recovering your lander to Kerbin intact, your only options are to:\n\n1. Quicksave, then try reentry without any heat shields. I reckon all your big parts (tank, crew capsule, LV-Ns) will survive reentry just fine even without a heat shield. Engines have high heat tolerances.\n\n2. If the above strategy fails, reload your quicksave, then use a Claw or some sort of docking arrangement to attach a heatshield/parachute craft onto your lander in orbit, then reenter with that arrangement."},{"CreatedByName":"rudi1291","CreatedById":138990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:02:23Z","Content":"You can also let your Kerbals grab the data/experiments/science (right click on the command module of the lander (or specific experiment), then\u0022Take Data\u0022 (if you are on EVA)) and transfer them over to a vessel which can reenter.

Once you returned from Minmus (or wherever you\u0027ve been), make sure your Pe is well within the atmosphere (35-40 km), separate the stages before reentry, then circularize your engine block. Then switch to the reentry capsule and continue the descent.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T14:06:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:26:35Z","Content":"Another Option: Don\u0027t return the lander to the surface on Kerbin. If you\u0027re refueling it, I\u0027m assuming you have a fuel depot station somewhere. Dock the lander to that. Then send another ship to meet the lander there. This other ship is simply a crew-and-data recovery vehicle, specifically designed for reentry. Have EVA Kerbals transfer all the data from the lander into the recovery ship, get in it themselves if they\u0027re due to come home, and then land the recovery ship.\n\nNext time you want to use the lander, send another recovery ship out there with the new crew in it. Move the crew to the lander, refuel it at the depot, go do more science, put the data and Kerbals back in the recovery ship, and bring that home. Repeat until you get bored with it."},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:33:44Z","Content":"You could probably bring it down in one piece, but I doubt you can land it safely without chutes. LN-Ns have poor performance in atmosphere and that beast of your is big and heavy. (Also, I consider running LV-N down over habitable parts to be a bad taste.) You could bring up heatshield and chutes, attach it via docking port and (with some careful piloting) land it, but that would be more expensive then just ditching the whole thing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nI\u0027d say forget about it.

Thanks every for trying to help, you guys really did give me some ideas!"}]}
