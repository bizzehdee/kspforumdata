Engines at the end of a modular girder segment attached to the main rocket are drawing fuel from the centre stack even though there shouldn\u0027t be a connection as the girder does not support fuel flow (as I\u0027m aware).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis however only got more confusing when I introduced decouplers into the mix. Usually a fuel tank and an engine attached to a radial decoupler won\u0027t drain from the centre stack, nothing new there at all. But if I put a girder between the outer fuel tank and the decoupler suddenly it\u0027s drawing from there! I\u0027ll post some pics as soon as I get home (probably around 5 hours from posting this) but this really is confusing me and making me require severe changes to simple designs that should by all means work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully one of you can shed some light on this truly strange occurrence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:23:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGirders do support fuel flow, like pretty much everything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with decouplers appears to be a bug that\u0027s been reported a couple times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fr3Runn3r","CreatedById":73353,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022numerobis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022numerobis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGirders do support fuel flow, like pretty much everything else.\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with decouplers appears to be a bug that\u0027s been reported a couple times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, any ideas for how to get around it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T13:36:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way I\u0027ve heard of is to not attach the top of any subsequent part to the girder (i.e. don\u0027t attach it via the green node ball in the VAB); if you can attach it to the side, you should be alright.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it says \u0027crossfeed capable\u0027 or something like that, it supports fuel flow\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T14:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it looks really weird, that\u0027s why I always attack fuel line with it, looks better\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fr3Runn3r","CreatedById":73353,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T20:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it says \u0027crossfeed capable\u0027 or something like that, it supports fuel flow\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s just the thing, none of the girders say \u0022crossfeed capable\u0022 on them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hobbsyoyo","CreatedById":89917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T20:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fr3Runn3r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fr3Runn3r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s just the thing, none of the girders say \u0022crossfeed capable\u0022 on them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes they do.
