It has two control modules, those one kerbal lander cans connected with that two rocket sepelarator thing, basically they\u0027re standing side by side. There is another connector on top of em that ends with a clampotron which is positioned in the middle of them. Now every time I chose to control from the clampotron the navball is still set on one of the landint cans. Now, I love using the navball for docking, but this issue prevents me from doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, everytime I transmit data my antenna retracts. Is it possible to prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the first: Are you going into/out of IVA regularly? Also, a pic of the craft would help because it is entirely possible your docking port is incorrectly placed. As far as keeping the antenna deployed, not that I know of. I do know that RemoteTech prevents this, but it adds a whole new level of hard to the game. (Specifically requireing a constant connection to mission control for unmanned flights and science transmission)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimmy Jazz","CreatedById":102211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t get you pictures right now, tomorrow.
