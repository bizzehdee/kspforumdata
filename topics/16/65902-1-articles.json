Didn\u0027t you wonder how you can use them except for attaching them to wings? Well; i think it\u0027s possible! They could be used as winglets for rockets or missiles; they also can be attached to personal heat shields and reentry modules to encache control. In real life, control surfaces often are attached to lifting body vessels or even \u0022blunt end forward\u0022 reentry vehicles for additional steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T21:15:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if they can attach in the right orientation. If you put them long-edge-on to your rocket you can control pitch and yaw but not roll. (Then again, roll is quite easily handled by reaction wheels). And that assumes the controls \u0022work\u0022 and the game doesn\u0027t think they\u0027re pointing in a different direction and thus mess things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, we already have two winglets and two canards that mount the right way to a rocket and work just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
