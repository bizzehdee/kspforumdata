But can we adjust somewhere how wide it is ? On stock KSP it is not really problematic, but a lot of mod are showing some long lines of information that the window is just clipping and then you can\u0027t read half of it. I\u0027m mostly reffering to KSPI, where the first info line for generators is sometimes plasma/laser consumption rate and you just can\u0027t see the numbers because they are clipped by the window .... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure this has already been solved, I just can\u0027t find it anywhere on the forum through google.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
