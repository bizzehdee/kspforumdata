LY50: lots. \u0026lt;- these are conservative limits, assuming moderate landing and takeoff stresses -- and that you land mostly empty of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest trick to avoid takeoff rotation is just to fly straight off the end of the runway (but it doesn\u0027t always work to save your gear). The second is to use a canard design instead of a traditional one, since canards do not put downward forces on your landing gear. Using the offset tool to raise the nose a little during your takeoff run can help. Of course, as icedown said, moving the gear a little closer to your CoM can prevent blowouts at the price of an increased risk of tailstrikes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T15:25:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
