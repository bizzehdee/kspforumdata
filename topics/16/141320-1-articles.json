But that\u0027s OK, because it\u0027s easy to taxi a plane for many kms once landed\u00A0on its wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes enough lift can come from wings, if you have a hell of a lot of wing area, and your plane is fairly light (but this SSTO has a couple nuke engines, a whiplash, and a lot of empty fuel tanks, so \u0022light\u0022 is a relative concept) -- and if you notice he has RCS on and\u00A0is using at least one Vernor under the nose to maintain his attitude. Notice just how low his landing speed really is at the end, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of doing pure horizontal landings, I tend to come in much faster and pitch up into a vertical climb -- then select \u0022radial hold\u0022 SAS, stall, and come down vertically, landing on my nuke engine bells. Then I can use reaction wheels to rotate the craft forward onto its wheels. You can always take off up a smooth hillside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-06T23:50:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2016 11:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
