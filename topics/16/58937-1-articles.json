Thanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose numbers included the delta-v needed to get from the surface of Duna to orbit, but your original question sounded like your limit was after returning to orbit. If that\u0027s correct, then you should have had a margin for a trip to Ike and then return to Kerbin, especially if you return to Kerbin by departing Ike with a low Duna periapsis, then burning prograde at the periapsis to achieve the proper ejection velocity. The timing might be a bit tricky, but it\u0027s how I leave from any moon if I\u0027m heading out to any planet other than the one the moon orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
