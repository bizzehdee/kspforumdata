Would it make sense to keep two sets of RCS thrusters, one for empty and one for full tanks?"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:02:10Z","Content":"My way of doing this (for rockets, I\u0027m not much of a spaceplane person):\n\n1. Display the ACoM (Average CoM) using RCS Build Aid.\n2. Place the RCS thrusters in order to minimise translation torque at ACoM.\n3. Check the maximum RCS torque at CoM and DCoM.\n4. Ensure that the vessel has sufficient non-RCS torque (i.e. reaction wheels, command pods) to overcome this max RCS torque."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:03:48Z","Content":"the COM and DCOM are close enough that this doesn\u0027t matter. The unwanted torque created by the slight imbalance can just be canceled with reaction wheels."}]}
