So you have those engines on rotation servos, and when your action group is triggered these rotate in opposite directions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess you could simply re-place the rotation servos so that they rotate in the same way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option would be to use a KAL controller , bind its play position to a translate action group, and add the rotation servos to the KAL, so you can then manually define the rotation of each servo to match your needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HedgeKnight","CreatedById":224559,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-11T02:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had them operate in opposite directions, and I have had them not spin at all, and even in flight had then all spinning like fire works.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I want to do is press a button and rotate the servos from one position to another; ideally Id like to be able to rotate them as desired in either direction, pointing back to pointing down should suffice.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I managed to do was use \u0022custom one\u0022 and \u0022engane servo motor\u0022 and set the target angle BUT I never managed to actually do it from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
