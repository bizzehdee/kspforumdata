In theory I know what to do, but still cant get it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a tiny station in Kerbin orbit, and a spacecraft that I\u0027m trying to dock with it. Both have clamp-o tron ports, one of them shielded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual rendevouz is not the problem. I have both craft aligned, but when I bring the docking ports close together, or even have one inside the other, the two will at some point just bounce off. From the KSP wiki I learned that they are supposed to magnetically clamp but that doesnt happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I noticed is that when I set the approaching ships docking port to \u0022control from here\u0022, nothing really changes. I\u0027m not sure whats supposed to happen, but apparently its important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope some kind Kerbal can point out my mistake(s).
