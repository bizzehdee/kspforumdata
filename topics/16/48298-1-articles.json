This section that is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe true reason I\u0027m asking is because they use larger than 3 meter and 3 meter tanks all the time in real life. The Orion Capsule is bigger than 3 meters and holds 4 crew, which is something I\u0027d love to use in KSP.

In fact, the SLS system NASA is developing uses 8.4m diameter tanks. In essence, the 2m command pod is the KSP analogue of a Orion style cockpit. It\u0027s just stylized to have 3 kerbals as in the Apollo program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, i\u0027ve not heard of there being any 3m parts anytime soon. I personally think they\u0027d be too much to handle, especially since we can already get some pretty high payload fractions with the 2m parts and a little ingenuity (Yes, i mean you, Whackjob). As a veteran of KSP, i remember having the NovaPunch mod back in 1.2 or something, and i didn\u0027t care much for the monstrous parts of the pack. There was trouble adapting the mod parts to the stock ones, and they were structurally unstable. Even if they made stock 3m parts, they would be a little overkill in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-14T02:29:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2013 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dynamo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralHavan","CreatedById":58406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T02:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, but Novapunch\u0027s parts used to have a degree of eccentricity to them.

It seems like it\u0027s the predecessor to the spirit of KSPX, adding parts into the game where there currently are none. It offers some impressive .625m selection of bipropellant tanks and two bipropellant engines, and I think there\u0027s a few monopropellant engines in there as well.
