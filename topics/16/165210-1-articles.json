A screenshot of the craft would be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few thoughts about what could be going wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Communication problem: What kind of antennas are you using on each craft? An unmanned probe needs a line of communication back to Kerbin in order to be controllable. Small antennas on rovers are not always powerful enough to communicate directly with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, however if you have a relay antenna on the mothership then it could be relaying the signal for your rover using its more powerful antennas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Power: Sometimes the electricity in small batteries and probe cores gets used up first when connected to a mothership. When you undock you might be stuck with no electricity, and no control as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Control point: Your rover might be trying to orient itself to the docking port after undocking. This would mess up your directional controls, but it shouldn\u0027t cause a complete loss of control. Try right-clicking the probe core and choosing \u0022Control from Here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Design flaw: If you built the two versions of the rover separately, then it\u0027s possible you simply forgot some easy to overlook essential on the probe because it was present on the mothership - like batteries or an antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if any one of these is the cause of your problem.

The ones on the back of the cockpit should look like the ones on the back of that probe core. Notice how on the probe core docking ports the narrow ends meet in the middle between the flared collars of the docking ports? In the first pictures of the cockpit the flared collars are touching each other which should not be the case if they were attached correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that you probably missed the end node at the back of the cockpit when attaching the first docking port, which means that it surface attached and left the end node open. Then when you attached the second docking port it attached directly to the node on the back of the cockpit, and clipped through the first docking port. The docking ports aren\u0027t attached to each other, they are both attached to the back of the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo try and keep this from happening, hold down the ALT key when you want to attach to an end node. It prevents parts from surface attaching and will center it directly on the nearest available end node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-08T06:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2017 06:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BjM","CreatedById":178695,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-08T13:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146104\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@HvP\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Big thanks!!
