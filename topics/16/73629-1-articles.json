Its likely a mixture of all three. Solution is to build heavier as you go lower, not the other way around (in my experience, CM should be ~75% up the height of your first stage). And then ensure that whatever you\u0027re using to control your rocket while still flying in the atmosphere can control it. Bigger wings and stronger ASAS/SAS/Reaction Wheels.

The solution there is to keep your pitch angle close to your prograde marker. Depending on your craft there is an maximum AOA (IE, the difference between your pitch and prograde marker) that you can go to without stalling the craft. You can check that using FAR\u0027s tools to see where the craft begins to stall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the crew pod issues, thats up to the mod authors to fix if the issue is what I think it is.

KSP\u0027s stock aerodynamic model requires you to fly inefficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom an efficiency standpoint, you are wasting fuel whenever you are not thrusting directly prograde. This includes engines gimbaling to affect control input. A real life rocket will use engine gimbals exactly once: shortly after liftoff, for one singular, tiny nudge to the side. Afterwards, the rocket flies entirely uncontrolled; it simply tilts over slowly and gradually by itself, pulled into the curved path towards the vertical by gravity and stabilized by its aerodynamic profile. That\u0027s why it is called a gravity turn, incidentally: because you don\u0027t actually steer. Gravity does the steering for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to that, stock KSP\u0027s atmosphere punishes you for trying to pitch over normally by applying excessive lateral drag until the air thins out sufficiently. As a result, stock KSP rockets go straight up for 5-10 km, and then aggressively pitch over through manual control input. This is a very inefficient launch profile, and one that (as you can see in FAR) isn\u0027t even aerodynamically valid under proper physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR, this excessive early drag isn\u0027t present, and there\u0027s nothing keeping you from starting your pitchover right after clearing the launchpad. This allows you to fly a much more gradual turn, never deviating far from the prograde marker and never using aggressive steering input. That results in a very smooth and efficient ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you\u0027re really good at what you\u0027re doing and your rocket is aerodynamically sound, you can just turn off SAS, sit back and watch. It\u0027s not easy to pull off, but the authentic, uncontrolled gravity turn does work under FAR.

If the CoL is to far back the nose will never pitch up and will actually be forced down at supersonic speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR doesn\u0027t make the game easier, it just makes it more realistic. Which for most people that is easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets are a bit more difficult in FAR, you need to start your gravity turn MUCH sooner than stock. I start mine at 1km altitude if you use MJ, or as soon as it clears the launch tower if I manually fly it. I never go more than 5deg past the prograde marker the whole time I am doing the turn. Also make sure your TWR isn\u0027t more than 1.2-1.4 at launch otherwise you will accelerate faster than you can control your craft, and it will push the back of your rocket around instead of pushing it where you want it to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-30T19:33:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2014 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaytheAerospace","CreatedById":108355,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T22:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETouching on CL in relation to CM again, I very strongly disagree with the notion that you should put the CL far behind the CM. It gives you a more stable plane, but stability isn\u0027t actually a good thing! Maneuverability is predicated on \u003Cem\u003Einstability\u003C/em\u003E, so if you\u0027re too stable, you lose the ability to maneuver. You want only as much stability as is necessary to make the plane controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been following a pretty strict rule for my small (\u0026lt;40 tons) spaceplanes, with great results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, your CM can\u0027t move more than 10% of the diameter of the CM ball as your tanks empty. Moving none at all is preferable, but a little movement can be tolerated. Second, put your CL ball just behind the CM ball, with the surfaces of the balls just touching. This will give you a good starting point to tune your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Typically to tune, I turn SAS on at launch, then fly to 1km and turn it off. If the plane oscillates during this initial climb, then it\u0027s not well balanced or I have too much pitch authority (or both). You can fix balance problems with trim, but it\u0027s best to make it fly more or less straight on its own. You can use nose canards, which make it very easy to apply a precise upward pitching moment by moving the canards in relation to the CM for more or less torque. Rotated tail fins are another good option. Moving the wings to shift CL is another option, but the ultimate goal is to make the plane fly well \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E sacrificing the maneuverability granted by having them close together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA well tuned plane should pitch down very gradually. The downward pitching moment should be low enough to be trimmed out for easy, level flight \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E SAS. A well designed plane will be just about as easy to control without SAS as it is with it. If you turn SAS off and your plane nosedives, then you need to take it back to the SPH and fix your pitching moment. Also, keep in mind that you\u0027ll tend to lose pitch authority (as well as develop a downward pitching moment) as you go supersonic and beyond. FAR\u0027s simulations are very, very handy for evaluating this \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E you spend a bunch of time getting your plane up to Mach 5 for hypersonic tests.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T22:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaytheAerospace is dead on about everything there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you set your CoL to far back the craft will never leave the ground untill the ground falls away from under it at the end of the runway. And even then it may not even pitch nose up even with full control lock for it to go up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have it set to close to center, if your CoM shifts a great deal during flight then your craft will have a completely different flight profile when near dry then when full.

If you go too fast, you\u0027re pushing hard against high drag atmosphere that will flip/break your rocket. If you look at it, it makes sense - say you\u0027re travelling straight up but are tilted over 10 degrees (through engine gimballing/SAS etc). You have a wall of air hitting the side of your craft at 200 m/s or whatever which creates instability/failure. Either it pushes your craft over or your craft can\u0027t take the stress so it breaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a launch TWR of 1.2, start pitching over about 70 m/s. I say pitch over, but really, it\u0027s just a tap in the direction you want to go. As a rule of thumb, never pitch more than 5-10 degrees off prograde initially. Above 30km, you can start pitching/turning more aggressively, but still, be careful. As for the actual ascent path, for a low TWR craft, the Time To AP should be around a minute and for a higher TWR (1.7\u002B), from 30-40 seconds. Try and follow the stock shape (be pitched over 45 degrees at 10km) but really, it depends entirely on your individual craft. I usually keep the gradual turn going until I\u0027m pointing just above the horizon at around 35km. I keep this attitude until the AP is where I want it, cut throttle, point prograde and coast. Might need a few nudges to counter drag, but you\u0027ll likely be coasting for about 5 minutes. Once at AP, a circ burn of usually less than 400 m/s is needed, but again, it depends on your craft. Sometimes, I\u0027ve only needed a burst of 30m/s at AP, other times, I\u0027ve needed 500. A constant thrust ascent is doable, but very difficult. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planes, as others have said, make sure the CoM is slightly ahead of the CoL. Don\u0027t overspeed low in atmosphere or you\u0027ll have a high dynamic pressure which is what tears you up if you turn. FAR has a few flight assistance toggles that can help you - DCA, or Dynamic Control Adjustment, will limit the input so you don\u0027t overturn your plane. However, in doing so, it does limit what the plane can do and doesn\u0027t let it get pushed to its boundaries (which is sometimes needed, at least for spaceplanes). FARs Flight Data contains all the info you\u0027ll ever need - it\u0027s far too much for me to explain here, hopefully the wiki has the info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking of spaceplanes, I\u0027ve found them incredibly easy with FAR. Make a simple deltawing with 1 RAPIER at the back (keep in mind CoM/CoL and everything) and while in the VAB, make it manual mode switching and put the following into action groups - AG1 = Toggle Mode \u002B Toggle Intakes, AG2 = Toggle Intakes. This allows you complete control over your intakes and engine. When you start, press both AGs and get going. Go up high enough (around 10km or so, depending on how many intakes you have) and then fly about 5 degrees up. Build up speed and keep an eye on the Air Requirement Met % in FARs Flight Data. The faster you go, the higher it\u0027ll be, but the higher you go, the lower it\u0027ll be. Once it gets below 100%, you\u0027ll flameout unless you throttle down so keep going until about 120%. Your AP should be around 17km or so and you should be travelling at around 1.5km/s. Press AG1 to switch to closed cycle mode (and close your intakes), pitch up more and watch your AP. This is likely where you\u0027ll have to turn off DCA if it was on because it simply won\u0027t let you pitch up far enough. Don\u0027t pitch too much or you will break, just maybe 20 or so degrees up. Enough so your Time To AP rises at about 1s/s should do. If it\u0027s not going that fast, don\u0027t pitch up, just fly straight in closed cycle for a bit longer. Once your AP gets above 30km, you\u0027ll likely get to space today (as long as you have enough fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve honestly found making spaceplanes much easier now I know what to do. My current airframe is very capable and stable almost all the time. It\u0027s slightly more complicated due to having separate rockets and jets, but the principle is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kHRAKDY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kHRAKDY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
