I\u0027m in an inclined orbit (73 degrees) about Duna and my guys want to get home. The orbit isn\u0027t as poorly lined up with the orbit (maybe 20-25 degrees?). So how long is my escape burn and in what direction?

I see three choices...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Set up a maneuver node to burn and swing out over the poles, moving the maneuver node by eye until the escape looks as parallel with retrograde as I can (thought the orientation of the orbit will mean it has to be ~25 degrees off).
