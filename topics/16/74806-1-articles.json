At subsonic speeds with FAR, I also see some wobble with SAS. In my experience, it\u0027s completely independent of the control surfaces on the plane, meaning if I add or remove control surfaces, it doesn\u0027t get better.

Given how he\u0027s launching, I\u0027m guessing the plane is going to nose down and crash, probably before the end of the run way. Right now, those canards are providing lift on the front of the plane to balance lift from the wings at the back of the plane. This keeps the CoL near to the CoM. If the CoL is way behind the CoM (as would happen if he removed the canards), The CoM acts as a fulcrum, and the upward lift at the aft of the plane causes the the craft to rotate/pitch so the nose will point downward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is a good segue to this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Creature\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Creature\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve used canards sometimes successfully too, but sometimes I get backflips because of them and have no idea how to predict it so as a rule of thumb I\u0027d say try losing them on a problematic craft and see if it helps. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you put the canards \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E far forward, the CoL also moves \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E far forwards, and the opposite problem happens: too much unbalanced lift at the \u003Cem\u003Efront\u003C/em\u003E of the plane cause the nose to rotate/pitch upwards, leading to backflips/stalls/bad days.

You have not set your control surfaces jobs. Right now it looks like they are all doing everything which is WAY to much control for that small of a craft going that fast. So as it is adjusting its pitch it starts to oscilate which in turn causes it to over correct which only makes the oscilation worse. Till eventually you are going to fast and the airpressure is so high that you litterally rip the wings off the craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fixs for this are simple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Set your control surfaces jobs... The canards on the nose, set for roll, set your elevators on the wings for pitch, and the tail for yaw. You may want to reduce the max angle those controls can move to prevent over correction and over control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- struts..... B9 has some wonderful invisible struts that are great in keeping the craft strong. So you dont have to worry about the craft flexing apart under high dynamic pressure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly as others have said... you are going WAY to fast at to low of an altitude. Open up the flight data window in FAR and you will see you probably were pushing nearly 90kpa at that speed at that alitude. Which is beyond high, that is ******ed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
