I made a very basic plane out of stock parts and it flies great and everything but it almost seems too stable. I am on my 7th attempt of taking off and trying to land it the island runway. The problem is that no matter what I try I cant seem to lose speed. I come in from I would guess 25-30 KM out lined up with the runway at about 500-1000 meters up at a speed of around 100 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy engines are completely cut off and I have been trying to bank up to get wind resistance to increase drag to drop my velocity. Well that does work but I gain altitude. The instant I level out my artificial horizon my craft starts dropping somewhat but then my velocity increases basically right back to where I started making this never ending frustrating loop. It seems if I can fly forever with no thrust this way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m missing in order to slow myself down? Any help would be appreciated.

Air brakes are a good option, however if a plane is going to fast the best solution is an S curve. Bank left, pull up, bank right, pull up. The act of turning a plane naturally slows it down due to the wind resistance of the bottom of the wings.

Just land at 100m/s; it\u0027s a perfectly fine landing speed. In fact, it\u0027s my standard landing velocity; I don\u0027t bother trying to get any slower than that.

By default brakes will activate spoilers but I recommend removing that. You don\u0027t always want spoilers and brakes at the same time. The spoiler can help you pitch the nose up but you wheels shouldn\u0027t be braked right as you touch down. Worse still if you use a custom group for spoilers and then turn on brakes, they turn back off when you want them. So remove them from brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, yes 100m/s is fine. Some of my SSTO\u0027s will not land at less than 150m/s because I can\u0027t keep the nose up any lower. However, that is a small runway. So you can either slow down more or use Real Chutes to stop before you plow into the hill at the other end (just like the Space Shuttle!) Just make sure you configure them, they are configured by switching to action group mode and clicking them. There you can set them to deploy on touchdown and to be drag chutes instead of main chutes for rocket pods. Also since your probably taking off from the KSC and landing on the island, make sure you set them to calculate from Wet Mass (i.e. a full tank of fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-11T23:16:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2014 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T00:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KBMODIGITY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KBMODIGITY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy only last thought is that you all seem to agree that 100 m/s is a safe landing speed.

So you can either slow down more or use Real Chutes to stop before you plow into the hill at the other end (just like the Space Shuttle!)

There you can set them to deploy on touchdown and to be drag chutes instead of main chutes for rocket pods.

In comparison, a typical final approach (when you\u0027re lined up with the runway and descending to touchdown) starts at an altitude of around 3000 ft AGL (above ground level), or 1km. A good glide slope (the angle at which you descend from altitude to touchdown) is a mere 3 degrees. I\u0027m sure you can descend at 20 degrees in KSP, but that would be insane IRL. You\u0027re going to want to start your final approach from about 17 km away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but pitch your nose up about 3 degrees and control your airspeed with pitch angle. Control your rate of descent with the throttle. It really depends on the aircraft design, but you want to be descending at 3 degrees (prograde marker 3 degrees below horizon) while your nose is pitched up a few degrees above the horizon line. Airspeed could be as low as 66 m/s for aircraft designed for slow speeds (the A-10 \u0022Warthog\u0022 lands at 130 knots, or 66 m/s), but I can get away with 100 - 120 m/s in most of my aircraft designs, which are low aspect ratio supersonic jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirspeed too fast? Nose up. This will make you gain altitude and slow down. To counter the gain in altitude, drop your throttle. Eventually, your airspeed will slow and your altitude gain will turn into altitude loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELosing altitude too fast (i.e. your prograde marker is lower than 5 degrees)? Throttle up. You might also have to pitch up to keep your airspeed down as a result of your increased thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T03:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I see a picture of the plane, it looks like a light and speedy design.

Your going to run into some pitching trouble because your aielerons are very close to the center of mass. Your pitch control should be as far away as you can, either in front (canards) or in back (elevons). The pitch control acts as a lever on the plane, the center of mass is the fulcrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour wings are also very large for a plane that small. Rather than changing the wings I would add another fuel tank to the rear to lengthen the plane and also empty the first two tanks to shift weight a bit, you don\u0027t need that much fuel for this trip anyway. Then add some of the active winglets around the engine area. Finally, using FAR, set the aielerons you have there to do only roll, the winglets by the engine to do only pitch, and your vertical stabilizer on the tail to do only yaw (which is not required at all for flight btw). For a plane like that I can\u0027t imagine you really even needs spoilers or flaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of a plane I made a while back, it\u0027s very similar to yours plus the changes I mentioned above.
