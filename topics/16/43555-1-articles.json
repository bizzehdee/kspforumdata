Rather than make several trips launching 2 or 3 of the 25 part containers into orbit I decided to make a super snack delivery vehicle. This one capable of lifting 500 tons of snacks into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow however I have the issue of my nuke engines falling off for no apparent reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst attempt I figured was a fluke, after all one of the snack containers popped off on the launchpad, which shouldn\u0027t have happened. I launched got to 36,000 m and saw an explosion. At 42,000m I saw another explosion. It was at this point I realized I was down two of my LV-Ns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond attempt I took it back to the VAB added a few more struts to the part containers and just for good measure added another strut to the final stage fuel tanks and to the LV-Ns. No cargo drop on the launchpad, got her up to 36,000m and BOOM engine fell off, and again at 42,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird attempt went back to VAB, added more struts to the engines and attempted to launch again. 36,000m BOOM... revert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth attempted I dumped the whole thing and redesigned it. Slightly lower payload (400 tons) and added a fourth LV-N. I figured if I lost one again I could just shut down the engine on the opposing side and fly on two. Get it up to 36,000m and BOOM. Revert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd more struts, Fith attempt, 36,000m BOOM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the sixth attempt I changed some parts around. I dumped the tanks from nova punch and used some from AEIS, strutted them and the engines to hell and back. 36,000m BOOM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeventh attempt I rebuilt the entire rocket. Aside from the part containers this one was completely stock. I even ditched the super heavy struts from NovaPunch and went back to the basic strut. In the end I wound up with a 653 part monstrosity. As soon as I passed the 36,000m mark BOOM...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially what I am asking is there some bug/glitch that I am unaware of that is keeping these engines from staying super glued to the tanks? If so how do I fix it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before anyone asks on the few flights I let time warp back down to kerbin the first thing in the report was structural failure between LV-N and the tank it was on. They simply dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing else at least going stock had one redeeming feature. In all of the previous designs the engine struck a fuel tank, but never made them go boom. In stock however...

The LV-N engines are heavy and long, with just a 1.25m attachment point. If you put them on a smallish rocket and give it a bit of a shake they have a tendency to snap off. If you have some on a craft that\u0027s parachuting down they have a tendency to snap off. Even if you give a craft in space a proper shaking they can snap off.

The very apparent reason for structural failures is too much mass or too weak connections. Aka physics at work. The fact that your failures kept taking place at 36km and 42km should be an indicator of something specific in the flight taking place there, causing more stress on the craft. Did you just light a new stage or are your tanks getting empty, are you in the middle of your gravity turn or did you just turn off your main stage to coast to AP? There\u0027s so many things that could create stress and make those engines snap off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo back and redo your launch(es), with the specific mindset \u0022because physics\u0022.
