I previously only used EAS-4 Strut connectors, and they did just fine for keeping rockets and landers together. But my space station, having been composed entirely of Sr. docking ports and pieces which are entirely stable on their own, did not have this option. My searches suggest that Autostrutting\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emay\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebe the answer to my problem, but I\u0027m having trouble getting clear info on it;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDoes Autostrutting dynamically change what an object is \u0022attached\u0022 too depending on circumstance (docking/undocking, decoupling, explosive spontaneous deconstruction, etc.)?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf not, what happens when the object strutted to\u00A0is disconnected or destroyed?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat do the various options do, and when are they best used? \u0022disabled\u0022 is obvious of course, but the rest confuse me, especially since I\u0027m not sure about the above two questions...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShould Autostrutting be used to replace\u00A0EAS-4 Strut connectors or supplement them?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHow effective is it at keeping space stations and other large docked up structures from destabilizing and damaging or destroying themselves?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard people sing it\u0027s praises, and I\u0027d like to know why, but I\u0027m just not sure how to make use of the feature, or even where to get good info on it. Also, I\u0027m trying to go vanilla for now, so I\u0027m avoiding mods; I\u0027ve only just started, so simple things like bringing one-way payloads to planets and moons are still a real struggle to me.

But \u0022joints\u0022 in unity have some\u00A0problems/bugs. They are too flexible, and vibrations do not ever damp down. So the devs gave us all a temporary kludge of these autostrut things until unity gets fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutostruts are struts that are zero cost, massless, dragless, and are really easy to connect. They have one drawback related to your points 1\u0026amp;2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 \u0026amp; 2: Yes, all the autostruts on your craft dynamically recalculate/change their endpoints in flight whenever the make-up\u00A0of your craft changes through docking, damage, fuel use, or decoupling. However, the disconnect/reconnect process on an autostrut is a very forceful and violent process. So you want to prevent this from happening to your autostruts if at all possible. You prevent it from happening by turning off most/all of your autostruts before you dock/decouple/or when the \u0022heaviest\u0022 part on your craft is about to change. Then you turn them back on again once the event is over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: Just as you would expect, \u0022Root\u0022 creates a strut between the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of your current part to the Root part (usually the first part that you placed) of your craft. Heaviest does ditto with the currently most massive part on your craft. If you have a bunch of parts that are equally massive, it just picks one randomly. Root and Heaviest autostruts can be very long, and these long autostruts can either be a godsend or a fatal flaw in your craft. You have to know what you are doing. The \u0022grandparent\u0022 part is basically two parts toward the root from your current part. Grandparent autostruts tend to be quite short and they never disconnect/reconnect, and for that reason they are very safe to use. In the Debug menu (Physics tab, iirc), there is a button you can activate: \u0022visualize autostruts\u0022 -- it draws lines between each of the parts that are connected by autostruts. So if you\u0027d rather\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esee\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ethe autostruts instead of reading a bunch of words, try that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Replace. Grandparent autostruts are better than EAS struts in almost every way. Someday, in some future version, the devs may get rid of them -- but for now they are a nice gift to the players. The only time an EAS strut is better is when you want to connect your current part to someplace really strange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Very effective. Space stations, extremely long rockets, and big surface bases tend to build up large destructive oscillations -- especially if you have reaction wheels active and you turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Using a lot of grandparent autostruts can easily rigidize any of these craft in space or on a CB. Just follow two main rules: Be very careful with your autostruts before doing any docking or decoupling, and minimize the number of really long autostruts (let\u0027s say a maximum of 5 long ones per craft).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T08:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0Autostrutting makes no change to the tree of parts attached to other parts (similarly to EAS-4 struts).\u003Cbr\u003E\nStruts and autostruts make their attached parts move together as one rigid body, without changing the logical\u00A0connections use for purposes of un-docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
