They need to get going supersonic before their thrust really starts ramping up. So stay at sea level until you reach ~mach 1.3 then slowly pull up to about 15\u00B0, no more, and climb to at least 15km. There you\u0027ll want to level off and start accelerating in the thin atmosphere. Aim to get to at least 1400m/s\u00A0with just your Whiplashes before allowing your altitude to reach 20km. Then keep your pitch nice and low (\u0026lt;5\u00B0) and light up your rocket engines. Remember, orbit is about going fast, not up, the only reason you need to go up is to keep from blowing up. Drag is basically negligible if you keep your angle of attack close to 0\u00B0 so let your engines focus on building up that orbital velocity and let your wings handle keeping you in the air.
