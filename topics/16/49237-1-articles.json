Space Planes! I\u0027ve flown a couple of the stock ones but without any real understanding of how to actually take one out to LKO or beyond and usually would fly around until my engines cut out from lack of Oxygen and plummet to the ground in a spiralling catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I also feel completely out of my depth on where to start with the design as Aviation in KSP seems incredibly complex in comparison. Usually I\u0027m a MechJeb kinda guy but I don\u0027t expect to be able to use MJ to fly a plane so I\u0027m prepared for manual flight at least until I hit the LKO. So here\u0027s where I need help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly what\u0027s the essentials for making a plane? So far I\u0027ve got cockpit, fuel, engines, rudder, ailerons, wheels. Is there any missing piece? Secondly, what do I need to add to this to make it space worthy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith technique what would be a good way to swap between jet engines to rocket engines and what would be a good height to do so? I have a bunch of questions about re-entry too but I don\u0027t want to flood you guys with a billion questions before I can even get a plane off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prime flux","CreatedById":57347,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will point you towards this great post \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso action groups are your friend when switching from air breather engines and rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpace planes are simple when you get the hang of them... but that first dozen or hundred attempts will be rough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe post that Prime Flux posted is great for building planes that work in KSP and in FAR. I highly suggest if you don\u0027t have it get FAR, it will help with aircraft acting like aircraft in atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as space planes go start small, there are dozens of designs in this thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33312-Showcase-SSTO-s!-Post-your-pictures-here\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33312-Showcase-SSTO-s!-Post-your-pictures-here\u003C/a\u003E look at some of the designs, most of them are plane types but a few are not but still helpful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally am against airhogging (having more intakes than possible), I run a 3:1 intake to engine ratio. I can get to around 20-28km depending on the SSTO before I switch to rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbonautical","CreatedById":75532,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T18:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!
