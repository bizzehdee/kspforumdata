Often when I\u0027m landing on laythe, I\u0027m looking around for nice biomes and features as I glide for hundreds of km without reducing my reentry speed at all. With the intent of flaring heavily when I see a geologic formation that I like. Often that results in so much heat buildup that my poor little plane explodes. And then I promise myself not to do that again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re not picky about your biome or landing spot, I think you could easily enter laythe\u0027s atmosphere at 2km/s -- just so long as you start aerobraking immediately. I wouldn\u0027t enter at anything faster than 2200m/s, I don\u0027t think. The atmosphere is too thin to trust it for a lot of drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-09T07:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe is one of the easiest bodies to land on aerodynamically. As @Aeroboi said, grav brake off Tylo and/or whatever other Jolian muns are available, then aerocapture, then enter. I don\u0027t recall exactly how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E I expended the last time I did this but it was pretty low, maybe 200-300 m/s total from Jolian transfer orbit. Laythe is lower gravity than Kerbin so aerobraking is a lot gentler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trick is to get a good intercept of Laythe for aerocapture, i.e. nice and tangential to its orbit so that your relative velocity is as low as possible. And for aerocapture you can tune your orbit rather precisely by controlling your plane\u0027s attitude -- just point yourself prograde when the orbit has tightened enough for your taste.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-09T07:24:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2019 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
