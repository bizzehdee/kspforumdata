Now when I look in the R\u0026amp;D Archives I have two separate entries for \u0022East Crater\u0022. It appears as though the game is recording science experiments done in the East Farside Crater as \u0022East Crater\u0022 in the R\u0026amp;D Archives.

I just drove a rover through the East Farside Crater and collected a bunch of science.
