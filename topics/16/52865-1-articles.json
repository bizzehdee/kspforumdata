Munar lander lands. Kerbal gets out and grabs a soil sample and EVA report. Kerbal gets back in the lander and blasts off for the CSM. Rendezvous and crew transfer from the MM to the CSM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe EVA report and soil sample stays with the lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there no, current, way to transfer it between the vehicles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t notice or think about that on my first mission, so it stayed with my MM in Munar orbit (but, hey, I guess I can transmit it back come to think since I didn\u0027t end the lander mission yet). Next round I tried keeping my kerbal on the ladder for rendezvous...WAY to much work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I can just spam transmitting the data back now, but that seems cheaty. I know I can also make an all-in-one design instead of seperate lander and command modules...but that isn\u0027t as fun. I also know .23 is going to bring science transfers through EVA (some how).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas? Or is this one just not going to work until .23?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS On another note, I did already set it up so that my materials bay and Goo cansiters are on a detachable module that I can hook to the CSM and then eject the lander portion and only take the science modules back (with parachutes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T17:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah you can\u0027t transfer them, you\u0027ll have to wait for 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"finnolin","CreatedById":90828,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T18:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you are ok with using a mod, try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54998-FScience-Science-data-transfer-v0-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSF77","CreatedById":88474,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T18:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use the mod linked in the above post, works good.

Make the lander also the command capsule and return ship. I\u0027ll leave it a joint though. Leave an orbiting interplanetary stage up around Duna, dettach the lander, drop it down. Once done, dettach ascent stage, rendezvous with the interplanetary section and boost back to Kerbin and then reenter with the ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just can\u0027t bring myself to do that with Mun missions though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome on .23\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rufferal","CreatedById":92695,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T22:57:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExternal Command Seats.

The CoM is not the dead center of the seat. On a small LOR lander, this imbalance can be enough to throw you all over the place. My solution is to make it a two man craft, with symmetrical chairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EECS doesn\u0027t have built in SAS. You\u0027ll have to include RCS, a tiny probe core, or a dedicated SAS module.
