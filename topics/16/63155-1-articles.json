You can set the thrust limit for a given engine to zero using the right-click tweakable menu and the SPH will update the thrust vector.

That helps a ton. I created a new rapier engine with no thrust so I could try to figure out the forward thrust, but thats way easier. That engine will be placed inside the ship with just the bottom of it exposed so it looks flush with the ship. You can kind of see the set up in the top two pics. Ideally that engine will be directly under the COM to accomplish a verticle takeoff/landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/2QBMK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/2QBMK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the album of my first version of the ship. It isn\u0027t as pretty but as you can see it takes off verticaly with the feet down, then lifts the legs up to fly. The dificult part is having it balanced for a hover then balanced for flight when the legs lift. The COM moves backwards and upwards as the legs lift up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is off the topic but thats the game plan for this thing, it\u0027s just going to take a lot of tweaking to get the hover\u0026gt;legs up\u0026gt;flight\u0026gt;legs down\u0026gt;hover\u0026gt;land sequence to work. Thanks again for the 0 thrust tweakable, thats seriously huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: yeah the Lift is behind the COM in that pic. I can post a better one when I get home. To me it looks there like the thrust is pushing below the COM, which should make it pitch upwards. But still the thing just nosedives after about 20 seconds, even with the downward rapier engine on\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-14T17:27:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2014 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by clown_baby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
