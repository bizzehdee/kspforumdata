I don\u0027t think there is such a thing in KSP. So I\u0027m going to guess at the answer to your question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes you get contracts that ask you to fly to a particular place. Once you are sitting in your plane, you can go into map mode, then zoom in and click on the contract destination point. That will put a marker on your navball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to put your own markers on the map at places of your choosing, you have to wait until you have upgraded the Astronaut Complex and Tracking Station to Tier 2. At that point you can plant flags, and select them as \u0022Targets\u0022. (Instead of planting a flag, you can leave a piece of debris at the map point, and target that instead.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the first two contracts are always to take one science reading -- and then to get a rocket a few inches off the ground. -- Unless you wait too long to visit Mission Control and those contracts expire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-19T01:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2016 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
