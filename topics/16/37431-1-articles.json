That allows for much finer control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-keep the relative speed low, so you don\u0027t overshoot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-try switching to docking mode, so you get relative speed and target markers on your navball\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if the problem is that you can\u0027t get closer than 1.5km, remember that to catch up you need to accelerate \u003Cem\u003Eaway\u003C/em\u003E from the target so you get into a lower orbit (which is faster). If you accelerate prograde towards the targeat ahead you\u0027ll just get pushed into a higher and slower orbit and so you\u0027ll just end up farther behind. Start firing (with RCS!) directly towards your target only when you\u0027re already within visual range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all else fails, search youtube for Scott Manley\u0027s videos on the subject =D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T14:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are the basics, doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re using LOX thrust or RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Make sure the velocity gauge over the navball is set to \u0022Target\u0022. If it isn\u0027t, you can switch to docking mode or just click it until it comes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Watch the distance between you and the target; easiest way I find to do this is with the map but the data will come up in the flight view as long as you\u0027ve got your target selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) If the distance starts to creep back up, aim your ship at the retrograde marker (the yellow one with an x in the center) and reduce your relative velocity to zero m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once your relative speed is zeroed, aim at the target (the purple doughnut with a meatball in the center). Thrust ahead - ten meters per second should be sufficient if you\u0027re more than a thousand meters out. You should notice the distance dropping again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Repeat as necessary. Slow your relative velocity as the distance closes - a good rule of thumb is 1 m/s for every 100 meters or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) At 100 meters, slow to zero, adjust your aim and thrust towards the target. If you\u0027re aiming for a specific docking port on the target, this would be a good time to target it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) At 50 meters, slow to zero, adjust your aim and thrust towards the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) At 20 meters, slow to zero and adjust your aim. Here\u0027s where you need to make sure you\u0027re aligned for docking. Easiest way to do this is to switch over to the second craft, target the first craft, and aim the second craft towards the first. If you haven\u0027t got a lot of torque or its turning response is crappy, it helps to timewarp for an ever so short amount of time once it\u0027s aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Switch back to the first craft, adjust your aim again and thrust towards the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) At 10 meters, slow to zero, adjust your aim carefully and thrust towards the target. No faster than 0.5 m/s at this pont; 0.3 is probably optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) At 5 meters, slow to zero, adjust your aim carefully and thrust towards the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) Once the ports get within a meter or so of each other, they\u0027ll try and pull each other in.

Short-duration fast maneuvers are \u0022point and shoot.\u0022 Outside of 50km think transfer orbits. Inside 10km think point and shoot. The difference between the two regimes is what orbiting around a common body does to your velocity vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 1.5km you\u0027re well inside direct-path range. The goal in this situation is to \u0022put the \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E on the \u003Cstrong\u003Ething\u003C/strong\u003E.\u0022 The \u003Cstrong\u003Ething\u003C/strong\u003E in this case is the direction to target and the \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E is the velocity vector. Adjusting your velocity vector can be confusing if you\u0027re not used to it. In the general case you are going to have two components to your velocity with respect to the target, axial and lateral. Axial is motion toward or away and lateral is sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo travel to the destination we want a manageable positive axial motion (toward it) and minimal lateral motion (sideways). A good first step is to put your nose on the target (pink round) and roll until the velocity vector (yellow, either one) is up. If the anti-velocity vector is visible in the hemisphere around the target direction then you are traveling away from it. Burn toward the target until the prograde velocity vector is in sight. If not, skip that step and proceed to next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the previous steps we should be traveling toward the target but also missing it due to some lateral motion. To cancel the lateral motion we point opposite and burn to cancel that \u003Cem\u003Ecomponent\u003C/em\u003E of our velocity without adjusting your toward/away part. As an example we\u0027re traveling towardish the target with our nose on it and our velocity vector showing prograde somewhere between the pink-round and the top of the navball. We\u0027ve got excess \u0022up\u0022 lateral velocity that we want to cancel. We do this by pointing 90 degrees \u0022down\u0022 and burning a little bit. How much is a matter of some math or guess and check. After several iterations of this the velocity vector and the target market should merge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s a question of speed and timings. What\u0027s your relative speed? Are you going to get there in 200 milliseconds or 20 weeks? Personally I strive for a relative speed that arrives in 100 seconds. It\u0027s easy math and comfortable. If something is 20km away I want to have a closing speed of 200 m/s. For 5km, 50 m/s, etc. Orbiting Kerbin happens once every 30 minutes or so. If your rendezvous takes a significant fraction of this time (1/4 orbit or more) then your aiming gets complicated very quickly and it\u0027s better to switch your brain to intercept orbital transfer mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 10 seconds I turn around and reduce speed to match the 100 seconds rule again. So 9km, 90m/s. At 900m I slow to 9 m/s. At 90m I slow to 0.9 m/s. Inside 100m I keep docking slow and visual. If you\u0027re close in position and speed then the disrupting effects of orbiting are minimized. Once inside 100m and 0.5 m/s you are effectively colocated and static and the fact you\u0027re orbiting shouldn\u0027t be too bothersome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
