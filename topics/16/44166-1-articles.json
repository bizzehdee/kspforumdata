Going from a 100km to a 200km orbit does nothing... you\u0027d have to go up to 800km to cut the drift-rate in half.

Somewhere around 100-150km should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to make docking easier is to turn your craft so that the docking ports point Normal to your orbit.
