Only (not so) \u0022physic-less\u0022 parts are non even. For example, as antenna aren\u0027t physic-less, I always stick 2 of them...\n\nThen KER always shows 0 thrust torque-offset.\n\nBut recently I\u0027m working with moving space stations and I noticed that my lander was nearly the same weight as my generic lander. So I sticked the side ways. that gave me 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of torque offset.\n\nWhen I fired the engines with SAS... nothing append : the ship flew straight. The engines don\u0027t have gimbal, so the course correction is managed by the reactions wheels (2 big ones and probe cores)\n\n[![eac68a85-fb54-4c81-b932-74d2cb4efd4f.jpg](http://tof.canardpc.com/preview/eac68a85-fb54-4c81-b932-74d2cb4efd4f.jpg)](http://tof.canardpc.com/view/eac68a85-fb54-4c81-b932-74d2cb4efd4f.jpg)\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\nThe questions : \n\n- How can we evaluate when it\u0027s necessary to balance parts ?\n\n- How can we evaluate the reaction wheels torque correction needed ?\n\n- Do reaction wheel can compensate better at low thrust ?\n\n- What experimentation can we do to check that."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T06:37:02Z","Content":"I mock up the design in the VAB and use RCS Build Aid to evaluate the torque generated by offset masses."},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T09:22:21Z","Content":"Deactivate the SAS on your landers/side modules.

If the offset engine torque is greater than that of your reaction wheel, then your ship will be unable to hold course.\n\nDue to lever arms and such, an engine running at low thrust will produce less torque from an offset CoM than an engine running at high thrust at the same point.\n\nSeveral experiments to do with reaction wheel placement have been done over the years, just google for reaction wheel placement KSP. As for offset CoT/CoM torque, I am unsure as to where to find examples but mostly proven in the Math."},{"CreatedByName":"bzimac","CreatedById":144219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T11:27:36Z","Content":"Amount of torque generated by offset thrust depends on two things. First is distance from center of mass to the line along the thrust vector. Second is amount of thrust.\n\nWhat helps here is that your ship has a lot of mass (at least with full fuel tanks), so center of mass doesn\u0027t move very far. Also, nuclear engines don\u0027t have a lot of thrust.\n\nIn case reaction wheels were not able to control the ship, you could try to balance it by transfering fuel between landers, or by limiting thrust of the engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T13:09:55Z","Content":"Thank you for you replies. \n\nSAS can handle torque offset. I didn\u0027t noticed first, but it also show a thrust torque which depends on the engine providing the thrust. \n\nI did some testing, even increasing torque by moving fuel around, messing my save file. SAS is capable of handeling the torque. BUT, the heading is still sliding because SAS don\u0027t keep a clear heading. It works better when targeting prograde, radial or normal. Event a node will keep it straight. \n\nThat\u0027s for reaction wheels.\n\nNow for Gimbal : engines (but not LVN on my test vessel) have gimbal. My ship would be stable is the torque offset angle is lower than the gimbal angle ?"}]}
