What is an eastward orbit ? An orbit is either clock-wise or counter clock-wise. Anyway, so here\\\u0027s my situation, tell me what i\\\u0027m doing wrong\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI land on the mun with half a tank of fuel and 3 quarters of RCS left. I usually manage to land close to the the equator. I make a counter-clockwise orbit, i adjust the orbit so the Ap faces towards kerbin, I boost at the Pe so Ap is closer to kerbin (i\\\u0027ve tried various Ap distances and angles). Every time I end up orbiting kerbin with huge Ap and Pe values (last time it was 6million to 21 million) and i simply don\\\u0027t have enough fuel to correct that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can i do to end up with a smaller Ap value ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I make a clockwise orbit instead ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat should my TKI orbit look like ? Any pictures or a video would be appreciated. If you\\\u0027re going to describe it could you tell me what should the Ap and Pe values be and what should be the angle between |Ap Pe| and |kerbin mun| given |Ap Pe| is on the same plane as |Ap Pe|\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waterlimon","CreatedById":16829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-15T14:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could try to fly opposite to the direction where the moon is going, preferably at 0 velocity if you look at it from kerbin-space, so when you have been hovering still for long enough (looking from kerbin)/flying high enough(looking from mun), you will exit the SoI of mun and end up falling straight to kerbin :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats what id do if i got to the mun \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypocee","CreatedById":8609,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-15T15:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027East\u0027 and \u0027west\u0027 rely on arbitrary reference choices...but so do \u0027clockwise\u0027 and \u0027counterclockwise\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E In my case at least, \u0027east\u0027 and \u0027west\u0027 always refer to the arbitrary reference frame chosen by the NavBall, i.e. east=90 on the NavBall and west=270.

You have to aim towards left of the kerbin (looking from the top, kerbin on the middle of the screen and the mun directly below it) for you to be able go directly to it. Which is caused by the movement of the mun on it\\\u0027s orbit around kerbin. When you aim directly to kerbin the mun tilts your path over time and causes you to end up with a gentle orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4003.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4003.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelped me understand it thanks to the pictures, it\\\u0027s on the front page too.
