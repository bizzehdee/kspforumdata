It isn\u0027t about orbits, it is about software ergonomics. Maybe if they used arrows instead of dots, the human brain would more intuitively grasp the intention. They don\u0027t have to be big arrows, sometimes the slightest change makes a big difference in ergonomics.\n\nThere is a story that Valve will tell you about the Portal development and testing. When they first did focus groups, they received a load of comments on how it was unrealistic and unbelievable that someone could fall such great distances. So they simply added the initial scene where you could see Chell\u0027s legs and the attached bars on the back of her legs and never heard a complaint about it from the focus groups again. \n\nIt is a funny thing how the mind works, and that is why there are people like me who make their careers out of predicting the intuitiveness of software. At best bad ergonomics are an annoyance to the users, at worst it can destroy a software, just ask Microsoft... it killed Windows 8. My specialization is in user software rather than gaming elements so I can\u0027t offer a lot of ideas on fixing this in KSP, but I can tell you it is an ergonomic issue.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T22:00:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"}]}
