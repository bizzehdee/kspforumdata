Even on a world without atmosphere, you will still undershoot from where you target as during braking you\u0027ll slow down. It may take a reload or two to get it perfectly, but once you get a feel for a particular world it becomes quite simple to land \u002B/- 5km or so. Worlds with atmosphere are even harder as aerobraking will suddenly shave a lot of speed off, as will parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn low grav worlds it\u0027s also very easy to correct your destination once you\u0027re coming directly downwards, as long as you still have a bit of height you can tilt in the direction you want to go and burn a bit. Finally, on low grav worlds, if you do come down far away, it can be really quite easy to \u0027hop\u0027 once on the surface. Take off with a very slow rate of ascent, angle in the direction you want to go, push your path out beyond your destination then cut thrust and wait. As you pass very close to your target you should still have a good bit of height left if you pushed your landing spot beyond it. You also shouldn\u0027t be moving too fast. So burn prograde hard and come right down.
