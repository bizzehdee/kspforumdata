basically, get out of the treacle-like lower atmosphere before steering!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough it is tempting to add fins and stuff, be careful.\u00A0 This is a successful one-man ascender --\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lxOxHEF.png\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/lxOxHEF.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the addition of basic fins on the upper stage changed this from being able to make orbit from sea level with 1000ms spare, to one that could not make it to orbit from a starting altitude of 2000metres.\u00A0 \u00A0On Kerbin, you can generally brute-force your way through the lower atmopshere with enough engines.\u00A0 On Eve, you probably can\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEjecting re-entry stuff causes explosions\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0-- This is either when you\u0027re in the descent phase, when you\u0027ve dropped below the exploding-due-to-entry-heat phase, and want to get rid of extraneous heatshields, or on the surface when you want to get rid of parachutes and landing legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0-- Separatrons are good (in one of the earlier versions of KSP Separatrons basically didn\u0027t work at low altitudes on Eve, but this appears to be fixed since at least 1.3.1).\u00A0 Spinning whilst staging can also help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0-- Ejecting the bottom heatshield is recommended after inflating the parachutes.\u00A0 This is mainly because before this, your lovely aerodynamic rocket will move much faster than the ejected draggy heatshield, causing you to crash into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0-- It can be helpful to lift off and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0eject any landing gear structure if that\u0027s possible, depends on your first-stage engine though -
