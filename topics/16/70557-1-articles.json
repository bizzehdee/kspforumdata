I had about 20 different ships/bases/probes on the Mun. I had performed a quick save, and of course being on the Mun, one of my rovers flipped over, because apparently that\u0027s all rovers are good for on the Mun - even at 5m/s. I reload the quick save, and suddenly I\u0027m missing about a quarter of what I put up on the Mun. I thought it may have been classified as debris (I have my debris set to 0) but some of the units that vanished, were the same as ones that remained - and all the vessels that disappeared had probe cores. And of course the persistent file updated after the reload, so I can\u0027t even find the missing craft there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue is I seem to only be able to dock a certain number of vessels together, and then I can no longer attach any more. I know the clamp-o-trons are at the exact same height, because I built a lower assembly to guarantee that, and some of the vessels that won\u0027t dock are multiple clones, so they have to be the same height. They will draw towards each other, suck together, but will not dock. All units do have a probe cores, maybe that\u0027s the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else run into this sort of thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-28T23:58:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2014 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by EdFred\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T04:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat sized docking ports are you using?

I was using rovers on Kerbin and noticed that I had to be exceptionally close on the height and angle to get them to click together. In most cases, I had to hack gravity for just a second for them to have enough wiggle to stick.
