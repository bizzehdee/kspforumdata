So if you\u0027ve done enough science to suit you and are done with anomalies, just go touring. There are scads of really cool geologic features scattered all over and they\u0027re definitely worth seeing. And perhaps building a vacation home for Jeb at. The mountains and badlands are especially interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you go touring, you need a map. I recommend using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalMaps.com\u003C/a\u003E to plan your trip. This incidentally will show the highest point on Kerbin, which is a mountain located at 61.5784 N, 46.3733 E, as well as the biomes and anomalies if you want to grab some of them while you\u0027re out. But it\u0027s discovering the cool random things the procedural terrain system spits out that IMHO is the reason for the trip. So look at the map for places where the terrain looks likely to combine several elements and go have a look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn easy bit of coolness to find is what I call \u0022Mount St. Kelens\u0022. This is a big volcanic-looking mountain sitting alone not too far NNE of KSC. The east side is all blown out like its namesake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5519/12459872665_00f7654707_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212459872665_00f7654707_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to get the full enjoyment of the cool geography, you have to land there. This requires a plane with not only the range to go and return, but also insane STOL or ever VTOL performance, and the structural rigidity to take rough landings. If VTOL ain\u0027t your thing, go for STOL by just piling on more wing area until you can take off at 20-25m/s, then go straight up with a TWR \u0026gt; 1. With such a plane, you don\u0027t need anything even approximating level ground; all of Kerbin is your runway. So you can do stupid airplane tricks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3673/12460406574_8af5fd670f_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212460406574_8af5fd670f_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirbase Island is overrated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-11T16:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mmmmyum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mmmmyum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe pyramids are underground now though aren\u0027t they?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, they\u0027re not.
