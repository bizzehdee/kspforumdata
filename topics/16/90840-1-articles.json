The design was inspired by several other\u0027s examples. Works great on Mun and Minmus. Rover has an OKTO for control, or a Kerbalite driver. Rover science complex is also autonomous, with an OKTO control. After landing the rover/science complex, 3 Kerbalites were landed nearby. I un-docked and drove the rover out to pick them up... then returned, putting 2 in the science module and leaving the 3rd to drive around and do science. Driving up beneath the science module, the magnetics of the docking port simply pulls the rover back up and it docks... science gets transferred and processed... then undock and head out again. Lander legs were locked fully extended before landing. It\u0027s one way of doing it anyway, worked for me. The only thing I\u0027d change about it now was the use of the Place-Anywhere RCS ports, I was playing around with them... should have stuck with the RV-105\u0027s.
