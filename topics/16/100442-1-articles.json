(It weighs a bit over 25 tons.) The contract called for a base on wheels that could support 17 Kerbals so I figured this would be a great opportunity to use the XL3, but now I\u0027m not so sure. It gets slower and slower as I make my way up the hill, if I try and zig-zag up the whole thing just skids sideways and climbs up the slope of the crater even more slowly. Should I scarp the design and go for the smaller wheels?\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/lBfuVLq.png](http://i.imgur.com/lBfuVLq.png)\n\nEDIT:\n\nWell, I made it out. Physical time acceleration didn\u0027t really help, but I found out that if you make very quick short zig-zags you could maintain the speed at around 2 m/s. Without the zig-zagging the speed sometimes stalled down to zero and I was afraid I would start slipping backwards. All the same, if anyone has some sort of input or suggestions for getting better torque on inclinations like this I would very much appreciate further advice.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/NaJtsYu.png](http://i.imgur.com/NaJtsYu.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T18:48:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T18:43:53Z","Content":"No, that\u0027s just a REALLY steep hill, no problems there.\n\nI\u0027d say that, if you did make it out of that hole, that 20 degrees is your maximum inclination with that design.\n\nSome tips:\n\nDitch wheels, use the NERVA engines, if possible.\n\nIf not, go with smaller wheels and a lighter craft.\n\nAdd some engines to help push you up.\n\nThe \u0022plane\u0022 gear are un-poppable. (When rolling. Crashing... well. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) Use engines and those gear and you can go at nearly any speed, provided you can still control the thing.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT:\n\nOh, the plane gear aren\u0027t \u0022wheels\u0022, exactly. They are, but the contract for a mobile base doesn\u0027t like them.\n\nStick other wheels on it and you\u0027ll be good, though. (The tiny little ones will let you complete the contract.
