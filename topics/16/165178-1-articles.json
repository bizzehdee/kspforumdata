Usually,\u00A0I burn at 5km from target towards it (if remeber correct the purple circle?) to something like 50m/s and wait, when its close to the target my prograde is not aligned with it.

Wait, when at maybe 100m go 0m/s again, target again an bo to 10-5m/s. Wait, at 30-20m go 0m/s again. With some slow and careful simple steps you will easily come close to the target and stop relative to it. At this ponit you start the doking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn no time you will get it and you do without so much burn and brake. Will be more efficient too.
