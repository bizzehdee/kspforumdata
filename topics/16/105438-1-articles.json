We always have to re-root the subassembly or merged craft before using them. The game should be able to re-root the parts automatically when you drag them in, or at least be able to root parts manually when they\u0027re dragged in and red."},{"CreatedByName":"Allen Snowdon","CreatedById":153004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T20:43:56Z","Content":"Too bad you can\u0027t save or load a rect without a pod, and you can\u0027t change a pod later, that sucks."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T21:09:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Too bad you can\u0027t save or load a rect without a pod, and you can\u0027t change a pod later, that sucks.\n\nTry using the reroot tool, the pod does not have to stay."},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T23:37:29Z","Content":"Edit: Ok, I managed, but now I\u0027ve other issues probably not related with merging.
