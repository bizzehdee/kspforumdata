I have mining modules on the lander too.\u00A0After going to Duna and sending a rover to Eve. I\u0027ve unlocked enough parts to do this but my only problem is fuel. The first stage and second stage is fine but my interplanetary transfer stage/tanker is the problem. I\u0027m also using a Rhino engine for the transfer (nuclear engines are too weak). After completing the transfer burn, i don\u0027t have enough fuel for the plane change and capture burn. I even took out a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002BOx of the lander fuel tank since it doesn\u0027t need that much fuel to land on Dres. Is there any way or any mods that will help me to do this?\u00A0 Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-18T15:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse a poodle instead of a rhino (or a wolfhound if you have it). You need all the Isp you can get. Short, High-G burns are fun and all -- but going interplanetary requires some sacrifices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-18T16:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes you won\u0027t want thrust you want efficiency. Poodles or even terriers are the way to go if you don\u0027t want to go full nuke.

You mentioned emptying tanks, so consider replacing partially empty tanks with a mix of smaller, full tanks. There\u0027s no advantage in KSP to using larger tanks except for part count and wobbliness.\u00A0Have you removed any extra ablator? Heat shields that are full of ablator can survive dropping all the way from Jool or beyond. Is your lander two stage? You might be able to shave some weight off by making it two stage. And is your Dres ascent \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E high enough? Unlike Kerbin, 1.2-1.5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is too weak to be efficient on airless worlds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB) Add fuel to your transfer stage.

If the stack is getting to heavy to make orbit, then\u00A0launch with some empty tanks and refuel them in orbit.
