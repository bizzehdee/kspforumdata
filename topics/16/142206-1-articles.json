Curiously, I have noticed that the Jumbo 64 fuel tanks sometimes line up differently with the\u00A0next level? In the below image you will see that the 64\u0027s are offset, judging by the line of \u0022piping\u0022 on the side of each? In my original post, this piping all lines up, tank to tank. I don\u0027t think that means anything, but I point it out all the same. The fact that 3 stacks work and 1 doesn\u0027t makes me think you are correct and some little niggly placement thing is preventing one C7 from transferring fuel.

Then turn off symmetry and rebuild ONE radial stack, preferably the one facing due south (right side in that screenshot) or at least one of the cardinal directions.

I suspect from the misaligned tanks that you built them in random order, attaching one orange tank in full symmetry southside, then putting another orange tank on the NW symmetry unit instead of building it on the same side.
