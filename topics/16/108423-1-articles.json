It seems stable in the pitch direction, a little less stable in the yaw direction, but it is almost impossible to control in the roll direction. It always seems to roll one way or another out of control after a couple minutes of flight.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that the roll controls on this work weirdly. If I try to roll it right, say, it will roll right a little bit but then zoom back left, even beyond where it was initially. I have tried looking at some spaceplane tutorials but they always seem to address stability in the pitch direction, and I haven\u0027t been able to find one that addresses stability in the roll direction. What are the possible causes of this problem?\n\n(I am trying to copy and paste the picture in here but it doesn\u0027t seem to work; it always gives the error \u0022The text you have entered is too long.\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:17:24Z","Content":"If the image is on steam, open your steam screenshot page and copy the url of the image into the thread."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T18:03:55Z","Content":"If you\u0027re by any chance trying to carry an M700 scanner in that plane, remove it...
