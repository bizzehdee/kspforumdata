When I get to say about 10k to 15k sometimes lower but never higher my rocket wants to \u0022tip over\u0022 like its top heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is what I did - first I checked my center of mass etc...all good right down the middle. I thought maybe it was just a payload. I added angled boosters to help stabilize on launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever ever got above 15k with the rocket tipping over (loosing control, top heavy feel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO ok I was getting frusturated. I launched the same rocket with no payload and it did the same thing - ok so its the rocket not the payload i thought. Played around a bit still every time same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK SO I launched a different rocket - did the same thing!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched my primary rocket I use for say 75% of my lifts empty, with payload I have launched before etc... same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought ok mechjeb? took it off - still doing it. SAS? still doing it. FAB?? took it out still doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of my primary rocket I use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0L2Xun1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220L2Xun1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is two launches with the same rocket with TWO DIFFERENT tops (to different size payloads) that I got up no issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AmZLlnp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AmZLlnp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOW here is the kicker...
