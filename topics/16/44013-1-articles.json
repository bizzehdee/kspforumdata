After struggling with unplayable lag, I\u0027ve decided to strip out most of the part packs I had, and just go with some basics. One thing I really do want, however, are the massive panels you see in this image, but I can\u0027t figure out which addon they\u0027re from. I\u0027ve had no luck hunting online either. They were a random find that I can\u0027t randomly find again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/20f2ihk.png\u0022 alt=\u002220f2ihk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-27T04:50:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2013 04:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Moencino\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T04:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose panels are from the B9 Aerospace pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moencino","CreatedById":79498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T04:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoh!
