So far I\u0027ve not used any. Check out the SpacePort and the forums here for those. Its involved. First, you need to decide what the mission is. If its just flying around in the air, experiment. If it is to get to orbit, determine what altitude you want to achieve (high and low points of the orbit) and what you want to be your payload. Then you get to figure out the total mass involved and the total delta Velocity. If you want to return to Kerbin, allow for a little more. If you are planning to go to a moon or another planet, you\u0027ve got more variables, like their positions relative to where your\u0027s is in the different orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure someone else will chime in, but that will get you thinking about it until better replies are up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T22:59:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESlightly shortened it.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T22:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore I began doing my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entry.php/762-Eos-Program-Announcement\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEos Program\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027ve laid out the complete program in a simple text file in Notepad.

To do that, I need to build a rocket that can get a lander into orbit around Kerbin and then to the Mun, and a lander that can get off of the Mun\u0027s and return to Kerbin.

Pretty much everything you can do in the game boils down to the same set of core skills, so taking the time to master those skills around Kerbin and its moons will reward you in the long run. If you can land on and return from the Mun, you can in theory do the same from anywhere else in the system (provided you have the right craft for the job); getting two ships close enough to dock applies the same principles as getting your lander to the Mun (with the added complication that your target ship doesn\u0027t have its own gravity well), which in turn is just an application of learning how to change the shape of your orbit; and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, feel free to ask as many questions as you need to, whether you\u0027re stuck on something or just need more info.
