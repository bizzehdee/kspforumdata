Im designing a pretty descent rocket to start with, but i got 2 of those weird missions that im struggling to complete. Basically what i have to do is to test the Hammer solid booster at 30.000 meters and at 160ms to 240ms speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow i tried to design a rocket that will use liquid engine to get to 30k and then to decouple it and use a second solid booster stage, my problem is that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. im running out of liquid fuel too early\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. im running out of solid fuel too early\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. at 20k altitude my speed is already at about 600ms\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin addition, i have to test a decoupler while at lunch pad, which is a really weird thing to do\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplease post me a design that can achive 2 of those missions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas far a research, i only unlocked\u0026gt; \u0022Start\u0022 \u0026gt; \u0022Basic Rocketry \u0022 \u0026gt; \u0022Engineering 101 \u0022 \u0026gt; \u0022General Rocketry \u0022 \u0026gt; \u0022Stability\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T10:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTesting decoupler at the launchpad is dead simple. But you might want to avoid doing it if you haven\u0027t unlocked the part yet - because you get to use it as often as you like UNTIL you complete the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut to do it? Attach a decoupler to a command pod. Launch. Right-click on the decoupler to \u0022test\u0022 unless you are told to activate it in the staging sequence, in which case you put it in a stage by itself and activate. Done. Recover craft for 100% value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the booster - if you\u0027re going too fast, just build a smaller rocket! Again it depends on whether it says to \u0022test\u0022 or \u0022activate\u0022, but basically put a pod and parachute then decoupler then your SRB (right-click in the VAB to set throttle at 30% or something) then decoupler then either a seriously under-throttled SRB or a couple of fuel tanks and Reliant \u002B fins.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve got to 600m/s at 30,000m then you\u0027re 99% there, just throttle down. For the SRB that just means right-click in the VAB.
