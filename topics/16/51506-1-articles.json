My question involves attaching an unmanned probe core to manned equipment. What I\u0027m trying to do is send an Apollo style command module \u002B lander module \u002B an additional \u0022Science Probe\u0022 lander as well so I don\u0027t have to return to Kerbin with its weight, it can sit wherever and mine science points. And the Kerbins can return slightly less massive and better fuel budget. (FYI I\u0027m doing this because on several planets I\u0027ve already mined science points with my unmanned landers so the Science Probe could just be dropped into orbit for the places I haven\u0027t done high/low-alt science at or land as well etc. Seems like a flexible mission payload to me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is detaching the Science Pod from the manned equipment works fine, I can steer, activate ASAS, throttle, everything I need to, until I deploy my solar panels... for whatever reason it appears the panels don\u0027t want to track, they\u0027ll extend but sit in their default configurations which defeats the purpose of the tracking panels... any idea what causes this?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-02T04:35:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2013 04:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by darkfall13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered self...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkfall13","CreatedById":90354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T04:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enm for those that get the same problem a restart did the trick...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
