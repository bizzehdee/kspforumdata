I am just starting in career mode, and I go to launch something, and the first time I hit map view, I am looking at the far side of Kerbin, and I have to scroll the view around to properly see my ship and apoapsis and the like. And it does this with every new launch. Is there a reason for this? It is by no means game breaking, but it does cost me an extra couple of seconds (which can be very precious sometimes) to swing the camera around."},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T06:52:07Z","Content":"Do you only have the problem with night launches?

Note that it\u0027s not when you go to the Space Center if you\u0027ve switched to map view, it occurs only (I\u0027m fairly sure, some experimentation is needed) when you switch to the Space Center *from* map view. When you are zoomed out like that, hitting \u0022m\u0022 twice will fix the camera.\n\nAs for the orientation of the camera I am not sure, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s been happening to me. Do you have any mods installed?"}]}
