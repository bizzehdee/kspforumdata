I looked up a guide online, and it says I need the Phase Angle (angle between the two planets) and the Ejection Angle. I get that. But then I get these angles and go into the game, and I don\u0027t see that there\u0027s a way to show these angles, so I just have to guesstimate whether I\u0027m in the right spot or not. This makes it frustrating to spend half an hour trying to get to a planet and end up not having the right intercept. How do I show these angles in-game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Phase Angle is the critical one.
