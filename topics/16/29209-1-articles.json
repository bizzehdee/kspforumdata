When I first took control of the station after the update, all of the sepratrons fired and put my station into a wild spin. Not to be deterred, I flew up a new pair of escape modules to replace them. I flew my tug over to the delivery rocket and docked with the stack. When I undocked from the delivery rocket, the new sepratrons fired! Sending my tug spiraling off into the abyss with two escape pods attached. I\u0027m fairly sure this is an artifact of the staging changes in 0.20.
