Similarly, the \u0027-\u0027 lets you collapse and remove empty stages. Click any component in the stages and drag it to the stage that you want. Whole stages can be re-ordered by dragging the bar above them to the put them in the squence you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote also that the staging can sometimes be a bit limiting. If you want to do several things together that don\u0027t have \u0027staging\u0027 actions, such as decoupling docking-ports, or need to do something more than once - parachutes you\u0027ve re-packed are the classic example - you will need to use action groups.

It seems to be something KSP does all by itself, or not. They\u0027re usually grouped to a single icon if added with symmetry but if you change almost anything they\u0027re shown separately. A save and reload usually consolidates them but, to be honest, it\u0027s not something I worry about much - when you light them in flight they\u0027re all shown individually anyway, whatever you do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-11T23:43:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2014 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T23:36:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPecan is right.

Each booster has a few sepatrons on it to help push it away from the main body.

Was wondering if the sepatrons where grouped would they fire properly or what am doing wrong to make them fire? I have sepatrons that push my main tanks away during asparasugs staging drops and works fine but for some reasons the boosters just drop and are not being pushed away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T00:13:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut the seperatrons in the same stage as the decoupler, before the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIE stage 3 consists of 8 seperatrons and 8 decouplers, the seperatrons are below the decoupler.

To fix it, you can rearrange the order of the separatrons/decouplers within the staging block. So per xcorps\u0027 example... If stage 3 consisted of 8 seperatrons (at the top of the stage) and 8 decouplers (at the bottom of the stage), then grab the whole lot of decouplers and shift them to the top of the stage. Try to grab them all at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe order doesn\u0027t really matter.

If they\u0027re just decelerating the tank, then you\u0027ll still get collisions commonly. Orienting them so they push the tank directly away from the rocket has tended to work better for me. Lots of ways you can place the sepratrons to accomplish it, but generally I just put them on the sides of the tank, at right angles to each other, so the net force is directly away from the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
