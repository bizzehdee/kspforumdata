It has not gotten past just a\u00A0vague idea. I have never built a boat before and I am struggling with the design. I am thinking it would have to be amphibious, otherwise I would have to come up with some type of shore docking system which raises all sorts of level of docking ports problems. Maybe I could just have my Kerbals wade to shore, but that does not seem an elegant solution. I am thinking I could use two Structural Fuselage capped on either end with Aerodynamic Nose Cones as pontoons, with something\u00A0like a MK2 cockpit and\u00A0Mk2 Crew Cabin powered by a jet engine. But I am not sure how to do the wheels. So, I was hoping some of you might share your boat designs to get me started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat does your amphibious boat look like? Or, maybe you have a better solution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T20:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you willing to go with mods? I think Kerbinside would allow you to place images of docks on Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I use the small retractable landing gears when I want to be amphibious -- they have a lot less drag in the water when they are retracted. MK2 parts are nicely shaped for floating and boating, for the fuselage and fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in general any airplane can be a boat. They all float -- you have to do really special things to make them sink, especially in low gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t really need any wheels, though. Laythe\u0027s islands have really steep shorelines, so you can drive in really close. Then all you need is a gangplank on the nose that reaches a few meters to the shore, for your passengers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T21:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003E\u0022gangplank on the nose that reaches a few meters to the shore,\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI kind of like that idea.
