You just have to calculate, manually, your orbital time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is, it\u0027s easier than it looks like; i recently learned it, and it worked immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a very simple datasheet to calculate this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RrNB0SK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002246.17\u0022 height=\u0022372\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/RrNB0SK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see on the red circle, the two lines of numbers are just iterations, where the same numer is added over and over. In this case the upper line is the orbital period of Eve, and the lower line is the orbital period of my spaceship. So, the first line is just telling me that eve will return to the same position after 261.9 days, and then after 523.8 days, and then after 785.7.... while my spaceship will return to the intercept in 174.6 days, and then the next time in 349, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd i just manually look if some of those numbers check. In this case, the datasheet shows that in 523.8 days eve will pass again through the intercept having made 2 orbits, while my spaceship will pass in the same spot at the same time having made 3 orbits, so a 2:3 resonance. But i used a 9:10 on kerbin earlier, and it\u0027s not any different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the numbers don\u0027t check, i look where the numbers are closer, and I try to refine it. For example, in this case maybe i started with 180 days of orbital period, saw i would be late for a 2:3 resonance, and tried to adjust for a faster orbit. if that was not possible, i could have tried for a 3:4 resonance, and so on. there are more refined ways and more accurate tools, but this one suffices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManuever-node wise, the way to do it is to set up a manuever node (without any actual deltaV used) after the gravity assist. it will tell you the new orbital period. so you try to adjust your flyby so that the new orbital period, shown in the second manuever node, will match what you calculated. You can\u0027t see your new orbital time when you adjust the flyby, you have to tinker with the correction manuever blindly and then select the second manuever node and see if the orbital time is right. however, with a bit of trial and error you can do it. and if your new orbit is a few hours shorter or longer than it should be, a correction manuever to fix that is cheap - so long as it\u0027s just a few hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022584hFRy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/584hFRy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis image shows one such manuever planned. You can see the new orbital period, 385 days, in the bottom left corner of the image; it\u0027s the 9:10 resonance with kerbin i calculated. you can see the manuever node selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, i said that there was some formula in addition to all this. Namely, there are 2 other mathematical boundaries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first, and most important, is that \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou leave your planet after the flyby at the same speed you arrived, only in a different direction\u003C/strong\u003E. example of why this is important: after my third kerbin flyby, i reached an intercept to eve. i was aiming for moho, and from eve to moho a transfer takes roughly 1000 m/s excess speed (in addition to eve escape). but my trajectory from kerbin had a 600 m/s intercept speed over eve. Guess what? No matter how much i tinkered with the trajectories, i could never intercept moho the way i wanted. I had to provide the additional 400 m/s with a burn at eve periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you\u0027ve ejected from earth at the minimum excess speed, you won\u0027t ever be able to reach jupiter with any amount of flybys. you need two planets to bounce against each other, gaining energy at every step. on kerbin you can also use mun, if you include a mun flyby you can leave kerbin at a different speed than you had coming in. but the real moon has too much of an orbital inclination and too slow an orbital time for this to be practical. On the plus side, if you left earth on an inclined orbit, you can use the flyby to change your orbital inclination for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsecond boundary, every planet can give you an assist for a limited amount of deltaV - the closer the pass, the higher the deltaV. if that deltaV is not enough, you have to make multiple passages. For example, kerbin can give you roughly 500 m/s kick, maybe 700. if you are coming from jool, excess speed of 1000 m/s, and you want to go to eve, you can do it - convert your excess speed of 1000 m/s going away from the sun to 1000 m/s going towards the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you won\u0027t be able to do it in one passage. not even in 2. you have to first lower solar apoapsis, ejecting into a resonant orbit to meet kerbin again, lower apoapsis again, into another resonant orbit, and finally you can leave kerbin with kerbin as your solar apoapsis. because you had to change your speed by 2000 m/s, and kerbin can give at most 700 m/s, so you needed no less than 3 flybys. I can\u0027t give you hard numbers, unfortunately. especially not for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003Erss\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I was clear. In addition, I can link you to the mission report where i describe how i went from ike to moho with resonant gravity assists. It took very long, but it was surprisingly cheap, and very rewarding. and my mothership didn\u0027t have enough deltaV to do it any other way. It is described in detail, so you may get some additional information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9916007616\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/203233-lucy-in-the-sky-with-deadly-radiations-3-skys-just-got-a-lot-bigger-kerbalism-opm-grand-tour/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=4046683\u0026amp;embedComment=4046683\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:297px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
