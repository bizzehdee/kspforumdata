So I just installed about 2gb of mods for 0.24.2 clean installation, I launched the game in x64 version. The KSP folder is only about 3.2gb and KSP uses about 9-10gb of ram. What does the game exactly do to use ram more than 3 times the game folder size? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKSP, first game I\u0027ve played that uses over 5gb of ram\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T22:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStoring every model upon load, every planet, every moon, every texture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T22:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main RAM hog are Textures.
