Now, I\u0027ve seen this happen to people before and it\u0027s usually been a bug with some part, but I haven\u0027t started searching for which one. If anyone has any ideas let me know. Could it also just be bad rocket design causing my CoM to really get all wonky after SRBs drop? I\u0027m doubting it but want to make sure.
