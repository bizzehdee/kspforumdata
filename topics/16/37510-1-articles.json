However I think the part is to small for some rockets. I tried to re-scale the part by creating a new folder. I copied everything to the new folder and renamed. I changed the part.cfg file rescale facter to 2. It appears to work great in the vab, but when I click launch the part back to it original size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod making said he intends to create a larger size, but he can\u0027t do it immediately.

You can leave it in the same folder as the original as long as it has a different file name (but you must keep the .cfg extension.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit the .cfg. You must at least change the part name, (eg. Engine1 would become something like Engine_375m if I was making it a 3.75m part.) You can also edit the part description and title, but if you don\u0027t change the part name, KSP won\u0027t load both the new part and the original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange (or add) the rescaleFactor value. This is basically the amount of reduction or enlargement and is a decimal. So 200 percent is 2.0, 150 percent is 1.5, and 50 percent is 0.5, etc. For instance, if I was going going to make a 2.5m part a 3.75m part I would set it at 1.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough note that sometimes these numbers need to be tweaked if the original model scale is not 1 to 1. Sometimes a part that should be 2/3rds (0.66) ends up being .75 or .8. You can quickly reload parts by going out to the spaceport screen, going to the F12 menu, and reloading parts. I wouldn\u0027t do this a number of times and then going straight into playing as it will sometimes use up memory reloading textures, but it\u0027s a quick way to text part scales without having to reload every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astronut25","CreatedById":9000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T19:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t even have to copy the part.cfg , just put another part{...} underneath the other one within the same file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MainSailor","CreatedById":74050,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T11:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Astronut25\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Astronut25\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou don\u0027t even have to copy the part.cfg , just put another part{...} underneath the other one within the same file.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even know you could do this.
