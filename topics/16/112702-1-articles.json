Unfortunately for me, Mk3 SSTO\u0027s seem impossible to properly design for me, especially with how much harder it is to make SSTO\u0027s in general since 1.0. And I happen to like designing things that look somewhat realistic, rather than stuff that look ugly and/or rely on clipping excessive amounts of parts into each other. So I decided to try and build something of a Space Shuttle to ferry 2.5m parts to orbit!\n\nThe problem for me, however, is getting a ship like that into orbit. I\u0027ve designed the actual shuttle part where the crew and cargo go, but I can\u0027t seem to make anything that can carry it to orbit. You guys happen to have any tips for getting it to orbit?\n\nHere\u0027s a pic of it and the craft file, if that helps somehow.\n\n![B5DF3B327A3AB116C8D98B0636CA0B27FC9451EF](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/517133380412760618/B5DF3B327A3AB116C8D98B0636CA0B27FC9451EF/)\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xmlozrqo44ova71/Starlifter%20Mk3.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xmlozrqo44ova71/Starlifter%20Mk3.craft?dl=0)\n\nDo keep in mind, I may want to try an add more monopropellant to this design, because I\u0027m not sure it has enough for an orbital insertion burn, rendezvous with a station in a 150 km orbit, docking, and re-entry."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T22:46:00Z","Content":"Can we just sticky a thread on STS recreation? These questions get asked every few weeks.\n\nOMS dV will be dependent what sub-orbital trajectory your external tank gets you. At minimum you need 300 (ideal sub-orbital to 75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) \u002B 400 (conservative transfer budget) \u002B 30 (75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 to 75x45) for around 800 dV; about 500 dV with payload.\n\nA majority of your dV will come from the main engines and external tank. You want good atmospheric performance, better than unity TWR full, around 3 km/s dV, and significantly less engine torque than reaction wheels and gimbal can correct at all fuel levels and payload configurations.\n\nOnce you have that, add SRBs for launch TWR and rebalance everything to minimize engine torque again.\n\nBoth RCS build aid and KER will be indespensible in design.\n\nIn all, designing a STS replica is harder than a SSTO. If you want a staged space plane, I recommend emulating Dream Chaser or symmetrical shuttle concepts. Even Buran is easier to emulate!\n\nThe other fun thing is you can\u0027t even match the (broken) economics of the shuttle regardless. IRL engines and control systems are the expensive bits. Tanks are dirt cheap comparatively. In KSP tanks are almost if not more expensive than the engines! The space plane advantage in KSP is landing site selection (for 100% recovery) and cargo bays instead of farings. (Bonus points: Mk3 bays are bugged) Dropping tanks is still dropping a significant part of launch cost.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T23:11:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"}]}
