I\u0027m trying to plan a mission to Duna. Launch would be around day 26. Alex Moon\u0027s calculator states ejection angle 24 to prograde, delta V of 2002 m/s at phase angle of 124.11degrees. Yet when i set up a node with those parameters, I don\u0027t even get a close approach. Any advice is welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-22T20:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDay 26?

Optimal window is day 236, however 2000 and a change delta v is not that bad. I have done it before in version 1.2 at about the same date, so I\u0027m puzzled why it\u0027s not working this time around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-22T21:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://k-ohara.oco.net/KSP/dunamiss.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:241px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u0022483\u0022 alt=\u0022dunamiss.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are leaving much earlier than the transfer window, to an outer planet, so Kerbin has not yet caught up to Duna as much as it would be at the transfer window. \u00A0To catch up to Duna, the transfer path has to swing closer to the sun than the Hohmann-transfer shape you would\u00A0see at the window. The exit from Kerbin is not parallel to Kerbin\u0027s apth but dives toward the sun; the approach to Duna is parallel, though, since you picked the arrival time that minimized that burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes the closest-approach markers give nonsense (bottom image). \u00A0 You know there is a closer approach further along the orbits, so\u00A0If you add another maneuver node, with zero burn, further along in your orbit, you can force KSP to find the real approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
