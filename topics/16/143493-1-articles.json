Try lowering this. I\u0027m not sure which of the two is hit first, since I don\u0027t know your rocket, but 3.5 km is pretty high, so I\u0027m guessing that it\u0027s speed. Try setting it to 75 m/s or even 50 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will cause your rocket to start the turn sooner, which does two things: first, it has more time to turn over, since it starts lower down. Second, it will naturally tend to tilt over faster, since it is going slower at the time, which removes the need for strong steering input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-10T17:39:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2016 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T06:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222669667\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143493\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468160633\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159912\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022grondilu\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, grondilu said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was hoping getting MechJeb\u0027s ascent guidance module would help me automate the launch but I can\u0027t quite follow the ascent path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes that really matter to you though?\u00A0Can you stall make orbit OK?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T08:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with Foxster.
