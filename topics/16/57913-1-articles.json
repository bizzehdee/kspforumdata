Basically girders as hinge pins, attached to door, but not body, cubic struts forming a loop around them (attached to main body only, not door). Docking ports to hold the \u0022door\u0022 shut. Probe core to control the door-ship once you decouple it from the main ship. It\u0027s clever and interesting, but far from a clean way of doing anything, and stands a very good chance of failing from a physics glitch, or inviting a Kraken to come and munch on your ship. There\u0027s videos of it on youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely do not recommend using that hack, it should be regarded as an interesting curiosity, not a good ship design which can be relied on, in my opinion. You\u0027re far more likely to run into problems using that hack, than by just using a good mod pack which does it cleanly. It\u0027s also the sort of thing that\u0027s very likely to break across KSP versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T17:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a good example of a shuttle door hinge in the KerbalCon stream, though I forgot who was broadcasting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA door made of structural panels, and a few cubic octagonal struts to attach an Oscar-B fuel tank.
