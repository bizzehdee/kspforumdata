On my career mode profile, it is time to send 3 Kerbals to Minmus, with a rover! I have made the rover and fit it into a Service Bay that is 2.5m, but I do not know where to place it on my lander. I have included a screenshot, if someone could tell me where would be a good place to put the Service Bay with it so that it can be deployed properly, it would be very much appreciated. Thank you! \n\n[http://postimg.org/image/c8tgq9ocp/](http://postimg.org/image/c8tgq9ocp/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T21:05:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:52:16Z","Content":"I\u0027d loose the service bay. That\u0027s a large lander and s small rover. Stick it on the side with a radial decoupled. Or you may have to redesign a bit to drop the rover from the bottom onto the ground after landing.\n\nOr to make it really easy just turn the rover 90 degrees, pop the clutch and fly out of the service bay ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Low gravity so the fall should be fine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T20:55:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:53:47Z","Content":"Since it is Minimus that has low gravity you could just drive off the bay.

Then use fuel lines so the outter engines can still pull fuel from that center tank.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T21:07:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:59:01Z","Content":"I think I do have some fuel lines unlocked, and this sounds like a good idea!
