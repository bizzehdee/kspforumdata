My problem is the RCS and vernier engines don\u0027t fire on the payload stage when I use one of the buttons next to the NAV ball to hold position. If, for example, I change from retrograde to prograde by simply clicking on the symbol, the ship won\u0027t budge. I can manually steer the ship but even then it will drift from the set attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve added vernier engines to move things about on Minmus, but these don\u0027t fire when I change from one attitude to another. Again all is fine if I move things manually. Is it just that the probe core is just trying to use regular RCS clusters and ignoring the vernier\u0027s? The vernier\u0027s do fire when I turn the SAS off then on and the ship is rotating. They bring it to a stop, but won\u0027t change its heading.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T15:52:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Clipperride\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T14:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVerners use lfo fuel instead of monoprop.

I\u0027ve noticed weird behavior from my RCS system on one ship. It\u0027s very intermittent and random, so I can\u0027t describe it well enough to write a bug report. Seems to be related to power not always reaching the probe core and having a low-level pilot standing by. To get around it, I make sure the probe is powered and in control, then switch vessels to reset everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T16:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can get the vernier\u0027s to fire when I manually turn, so there\u0027s fuel and power.
