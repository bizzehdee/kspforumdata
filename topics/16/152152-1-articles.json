While deployed, even in the thinnest part of the atmosphere, will help slow your rocket down earlier, and thus reduce peak heating. In the deployed state, the airbrakes have a somewhat lower heat tolerance, however the flat surface sticking out creates a bow shock, reducing this effect slightly. When stowed, the airbrake has a higher heat tolerance, \u00A0but will not provide the extra drag to slow you down, and thus won\u0027t reduce peak heating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest keeping them open as long as you can, and then when you think they will overheat, use the authority limiter to clean them partially, so that they provide some drag while avoiding overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used this technique for returning rockets from lower orbits (75-120km), and I think actually my airbrakes would survive if I kept them completely open due to the aforementioned bow shock effect (I mainly just take these things into effect while using them to target the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not certain, but I think you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be able to keep them from overheating by using careful management of their deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re willing to sacrifice a little payload capacity, using a little fuel to slow down just prior to reentry would likely help your heating problems a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T18:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTBH it was a \u003Cstrong\u003Etest\u003C/strong\u003E entry, so it\u0027s an extreme steep re-entry; I placed it so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E state AP=400k, pe is at -380k.
