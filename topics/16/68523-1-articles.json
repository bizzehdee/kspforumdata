Fuel tanks in KSP are cylinders, and density is defined as mass over volume. The volume of a cylinder is its area (pi times the square of the radius) times its height; you\u0027d need height and radius data for a particular fuel tank to get its volume, but that data is floating around on the forums. Units of oxidizer and units of liquid fuel are both known to have a mass of about 5 kilograms, so you can use tweakables to predict at what point the tank would float or sink.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T12:41:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am familiar with how boats work, it just seems odd how it works in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(A grappling hook from KAS basically bounces off the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am guessing Kerbals water is much denser than normal water based on observation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T13:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s also something that can be tested, and in the same way; you just tweak the amount of fuel and oxidizer in a tank of a known size.
