Even if you could line up a flyby perfectly, you would never dock; your momentum is far greater than the magnetic strength of docking ports. Because flipping your inclination 180 degrees takes a ridiculous amount of fuel, no doubt more than you have, I suggest scrubbing your rescue mission and sending another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are not going to be able to rescue Bill without getting the orbits going the same direction.
