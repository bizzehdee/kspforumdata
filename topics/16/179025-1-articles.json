My problem if I can call it that is that I seem to get ridiculously high payment for even trivial contracts. I\u0027ve completed four of the easiest starter contracts and I\u0027m already up to 300k funds, that doesn\u0027t seem very balanced to me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T00:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, in\u00A0 Mission Control (when you are looking at/accepting contracts)\u00A0it tells you exactly how much money you will get for accepting the contract, and exactly how much you will get for completing each sub-objective of the contract, and exactly how much you will receive for final contract completion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there are several questions for you:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you look through that list of contracts, do the payouts seem unusually high?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo the actual payouts exactly match the numbers specified in the contract when you took it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also need to understand that the most expensive thing in the game is upgrading your facilities.
