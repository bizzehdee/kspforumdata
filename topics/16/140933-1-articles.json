In general, the answer is yes, but not quite the way you ask it. You are implying that the parts fell into the water separately from their craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the parts\u00A0are separate from the main craft, then they follow the rules of debris. Either you have to watch them fall all of the way down \u003Cstrong\u003Eand stop moving\u003C/strong\u003E, or they have to be within your physics radius -- or else they may get auto deleted as \u0022burned up in the atmosphere during reentry\u0022. Once they come to rest, they will remain there forever until you specifically recover them -- they will definitely not be recovered automatically with the main craft. When you recover them, you will get kerbucks for their recovery depending exclusively\u00A0on their total distance from KSC (being underwater makes no difference).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you land a craft in the water and some pieces fall off and sink, then the same thing happens. The sunken pieces are debris and must be recovered separately, once they finish moving. However, the autodeletion concept probably\u00A0still applies. If you recover the ship before the pieces finish sinking (moving), I suspect they will get autodeleted. If you care to find out for certain, you can test it. Engines sink -- so if you ditch a plane, decouple the engine\u00A0over deep\u00A0water, and recover the craft\u00A0while it is sinking ... you will know by whether there is debris remaining\u00A0afterward for you to recover separately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if non-floating parts can get autodeleted after they hit the water, then yes -- adding flotation to them might make all the difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T03:48:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T22:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222610887\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140933\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464751520\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor else they may get auto deleted\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned this the hard way several months ago;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built this super-sweet cargo plane with pods behind the tail so that I could fly over and stage a chute and decoupler to land a kerbal at a specific point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dropped off three kerbals that day, but the lands were greedy and swallowed them all whole - for, when I went back to pick up some science with them, they were no where to be found.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T23:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222612029\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140933\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464818963\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022114432\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mahnarch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n55 minutes ago, Mahnarch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned this the hard way several months ago;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had two tourists get autodeleted (maybe just one, but it killed the contract). \u00A0They were in separate capsules that all separated and pulled parachutes together, but the one on top was carrying a sputnik and fell faster. \u00A0Somehow the tourists were deleted in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect it was a bug, I just reverted and adjusted things so they all could land together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TBryson2","CreatedById":66586,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T11:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks all for the informative feedback!\u00A0\u00A0I was wondering why my booster rockets were not being recovered even with parachutes.
