I am curious as to how one would calculate the ideal escape from Kerbins atmosphere with a one stage rigid body. (One stage, since more stages just complicate the final equation.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know, there are three forces (At least three significant ones) acting on the body while in flight; the constant thrust (constant for each stage, as long as there is fuel left), the downward force due to gravity (which decreases linearly with the mass) and the drag force, which appears to be the most arbitrarily simulated phenomena in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am assuming the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity, just like in textbook examples of differential equations involving drag. Also, seeing as the drag is affected by the atmospheric density, which in game is simulated with an exponention function, the final equation seems to become something way beyond my current abilities - a second order non linear differential equation. Therefore, I call on the help of those with a sound knowledge of such matters, and the magicks of Laplace and Fourier!

Which force would you rather lose the most delta-v to: gravity, drag, or thrust (i.e. getting the hell into space)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, the force balance for a launch is indeed drag-downward, gravity-downward, thrust-upward. Newton\u0027s Second Law says that in order to accelerate, you better damn well not be 100% balanced...Tsiolkovsky says the same thing - it\u0027s the same equation, just cleverly disguised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as far as those forces go, gravity slowly decreases as you ascend (g = GM/R^2), drag is dependent on your velocity, along with your mass (which decreases with time based on your fuel flow rate and is the unrealistic part of KSP\u0027s drag model) and the density of the atmosphere (which decreases logarithmically as you ascend). Your thrust is constant assuming you don\u0027t fiddle with the throttle but the resultant acceleration it produces is going to increase with time on account of your decreasing mass. Basically, there\u0027s a cycle going on there - you accelerate faster, your rate of acceleration changes, you get faster, the drag increases, you accelerate slower. The way you minimize the drag acceleration is to ascend, get lighter (i.e. burn fuel), and keep your velocity reasonable by minimizing your rate of acceleration. The only way you can minimize the gravity acceleration is to get higher up as quickly as you can, i.e. by maximizing your rate of acceleration. Obviously you can\u0027t do both, so you have to find a happy medium - which happens to be to accelerate at a rate such that your craft remains as close to terminal velocity as manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve made things clearer or muddied them up; if the latter, please accept my apologies.
