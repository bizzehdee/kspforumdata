The problem is that when I put decouplers on the set of engines, it adds those dang fairings. When I press the button to ignite the nukes, the fairings break off and and slam into the engine opposite them, everything goes boom, and I\u0027m left with a giant pile of fuel tanks and no engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know how to avoid this? Is there a way to disable these fairings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!
