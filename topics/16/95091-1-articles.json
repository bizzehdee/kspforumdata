A new contract popped up for a new outpost on Minmus that will accommodate 9 Kerbal. My existing design will dock with itself so I could simply launch another of the original surface outpost land it near the first one and drive it over and dock them together forming an outpost that will accommodate 10 Kerbals meeting the requirements of the new contract. Will that work? Since half the outpost was originally built for another contract. Anyone try adding on to existing outpost to meet new contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-31T18:17:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2014 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TerminalV\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T04:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApparently this \u003Cstrong\u003Esometimes\u003C/strong\u003E works with orbital stations, but I think it depends on which part of the station is made the root.
