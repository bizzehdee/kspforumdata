Each tank drains into the next. All engines burn exepct for the center return craft. These ten nuclear engines drain the outter, smaller radial tank. That decouples then the inner, smaller tanks which then drain into the large workhorse tanks. ( The small tanks are more or less nuclear boosters ). Then the four large tanks ( still asparagusly staged ) fall off two at a time. At this point im well into Laythe\u0027s orbit. Problem? ..none of this works. At all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres the staging/fuel line setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f389/Motokid600/FuleLines_zps9f556506.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FuleLines_zps9f556506.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeres the problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/576744651321480177/4C7FCB330D7A0E1A7643766372034A3DD65DBCDE/\u0022 alt=\u00224C7FCB330D7A0E1A7643766372034A3DD65DBCDE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe highlighted adapter tanks you see here are draining...WHY?! its just these two and nothing else. For some reason its almost as if the nova punch reaction wheels in between are acting as if they are NOT crossfeed capable. They are... the other two work perfectly. All engines fire and the fuel from those non-highlighted tanks does not drain. It does exactly what asparagus staging does best. But for some reason the other two engines will drain those highlighted tanks and flame out..they wont even start taking the fuel from tank above the reaction wheel. They just cut off after those are done. So because of this it sends the whole setup out of wack. The radial engines that are supposed to dump into this engine do not and flame out not long after the highlighted ones do. The other set...again is fine. W..T...F is going on here? Ive tried jumping the two tanks with a fuel line.. no change. Something is wrong. I just don\u0027t know what. Idk if somehow the other tanks from the return craft are messing it up somehow? That craft is designed asparagusly aswell, but no fuel lines connect the tug and the return craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve been working on this craft for weeks.
