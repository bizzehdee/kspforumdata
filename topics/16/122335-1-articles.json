Both Duna and Kerbin have atmosphere for you to brake and capture. You don\u0027t need to waste your fuel to do that. And don\u0027t be afraid of heats - entry speed to Duna is even slower than Kerbin low-orbital speed, so that is harmless. Entry speed to Kerbin from Duna is comparable to a Minmus return and should not be faster than 3.5km/s, which shouldn\u0027t be too much a problem with a right attitude (but you should test). My experience tells me I need to seriously consider heating in craft design only when entry speed is above 4km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T06:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to have LV-Ns feeding from LFO tanks.... have you removed the oxidizer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(haven\u0027t loaded the craft file, I don\u0027t have the mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway...
