There isn\u0027t enough atmosphere for full drag on a parachute, there is also not enough atmosphere to create full lift. If you fly a plane there, it needs to have a larger wingspan than you would expect to use on Kerbin if you want to actually fly. It can also be hard to find a landing spot, again because it\u0027s hard to slow down in the low atmosphere and gravity. The good news is, the gravity is lower so getting back off the ground is pretty easy as your plane may have a TWR greater than 1 and can basically just be a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-21T19:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2014 07:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Treldon","CreatedById":128860,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T18:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually chutes do work, though you do have to add more than normally.
