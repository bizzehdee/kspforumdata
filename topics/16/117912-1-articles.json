I\u0027d sent Bill and Jebediah out to stake some flags down to mark landing spots that i thought I should have been able to pick out from orbit and set them as targets for mechjeb.\n\nHowever, when i clicked on the stack of vehicles in the landingzone the flags didn\u0027t com up as targetable. I ended up using SCANSat\u0027s zoom window to set my target instead. SO is there a way to target flags? \n\nI don\u0027t recall if i had them turned on in the orbital map or not. Is that the key they have to be turned on in the orbital map to be able to select them?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T00:32:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gary.townsend**"},{"CreatedByName":"DivideByZero","CreatedById":148532,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T23:16:57Z","Content":"Yes, you can target them by turning on flags in the map view and hiding the rovers/capsules/miscellaneous stuff that\u0027s bound to get in the way."}]}
