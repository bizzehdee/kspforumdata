Liftoff is similar (a bit cheaper since I\u0027ll have better TWR), so we\u0027re talking about saving tens of meters per second. Altitude matters!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParking orbit matters less, but it\u0027s still a few m/s on either end. A 10km parking orbit costs 287 m/s to get into from a Hohmann transfer from Kerbin plus later to drop periapsis to 3km (or the flip side: 287m/s to go home). If we can do a 6km parking orbit, it\u0027s 283.5 m/s -- that\u0027s 7m/s saved off the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T14:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMunar parking orbits under 30km are annoying since you can\u0027t timewarp much.

I\u0027m downloading that elevation map now, so I can get the precise data.
