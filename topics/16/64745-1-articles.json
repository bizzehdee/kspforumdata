One with a science lab and lander, the other a refuel station and deployable rover. My problem is that testing the rover on Kerbin, I cannot get it to move using W or S keys. I launch just the rover at the launchpad, drive it down the ramp, then launch a capsule only and walk my Kerbalnaut down to the rover. When I get my Kerbal into the chair, the W and S keys don\u0027t work. I tried to \u0022control from here\u0022 with my remote guidance unit and still nothing. I\u0027m hoping this is a known issue and I am just wondering if anybody could point me in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T00:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the navball showing all-blue when that happens? If so, your rover thinks it is sitting on its back.

I remember problems with placing the wheels onto the I-beams I have for the chassis. Maybe we could turn this thread into a general rover help thread or something? I started off trying to place the I-beams, then the wheels, then figured out its easier to do one I-beam, place the wheel, go to 2x symmetry, place it, then alt-click and place the other two wheels...so much easier. Any other tips you guys have for rovers? Mine is more for landing, hitting F5 and driving around trying to go off jumps and crashing, F9 and repeat. What do you guys do to make your rovers more valuable to a mission rather than just a fun toy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T23:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPacked mine full of science stuff, landed it and a base near 3 biomes together with a few more farther out.
