This one causes parts with too low structural integrity to collapse inward and allow the parts connected underneath to push through the rocket--then when the parts reach the top of your rocket or some other crucial point, the Wormhole Kraken takes a bite out of your ship and makes it explode into tiny pieces. Struts tend to fix it but it can generally also be fixed by decreasing the throttle towards the end of a burn to make sure the thrust doesn\u0027t go too high. Some decouplers fail at around maybe 10-15 Gs, and if you\u0027re using docking ports, they can fail at even less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T23:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe classic kraken attacks ships moving at very high rates of speed, on the order of kms/sec, often while warping, so I think you had a more straightforward structural failure.
