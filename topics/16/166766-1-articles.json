Because of it being long-term, I plan to have a space station orbiting Laythe with two landers on standby, which must be almost completely reusable and be able to ferry at minimum six Kerbals from the station to the base(s), with maximum efficiency. With those restrictions in mind, and considering that I plan to keep the space station at an altitude of \u003Cstrong\u003E150-175km\u003C/strong\u003E(to make the rendezvous easier for me), I managed to design a hefty lander packing 3.8 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, space for seven Kerbals, and a jumbo docking port on the bottom, which also counts on being refueled when landing on Laythe by virtue of the base(s) being equipped with fuel refineries and rovers able to ferry the fuel:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022740\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/132503638793912320/371373084541976586/unknown.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/132503638793912320/371373131564187648/unknown.png\u0022 width=\u0022930\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the reason for the unusual placement of the docking port(below instead of on top) is in favour of a RealChute parachute, designed to work flawlessy(mostly) on Laythe - which is why the lander is not completely coated in \u0027chutes. Unfortunately, RealChute has a hardcoded limit of 10 uses per parachute part, after which it will no longer work; as it will have to be replaced by a new parachute part through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, this is why the lander is only 95% reusable - and not using parachutes at all is a terrible idea as the lander completely loses control when entering Laythe\u0027s atmosphere - being the very first craft I\u0027ve seen that prefers to fly face-first when I intend it to fly butt-first, while it\u0027s normally the other way around. (Re-entry heating is disabled in my save file because I have barely mastered proper drag-friendly crafts, let alone drag-friendly heat-freindly crafts)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, using HyperEdit, I did multiple simulation flights with Laythe and, despite those shortcomings, de-orbiting and landing in Laythe is something the lander can do(with some trouble regarding loss of control; it can end up flying sideways and therefore gliding far away from its intended destination). The true problem is taking off again and reaching orbit: It just doesn\u0027t have enough fuel. Sure, it can attain an apoapsis that\u0027s above the atmosphere(thanks to a planet pack, the atmo height is raised to 66km instead of 50km; pressure and grav are unchanged), but it will be left with just 900-800m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left, when over 1100m/s are needed to complete the circularization. And this is without accounting the fact that the lander would still need to rendezvous with the soon-to-be space station at 150-175km of altitude...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEither the lander is fuel-inefficient, or I am doing a wrong ascent profile. And I did check a guide for ascent profiles, but when I tried that, it just resulted in the lander deciding to fly into the ground. (Considering that guide was aimed toward large Kerbin crafts, it\u0027s possible its advice just doesn\u0027t apply for this situation) Thus, I\u0027m wondering if anyone is able to help me with either/both problems. I\u0027m looking to try and optimize its fuel consumption as much as I can(the aerospikes are the most efficient engines available: the Terrier is too weak, and everything else is either too powerful/inefficient, or has a mismatching size) to be useful in case of an emergency, and find out a more efficient way to get the lander up into Laythe orbit. As well as possibly find out what\u0027s causing the lander to completely lose control when braking into Laythe, as that will definitely end up causing problems later on regarding landing precision and the time spent ferrying Kerbals and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the Center of Mass is above the Center of Lift, which is above the Center of Thrust.

It doesn\u0027t care whether it is entering Laythe or leaving it, the heavy end (command pod) goes first, and the draggy end (with the winglets) brings up the rear. For entry on atmospheric worlds, I combat this problem with drogue chutes. They can open at higher speeds than standard chutes, so it won\u0027t matter that you\u0027re coming in nose-first. As for the heat, you should be able to turn it back on. As long as you don\u0027t try to enter in a steep dive to the surface, you shouldn\u0027t have a problem with over-heating. I don\u0027t use shields on Laythe and I\u0027ve never run into a problem. I wouldn\u0027t say the docking port is in a strange spot, because that\u0027s exactly where I always put my docking ports (and sometimes a standard size on the nose, as well). I feel it allows for much more versatility. In fact, aside from the modded stuff, it looks exactly like one of my own ships. As for a launch from Laythe, I usually takeoff Eve-style. That is, launch almost straight up to get out of the atmosphere as quickly as possible; then coast into the vacuum, turn and burn for orbit. Comparatively, Laythe\u0027s atmosphere seems to be thicker higher up than Kerbin\u0027s is. I feel like I lose more to drag than I gain with a gravity turn, so I just head straight up. I usually 2-stage it, though. I don\u0027t think I ever tried a single stage before.

Sadly, I had to dump the Mk1-2 (which pained me), but I kept the Sr Port. I like them for their stability when docked, and their ease of use when docking. This does not need to refuel on the surface. With aerobraking and parachutes, it doesn\u0027t need much fuel to deorbit and land. I actually landed in the water and, once the ship stabilized, I was still able to make it back to orbit (and in a retrograde orbit, at that: not purposeful, of course; when it left the water, it was already turned toward the West, so I just let it do what it wanted instead of fighting it). It has a mix of retractable and stationary\u00A0ladders for Kerbals (on each side for symmetry). A bit of a crazy design, but I kinda like it. I\u0027m using something similar for a challenge; which is what made me think of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://s1.postimg.org/4mzjxyasr3/screenshot2.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports for docking and, inside the service module, a battery, a monopropellant canister, and 2 solar panels.

I only use them on Tylo, Laythe, and Eve so I don\u0027t have to deal with them unless I absolutely have to. I always run into the same problem you described. Specifically, getting the ladders right when the fuselage changes diameter. I\u0027ll test it on Kerbin, and it works fine, but when I land, my Kerbal either can\u0027t get down or can\u0027t back up. I end up having to go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to move the ladders a bit.
