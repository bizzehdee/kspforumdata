Personally planes annoy me so I went for the BIG numbers and started collections from Mun and Minimus and started getting probes out to all of the other planets with a pretty small amount of science (just the ones I mentioned earlier actually - well, I went one step further in the electric tree to get some 1x6 panels). When you get that return from Minimus and it says 360 science gained (plus all that you transmitted), you won\u0027t be thinking about the 10 science here, 10 there stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and just get \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12384-PART-0-21-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-0-9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMechJeb \u003C/a\u003Eif you don\u0027t like the interplanetary transfer planning.
