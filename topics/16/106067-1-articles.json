I would like to be able to \\*From the Launchpad\\* launch at a particular time and point myself in a particular direction so that when I reach my initial 100km orbit (or thereabouts) be very close to the angle I need.\n\nThanks very much for reading and I look forward to your responses.\n\nZ\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T03:48:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zhollett**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:19:22Z","Content":"That is a hold over from FinePrint, which relied on other mods to show that information. When it was integrated into stock they made it a little more tolerant, so all you really have to do is put your satellite in a position that the little orbit lines look like that match up. It will clear quite quickly without needing to worry about really any numbers at all, you really don\u0027t even need to look at Ap, Pe, or Inclination, you can do it entirely by sight. Just make sure you are orbiting in the right direction, the little moving indicators tell you which way you should be traveling. One of the most common mistakes is to launch into an equatorial orbit only to find out it should be a retrograde equatorial orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"zhollett","CreatedById":62547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T19:29:03Z","Content":"Ok, thats good information, and I get it, but it still doesn\u0027t really answer my initial question (unless your answer is \u0022just eyeball it\u0022).\n\nWhat I am doing now to launch in the proper direction is place my craft on the launch pad, and then go into map mode and ffwd time until my craft is roughly lined up with the orbit of the contract, then launch and try to keep my degrees roughly matched up. That works, but I was wondering if there was some more scientific way of grabbing the longitude numbers instead of said method above ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks for your answer by the way, its greatly appreciated.\n\n\\*\\*\\* EDIT \\*\\*\\*\n\nJust did one by the \u0022eyeball\u0022 method, and it works\n\nI wish there was a stock readout to tell me where I was on the orbital numbers though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T19:40:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zhollett**"},{"CreatedByName":"MacroNova","CreatedById":126611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:01:16Z","Content":"Kerbal Engineer Redux will give you this information.
