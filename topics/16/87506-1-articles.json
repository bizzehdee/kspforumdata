I was most of the way through developing it when the 0.25 update hit. Now I\u0027ve finally gotten around to updating all my mods and I tried to launch it, and the runway doesn\u0027t survive. One thing I can do is drive the plane off the edge of the runway, then launch it on the grass, which doesn\u0027t make any sense and most the time doesn\u0027t work because this thing isn\u0027t so good at navigating the runway debris.

Collision mapping is affirmatively disabled on combined craft. Any door, engine fairing, any part can clip other parts on the same vessel with utter impunity, and this has been the case at least since 0.19 AFAIK. Part clipping becomes a HUGE problem, however, when craft separate. Parts from different \u0022vessels\u0022 (as the term is used inside the actual savefile) clipping through each other will cause violent explosions. There are four ways this can happen. First, of course, is a generic collision course between objects / craft, either piloted or dead-stick / debris-type collisions. No explanation needed for this type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, is during staging events. If a stage sep would split parts that began clipped, then at the time of stage event activation, the clip-collision would render detected, and there would result in either an explosion, or if the clip threshold were \u0022minor,\u0022 the craft would be forcibly and violently repelled from each other, often at a momentary 5\u002B G-load acceleration. This \u0022minor\u0022 clipping event is why EVA kerbonauts will sometimes bounce wildly off of the capsule ladders -- it\u0027s reacting to a minor-threshold clipping event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, is after manually releasing a docking node. This would result in the same behavior as the second type, above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd fourth is during RSD (Rapid Spontaneous Disassembly). If your craft is disintegrating for any reason (more likely in FAR-atmospheric flight profiles, due to aerodynamic failure) and previously-clipped parts are then separated, then this would result in similar behavior and collision results as items two and three above.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T01:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MisterFister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
