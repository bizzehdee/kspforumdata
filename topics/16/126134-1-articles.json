Your CoL is to far forward. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe issue you are running into on the ground with take off is your landing gear are to far back.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanding gear should be placed just behind your CoM, near your CoL, this is the \u0022point of rotation\u0022 for the aircraft. \u003Cbr\u003E\nLike in this pic.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/XETBVqT.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNotice how the aircrafts main landing gear are just behind the CoM, so it lets the aircraft rotate around them, like a pivot point. So you are not pushing them into the runway on take off. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven on my older VTOL designs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]TxoCK[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe landing gear is just behind the CoM, that one was a tricky one though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of my must have mods now is RCS build aide... I cant suggest it enough if you are building with FAR. It is one of the mods I feel should be stock.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bzimac","CreatedById":144219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T12:35:39Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m just guessing, but it might have something to do with a cargo bay. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could try to open and close it in flight and see if it helps.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_42","CreatedById":151760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T21:14:04Z","Content":"\nI am going to reinstall the game.
