I\u0027ve launched many, many rockets with the TR-18A Stack Decoupler being used, I\u0027ve tried it while breaching atmosphere, I\u0027ve tried it while reaching orbit, I\u0027ve tried it while staying within the atmosphere. No matter how many times I use the stack decoupler, the mission never completes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow are you supposed to know what the \u0022test\u0022 conditions are? They aren\u0027t written in the mission description, they aren\u0027t listed under \u0022Objectives\u0022, and they don\u0027t appear in that little panel on the upper right of the screen that shows the mission progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the heat shield mission, I sort of just had to guess at what the conditions where based on logic (e.g. I had to guess that the heat shield needed to be right-clicked on *after* having landed, this was after a series of failed flights where I tried clicking on it during re-entry and found that it was unresponsive). What am I supposed to do for this one? logically, you would think the mission is passed when you use the decoupler, because it says \u0022activate the part through the staging sequence when all test conditions are met.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere must be some invisible test conditions.

In the case of the decoupler simply stick one under a mk1 pod and whilst still in the VAB right click on the decoupler and change force percentage to zero to stop the pod being flung around. This is also useful on contracts that require testing engines/boosters at the pad. You can change the amount of fuel in a tank/booster to zero and still stage the engine without going off into the blue yonder. Note that you can also change the max thrust, very useful if you want to ascend in a more dignified manner than the default bat out of hell...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steuben","CreatedById":77368,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T13:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit should say somewhere in the text of the

in the Mission Control building but you have access to a condensed version at all other points in the game on the toolbar.\u00A0 The contract button looks like a sheet of paper with text on it.\u00A0 Click that and it will show you a list of all your contracts with their objectives and conditions spelled out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to read\u00A0conditions CAREFULLY because sometimes one of the conditions will be utterly ridiculous, either making the contract impossible to begin with requiring so much effort that you\u0027ll spend more making the ship than you\u0027ll earn doing the contract.\u00A0 Or maybe one of the terms is just beyond your current technology and you\u0027ll have to do it later, but that\u0027s rare.\u00A0 And with part test contracts, sometimes the part has to be staged as normal and sometimes you can right-click and do \u0022run test:\u0022.\u00A0 Be very sure you know which one you have to do before you launch the mission \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, part test contracts all require the test be done at a specific location at a specific planet.\u00A0 This can be the launchpad (easiest), the ground (launchpad counts for this), splashed down, in atmospheric flight at some combination of speed and altitude, or in space on sub-orbital, orbital (within a certain alittude range), or escape trajectories.\u00A0 But be sure you\u00A0read which planet because many of these locations can be specified for Mun, Minmus, and other planets, not just Kerbin \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing about part test contracts is, as mentioned, whether the part has to be activated by staging or by \u0022run test\u0022.\u00A0 If staging is required (and it almost always is for engines and decouplers), it means just that, you push the space bar to activate the part.\u00A0 Right-clicking to activate the part will probably NOT work (it used to, but they changed this).\u00A0 This means that when building the vehicle to perform the test, you have to arrange its staging list so you can stage the test part in its specified location without screwing up the rest of your vehicle.\u00A0 OTOH, if you have to \u0022run test\u0022 (usual for wheels and other things that don\u0027t normally appear on the staging list), this takes some time and of course access to the part with your mouse, so you have to take that into account when designing the ship and mission profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut OTOH, you don\u0027t actually have to USE the part you\u0027re testing, just activate it somehow. and you don\u0027t even need to bring it home.\u00A0 IOW, engines don\u0027t require fuel, decouplers can be fired sideways\u00A0without separating your rocket\u0027s \u0022real\u0022 stages, etc.\u00A0 Sometimes the test part is actually useful to your ship so you will use it, but often the part is useless/awkward to the ship, just payload to get to a certain location.\u00A0 This all means that it\u0027s often possible to add some test parts to a ship that will be going to or passing through the specified test locations while en route somewhere else for another purpose.\u00A0 Such as a Mun lander.\u00A0 Getting significant amounts of science has to be done mostly on your own dime because contracts don\u0027t provide very much at all these days.\u00A0 So you have to build a big, expensive Mun lander at some point, which will, just in the course of its normal mission, pass through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, suborbital, orbital, and escape regimes, plus the same on Mun and the Munar surface.\u00A0 You can thus often stick a few small test parts on it to help it pay for itself fincanically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T19:32:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a vague memory of a recent support
