I believe the workaround is to not only be running in windowed mode, but that you actually have to click away from the KSP window (or maybe even put focus on a different program), and then click back onto the ksp window. I have also seen people suggest simply spam-clicking the hatch as a solution. Maybe you have to do both; I\u0027m not really sure. Poke around the forum a little bit.
