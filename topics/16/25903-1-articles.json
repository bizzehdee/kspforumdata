Case in point: the Lunar Excursion Module from the Apollo program. There\u0027s not an ounce of extra weight on that thing. It had a pressure hull the thickness of a soft drink can, and an engine with hypergolic fuel so corrosive it could not be test fired before it was actually used in the mission. It\u0027s one of the most amazing machines ever designed by humans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-08T03:14:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2013 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pebble_garden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steamypete","CreatedById":60577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T08:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually trying the same thing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I use for extra coolness:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KW rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- B9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSPX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of my latest creations.
