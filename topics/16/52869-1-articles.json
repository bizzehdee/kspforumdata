Put these decouplers in stages 0-11, one in each stage. Then organise your normal staging under that in stages 12 and up, then save your subassembly. You can now attach this heavy lifter to whatever you want, and the stages for the payload will go in slots 0-11 along with the decouplers, leaving your payload and lifter stages nicely organised. Now you just pick up the decoupler which attaches the decoupler stack to your rocket, and throw away the 11 decou leaving them out of the staging system, but keeping the stages organised as you want them.
