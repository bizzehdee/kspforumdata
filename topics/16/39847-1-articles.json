It\u0027s only visual. The CoL is actually aligned, its just a display bug in KSP. So the Center of Lift isn\u0027t the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a problem \u003Cstrong\u003Eon the runway takeoff roll\u003C/strong\u003E, it\u0027s probably your landing gear setup doing something wonky. Make sure your main gear is right behind the center of mass, with your nose gear far forward.
