I don\u0027t know of any stock way to do this, but the mod Procedural Fairings can help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve done is use two fairing bases; one flipped upside down, then with some some structural component (the Modular Girder Segment, for example, or if you need extra fuel / monopropellant, one or more FL-RC10 or Oscar-B tanks as a core), then a second fairing base (right side up). You can then attach items like batteries to this core structure, and cover it all up with the fairings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that if you put sensors inside, you will not be able to access them by right-clicking, so be sure to assign them to action groups. You\u0027ll probably need to experiment a bit for function and aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother mod (one I haven\u0027t tried yet as it looks VERY new) is the 6S SerCom part - a hollow \u0022tube\u0022 which can be used as a structural component, and inside which various items can be stuffed. It seems a little simpler than using Procedural Fairings to build a service module, but again, it looks very new, so I don\u0027t yet know how well it works in KSP, or if it\u0027s been incorporated into the career tech tree as other mods have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T05:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61040-6S-Service-Compartment-Tubes-Design-smooth%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis mod\u003C/a\u003E out.
