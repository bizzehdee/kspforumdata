Anyway I know what system I am running but my program folder is labelled \u0022Program files x86\u0022 and inside my KSP folder it says KSP\\_x64 Data! Pardon my tech ignorance but this has left me slightly confused, and I just wanted to double check before I download anything that might mess up my game. Its the only game I play and I love it! I never thought I could have fun playing a game that required me to use a calculator haha (for the sake of efficiency). One of the things I love about KSP is that its helping me to learn just a little bit more about computers and how system files are stored and subsequently processed, anyway I tried to look this up and educate myself via Google but I was fruitless in my efforts. Now I seek the help of the Kerbalnaut community and will also name a Kerbal after the first person answer my question! \n\n\\*Disclaimer\\* by answering this question and leaving your name, the kerbal named in your honor can not be guaranteed safety or ensured they will live to see a second mission.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T05:57:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 05:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reimroc**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T04:09:58Z","Content":"You haven\u0027t mentioned whether you installed KSP through Steam or bought it through the Squad website. I\u0027m only familiar with the Steam version, but understand there\u0027s not much difference between the two at all.\n\nThe game ships with both 32 bit and 64 bit executables, which is why you see \u0022KSP\u0022 and \u0022KSP\\_x64\u0022 data folders. But generally, unless you\u0027ve explicitly done something to run the 64 bit game, you\u0027ll be running with 32 bit.
