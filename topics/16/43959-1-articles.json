I have been playing the game for a little over a month now, and I absolutely LOVE IT!! I have been doing my best to try to not use MechJeb as much as possible.

I know that the elevation is 2868.75, from watching videos on YouTube. (Scott Manley, etc.) But I cannot find a tutorial or even figure out for myself through many many attempts how to consistently put a satellite directly above KSC in a geostationary orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone out there could please help me out or at least point me in the right direction, I would be very grateful.

Essentially, if you set up the maneuver to go to 2868.75km just a tad to the west of KSC right after you circularize a 100km orbit, your geostationary orbit will be over KSC. My problem was....(and I feel like an idiot to admit this,)....I had not discovered how to \u0022quicksave\u0022 and \u0022quickrestore\u0022 in the game until last night, so it allowed me to do lots of trials and errors when previously, I was hitting ESC and reverting back to launch!!
