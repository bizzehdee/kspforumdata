Entering a system: Before you encounter a new system do some correction burns to lower your projected periapsis to the target to within 500km (50km for Minimus/Mun). Burn a small amount in each of the 6 major axes (pro grade, retrograde, left, right, up, down... as based on pro/retro trajectory) to see if it increases or decreases the projected periapsis. If it decreases keep burning until it stops decreasing or until the target altitude. Now when you enter the system you can do the blue and purple axes to adjust your orbit around the target without spending too much delta V to do so. Adjust until you have the desired axis of orbit then burn at the periapsis for system capture (or do an aerobrake if the target has an atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In-orbit: If you\u0027re already in orbit of the target you can plan the burn. For whichever direction you drag the purple adjustment make sure you drag the retrograde green marker as well to maintain your orbit\u0027s shape. Drag purple and green until your orbit is the correct direction.
