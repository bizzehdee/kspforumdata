I\u0027m confused though by the numbers I\u0027m seeing: launch costs are up 6%, so when I launch, my rocket (or more likely my plane) costs 6% more than normal. Fine. Recovery is up, so when I recover, I report 100% recovery when landing on the KSC grounds, as opposed to 96-98% in my normal landings. But it seems to be reporting that e.g. my radial air scoops recover at 1,000 Roots -- even though, with the 6% extra cost, they cost me 1,060 Roots to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo whereas each scoop before was costing me 20-40, now they cost me 60. It\u0027s break-even when I land my scoops at a distance with 94% recovery. But there\u0027s parts that I don\u0027t recover (the fuel, for example), despite having paid for transponders (flammable transponders?) which means I only gain from the strategy if I land fairly far from KSC, where I\u0027d normally get 90% recovery or so -- and that\u0027s with an almost fully-reusable spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the strategy at lower settings, the transponder cost goes up, and the benefit goes down, so that at low levels you lose no matter what. And if you\u0027re dropping a first stage, I have trouble making things end up in our favour ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I misreading what\u0027s going on, or is this a seemed-like-a-good-idea strategy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: consensus seems to be NO, \u003Cstrong\u003Erecovery transponder almost never pays\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-19T15:24:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2014 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by numerobis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T03:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a \u0022Seemed like a good idea\u0022 strategy, if you use mods like Debrefund it should take that recovery into account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T05:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this one of those strategies that only really works when you max it out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T06:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought that strategy is actually for those that either can\u0027t or not bothered to land close to KSC?

It means I can miss KSC by quite a large margin and still get OK fund recovery. Since I use the Trajectories mod, this isn\u0027t much of a benefit for equatorial orbits, because I can pretty much pinpoint the landing site, but it\u0027s nice for saving time with inclined orbits which don\u0027t pass directly over KSC every revolution. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. TNSTAAFL. Because of the 6% difference between launch cost and recovery value there are no longer any free parts (launch clamps, for example, cost nothing unless you use this strategy), and testing parts or vehicles on the pad also has some cost, which provides an incentive to optimise testing programs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real advantage of this strat is for people who can\u0027t, or won\u0027t land at KSC. If you land somewhere you\u0027d normally get 15% value for recovered parts, this strat will literally double the amount returned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T08:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I also agree that this strategy doesn\u0027t really make sense. You will literally never benefit from it. Ever. Well, maybe not quite \u0022ever,\u0022 but you\u0027d be hard pressed to get an advantage. Even if you land at the far side of the planet, recovery value is 50%. Practically speaking, you really only benefit from recovering craft that are extremely fuel efficient, and they need to be about 1/5 of the way around the planet or further. Anything recovered closer to the launch pad suffers more loss of funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you launch, realize you need to change something and recover, you lost the 6% investment (you can never recover for more than 100%, even if it costs 106% to launch). While as AlexinTokyo points out, that would be akin to losing funds on a scrubbed launch, that doesn\u0027t make sense to me from a voluntary strategy standpoint. I would think that if it\u0027s a fund penalty you want, there are probably better ways to get it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T12:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, I didn\u0027t realize that you don\u0027t get the added cost back when you use this strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought recovery would be equal to: (Base part \u0026amp; resource cost)*(launch cost modifier) * (Max: [1, recovery%/100%])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovery amount needs to be multiplied by the launch cost modifier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven then...
