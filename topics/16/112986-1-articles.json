In addition, all the informations given in the wiki are outdated and there\u0027s no warning about it.\n\nDoes anyone care about the lack of informations about this ?\n\nIt appears that there\u0027s a consesus to say that reaching Kerbin\u0027s orbit takes about 3500 m/s, but what about the other bodies ? Does anyone have made some research about this ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T01:14:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tatonf**"},{"CreatedByName":"lpfr52","CreatedById":140490,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T00:43:13Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96985-1-0-2-WAC-s-Delta-V-Map-(24-05-2015)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96985-1-0-2-WAC-s-Delta-V-Map-%2824-05-2015%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T01:14:27Z","Content":"Wow thanks, sorry I didn\u0027t see there was a sub-forum."}]}
