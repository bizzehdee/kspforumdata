Since I am not using the default flag, this is slightly immersion-disrupting and quite annoying/disappointing. I understand this is likely a bug or simple oversight, but what I\u0027m wondering is if there\u0027s a way to fix it in the interim. Does anyone know how to get my \u0022real\u0022 flag flying high?\n\n(Side note: I believe this is also the case for the Level 1 Astronaut Complex...)"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T22:43:05Z","Content":"I think you have to climb it with a Kerbal and right click the top"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T20:01:18Z","Content":"Mine has been intermittent.

I didn\u0027t realize you could change your program flag mid-career (not that I\u0027m going to, but hey, fancy). I do seem to have gotten my Flagpole displaying the correct flag, but the Launchpad is still a no-go. And it\u0027ll be a long, long ways before I have that thing fully upgraded. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"}]}
