How do you un-group them so they can be part of separate stages? I\u0027m asking because I like to stage a pair at a time with fuel flowing from the first stage, through the next, then to the central engine for efficiency, which is apparently called asparagus staging. Anyway, do you just have to place it all manually, because I suck at that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MulleDK19","CreatedById":34027,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T19:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClick the group icon, it\u0027ll expand.

That way they\u0027ll be automatically grouped. For instance, if you want two stages containing four decouplers each around a central body. Instead of setting symmetry to eight and adding all of them at once, set it to four, add one group, then the other.. This will give you two groups of four instead of having to manually break up the group of eight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also break up groups. If you click the group in the staging list, it will expand it. Then you shift click (or is it ctrl?) to select/deselect individual parts in the group so you can move them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T19:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking six radially mounted stacks dropping in pairs and if you place them manually, they will be slightly higher or lower than each other.
