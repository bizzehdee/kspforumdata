So i built, 2 command pods on the return vehicle (gonna leave the big ol science pod behind) and have both kerbals return with all the data in the command pods. Yes i am aware this is not effective of getting science points but whatever :-p anyways.. when you remove said kerbals from the command pods and stick them in the science pod... you no longer can get them back!! apparently and tested this on the launch pad.. if you have no one in the command pods, or a probe attached, you will no longer be able to even communicate with the space craft, there for it has eaten your kerbals until the rescue team arrives with extra room. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethus ends my rant, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe real question is.. was the game designed this way, or is this a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-22T23:10:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2014 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by stormoffires\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T04:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy \u0022science module,\u0022 do you mean the Mobile Processing Lab?
