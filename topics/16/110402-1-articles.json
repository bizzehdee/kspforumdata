(Never ever used them before. Ever.) However, they kinda missed a spot with the editor-- the unshrouded, can\u0027t-retract ones still have \u0022Toggle\u0022 and \u0022Retract\u0022 as options when working with action groups, which leads to the sort of confusion you experienced.\n\nOf course, if they did that, it would have just pushed your confusion a bit closer to the source (\u0022Hey! Why isn\u0027t there anything but \u0027extend\u0027 available for action groups?\u0022) ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ...but that\u0027s better than thinking everything\u0027s hunky-dory, launching to space, and then getting an unpleasant surprise."},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T03:05:57Z","Content":"I still disagree with the decision to make the shrouded panels retractable: it\u0027s completely plausible for a user to place the unshrouded panels inside a service bay, and retract the panels and close the doors for reentry."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T03:17:51Z","Content":"Yeah, I think it was a mistake to make them non-retractable. It just doesn\u0027t make any sense to me, and feels very like an arbitrary \u0022we need to do something, let\u0027s invent something without any real basis\u0022. It would have been quite sufficient to just make the shielded ones more resilient to heat when closed, maybe a little less draggy, and more protected from impact damage. Those things would make some sense, lack of ability to retract does not."}]}
