Definitely need to be fast and precise. Best way would be if your tug was in orbit and would need to launch a precise intercept to it. Your dug would need to fast break, then accelerate back up again. Good and really only possible way would be a fairly high orbit to allow enough time for this to happen. I haven\u0027t heard of anybody doing it, but is theoretically possible. I have had interception with highly eccentric orbits before, just need to time your burns right to get matching speeds and be close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vonar","CreatedById":55997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T07:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the lowest docking I\u0027ve done was a mission where I sent a payload to a 63 km by 63 km orbit, and then had a tug bring up the cargo to a space station in a higher orbit. The problem with a sub-orbital flight is that chances are quick travel and the intercept burn will result in the craft that is on a sub-orbital path falling back down to Kerban. My general policy is to design rockets that can launch various cargo\u0027s in the 20 to 50 tons range into a 80 by 80 km orbit, and then have a tug refuel at a fuel depot, dock with a lander, and then meet the payload for missions to the Mun and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-12T07:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2013 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vonar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jod","CreatedById":68384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T07:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m asking this because I\u0027m still considering an Eve single stage lift-off mission.
