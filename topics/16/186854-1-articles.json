I assume that you\u0027re actually talking about a course where (assuming you\u0027re in the right inclination already), you burn\u00A0close to\u00A0Jool\u00A0just enough\u00A0such that your AP\u00A0intersects Pol\u0027s orbit.

The general intuition is that by capturing close to Jool, you\u0027re taking maximum advantage of the Oberth effect since you\u0027re moving so fast close to Jool. It\u0027s easy to burn off the excess orbital energy you had when entering Jool. However, the cost is that you then have to raise your PE to match Pol\u0027s. It\u0027s similar to the tradeoff between a Hohmann Transfer versus a Bi-Elliptic. I haven\u0027t done the math, but I suspect that Eve and Kerbin are close enough that there\u0027s probably some savings in capturing at Gilly directly. However, Jool is far enough (and massive enough) such that I think it\u0027s still probably better to burn close to Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe optimum\u00A0also can change\u00A0if the moon is very massive, since you can take advantage of the Oberth effect there too, but both Pol and Gilly are small enough that I don\u0027t think it makes much of a difference here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
