Is it a monster single stage?\n\nRockets should stay mostly nose heavy for stability. The larger mass tends to lead the way unless there are other forces (like Darth Gerbils Fins creating drag preventing a flip).\n\nThe fuel flow logic pulls fuel towards the engine and thus empties the furthest tanks first (since if you remove fuel from beside the engine, and there is fuel further out that can flow toward the sucking engine then the emptiness starts at the furthest point away). \n\nPut those aspects together and your center of gravity will shift rear ward unless A) you add more stages thus trap that fuel mass forward until you shorten the ship. or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) you use the right click dialogue on the fuel tanks to click the little play buttons to cut access to the 2 fuel types. You will have to manually turn this back on (especially if you use MechJeb\u0027s Autostaging!) but you can then drain the rearward tank first. C) add fins (especially if this occurs while the atmosphere is Thick - but if this happens again at 50K or something then you need to think weight shifting or torque control systems and the associated batteries -but beware the shake caused by multiple torque systems spread out being out of sync).\n\nIts probably not that your heavier side is being pulled down unless your going REALLY slow (Vertical speed gauge at top at or above 100 is my standard) or your speed at the bottom is... well bellow a few hundred by that altitude. \n\n1200 does seem a little low for this to happen - mines happened around 6-12Km.\n\nIf this doesnt fix it please describe the layout of your ship."},{"CreatedByName":"SultanSaidi","CreatedById":144891,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:14:54Z","Content":"So i tried different types of Rocket layouts multipel staging over height distributed and multipel staging over more or less the same height but dropping over time the empty tanks. i usually have a lot of starting stages with solid fuel boosters to get my speed up and overcome the starting inertia. i start with all my possibel engines on the same time and throttel them so i get an steady acceleration over time\n\nand side note its still completly at the start of carrer mode i have i think unlocked all 45 science stuff. i got further some other runs but i like to restart with knowledge i got and refine my carrier\n\nit could be i missred one 0 and it was at 6-12 km \n\nwhat i dont understand is why should a rocket be top heavy for stability? if the center of thrust is far away wouldnt then every little change make it tillt?(like balancing an pencil on your finger)\n\ni ll try to make some screenshots of my different designs"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:50:41Z","Content":"Read this.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117876-Why-Does-My-FLIPing-Rocket-Always-Flip-Over!-%28Easy-Picture-Explanation%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117876-Why-Does-My-FLIPing-Rocket-Always-Flip-Over!-%28Easy-Picture-Explanation%29)\n\nIt is like balancing a pencil, but only for the first 30 seconds or so. Try balancing that pencil when it\u0027s moving super sonic. With no weight up top it\u0027ll want to rip around backwards.\n\nAlso it\u0027s good practice to build rockets so they stage higher up around 25-30km. Radial boosters is fine they can be dumped whenever. But when it comes to serial staging that will make your craft shorter you must make it so the first stage does more work. Once your above 30km it\u0027s easy. The air is thin. \n\nAnother hint is to simply wait. This had been working great for me. The problem is in the early careers your limited to small rockets. Small rockets are harder then big rockets because they are far more susceptible to the air and lack a heavy payload. So what I\u0027ve been doing is if I can\u0027t get my rocket to stage really high up I wait. Let the first stage burn out then just hold prograde and wait until 25-30km before separating and continuing on. Really works well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T17:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600**"},{"CreatedByName":"SultanSaidi","CreatedById":144891,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:13:40Z","Content":"mmm oke i understand that but i kinda followed that already naturally with my rockets so i dont understand what is wrong with them then take a look please \n\nthis one is how i build them normaly [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711912327654707228/0298254A71D2465F407A63A86949C7621BD75C83/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711912327654707228/0298254A71D2465F407A63A86949C7621BD75C83/)\n\nthe next two where i just experimented around and they all failed the same from tipping over at around 12km\n\n [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711912327654707618/38974A6AE5B724D4D7E8D0E6D82B8B6BF51FE55C/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711912327654707618/38974A6AE5B724D4D7E8D0E6D82B8B6BF51FE55C/)\n\n[http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711912327654707921/E840D67AE1913DD7C7D3E858F85D4D39C9530282/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/711912327654707921/E840D67AE1913DD7C7D3E858F85D4D39C9530282/)\n\nany idears maybe? and thank you guys you helped already very much"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T01:35:12Z","Content":"\u003E any idears maybe? and thank you guys you helped already very much\n\nThere\u0027s lots of things that could be wrong. Pinpointing just one would be a bit difficult without the actual .craft file. But I\u0027ll take a stab at it.\n\nStability increases as the distance between the center of mass and the center of thrust increases. A perfect rocket would have the center of thrust all the way at the bottom and the center of mass all the way at the top.\n\nWinglets and control surfaces increase stability in that they counteract aerodynamic pressures exerted on the opposite end of the rocket.\n\nYour rocket is a big lever with the COM being the fulcrum. Your job is to keep the top of the rocket from being pushed in the wrong direction by aerodynamics by controlling the direction of thrust coming out the bottom. The more difficult you make it for that lever to be pushed the wrong way, the more stability your rocket will have.\n\nNextly, SRB\u0027s. While they have their use, their main purpose is to get you off the pad and moving so that your control surfaces can take over. They have no ability to direct your rocket other than forward. The longer you burn them, the more magnified errors in flight become.\n\nMy advice: \n\n1. Rely less on SRB\u0027s and more on engines with gimballed nozzles.\n\n2. Keep your COT as low as possible. In two images, you have SRB\u0027s half way up the rocket. Bad physics.\n\n3. Until you get some more experimentation under your belt, use winglets, canards are better. Two of your rockets have no winglets.\n\n4. Reaction Wheels - Adds another control factor to your rockets. Get them as soon as you can.\n\n5. Drag. With version 1.0\u002B This has become a new huge reality. Do this as a test. Send up just your SRB with a cockpit on top. Let it fly straight up, and check it\u0027s max altitude. Next, strap 4 of your parachutes on it and launch again. Again, check the altitude. I think you\u0027ll be stunned at the results.\n\n6. This is just my preference and may make no difference. Have your stability enhancers detach in the same stage as your engine ignition. If you fire off the engines without detaching, you\u0027ll soon see your rocket start to wobble. That wobble gets translated into your launch direction. Anything you can do to keep pointed the right way, do it. Even better, only use stability enhancers when you absolutely need to. I always put my rockets on the pad without them and only add them if absolutely necessary. Rocket engines and SRB\u0027s, unlike jet engines, have no spool-up time. Their thrust is almost instantly translated from your trust setting.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"SultanSaidi","CreatedById":144891,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T11:59:32Z","Content":"Ah yeah i figured it out my problem was that i put my center of mass and center of thrust too close together because i didnt wanted a too high mass shift while destaging because of that i builded my rockets always a bit more wrong but now i think my wrong physiks thinking got correct thank you all for your help yaall ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T22:18:05Z","Content":"I know you\u0027ve found the problem but I\u0027ll input my .02 for launches\n\n1 make it somewhat aerodynamic\n\n2.
