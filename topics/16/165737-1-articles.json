they\u0027re worthless otherwise. \u00A0For boosters, you always want to add net thrust--this means that you need the boosters to have higher thrust-to-weight than the core. \u00A0Usually, the 1.25m engines are weaker than the 2.5m types (the exceptions are the Vector and Dart, which you don\u0027t have yet), so for a comparable fuel load, you end up losing delta-V if you use them against a 2.5m core. \u00A0You\u0027re only managing because you have three FL-T800 fuel tanks stacked on each one, so it\u0027s a more-than-comparable fuel load.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, that larger fuel load is also at the limit of what the basic 1.25m engines can lift: \u00A0less fuel gives more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E but an even more pathetic burn time, and more fuel leaves you on the pad, unable to lift at all.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo put it in other words, your design has reached the point of diminishing returns;
