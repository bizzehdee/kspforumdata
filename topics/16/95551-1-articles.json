How much vacuum dV do I need precisely? 9600 seems to be the number, but I am not sure. Also, how does t/w ratio affect that number?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What is the best ascent profile?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Where is the best place to launch for which missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

That means: dV expended - gravity losses - drag losses - steering losses \u002B rotational boost = 7.7km/sec. Thus you can see that the vacuum delta V will depend on how much of that delta V was expended in atmosphere, and the delta V expended will heavily depend on the gravity losses you incur, the site you launch from, and (to a lesser extent) the drag losses and steering losses you suffer. From the Cape, the nominal vacuum delta V is around 9300; with high-thrust lower stages I have been able to expend only 8800m/s getting to a 185x185km parking orbit, but with a low thrust first stage it may be up to 9400\u002B, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigher TWR early on will drastically decrease gravity losses, but will (a) increase the mass and probably lower the payload fraction of your LV and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E may make your LV hard to control and \u00A9 can make things dangerous due to high dynamic pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that there is no single correct ascent profile or correct amount of delta V required; PhD theses are written on this subject, and years of CPU-time expended to calculate it for \u003Cem\u003Eparticular LVs with particular payloads\u003C/em\u003E let alone general cases (not least because there \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E be a general solution since the inputs differ).

Kourou (CSG) is best for equatorial orbits, and one of the high-latitude sites (like Kodiak) is best for polar.
