met because, unlike actual servo motors, the so-called \u0022servo motors\u0022 in game apparently have ZERO feedback loop.\u00A0 Real servo motors don\u0027t miss an angle because there\u0027s a

people even managed to build actual robots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso yes, robotic parts do work, but they do have limitations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst, in the amount of force they can take. those I used in the pictures are terrier engines. the hinges can keep them in position with some shaking. i tried using the more powerful darts, and the thing broke apart. In the same vein, I made a retractable solar array by attaching trusses to hinges, and solar panels to the trusses. but the more trusses you put, the less the system is stable. At some point it just keeps oscillating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, your attempt at putting rapiers engines on servos failed because of strenght limits. maybe using bigger servos would help. maybe the rapiers are just too powerful. in any case, related to this, robotic parts are not perfectly still. As you see, I used them for vectored thrust, in that I can direct my thrust upwards, downwards, or backwards. but fine control? nope. The push from the engines make the joints shake too much. In fact, the rover can be stable in flight only because of engine gimbaling correcting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, robotic parts are prone to shifting and getting distorted if force is applied on them. for example, if a big ground station is laying on them, like you tried to do. In this case, they can get bent by small amounts, that gradually get bigger with time. In my case, those hinges were moving lower and lower, until at some point I had to go in eva construction, disassemble the engines and hinges, and build them again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthird, robotic parts are also prone to bugs in many other cases. for example, if you place a docking port on a robotic part, it generally crashes. or two robotic parts stuck on each other. you can mmitigate this by putting other parts between the two robotic parts; for example, a simple octogonal strut between piston and docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfourth, robotic parts can get bugged even if you\u0027re not doing any of the above. the more complex your construction, the more likely it will bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\non the plus side, my dancing porcupine rover went to circumnavigate four different celestial bodies, and the robotic parts kept on working. so you can find some safe configuration. they are rddled with bugs, but they can be made to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
