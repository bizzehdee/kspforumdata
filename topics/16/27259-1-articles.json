The transfer window for Eve is 13 days away and I was thinking of using a single launch to get MapSat probes on both Eve and Gilly. My current design which I have partially tested is staged as followed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES0: Probe1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES1: Probe2 (Probe1 and 2 are vertically coupled with jr docking port)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES2: Gilly Transfer Vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3: Kerbin-\u0026gt;Eve Transfer Vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES4: Kerbin circularizing stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES5: Takeoff to 80km Ap\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is my thought process on getting the probes on both bodies:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES5: Lifter to obtain 80km Ap\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES4: Circularizing stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES3: Transfer burn/correction/capture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Capture to have ~45 degree inclination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - S0 (Probe 1) decoupled and corrects inclination and altitude (185km/89deg)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - S3 corrects inclination to match Gilly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - S3 decouples and fires reto to burn in atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES2: Transfer from Eve to Gilly/ correction/capture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Capture to try to get 60 degree inclination\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - S2 decouples and fires retro to crash into Gilly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES1: Probe 2 does correction to inclination and altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any comments/suggestions to my staging and process of getting both probes in polar orbits?

That way you shouldn\u0027t even need a transport vehicle to Gilly, just put one of the tiny fuel tanks (or maybe 2) and the smallest engines on each probe. A small probe with 1 tiny tank and engine should have about 1000 m/s of delta-v. That should be enough for orbital insertion at Gilly, and to set up an inclination change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar sized probe should probably have enough delta-v to get into the right inclination at Eve, too. But you might want to use the transfer vehicle for part of that inclination change, then finish it with just the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also consider ion engines. At Eve the solar panels are much more efficient, so just 2 or 3 regular sized panels are enough to power a single engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cxg2827","CreatedById":57380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T21:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESecond method worked great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an album of the Mission along with a probe i sent off to Moho:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/42W0I#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/42W0I#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
