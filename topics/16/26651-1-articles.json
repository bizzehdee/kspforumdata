To end up at different longitudes, the easiest way is probably to launch to a lower-altitude parking orbit first. Then plan out the transfer from parking orbit to GSO after waiting a bit in the parking orbit. If you set your first satellite as target, then the \u0022target position at intercept\u0022 markers might help you figure out the difference in angle when you get to GSO altitude. This is pretty much a manual process, I can\u0027t think of any great way to do it with MechJeb. You could do some math to figure out a specific target parking orbit altitude that would give you some convenient number of orbits before doing the transfer, but any intermediate altitude will work for some fractional number of parking orbits...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T22:13:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to do something similar to a rendezvous but going away from the target instead.

At this point, your apoapsis should be at the desired final orbit, your periapsis at the transfer orbit, making it a resonant orbit with the fraction of the period we need, and the first satellite should be very close, at a 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA phase angle. In our example, every orbit we complete will take us 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA away from the first satellite on the next apoapsis pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As soon as you\u0027re past the apoapsis, create a maneuver node to circularize the orbit at the next apoapsis. Once that\u0027s done, your phase angle to the first satellite should be exactly what you needed. Fine tune everything if you need to. I usually get all their semi-major axis to exactly the same by fine tuning the orbit with RCS, and this is enough to keep their relative positionstable for quite a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Go back to 3 and repeat for the other satellites, either using the previously launched satellite as target, or using the first satellite and going through a full orbit as many times as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis method also works very well when you want to get many small satellites in the same orbit on a single launch. Get the launcher to the ressonant orbit and every time you pass the apoapsis, drop a satellite, switch to it and circularize. As a matter of fact, I figured this method first, and start using the other method outlined above when I had large satellites that could be launched only one at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you create a video of this please?
