There could also be issues with an imperfect gravity turn or a bad TWR: if your engine is struggling to get off the ground, you\u0027ll lose a lot of delta-V during the first part of the ascent, and if you\u0027re going horizontal too quickly or too slowly, that also burns up delta-V. I unfortunately can\u0027t give you much guidance on how to do an optimal gravity turn: I\u0027ve never been to Laythe. I imagine it would be more horizontal than Kerbin ascents, courtesy of the thinner atmosphere, but the optimal turn requires simulation, either mathematical or just by trying until you get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*One thing which helps is that air gets thin very quickly, so if you\u0027re not dawdling in sea-level soup, you reach near-vacuum efficiency very quickly.

In theory, it\u0027s rocket fuel, and since it has low specific impulse, you\u0027d want to use up the monopropellant at launch or shortly thereafter (the issue is that, since RCS such a large vacuum/sea-level Isp ratio, it might be worthwhile to hold onto it for a few kilometers). In practice, that approach would require some fancy footwork, as you\u0027d need to rapidly switch between staging mode, to turn the craft and fire stages, and docking mode so you can hold down W to translate forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to deal with switching so often, the question becomes simple: do you get more delta-V by hanging onto that monopropellant until the LF/O rockets are exhausted, or do you get more by burning all of it before launch?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-09T18:15:28Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2014 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T17:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr, if it\u0027s not working out and you have another vessel in orbit, you can jump ship at the last minute and use the jetpack to circularize.
