That\\\u0027s what I thought the case was, but I kept seeing something slightly different from time to time I couldn\\\u0027t explain right away, thus the question above. I\\\u0027m usually careful about adding fuel from the top down (it\\\u0027s the OCD in me), but the last Munar launch I did, it went very wonky. All the RCS at the top of the stages drained first, even though they were placed first. I didn\\\u0027t notice this until I jetisoned the final stage before landing on the Mun. Didn\\\u0027t really matter too much, but the size of the craft necessitate RCS to get it moving in a reasonable time when going retrograde. Had to baby it for almost 20 minutes to get it into position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven Jeb complained on THAT mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-20T02:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\\\u0027ve noticed some strange behaviours with RCS tanks occasionally.
