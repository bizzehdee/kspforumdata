I planned a Munar mission but realized my third stage would still be burning through from atm to vacuum. Redux doesn\u0027t appear to calculate for this transition. How can I? I designed the third stage to boost me to almost LKO, but find that my total actual dV used for my entire mission is 300 more than I need. The culprit is that third stage and I hate over building my rockets, but I don\u0027t know how to calculate the atm to vac dV transition.

It\u0027s not 100% precise but it has proven to be suprisingly precise on my rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, lets say your first stage has 1500m/s in atmosphere and 2000 in vacuum. You substract 1000 from the atmospheric part, theres 500m/s left and in vacuum this is equivalent to about 666m/s. So your first stage would give you a total of 1666m/s approximately. Then you calculate the rest as vacuum delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an approximative method, theres probably a mathematical way to do it but it depends on your ascent profile and all. If you have a good TWR (\u0026gt;1.6), this should be pretty precise honestly.

Here, stage 4, 3 and 2 are used to get in orbit. So let\u0027s start with stage 4, who has 1476 of delta V in atmosphere and 1724 in vacuum. Thus, it has this 1000m/s to himself. So, if we take away, 1000m/s from the fourth stage atmospheric delta V, theres 476m/s left. 476/1476=0.32, meaning that 32% of the fuel will be left in the stage when it passes the \u0022atmospheric limit\u0022. So, there will be 32% left of the vacuum delta V, so 0.32*1742=562m/s. So, for our first stage, wel\u0027ll get 1000m/s atmospheric \u002B 562 vacuum, meaning we get a total of 1562m/s from our first stage. Then the other stages are considered vacuum, so 1562\u002B1863\u002B1197 = 4595m/s of delta V in total for our launch stage. To prove this out, I launched it with MechJeb to an altitude of 80k to have the most precise results possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B6CYffC.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B6CYffC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B6CYffC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we can see that the total delta V expanded to get into orbit is 4530m/s and there\u0027s roughly 125m/s left in the launch stage, so the total delta V of the rocket was actually 4655m/s, which is only 60m/s from the predicted 4595m/s. So yeah that\u0027s how I calculate my stuff. If you have multiple stages to get the first 1000m/s, just calculate the first as atmospheric and you do the same math as I did above to approximate the delta V of the one who goes through the limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results will vary a bit depending on your TWR and such but it should usually be pretty darn accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: To answer your question, that\u0027s how I calculated the 666m/s earlier: 1500-1000=500 --\u0026gt; 500/1500=0.33 --\u0026gt; 0.33*2000=666 --\u0026gt; 1000\u002B666=1666 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-24T18:41:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2013 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stupid_chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eextra info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T19:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.
