Even when I\u0027ve been able to build something, it\u0027s been ridiculously difficult just to get the wheels attached, and it seems like there must be some trick or technique I\u0027m missing that would make it simpler and faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNewHope","CreatedById":76088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T00:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst tip: If you don\u0027t already, build your rovers in the spaceplane hangar and then transfer the .craft file to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. : You can turn off angle snapping. It makes attaching parts way easier (e.g the seats)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. : you can rotate your parts around all 3 axes using the WASD \u0026amp; QE keys.

Start with a probe core; an OKTO2 works well. Slap a structural panel above it and a Reaction Wheel below it, and slap a structural panel below that. Use modular girders to build your chassis from that - the idea is to encase all of your critical hardware in parts with a high impact tolerance (by which I mean 80 m/s; you shouldn\u0027t be able to get a rover up to that speed without some kind of JATO system involved). Add a couple of battery banks and either RTGs or solar panels (I prefer RTGs but that\u0027s just me), some wheels and a couple of headlights and you\u0027re good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my best rover design, the Hellhound 7, driving around on Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gUcC3gM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gUcC3gM.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4WXONu0.png\u0022 alt=\u00224WXONu0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see that it is low and wide. The Reaction Wheel is there to further reduce the likelihood of a rollover; I could reduce it further by locking the steering on the outboard back tires (the inboard set are locked already).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilt in the VAB, incidentally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get a Kerbonaut into a seat, you have to get them in close proximity to the seat itself. Right click on the seat and select \u0022Board\u0022; if the option doesn\u0027t come up, you have to get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for wheels, depending on how you\u0027ve built up your chassis, you might try 2x symmetry. You\u0027ll get a wheel plus the one caddy corner from it. Me, I stick them on one at a time, and then do my level best to make sure they\u0027re at the same height and flush with the girders. Test your rover on Kerbin first; a well designed rover will go straight when it\u0027s not being steered and will pull to one side if there\u0027s an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
