I think the default is 250, but you can change that to 0 if you want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also, you should start thinking about designing your rockets so that the amount of debris that they leave is not abundant. Try to make your stages so that your takeoff stage ends within a periapsis of max 40.000m. That way, the debris will be captured by the atmosphere and crash into Kerbin.

I always try to keep the spent stage within a periapsis of less than 60, which is the highest point of the atmosphere that i read else where in the forum, but after the first pass, the periapsis will increase mysteriously, and it would remain in orbit. Now that\u0027s one less thing the crew will have to worry about....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T11:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s debris, then the orbit being in range of the atmosphere won\u0027t stop it.
