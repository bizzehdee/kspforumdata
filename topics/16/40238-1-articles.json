To transition from flight to hover, hold a constant altitude, by increasing pitch as your airspeed decays. Then start swapping in vertical thrust to compensate for wing lift as airspeed drops very low. Once you have a stable, slow-flying-hover, you then just shuffle over your landing point and put it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore than anything else it takes practice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralDisorder","CreatedById":35323,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T13:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with bsalis. It takes a while to master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, getting the balance of your plane just right also does wonders. I had the same problem when approaching 0 m/s horizontal speed. It would slightly dip forward and pick up speed again making me overshoot. Once I completely balanced my VTOL out it was considerably easier to keep in one spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plane is a little bigger though and the smaller your craft, the more precise you\u0027ll need to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy two cents\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
