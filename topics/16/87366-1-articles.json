If first, then it\u0027s maybe because part stick on side of vessel and thus it\u0027s pointing in wrong direction, i.e. what\u0027s forward for MJ may be \u0022down\u0022 for whole craft. Also those shuttles (don\u0027t know about which one exactly you\u0027re talking though) usually have their center of thrust not aligned with center of mass, which causes rotation that has to be corrected (like using shuttle engines mod, they have wide gimbal angle range to correct this issue).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T11:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb is excellent for many routine tasks. Getting rockets to orbit and getting landers down safe at a selected spot for instance. But there are also things MechJeb don\u0027t do well - amongst them flying aircraft. So might as well get used to flying planes manually. Which isn\u0027t that difficult going up, but can be tricky going down. With the latter MJ can help a bit though. The Spaceplane landing guidance/autopilot of MJ have a very helpful target indicator that is nice and easy to follow. Just don\u0027t let MJ fly the thing if you value your Kerbals...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
