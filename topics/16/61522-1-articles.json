I had an Idea and wanted to see if anyone knew if this was possible or how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wanted to create a mun base of operations to explore mun. My thought was to set up a base with fuel tank reserves. I would use these reserves fuel up my landing vehicles to return to orbit and eventually back home. I would be able to only have enough fuel in the landing vehicle to land, it would then refuel at the base to take off. I understand that this would take extremely precise landing, but mechanically is it possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not scoured this Forum so I apologize if this question has already been answered, please provide the link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, and Godspeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"canuckster","CreatedById":95193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechanically it is possible, use docking ports on your rovers and fuel tank reserves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest a tip, build your rovers and fuel base in the spaceplane hangar and save the vehicles to the subassembly. This way you can accurately place docking ports and get perfect wheel height so that all modules will fit together. When you want to launch them just add them to your lifter in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible, but would be better suited on Minmus, or bodies with low gravity.

The rover would need fuel tanks to transfer fuel. This way though, landings do not need to be as precise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you could just put rover wheels on the fuel reserve itself and make it dock-compatible with the lander. (this can be used when part count really is a limiting factor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I am working on a fairly large base/resort on Laythe, with SSTOs, comms, residence, etc. I am trying something new, because for me, part count IS a limiting factor. So, I have my runway/airport about 2.5 km East of my main resort, my fuel reserve and maintenance things 2.5 km South, and comms station 2.5 km North. The idea here is that a huge base can work, just with sectors placed out of render distance of each other, with a bus shipping Kerbals to and from, and SSTOs from the surface to orbit and back etc. Its actually working out great and is a great way to have a large base with minimal lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
