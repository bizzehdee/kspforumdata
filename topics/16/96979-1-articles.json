I\u0027ll be going towards Moho at 2500 m/s, no biggie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start my circuralization burn as I would, say, for Dres or the Mun. (no aerobraking, obviously, it\u0027s Moho)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maneuver node says I need 2400 m/s or so, and I have 5000 m/s in my tank according to kerbal engineer, so i\u0027m good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Except when I finish the burn, I have just 500 m/s in my tank. What gives? That\u0027s 1600 m/s gone into thin air. This is annoying, considering I need more delta-v to land, and I have no idea where it\u0027s going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing it wrong? Is there some trick? I use the maneuver node and execute it normally, if it was t -1 minute i\u0027d start at t- 30 seconds and end at t\u002B 30 seconds. Do I need to do it differently for Moho? I\u0027d like to know before I try to get my scansat into orbit (which has a tighter delta-v margin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may consider lithobraking using my skycrane to try to land the rover...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Picture of the rover, with KER readouts, in case they might be relevant (I don\u0027t think the exhaust is hitting anything, i\u0027ve tested it before)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xoqicNa.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xoqicNa.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T20:28:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norpo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot to put [Answered] D:\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"breakthrough","CreatedById":75359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T19:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the node was at periapsis and some of the burn took place far away from periapsis (likely in a Moho encounter), then Oberth effect is working against you and it will take more delta-v than the node indicates since the node assumes an instantaneous burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T19:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022breakthrough\u0022 data-cite=\u0022breakthrough\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the node was at periapsis and some of the burn took place far away from periapsis (likely in a Moho encounter), then Oberth effect is working against you and it will take more delta-v than the node indicates since the node assumes an instantaneous burn.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm, that\u0027s what I thought.

KER is incorrectly assuming you will decouple your rover before expending your fuel, throwing the calculations *seriously* off.
