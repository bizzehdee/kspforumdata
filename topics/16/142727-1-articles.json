I have a scientist aboard. I have transmitted my first batch of data but I still show that 337 worth of data taking up space? (see pic below). Can my kerbal clear this data or is the mission over once I reach 500 data?

It gets used up very slowly over time as it gets converted into science points. You want to keep loading in experiments until you\u0027ve filled up the buffer for data. As the data gets slowly used up, you want to add more experiments and fill it back up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo everything is still fine in your MPL. You have more room to store more data if you can, and the scientist is researching away -- slowly converting that remaining 338 points of data into lots and lots of points of science for you to transmit home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I suspect\u00A0you are under the following misimpression: You loaded up a bunch of experiments and converted them into 500 points of data. And then you \u0022waited\u0022 (with a timewarp) for the data to be converted into 500 science -- and you thought it would be a one-to-one conversion, so that all the data would be used up when it got converted into 500 science? It\u0027s not a 1:1 conversion. A little data gets converted into a lot of science. So you got your first batch of science points, and now you still have a lot of data left to convert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-29T03:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2016 03:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T16:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any more science in the lab (i.e. did it tell you to stop when it filled up the first time)? \u00A0If so, keep filling it to 500 (or 750 if you upgrade to 1.1) to increase the rate the scientists generate science. \u00A0Just review science and hit the yellow button to convert science to data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
