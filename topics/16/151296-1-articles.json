Start with a basic slightly overpowered orbit-capable craft (parachute, probe core, command pod, 1x100 battery, decoupler, FL-T400 fuel tank, Terrier, decoupler, FL-T800\u002BFL-T400 tanks, swivel, 2x radial decouplers, cross-feed enabled, with Hammers and an FL-T200 on top of each one).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift off when the target is 320km away. Follow standard gravity turn, heading a touch higher than perfect if anything. Drop the Hammers when they run out (you\u0027ll probably drop a bit of fuel in the side tanks too, but it\u0027s no big deal and you have more important things to worry about).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get to about 25 km, switch to map view,\u00A0 and watch your orbit lines. When you see that they intersect with the target vessel, set NavBall to target mode, and burn retrograde (which should be slightly under the horizon) until you need to stage. Stage and come back to map view. Now, retrograde and anti-target (pink cross) markers should be relatively close to one another. Burn on the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eother side\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of retrograde (compared to anti-target) until it slides over the anti-target marker. You should now have a very close encounter coming up in a couple of minutes. Divide your relative velocity to target by 15 (with this configuration, the Terrier\u0027s acceleration will be about 15 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E), that\u0027s the time you need to nullify relative velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow wait until you\u0027re about 2/3 of that time away from target, and burn hard retrograde. Again, pushing it over antitarget if it\u0027s a bit off. Keep watching the map view and time to target. It should count down very slowly. Ideally, you want it to say you have 10 seconds to target when your relative velocity is very low - 10 m/s or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do all that.. congratulations! You should be a hundred metres or so from target, without ever having had to plot a maneuvre node.

If you point to one side of the \u003Cu\u003Eprograde\u003C/u\u003E marker, you will pull it towards the middle of the NavBall (but the effect is necessarily less unless you increase velocity to target by a huge amount).\u003Cbr\u003E\nUse this to put yourself on a perfect collision course with your target. While you\u0027re still a couple of minutes away, thrust to one side to push retrograde over the anti-target marker. Your intercept point should have reduced even more.

Thank you very much to all of you, Debemma has been rescued and joined my team :]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh boy I had frustrating time catching her!\u00A0 Not sure if it is by default or I accidentally pressed F4 but I was not seeing my target even 500 meters away. Dont laugh but I even fully upgraded my tracking station thinking that it might be the problem lol :]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had 2 batteries on board but no solar panels thinking I will not need them being in such a low orbit, had 2.3 electric charge left when Debemma boarded my interceptor! :]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do feel quite confident now and will happily accept new rescue contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
