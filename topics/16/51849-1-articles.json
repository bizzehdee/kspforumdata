My intuition tells me that for a given rocket, it should have less dV in a bigger gravity well (e.g. Jool vs. Kerbin) and also it should have less dV when it is closer to the body than when it is farther away. For a fixed amount of energy in a rocket, the rocket should change it\u0027s velocity (e.g. delta V) more or less depending on the gravity acting on it. But I\u0027m not sure if this is the case in KSP: I\u0027m using Engineer Redux to estimate dV on a rocket I\u0027m building, and it allows you to select different planets. The TWR changes from planet to planet, but the dV for the rocket system remains the same across planets. I find this counter-intuitive; shouldn\u0027t a rocket be able to change it\u0027s velocity less in a larger gravity well?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to build an Eve return craft so I\u0027m scrounging for dV...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T15:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. The ammount of deltaV you need to escape changes, not the one you have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T15:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have the same amount of delta V in your rocket (with full tanks) no matter where it is be it on Kerbin, on Eve, in orbit, or whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you can actually get going faster by burning all of your fuel if you\u0027re in orbit than you could if you were on the surface of Kerbin is because when you\u0027re in a gravity well, it\u0027s as if you are accelerating downward at a constant rate*. So, unless you\u0027re on the ground, you need to be accelerating about 10m/s just to lift off of Kerbin. If you sat there for 10 seconds, you\u0027d use up 100 delta V, but not actually add much to your velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why Thrust to Weight Ratio (TWR) is so important. When lifting off the surface of a planet, you want to get away from it AS FAST AS POSSIBLE to lower that delta V wasting surface gravity down to 0 as quickly as possible. However, on planets with atmospheres you don\u0027t want to go above terminal velocity either, which is why a TWR of about 1.6 - 1.8 or so is the target. You want to go fast, but not so fast that you fight air resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*Clarification: You actually ARE accelerating downward at a constant rate.

I see that my dV on Eve is the same, but that the gravity well is deeper and steeper, so I spend the dV of my rocket and only get part way to escape compared to on Kerbin. In addition to the gravity well being deeper and steeper on Eve vs. Kerbin, the negative acceleration due to gravity following lift off is eating into my total dV, and worse so on Eve than Kerbin, correct?

So Engineer can\u0027t know how good of a pilot you are. Mechjeb has a tool that measures your ascent stats and will give you what your losses are due to gravity, drag and steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat number for dV for Eve is the total dV you need, given a fairly optimal ascent profile. If you fly well, that\u0027s how much dV you need to get to orbit. 10.5 is not enough to get you there from sea level. Kerbin needs ~4,400 dV to get to a 100 km orbit. That orbit is ~2,240 m/s, so you waste ~2,160 in overcoming gravity and drag. If I build my rocket with ~5,000 dV, then I\u0027m ok with some left over for orbital maneuvers.

But part of the confusion is that delta-v is a function of ISP, and ISP is a function of the atmospheric density. So you\u0027ll have a different delta-v depending how dense the atmosphere is and mods like engineer or mechjeb can\u0027t quite deal with this. You can calculate delta-v for a specific ascent profile, but it will be a little bit different if you don\u0027t fly that same profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem, and this one prevents you from calculating it based on initial and final velocity like you describe above, is the effects of gravity and atmospheric drag. The amounts lost to drag and gravity are highly dependent on how you fly and your rocket design. Flying straight up means you are fighting gravity the whole way, so you have huge gravity losses (and yes, gravity loses are worse on planets with higher gravity). Flying almost straight sideways means you will have huge drag loses. That\u0027s why there is so much discussion about ideal ascent profiles. The ideal profile will minimize your gravity and drag loses, but it\u0027s a little hard to calculate exactly how much you lose, and it can be difficult to actually follow that ascent profile, too. TWR is another matter, and there are about a thousand threads about ideal launch TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T21:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbocracy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbocracy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the replies guys; it makes sense.
