My ship will not stay on retrograde or any one spot when I\u0027m trying to make a burn while I\u0027m carrying an asteroid. I have to resort to spinning 360 degrees to the retrograde node to make incremental burns instead of a steady burn. It\u0027s not gamebreaking, but just frustrating. Thanks in advance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T04:43:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA screenshot would help diagnose the

causing a spin.\u00A0 To get properly centered, unlock the joint of your Klaw, choose \u0022target center of mass\u0022 on the asteroid, then rotate your ship until the target marker is perfectly centered on the navball.\u00A0 Then re-lock the joint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from that:\u00A0 depending on how your ship is put together, it\u0027s possible you could have a design

asteroid right-click menu\u00A0lets you\u00A0rename the asteroid.\u00A0 This only shows up when you don\u0027t have any ships docked to it---as long as you have a ship in contact, it will have the ship\u0027s name in the tracking center.\u00A0 So mostly it\u0027s for creating new moons by a \u0022catch-and-release\u0022 strategy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut back to your thrust alignment problem....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can target the asteroid\u0027s CoM during your final approach to it, before the Klaw makes contact.\u00A0 However, the Klaw only grabs when it hits more or less perpendicular to the surface and asteroids are lumpy.\u00A0 If the spot on the asteroid surface is at too much of an angle to the incoming Klaw, you\u0027ll slide along the surface a lot before the Klaw bites.\u00A0 This carries the ship well off the CoM line, meaning you have to make a bigger adjustment later.\u00A0 In extreme cases, it might be that the correction required will exceed the angular play in the Klaw and you\u0027ll have to release and find a different spot to grab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid this problem (most of the time), it\u0027s a good idea to 1) target CoM before contact and 2) unlock the Klaw\u0027s pivot before contact.\u00A0 That way, when you hit an angled lump on the asteroid, the Klaw will pivot and hopefully bite while the ship remains lined up with the CoM.\u00A0 There will probably still be a little sliding, however, so before locking the pivot, lean the ship as required to get back facing the CoM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T16:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA further possibility, more related to ship design: make your pusher with widely-spaced engines, at least 3, and fueled from a central stack.\u00A0 This means you can adjust thrust levels to better put the CoT behind the CoM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T17:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther ship-design issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou want your center of thrust as close behind the grab point as possible.\u00A0 i.e. you don\u0027t want a long, skinny rocket poking way way out from the asteroid.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBeware of engine gimbal, especially if you have a long skinny rocket; it can actually make the situation worse, when SAS tries to gimbal the engine to correct for orientation, and it makes the rocket \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebend\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E at the Klaw joint in precisely the wrong direction and you get a runaway error.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTrying to solve the problem by putting lots of reaction wheels on the rocket that\u0027s doing the pushing can have the same effect.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOne approach I\u0027ve used that worked pretty well was to completely disable \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eall\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E torque sources on the pusher rocket (engine gimbal locked, all reaction wheels disabled), and then dock some other ships to the asteroid that have very powerful reaction wheels, but disabled engines.\u00A0 That way, the source of torque isn\u0027t tied to the source of thrust, and it doesn\u0027t cause that problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s the kookiest contraption I ever built, which was a setup to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epull\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E an asteroid.\u00A0 Had a Klaw on the \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E of the tug, and the engines were mounted out on long curved booms so that they were on the sides of the asteroid.\u00A0 It only handled up to class C, but it was fun to watch.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

aligned perfectly,\u00A0depending on bad the torque you have is, it\u0027s possible that you might be able to overcome it with reaction wheels, etc. but at a lower thrust - try reducing the thrust and
