But coming in and landing from the slightly inclined orbit isn\u0027t much of an hassle anyway.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s generally most efficient not to try to match the inclination of your target during the transfer, but just to make your transfer orbit intersect the target orbit at the right time. Two ways of doing that are to include an inclination change component in your ejection burn (where you get to take advantage of the law of cosines which can reduce a 30m/s inclination change down to about 0.5m/s net) or to change your inclination mid-transfer like you\u0027re suggesting. The optimal point to do the inclination change mid-transfer varies depending on the eccentricity of your transfer orbit and the angle by which you need to change your inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hacked my porkchop plotter a bit to explore the transfer to Minmus from a 100km Kerbin orbit and it looks like the two strategies are pretty much equivalent in terms of delta-v (about 1410m/s total depending on the window), but the window is much larger for the mid-course plane change strategy. The optimal time to do the plane change maneuver varied but was generally quite close to Minmus (around 5 degrees prior to intercept, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the simplest and most efficient transfer to Minmus would be to wait for a window where Minmus will intersects an ascending/descending node at the time of intercept. Then you don\u0027t have to do any plane change and you can get an intercept with a single maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
