It looks like there is two (Duna/Ike?)... or maybe it is just two landing can radially placed? It would probably help to see the VAB assembly of that, instead of widely guessing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, you\u0027re right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022orangexception\u0022 data-cite=\u0022orangexception\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETurning large things connected by multiple docking ports is fun!\u003Cp\u003EYou should definitely use time warp to stop the wobble after you complete a turn. Also, make sure you\u0027re on your maneuver marker early. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re burning, lower thrust will mean lower wobble. If you\u0027ve got the craft aligned properly, then you can try to turn off SAS and engine gimbals to prevent wobble. When you get the burn good enough, then do another maneuver to correct for anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not that bad actualy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wibou\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wibou\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIndeed. Way WAY too much battery. 1000 electric charge would be PLENTY if you keep the SIX gigantic solar array. In fact, it would be quite enough to have only 2 (but it would be less pretty that way, agreed).\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the lander could land on Duna and back though...
