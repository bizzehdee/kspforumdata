I will eventually need to refill it, but every refill is going to take some orbital transfers. On the other hand, if I pack to much fuel from the start, I loose out to the tyranny of the rocket equation. If you have such a craft (stock engines and system), what kind of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E have you used, and what is your experience with it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T17:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t know the exact \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E numbers (I don\u0027t have MechJeb or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E installed on 1.2) but 580 units of liquid fuel in a 12.69 ton craft powered by an LV-N Nerva will get you from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to Minmus or Mun orbit and back with ease.
