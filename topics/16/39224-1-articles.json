I was able to get to orbit, land on mun, rendezvous and dock, and make duna orbit before adding mech jeb. There are many excellent tutorials on YouTube that will aid you to do all of it without mods. I am not saying there\u0027s anything bad about mods, you just don\u0027t need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBiggest issue I had with steering was docking, I would start looking at the ship I was docking with and start seeing funny because of my orientation. Switching to chase cam helped with this a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo imho you don\u0027t need mods, but I did start using mech jeb for some of the info it provides otherwise I am stock everything else. Biggest tip would be check those helpful YouTube vids for what you\u0027re having issues with, quick save often, and rejoice in the joy of failure. Killing kerbals learning was some of my most fun and memorable moments!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xylotism","CreatedById":76174,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T00:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dewm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dewm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff main topic noob questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you guys steer rockets so easily?

If you made sure to include the module from the Control tab in design mode, use T to activate it in launch mode, it greatly helps with steering. If you\u0027re using SAS and it\u0027s still out of control, add some RCS fuel with RCS boosters, use R in launch mode to turn it on and SAS will use RCS thrusters to help with course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf none of that works, your rocket is probably not balanced properly... too top- or bottom-heavy, or needs more struts for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, make sure you\u0027re using decouplers or separators to seperate stages as the engines run dry, otherwise you\u0027re hauling dead weight for no reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T00:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee my comment in the other thread you started for my list and explanation of the mods I use. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/42589-What-mods-should-I-get\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHERE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T00:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eto steer the rocket easily\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou need to use rockets that allows thrust vectoring\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eie... you cant steer well with a SRB because it doesnt have thrust vectoring\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso RCS comes handy if you ship is very heavy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luchelibre","CreatedById":61140,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T01:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESubAssembly Manager is a must-have in my opinion.

For some people, MechJeb is a must have from the start, for others, they pick it up when they get bored of easily automated parts of the mission, some never do use it. Personally, I don\u0027t recommend using it until you find something that you just can\u0027t do, and then you watch how it does it (the 2.0 version actually creates maneuver nodes for most of the things it does, so you can take a look at what it is doing), or there\u0027s something you\u0027ve done often enough that you\u0027re bored of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see a reason to stay away from things like Subassembly Manager, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Editor Extensions, etc. Kerbal Crew Manifest was a must have until 0.21 in my book, but not so much now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do recommend you stay away from overly powered parts at least for a while.
