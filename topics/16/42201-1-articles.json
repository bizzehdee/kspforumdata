You want to burn as close to the sun as possible to exploit it\u0027s oberth effect. You will get a substantial delta-v penalty for encountering Moho at it\u0027s apoptosis. You can think of it like this: Ideally, when would you want to burn from Moho to Kirbin? The answer is when Moho is at it\u0027s periapsis. This means that you also want to encounter it at the periapsis, because the lawls of physics work the same in reverse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe velocity of Moho at apoapsis is be 12\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0186, yours will be about 15 550 if you\u0027re coming from Kirbin.

But more important, I think, is making sure that you actually get a good encounter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese huge insertion burns, 5000 or 8000m/s are not due to differences in encountering Moho at its periapsis vs. at its apoapsis. They are due to getting non-ideal intercepts. The ideal intercept is one where you encounter Moho at \u003Cstrong\u003Eyour\u003C/strong\u003E periapsis (or perihelion to be precise, the closest approach to the sun). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving been to Moho more than any other planet I have found that the easiest way (though not the most fuel efficient) is to treat a Moho encounter like docking. Bring your periapsis down until it just meets Moho\u0027s periapsis (it\u0027s best to do this at the ascending node between Moho and Kerbin, which should get you close to Moho\u0027s periapsis). Then use smaller retrograde burns at the point where you cross Moho\u0027s orbit to setup a near ideal intercept. This might take several orbits around the sun, but I\u0027ve always found this easier than trying to get the perfect intercept from Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou lose some efficiency due to making burns far away from Moho, but it\u0027s not very much. Doing this I can almost always get from LKO to a 100km, polar, Moho orbit in under 5000 m/s, and I never have to worry about finding the perfect time to leave Kerbin or getting to Moho and finding that I need to a make a 5k m/s burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krenshala","CreatedById":76062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T21:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming Kerbin\u0027s orbit defines the ecliptic, you may want to shoot for the ascending or descending node as well.
