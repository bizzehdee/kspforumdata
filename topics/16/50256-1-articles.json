For example, on my way to the Mun, I\u0027ll plan a trajectory with my transfer burn that goes through the Mun\u0027s influence (behind it) and out the other side into a Kerbin Escape trajectory. Once I\u0027ve achieved that trajectory, I dump my transfer stages and then my lander or probe does burn at periapsis to get into orbit. The other stages etc just sail on into interplanetary space. If I give them enough energy, apparently they escape Kerbol as well. I like this process because while there is still litter, it is over such a huge space that I\u0027m guaranteed never to see it again. In doing this I have noticed some quirks that I wanted to mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Let\u0027s say I separate from my transfer stage prior to my Mun encounter. My transfer stages are drifting very slowly away from my lander. Upon Mun encounter, they suddenly accelerate away from my lander (to about 10km within 10 seconds or so). Why does this happen? It\u0027s as if my trajectory has changed upon Mun encounter and they have continued on my previous trajectory. If so, why does my trajectory suddenly change upon Mun encounter...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) A related question is: if I wait until I make my Mun encounter to jettison the transfer stages, they continue past periapsis and to Mun escape on the other side. Meanwhile I\u0027ve burned into orbit at Pe. Do those spent stages then achieve Kerbin escape as well following the Mun escape? The reason I ask is that under 1), when I left those stages, I still had the trajectory plot showing Mun encounter, Mun Escape, and Kerbin escape, indicating [to me] that the spent stages would eventually achieve Kerbin escape. When I jettison them in the Mun\u0027s influence, they only have \u0027Mun Escape\u0027 listed, and I go on faith that they will also achieve Kerbin Escape. However, because I suspect a sudden trajectory change upon entering Munar influence (described in 1), I no longer know if the jettisoned stages will escape Kerbin. In testing, I\u0027ve found that they do. But I\u0027ve also found some jettisoned stages that I thought would have Kerbin escape doing a very wide Apoapsis orbit of Kerbin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) In examining my spent stages that have managed to escape Kerbin orbit, I find them listed as \u0027Orbiting kerbol\u0027 or \u0027on an escape trajectory from Kerbol\u0027. The orbiting Kerbol ones make sense, but the escape trajectory ones seem to have defined Kerbol orbits. So I\u0027m not sure why they are listed as escaping; their orbits are defined (and fall inside of Eeloo\u0027s orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) A related question: Are unmanned debris items\u0027 orbits updated by encounters? For example, for my debris that is orbiting Kerbol, if a piece happens to encounter Duna\u0027s influence when I\u0027m not looking, will it get captured or have it\u0027s orbit altered? This relates to my question in 1) where I was wondering if I jettison debris just prior to an encounter, does that debris still have the encounter. I suspect based on my observation that the answer is \u0027no\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T21:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect what you\u0027re seeing is that trajectories crossing an SoI can go wonky if done at high warp.

Even though these objects are \u0022on rails\u0022 and completely predictable, the game still for whatever reason evaluates them in steps and if the step is large enough, the object may miss a SOI (or, more often, the warp factor may significantly affect the shape of the trajectory after SOI change) or skip through a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbocracy","CreatedById":89641,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T21:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mesons\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mesons\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThree-body physics. It\u0027s hard, so we don\u0027t do it. The approximation that Squad uses is to use only the gravity of the host of your sphere of influence. When you change SOIs, you are suddenly ignoring the gravity of your previous body and now subject to the new gravity, so though your velocity remains the same in crossing SOIs, the force changing your velocity differs. Depending on the angle at which you enter the SOI, this can mean that your separation from your disposed stages can change in non-intuitive ways.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk makes sense. Though - if I separate from my stages _right_ before crossing into the new SOI, shouldn\u0027t both me and my debris be subject to the same changes upon crossing into the new SOI? Therefore both of our trajectories might change in similar non-intuitive ways?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
