How does it works ? I mean, the asteroid can\u0027t do a retroburn, and if they manage to get \u0022aerocaptured\u0022 it means that their periapsis is inside the planet\u0027s atmosphere and they will eventually fall on the planet.\n\nSo, how does it work ? How Eve have been able to capture Gilly for exemple ? Can we do something similar with spacecraft ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T10:41:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 10:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tatonf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T00:04:47Z","Content":"A moon can gravity assist an asteroid into orbit.\n\nIt actually happened in a game of mine once.

It could have formed there in the first place\n\n2. There could have been two bodies passing by Eve at around the same time (Gilly plus one other), which interacted in a way that left Gilly in orbit while ejecting the other.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E its happens when two bodies similar enough orbital velocities interact with each other, so for eve and gilly, imagine that eve is orbiting around the sun at (i forget what it is in game and for simplification reasons) 1000m/s and an asteroid (gilly) is orbiting at 1050m/s (again simplifying for the \u0022capturing\u0022 part, i don\u0027t know the maths to say what is necessary for an orbit, and not lithobraking)\n\u003E If gilly were to enter eve\u0027s SOI its velocity now compared to eve is around 50m/s, so if eve\u0027s gravity is strong enough, it can prevent gilly from exiting its SOI, so it now has gilly captured.\n\nActually, it doesn\u0027t work that way-- the original poster had it right, that\u0027s a scenario where capture doesn\u0027t really work. Setting aside for the moment that planets in real life don\u0027t have an actual SOI (gravity goes on forever): if the asteroid entered the planet\u0027s field at some relatively slow velocity (say, 50 m/s) and managed not to collide with the planet itself, then it would just swoop around in a parabola and exit again with the same 50 m/s that it entered with.\n\nThe real answer to the question of \u0022how do things get captured\u0022 is that there has to be an interaction with a 3rd body involved. Two bodies in isolation cannot result in capture.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T04:59:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tatonf","CreatedById":146283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T10:41:06Z","Content":"Ok thank you !"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T11:18:32Z","Content":"supposedly I\u0027ve head that non-uniformity in the planets gravity (ie, its not a perfect sphere with its mass evenly distributed with no asymetries in density) can result in capture of bodies in very similar orbits."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T11:38:58Z","Content":"In real life there aren\u0027t clear SOIs with sharp boundaries where nothing but the primary affects your orbit.
