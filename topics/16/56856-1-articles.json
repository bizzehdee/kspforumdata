The rocket basically is throwing stuff out the nozzle behind your ship with a certain force, and that imparts the same force on the ship to go the opposite direction(forwards). The more mass it throws (Fuel Flow), and/or the faster it accelerates the mass it\u0027s throwing (ISP), the more force you get for your ship (Thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you have 1/2 your ship mass is fuel, and you throw it all out the back at once you get force X on the fuel going backwards, and force X on the ship forwards as well, and that will change your velocity (delta-V) by Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf however, you use the same mass of fuel, but double the mass of your ship, the fuel only accounts for 1/3 of the ship\u0027s overall mass.
