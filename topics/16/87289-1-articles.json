It simply doesn\u0027t work above a certain speed, even if there\u0027s still plenty of air available. I believe this was a deliberate design decision specifically to prevent using it for an Eve SSTO.

For example, use a Mk1 lander can, an X200-32 fuel tank, and a Skipper as the upper stage, and a Rockomax decoupler, an S3-7200 fuel tank, an S3-14400 fuel tank, and a KS-25x4 engine cluster as the lower stage, and you\u0027re already at around 8000/9100 m/s of delta-v with high enough TWR. For a bit more delta-v, replace the inefficient 3.75 m fuel tanks with 2.5 m tanks, and maybe add some extra fuel to the upper stage.
