Delighted to have completed the mission and on return to Kerbin...\n\nThis is where my problems now are. I have 8 Kerbs on a suborbital trajectory back into Kerbin. Set a nice Peri so I am slowing down in the atmosphere. Heat shield doing its job nicely, but the problem is what I have left is a huge hulk of a ship returning to Kerbin which is too darn heavy and its just falling to earth like a brick!! I didn\u0027t pack drogue chutes or airbrakes so am just reliant on the atmosphere to slow me down.\n\nI have F9\u0027d several times to the sub-orbital trajectory and have a bunch of mono that I can adjust my peri and tried various different heights but I either blow up as I am coming in to steep or I skip several orbits slowing and bringing the apo down nicely with each orbit, but even then just can\u0027t get below 250M/s to pop my main chutes before I smash into the ground.\n\nI can\u0027t revert the mission to the beginning as too much time has passed so that option is not available.\n\nCan anyone suggest anything to save my 8 kerbals and ideally my creature comforts experiment and return it safely to Kerbin. Even if I have to (ideally not) cheat temporarily just to get them all back so I can continue my career!!\n\nLessons learnt... On a large hulk pack drogue chutes and Airbrakes!!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T21:24:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pinchy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T08:52:24Z","Content":"\u0022SavingKlaw.\u0022\n\nSomething like this:\n\n![hrl7zoI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hrl7zoI.jpg)\n\nPossibly without the parachutes if the ship has its own.

If you run out of RCS, a kerbal can EVA out and push the craft in the required direction. Than it stays here.\n\nNow you can send a rescue-craft to bring the crew home for their xp. Decide if you want to land the craft - though unless a contract asks for it, there is not much point in doing so. The lab can generate more science up there. And you can refuel it to send it on another expedition. If it has no docking ports, you can still load it up with the klaw. If you really want to land it, the klaw is the solution again - just build something that has it and a lot of parachutes, and some fuel for deorbiting if needed.\n\nEDIT: ninja\u0027d... by a few guys. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT2: I think you don\u0027t need to be as slow as 250m/s to open those chutes.
