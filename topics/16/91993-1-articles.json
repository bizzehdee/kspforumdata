TWR=3.0 does seem a tad excessive in my experience unless you\u0027re trying to go for a speed record. It might be you\u0027ve got less an issue of thrust and more an issue of lift. The less lift you\u0027ve got, the more thrust you need to compensate for it in general. The general rule is ~2.3 tonnes per Delta Wing / Wing Connector A/B, which works out to 1.15 tonnes per unit of lift; a 1:1 ratio is easier to remember. So for your 35 tonne plane, you want a total of 35 units of lift, roughly the amount provided by 18 (i.e 9 pairs) of Delta Wings/Wing Connectors or the equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombine THAT with a TWR of 3 and you\u0027ll wind up with a plane that\u0027ll climb like a bat out of hell...in fact, it\u0027d probably climb \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E fast (as in climb at 45 degrees to 10k and then flatten out to 5 degrees, and expect to still go upwards at 100\u002B m/s). Especially if you stick all your high drag parts (i.e. intakes) up at the front instead of amidships and aft. I had a design like that the other day; thing went into a flat spin and the engines still had sufficient thrust to operate. A few up at the front are okay, just don\u0027t over do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T18:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can manage a TWR less than 1 actually.
