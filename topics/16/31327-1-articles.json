I would suggest learning how to do stuff in ksp and then after you know you are able to do it, use mechjeb(if you still want to). I haven\u0027t used it before so i can only assume here, but i would think that understanding how to move around in space, and knowing how thrust in a certain direction will change your orbit would make telling mechjeb to do those things much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T17:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1- Select target and mission parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Watch your ship magically lift and go to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl","CreatedById":58210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T17:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgree with Sol : should be posted in the \u0022How to...\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hadn\u0027t dowload MJ in the 0.20, but I gess this hasn\u0027t changed from the 0.19, so :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you want to go to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, choose the Homman transfer.
