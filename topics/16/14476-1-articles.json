Specifically, I\\\u0027d love it if the rotation keys also acted as the SAS hold key, so I could turn SAS on and it would auto-disengage temporarily when I\\\u0027m giving rotation commands (equivalent to holding \u0027F\u0027 at the same time as rotation keys).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the .cfg, I tried listing multiple keys, separated by commas, for the hold command, and I tried making multiple entries for the hold command.
