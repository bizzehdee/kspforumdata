I thought all the time that in new KSP Atmosphere we should stick to a max-Q ( and I just took the advice from MJ for about 20.000pa)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat is not true when the most important thing for you is most less dV to Orbit. You should stick with max-Q if you dont have a very well drag-optimized design to minimize stress on the rocket, thats also the way like they do it in Real Life, because an exploding rocket is fun in KSP, but it isn\u00B4t in Real Life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.)

It seems that if you have a very well aero designed rocket, that the most important factor is not drag loss anymore, the most important factor is gravity loss, if you stick with max q limit to 20.000pa you will always have a too high gravity loss and if your rocket is stable you are not gaining anything.

Also to get a perfect circularizing maneuver, the MJ Smatblabla function is useful to stay in prograde at Apoapsis.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found out that you can safe dV if you make the circularization manually and without a maneuver node, just stay 10 seconds behind time-to-ap and then burn exactly so that you dont go over or under the 10 seconds to ap, you will make perfect circularization maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) I cant make a totally handsoff Gravity Turn, the gravity turn is always starting to early or if starting at a good point, will end to early and I have to correct the pitch by myselve, thats a thing which grind my bears, because I wanted to make a gravity turn with so less drag and steering loss as only possible. And also I read that in Real life they are also trying to make a One-Steer only Gravity Turn ( the beginning pitch over ) though i also read that sometimes even in real life they have to use gimballed help to correct steer but at a minimal level )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to give my rockets more weight to the top through tanks which i dont really need/use, so that I thought more weight on the top will result in faster gravity turn, but it looks like that is not true, further testing from my site is needed though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) Im not sure about that thing, but it seems that a rocket with more width has also less drag in KSP and i think it should be the other way. Im testing this further on. I can only say that with similiar Ascent behavior, my first rocket with 1.25m did always had much higher drag loss than the rockomax parts rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.) Round about you should stick with that Degrees to Ascent:\u003Cbr\u003E\nPitch Over at : 100 m/s ( which is with a good TWR Vessel always something between 600m high and 1400m high, you should look only at m/s, because under 100m/s will return in too fast gravity turn and too much over 100m/s will return in a too straight gravity turn with much steering corrections and loss )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are at 10Km = ca. 45\u00B0 degrees\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour AP is at ca. 40KM = turn down to 20\u00B0 degrees\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour AP is ca. 55-60KM= turn down to something about 0\u00B0 degrees, you need velocity now\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be nice to go to 0\u00B0 at 30Km but the heat will melt the cone and wings and may even melt more of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3072 dV to LKO Rocket:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/fA9jUBu\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStart \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/i8OvWJo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAscent at 28KM\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/DwdkYLH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAscent at 47KM after Burn\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/eZH2nmQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFinal Orbit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone can show me that Im not right with some or even all facts, i would like to hear that !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 hour later i got to under 3000dV :=)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ZbBCjVS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPic\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-22T16:25:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2015 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rucki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T20:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222332694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128252\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450798218\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155581\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rucki\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Rucki said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read your optimization simulations and its very interesting, thank you for sharing :).
