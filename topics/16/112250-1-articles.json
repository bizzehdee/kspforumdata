Reached the point where i can theoratically make more than 7 kerbin circumnavigations with it but have a problem. I am supposed to get up to 30k with it as the fuel gets used so the next circumnavigation uses less and less fuel as i climb up very slowly. The problem starts at 5th circumnavigation. The plane reaches about 28k and starts loosing yaw controll. it can go 1450m/s at 27k height stable but if i go over that it starts yawing towards sides and goes out of controll eventually. Now before you get started about com sliding because of fuel getting consumed know that is not the reason... The plane can fly really stable as long as i don\u0027t pass 27k and even land with the fuel that i am loosing controll with. So this is not a com issue. Maybe the air gets so thin up there that the controll surfaces are not enough to keep the plane stable? I am indeed using a small surface for yaw authority for reduced drag.\n\nPS. Please don\u0027t talk about noob mistakes here.\n\nEdit: Added Images\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Like i said if the plane can reach 28k height while going 1450m/s you can assume that wing area is enough... If it wasn\u0027t i wouldn\u0027t have been able to go up to that height and keep that speed. Engines have nothing to do with it thrust is aligned with point of mass perfectly. Point of mass stays stable as the fuel gets consumed so no problem there either. As i said i have small yaw controll compared to the plane but it was enough untill i passed 28k mark. Haven\u0027t tried yet but the problem might get solved by adding a bigger yaw controll surface but i don\u0027t really want that because of extra drag...

Continue to decrease slighlty, i found that losing control is because :\n\n-either an engine got less air intake (reaching very low intake like 0.05, it seems that it feeds engines from left to right, so right engines flameout a bit before left, and your plane begin to turn on the right)\n\n-either too much thrust for control surfaces (as they become less efficient because of less atmosphere)\n\nYou need also to be almost at prograde 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 on the horizon to \u0022build\u0022 your speed to 2km/s.\n\nI don\u0027t know exactly which is the main reason causing this issue at 30km, but i could resolve it by lowering throttle to keep control. I can reach orbit without using any space engine (just raising a bit periapsis sometimes with a second burn at apoapsis, but i often manage to reach periapsis \u003E70km with only jets). If i keep full throttle at 30km, no matter how much SAS or winglets i have, i lose control."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T12:36:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Picture isn\u0027t going to show you anything else than these information i gave you.\n\nPicture tells a LOT.\n\nYou have Yaw control problems, while flying high supersonic but not hypersonic speeds at 27k?\n\nIs your wing shape appropriate? You do NOT want to build it along the normal plan for low-flying planes.\n\nNor do you want to use the design for SSTO spaceplanes, as at 28k they are flying much faster and not relying on aero lift any more.\n\nAre you flying west or east? \n\nAt 1450m/s, that\u0027s the difference between your plane weighing 7/8ths or 4/10ths of its mass.\n\nSingle or multiple engine?\n\nIf multiple, are you \\*sure\\* that they are getting enough air?\n\nEven ultimately airhogged designs cannot supply their engines max at 28k.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAll of these can be answered by 2 pictures.\n\none of your plane in hanger, aero tools shown.\n\nand one of your plane at altitude, experiencing the problem you face, again with aero display on and resource tab open."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T13:15:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All of these can be answered by 2 pictures.\n\u003E \n\u003E one of your plane in hanger, aero tools shown.\n\u003E \n\u003E and one of your plane at altitude, experiencing the problem you face, again with aero display on and resource tab open.\n\nUploaded pics hope you can solve the problem.

Clearly the stability effect doesn\u0027t work as well when passing 27k altitude. That might be the only reason why i am able to get away with that tiny fin untill i reach 27k altutide.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T13:32:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T16:56:07Z","Content":"Well added a big-s tailfin which solved the problem.

Mk-3 is too big tried that. When you use mk3 than you have to use mk3 adapter too to smooth the curve. Well when i use the mk3 then i can\u0027t use just 4 engines. Everything has to get big as the craft gets bigger. Another thing is that im trying to keep the speed over 1400m/s at 27k altitude or it will take forever to circumnavigate 7 times. If it was up to me i would use droptanks to do this and possibly would be able to circumnavigate more than 10 times easily but challenge doesn\u0027t allow that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T18:41:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:47:55Z","Content":"Your original design has a lot of frontside drag due to those inlets, and \\*very\\* little rudder for Yaw control.\n\nYou seem to be always flying as high and as fast as it can go.\n\nStill, you say it manages fine until that point. 27.5k, and fuel is about half depleted.\n\nWhile you are using a single monster tank for fuel, most likely to prevent CoM creep due to uneven fuel use, your CoM will still be moving to the rear as the tank empties.\n\nWith drag remaining front, and mass moving aft, your instability is worsening.\n\nWith increasing altitude, your rudder is becoming less relevant, also worsening stability.\n\nFrankly, I expect that at any point after about 25k alt that if you disable your autopilot and keep hands off the controls, your plane will enter a flat spin.\n\nI think it is purely the autopilot and the gimbal on your engines that is keeping it balanced at that point.\n\nThe small solution is to greatly increase your rudder size.
