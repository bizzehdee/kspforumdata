If you put loads of torque right on the top of the rocket, and there\u0027s a massive heavy-lift 1st stage at the bottom, it\u0027s quite possible for the torque to break the weakest link via bending during pitch and yaw. The fix is to avoid putting massive torque right at the top. The top stage is best to only have sufficient torque for that stage on its own, or maybe that stage and the stage immediately below it. Adding torque wheels to the top of the heavy lift lower stages, if it needs more in the early phases of flight, is far better than adding them at the top, in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T01:44:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETotally possible, I have small satellites with a set of reaction wheels on either end.
