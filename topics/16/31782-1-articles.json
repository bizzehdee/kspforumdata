If so, then that is not possible. If you are coming from outside of Ike\u0027s SOI, you will always be going at at least escape velocity. However, you can get into a stable orbit around Duna from a solar orbit using a third body, Ike, to give a gravity assist to slow you down into a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
