A tidal locked orbit where one side of the station is always facing towards the center of the planet it is orbiting. the ISS dose this by rotating at one revolution every 90 min but KSP kills rotation when you time warp, so that option is not a viable option.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-23T19:47:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2013 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by karolus10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eprefix change to \u0026quot;answered\u0026quot;\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolk","CreatedById":26764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T18:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou just answered your own question, Tidal locking is impossible without constant rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T19:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor large astronomical bodies, like the Moon (or Mun!), tidal locking works by that the parent body\u0027s gravitational field pulls most strongly on the side of the satellite facing it, while less so on the far side. This causes the object to elongate slightly. As such, this bulged side experiences a torque which compels it to stay facing the parent body. Thus, after millions of years of this, even satellites which initially spun with great velocity will slow their rotation rate and become tidally locked. This won\u0027t happen with your space station, however as the scale is much too small. Of course, if your space station is on par with the Death Star...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T19:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you could maybe get mechjeb to track the pro/retrograde marker you\u0027d be set.. until you probably switched to another craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T19:43:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is impossible to achieve in KSP because of game mechanics limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo achieve this we would need upgrade of on-rail system ,so it will save object axis of rotation and angular speed, so it could predict object position and angular momentum after leaving warp / loading spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly \u0022con\u0022 of this feature would made fast spinning debris and troubled spacecraft harder to recover after loosing control (If Gemini 8 would had time-warp key, they will had no problems ;P).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want avoid maneuvering the space station for docking, You can orient the station main docking port axis in parallel to normal/anti-normal axis (it\u0027s an purple axis on maneuver node), this should made one part of the job way easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Viper_607","CreatedById":32821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T20:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022karolus10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022karolus10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is impossible to achieve in KSP because of game mechanics limitations.\u003Cp\u003ETo achieve this we would need upgrade of on-rail system ,so it will save object axis of rotation and angular speed, so it could predict object position and angular momentum after leaving warp / loading spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly \u0022con\u0022 of this feature would made fast spinning debris and troubled spacecraft harder to recover after loosing control (If Gemini 8 would had time-warp key, they will had no problems ;P).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want avoid maneuvering the space station for docking, You can orient the station main docking port axis in parallel to normal/anti-normal axis (it\u0027s an purple axis on maneuver node), this should made one part of the job way easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno about calling it impossible when you know exactly how to make it work...
