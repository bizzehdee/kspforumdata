By some dumb accident of timing \u0026lt;I guess timing is as good as coincidence?\u0026gt; my boosters held out long enough to stay with the vessel almost to the point where I was ready for the coasting phase to the AP, mechjeb dumps the boosters as they burned out and 2-3 seconds later the vessel orients itself for the circularizing burn and mechjeb hits the auto-warp to take me to the the burn. I look below my vessel and I see 8 items in a neat oval below me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0CDkSvp.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00220CDkSvp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you see they range in distance from around under 20km to almost 30km away. THIS is where my question stems: I have seen things travel to 25km and delete, and now, I have seen them make it to basically 30km away \u0026lt;this doesnt count launch clamps as I have seen those stick to the pad with me nearly 60km away, i think, THINK they are counted differently, but, may be wrong there\u0026gt;, so, my question is: Is the 25km distance hard and fast, or basically an averaged distance that is a nice figure to work with? Not a pressing issue, just something I found curious and was wondering about. Thoughts?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nop 00:32:30\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Allocthonous","CreatedById":169833,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-30T06:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuto-delete only occurs below certain altitudes (or rather air pressures).

There is the autodeletion altitude, and the physics bubble size. The autodeletion altitude depends on the body you are orbiting, and that body may be airless, so it does not depend on pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rule is: if any object is below the autodeletion altitude of body X, and it is also outside the physics bubble of your currently focused vessel/object then it will be autodeleted. In the flight logs, they will be listed as \u0022crashed into terrain\u0022 generally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe autodeletion altitude is not adjustable. The physics bubble size is --\u00A0at the bottom of your settings.cfg file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, on Kerbin, the autodeletion altitude is 25km and the physics bubble size in the atmosphere is also about 25km (depending on your settings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your picture, you are at 350km altitude, and even assuming the objects are directly below you, that puts their altitudes at 320 km or higher, which is way above the 25km autodeletion altitude. They will continue to fly around forever as debris, until they go below that 25km altitude on Kerbin -- or until the debris cleanup mechanism (a completely different topic) gets rid of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Caveat that I have seen a few objects fall straight through the autodeletion altitude and impact\u00A0the ground.
