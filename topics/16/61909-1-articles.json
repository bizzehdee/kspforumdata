That is the main reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Minor contribution will be the additional drag of the craft on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason you don\u0027t notice it until you reach altitude, is because the control surfaces are strong enough to keep it flying right in the thicker atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to fix it you will need to balance it and/or add more torque.

What altitude and speed is the carrier aircraft supposed to reach before releasing the payload, and where is the payload expected to go? It\u0027s possible that you can switch the RAPIERs for turbojets and save a bit of weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload has 4 tons of fuel and its mass looks like about 8 tons, so with the aerospike it has a vacuum dV of about 2650 m/s and a TWR over 2. I can usually circularize from a TWR of 1 without trouble, and I know people do it with nukes and ion engines (although that\u0027s with heavily airhogged designs). Switching the spike for two LVT-909s would get you 3070 m/s (although it might be harder to make that look good), and save 0.75 tons. Three 48-7Ss would get you 3240 m/s and save 1.4 tons. Switching the fuel tank for an FL-T400 and the engine for a nuke gets you about 3000 m/s and a TWR of JUST under 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T21:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMartian, that looks pretty sweet. I downloaded it and messed with it a little. I\u0027ve done carriers before, but they were usually like hang gliders (similar to the White Knight and Space Ship One).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, your Center of Thrust (CoT) is too low compared to your CoM. When you\u0027re designing in the SPH, make sure you set the thrust limit on the aerospike to zero. That will give you the true position of the thrust vector when using the RAPIERS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you\u0027ve done that, there\u0027s a few things you can do to align your CoT with your CoM. Here are a couple things I tried and it flew better as a carrier, but I didn\u0027t test the changes to the carrier after release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I moved the carrier\u0027s wings up slightly, then bend them back to level. This brought the CoT up some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I bent the outboard wings up some and moved the outboard RAPIERS out onto the outer wings. This moved the CoT up a bit more. This also caused me to have to move the aileron. So I replaced the big one with two small ones and put them on the inboard wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I removed the ASAS and replaced it with two inline reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I replaced the pylon with a TT-38K decoupler to get the plane closer to the carrier. This lowered the CoM a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all helped it fly a bit better. I anticipate that the carrier should still be able to fly okay on the inboard RAPIERS (disable the outboards) after release so that it can fly home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try to add some external tanks tucked up to the underside of the carrier to move the CoM down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T06:04:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the replies. I was looking for a ceiling of 20kms before delivery. Higher than that would be preferable, but not necessary. The idea is to deploy the payload and return to KSC, while the smaller craft goes into orbit and hopefully deorbit back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Claw: If I mess around with the CoT, CoM and Lift would the spaceplane itself be screwy after delivering its payload?
