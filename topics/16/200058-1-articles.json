I\u0027ve run that mission twice. All that\u0027s needed to get the rover operational is a battery to allow Bill to extend the solar panels so that they can charge the on-board batteries. Then I\u0027ve driven the rover remotely to the coordinates but the contract does not complete. So I ran it again. This time with a Command Seat so that Bill could drive the rover, thereby having a Kerbal on board the craft. Still no contract completion. The rover is not broken, it is incomplete. There are no scattered parts and everything the rover should need can be brought from Kerbin in the cargo storage container. This is what led me to the supposition that it might need a SPECIFIC part. However, outside of bringing every part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, how do I find the correct part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-03T21:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223919617\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200058\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612383343\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277446\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Graknils\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Graknils said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what led me to the supposition that it might need a SPECIFIC part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that is not listed in the contracts objectives.

It turned out that my roverVslId was correct, however, I noticed that the Way Point Name was listed as endWPName = Zone 9F34-S which is supposedly coordinates on Minmus. While searching for this contract I noticed that another rover contract ALSO had a Way Point Name listed as endWPName = Zone 9F34-S but THIS location was on the Mun. I figure these might possibly be related to the way contracts are being written, but the Devs will need to track that down. Bottom line, is that this is a known bug and we will have to wait for Squad to fix. In the interim, the only way to resolve is Cheat Menu, or edit your Persistent file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(SUGGESTION - If you choose to edit the file, make a backup first!!
