I\u0027ve got several questions, and I hope y\u0027all can help me...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E!. If I understand correctly, my Kerbonauts won\u0027t go through the docking port - if I want to move a Kerbal from my capsule to my \u0022space station\u0022 (a Hitchhiker canister with a clamp-o-tron, two solar panels and an ASAS/RCS/RCS tank attached), I need to do EVA and maneuver him from the capsule to the station, is that right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Hitchhiker looks like it has one hatch (which I covered with a clamp-o-tron on my last effort, unfortunately) - is that where I\u0027d send my Kerbonaut?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Can I stick enough ladders outside the capsule and the hitchhiker so that I don\u0027t have to make the Kerbal let go and use his RCS pack to move him? I tried that once and lost him in orbit - I had no luck at all controlling him and he just drifted off into his own orbit. It was quite sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Unrelated to EVA. I think I\u0027m missing something blindingly obvious here, but when I click on the in-capsule view for one of my Kerbonauts, how do I switch back to the regular view so I can control the ship again? I can\u0027t see any control to do that, and I know there must be one staring me in the face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it makes any difference, I\u0027m still running version 0.19.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvus2606","CreatedById":57190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T20:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 correct\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 correct\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 indeed you can\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 pressing \u0027C\u0027 again should move you back to the external camera view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T21:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t opposed to mods, Crew Manifest will make your moving/managing tasks a lot easier.
