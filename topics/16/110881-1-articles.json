The engine gimbal/thrust vector tends to \u0027fight\u0027 against aero control surfaces (fins) and reaction-wheel SAS. This goes double or triple for bendy rockets, as any or all of the aforementioned control methods will tend to produce an under-damped response to the bendy oscillations."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:13:58Z","Content":"On take-off, don\u0027t activate SAS. You only need it at high altitude (around 40km). \n\nIf you have multiple controle devices, deactivate the most powerful : reduce or cut gimball, deactivate reaction wheels, use static wings.\n\nStruts are usefull, but with new aero, they seem off-topic. Now I use the \u0022Joint Reinforcement\u0022 mod which help to reduce wobble. Big structures still wobbles but much less. No more payload wobbeling out of fairing...\n\nEDIT : also, MechJeb SAS (smart ASS) does a better job than Stock SAS."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:15:26Z","Content":"Jeb\u0027s reaction time is not great. He doesn\u0027t anticipate where he wants the rocket to point. If it\u0027s too far left he goes right, and if it\u0027s too far right he goes left. He doesn\u0027t slow down his rotation enough when approaching the desired heading. This causes terrible oscillation. Making your rocket more rigid makes it more Jeb proof."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:19:13Z","Content":"Have you tried recent dev built ?\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t fly rocket in atmo with SAS or MJ (Ascent or smart ASS).

The different vectors and impulse delays from competing controls seems to confuse it. A bendy rocket will also create waves but I find that either turning SAS off or spinning (rolling about the long axis rapidly) the rocket will help. Spinning, for whatever reason, tends to damp bendy oscillations when it doesn\u0027t make the craft break."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:41:39Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need al lot of control to get a rocket to orbit. SAS is usually overkill and cause wobble. Wobble will make you quit the 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 safe angle and loose controle of you rocket much easily. \n\nNot using SAS and \u0022fine controls\u0022 (CAPS LOCK) helps a lot.\n\nI also noticed that clamps can set you rocket off course at take-off. I don\u0027t use them anymore, even I launch a 230T payload to LKO. Big rockets are usually stable enough withour using them. \n\nPS : I don\u0027t build asparagus pans anymore as in beta 0.9. I use reusable SSTO rockets. I send payload to LKO for a 470 to 650 funds per payload ton (from 12T to 236T). I find SSTO rockets to be easier as they don\u0027t have different flight controls. they behave mostly the same up to LKO. You only have to throttle back to keep TWR to reasonable level.\n\nBut again : if you have trouble with wobble, try \u0022Joint Reinforcement\u0022 mod by Ferram4.
