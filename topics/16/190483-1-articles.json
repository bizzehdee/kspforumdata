The purple marker shows you where your thrust vector is, that\u0027s the line of force that your engines create.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor stable flight the purple marker should be directly in line behind the yellow center-of-mass marker. This is often difficult to judge because it\u0027s normal for the center-of-thrust marker to be to the distant rear of the craft. To make it easier, try lining the camera up directly behind (or in front of) the plane looking directly along the center axis of the plane. If the purple marker is above the yellow center-of-mass then it will cause a leveraging torque that is constantly forcing a downwards rotation - if the thrust marker is below the center-of-mass then it will cause a rotational force resulting in constant upwards pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of it like this. Your plane is hanging from a string that is attached to a balance point at the spot the yellow mass marker is. Your engines are trying to push the plane forward, and that force is applied to the spot where the purple thrust marker is. You want them to push from directly behind the point the plane is hanging from or else it will cause the plane to tip over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplicating things though is the center-of-lift. This is a force applied by the air you are moving through. It adds another element of force to your plane. Imagine this force as the place where your plane catches the wind. If you are moving forward, and the blue lift marker is behind your yellow mass marker then you can move forward and the air just pulls the rear of the plane further in line behind the front of the plane. If the blue lift marker is slightly above the center of mass of the plane then you get lift pulling the plane into the air - although it also creates a slight tendency to pitch upwards, but as long as you have enough control from your pitch control surfaces this is desirable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if the blue lift marker is a good deal below the center of mass of the plane then you\u0027ll find that the plane is constantly trying to turn itself upside down. Try to imagine a lever arm attached to the yellow ball the plane is hanging from, and that this lever extends to the blue ball showing you your lift point. If you thrust forward and this blue center-of-lift catches the wind, what happens? The blue ball will be pushed backwards until it is directly behind your center-of-mass, but doing this will rotate the plane up or down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best options are to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA) Adjust the placement of your engines so that the purple center-of-thrust marker is in line behind the yellow center-of-mass marker.

Space planes seem to work best for me reentering the atmosphere with a periapsis no lower than about 40 km, but since you are suborbital your trajectory would of course have to intersect the ground. This causes you to fall through the thin upper atmosphere very fast which doesn\u0027t allow you to slow down very much before you slam into the denser atmosphere at high velocity. In an effort to slow yourself down you have to try and pitch up quickly which over-stresses the connection to the wings and they fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s what I think might help. Once you are leaving the atmosphere on ascent, see if it\u0027s possible to burn more horizontally aiming for the horizon. Try not to push your apoapsis higher than about 80-90 km. Instead, focus on making your trajectory wrap around the planet as much as possible. Go long, not high. You should still have time to launch your payload since you are just trading height for distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the way back down, you will now drift for a longer period of time in the high atmosphere where you can pitch upwards or downwards, and use that drag to slow you down a lot more before you fall into the denser air. You\u0027ll have more time to bleed off speed and won\u0027t always require as much force pulling up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a tip: Don\u0027t set the wings to \u0022Rigid Attachment\u0022 in their right-click menu.
