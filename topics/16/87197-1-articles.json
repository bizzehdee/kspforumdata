Take the 1-man can and put the short box girder you start career games with on top of it, then EVA the Kerbal on the launchpad. Due to the slope of the pod\u0027s sides, the top of the helmet spawns overlapping the box girder and the Kerbal gets tossed off the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem is mostly confined to the 1-man and 3-man capsules due to their hatches being near their tops and their sides sloping in. Then you have to worry when you stack any thing on top that\u0027s not the same size as the node on the top of the pod. I\u0027ve never had this happen on a Hitchhiker, Mobile Lab, or any other pod with the hatch flat on the side and in the middle, unless I stupidly attached some other part (like a light or science instrument) too close to the top of the hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
