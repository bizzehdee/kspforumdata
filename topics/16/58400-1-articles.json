Haven\u0027t played since long before career mode was introduced. I was reading up on it and watching some videos before jumping in. I kept seeing that money/cost of parts was something new to career mode. However, I\u0027ve been building my first rocket with the few parts that I have, but I don\u0027t see a running cost anywhere, but each part does have one. Am I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Also, is an antenna required to do science/send data back, etc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
