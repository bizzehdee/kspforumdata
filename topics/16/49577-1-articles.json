In addition to that, TreeLoader had this feature where tech trees created with TreeEdit were stored online, and that framework stopped working recently. Caused a huge issue for KSP Interstellar which is absolutely dependant on a custom tech tree. Thankfully, you can also use TreeLoader without the online backend, but it\u0027s inconvenient and even more likely to bug out. Basically, the only reason anyone is still using this extremely outdated mod is because a.) there\u0027s no alternative and b.) it still works... sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then very recently, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93759-ATC-Alternative-Tree-Configurator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlternative Tree Configurator\u003C/a\u003E showed up. It does a great many things better and simpler than TreeLoader, but there is one thing it cannot do: adding additional new nodes.
