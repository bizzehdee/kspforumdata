Standing at the pole, the planet is not moving you anywhere, it\u0027s just rotating you. Standing at the equator, the planet is dragging you with the surface at about 200 m/s - quite a difference, I would say."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:42:14Z","Content":"174.53 m/s to be precise, according to the wiki, so more than a few m/s, but not so much that it drastically alters launch vehicles."},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:47:21Z","Content":"At the equator it is something like 172 m/s rounded to 200 above. You can check by changing the navball to orbital while on the launch pad.\n\nAt 45 north latitude it drops to 70% of that number. (Basic trig math. Same is true for Baikonur which is also at 45 north.)\n\nFor comparison on Earth and Kerban (Assuming 172 m/s which is going by memory.) the numbers are: \n\nEarth -- Kerban\n\nEquator: 464 m/s. -- 172 m/s\n\nKennedy Space Center (28 North): 410 m/s -- 152 m/s\n\nBaikonur (45 North): 328 m/s -- 122 m/s\n\n60 North: 232 m/s -- 86 m/s\n\nSince Kerban is a ball and it is spinning the simulator takes this effect into consideration automatically, no special coding of the physics is necessary. Taking off retrograde requires double these numbers in extra DV.\n\nP.S. I see from the post above the value is 174 m/s. I don\u0027t want to do the math again, the change is small enough really.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T19:50:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Leszek**\n  \nP.S."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T19:52:51Z","Content":"What about Minmus though?

So that would be 7 m/s at 45 north and 5 m/s at 60 north. So for all intents and purposes nothing. If your Delta V budget is that tight that it matters, I would argue you have under built your rocket. The Mun I think is less, it takes 6 days to complete a rotation, but I didn\u0027t do the math or look it up. It is not going to be much though.\n\nWhen landed on a planet or moon, just switch the navball to orbital mod and it will say what the boost is where you are."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T20:43:19Z","Content":"\u003E When landed on a planet or moon, just switch the navball to orbital mod and it will say what the boost is where you are.\n\nOh, I didn\u0027t know that\u0027s what it showed, cool."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:31:43Z","Content":"What you\u0027re talking about is listed as the Sidereal Rotational Velocity, and it\u0027s in the sidebar: [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin)\n\nThis varies with the cosine of the latitude.\n\nKerbin has the highest SRV of all the bodies you can land on.
