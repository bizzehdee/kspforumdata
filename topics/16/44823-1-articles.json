To save weight you could have a detatchable command section on the lander, that you then attach to a Laythe/Tylo descent/ascent stage. Depending on how fancy you want to get you could even use the same one with a bit of design prowess, giving it drop tanks/boosters that you take down on Laythe empty with the core stack being able to lift it to orbit there, dropping parachutes off after getting up from Laythe and then filling up the tanks for Tylo.

The tug weighs a bit more than 30 tons so this beast (about 550 tons on the Launchpad) can\u0027t QUITE get it to orbit without the tug doing the last bit of the circularization burn. However, the tug\u0027s a nuke so has beaucoup delta-V and this little bit, plus whatever it burns rendezvousing with whatever payload it\u0027s supposed to push, still leave plenty to go just about anywhere. The lifter has an RCS tank and uses RCS thrusters on the tips of tail fins combined with those on the payload to rotate once out of the atmosphere to face prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s getting there. As to what to send there, you definitely want planes to fly around on Laythe and bragging rights for Tylo will require a specialized lander. Any lander that will work on Moho will also on Vall (as well as Dres and Eeloo should you go that way while you\u0027re in the vicinity). Pol is your best bet for Kethane exploitation to fuel moving around within the Jool system and eventually leaving it, Bop being a bit too inclined to be economical that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T19:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny lander that will work on Moho will also on Vall (as well as Dres and Eeloo should you go that way while you\u0027re in the vicinity).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny lander that works on Moho will work everywhere but Tylo, Laythe, and Eve (you could overbuild it for Duna with chutes and possibly have it work on Kerbin, and it won\u0027t land on Kerbol or Jool ofc, but anyway...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen figuring your trip\u0027s delta-V budget be sure to include transfers to the moons from wherever you plan to start in the Joolian system.

I\u0027ll try to post pics later, but my original plan was to assemble a massive carrier spacecraft/tanker, and haul enough gear to Jool to make a landing and return off the surface of every moon, then return home, taking EVERYTHING back with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me a month or two to develop the individual spacecraft. These were what I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow gravity nuclear rover- utilizes two NTR engines (NTR engines ARE in fact the BEST lander engine in low gravity environments, where the poor TWR of the nuclear engines does not matter nearly as much). It combines a lander and rover into a single craft. It is capable of landing and returning from the surface of every body except probably Kerbin, Tylo, Eve, Laythe, and Jool of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo Lander- uses some KW rocketry light and efficient engines to create a high TWR (1.8 TWR when fully fueled; TWR \u0026gt; 5 when near empty) lander with \u0026gt; 6000 delta V. I think it was 6200 but I can\u0027t remember exactly. It is capable of SSTO operation on Kerbin and Laythe, and can actually land and return from the surface of Laythe if modified with parachutes (however, very few flat spots exist for it to land on on Laythe). LACKS RCS, it is entirely dependent on the tug spacecraft (see below) to ferry it around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall VTOL space plane-uses some of the VTOL jet engines from (B9?), it\u0027s SSTO on Kerbin and of course Laythe. Be careful not to abuse the VTOL engines, they are very unrealistic (they can operate at like 40km\u002B altitude, and you can use nothing but the VTOL jet engines to get you up to Kerbin escape velocity), so unless you like to basically cheat, don\u0027t put too many of them on your space plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge Tug - simply a large NTR tug to ferry around the various craft to the different bodies in the Jool system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, all this stuff was to be hauled with a massive 1000\u002B ton carrier ship, basically a bunch of fuel tanks with docking ports, nuclear engines, and habitation modules attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWHAT PREVENTED my master plan from taking place was incredible lag. I can create all the individual spacecraft, but I cannot mate them all up to a single carrier ship or the game basically stops running. Also, the very complex ships are EXTREMELY vulnerable to Kraken attack. This is what happened to my first attempt to send a carrier ship with a lot of spacecraft attached- it just randomly started exploding!:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vgpVWSD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vgpVWSD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I\u0027m in the process of sending multiple carrier ships. I made my carrier ships very easy to assemble in orbit (1500 ton vessels, assembly takes two launches, fueling takes 1-2 additional launches, then however many launches are required to put up any vessels the carrier ships will take with them). Anyway, that saves me time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up having to make a huge heavy lift rocket capable of lifting 800\u002B ton segments of the carrier ships into orbit so that I could quickly and easily build the carrier ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an early version of a carrier ship, carrying two of the nuclear rovers, two of the Tylo landers (modified with parachutes), and two of the large tugs.

They have a delta V of around 13,000 m/s (it takes like 3000 m/s delta V to get from HKO to HJO, assuming you use aerocapture). But, the bigger carrier ships I am building now actually have the same or smaller part counts, thanks to that wonderful Ubio welding mod. Anyway, there is nothing really clever about them, they are just giant gas bags with engines, a bunch of docking ports, some smoke and lights, and some habitation modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPEAKING OF AEROCAPTURE!!!! BE CAREFUL AROUND JOOL! Due to bugs, it will often cause your ship lose parts when you depart its atmosphere after an areocapture/areobrake maneuver. What I did to counteract it was, after the bug damaged my ship, I would restore my ship to the state it was before the aerobrake using manual editing of the save file!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I guess an interesting challenge I could pursue next would be to try out the deadly re-entry mod... I\u0027d probably have to put some huge heat shields on the carrier ships, and probably some giant fins/wings to keep them going straight in atmospheres... assuming fins/wings don\u0027t burn off in deadly re-entry?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T22:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T22:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI designed mission that landed on all five Joolian moons and docked back at my station in LKO with about 3,000 m/s to spare.

Due to a spot of luck and Tylo\u0027s huge SOI to semi-axis ratio the mothership is due to enter Tylo SOI on the first pass. At this point the Tylo lander (the big one connected to the nose docking port) undocks from the mothership and manoeuvres into position for Tylo orbit insertion burn, while the mothership manoeuvres away so it dodges Tylo SOI for another pass through Jools atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Tylo lander enters Tylo orbit and performs deorbit burn to land on its surface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Mothership minus one lander makes a second aerobraking pass through Jool\u0027s atmosphere and end up with apapsis around Laythe orbit. My luck wasn\u0027t that good so I didn\u0027t get encounter on first orbit. At apapsis mothership fires engine to raise the periapsis out of Jool\u0027s atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Several orbits later mothership gets a Laythe encounter and adjusts orbit for aerocapture pass through Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. After several pass it settles down into a 80km Low Laythe Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Laythe lander (the one on the port docking arm with the parachutes) undocks from the mothership and makes a deorbit burn to land on Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. When the transfer window comes up, the Bop lader (the one on the starboard docking arm) undocks from the mothership and perform a moon-to-moon transfer to Bop for landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. After having explored Laythe, the Laythe lander ejects the atmosphere landing kit and takes off back into LLO to dock with the mothership and refuels. Having refuelled it then makes a moon-to-moon transfer to Vall for landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. After refuelling the Laythe lander, mothership makes a trans-Jool injection back to Jool, performs a few aerobraking pass again to settle down into Low Jool Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. The three landers take off from Bop, Tylo and Vall and all perform trans-Jool injection back to Jool, aerobrake using the atmosphere and then dock back with the mothership\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. With the fleet reassembled mothership fires its engines for transfer home back to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen planning a mission of this kind there are a few obvious choices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027re going to want to use aerocapture/aerobraking as much as possible. So you\u0027re going to want to first use Jool to slow down and get into some kind of elliptical Jool orbit, disgorge as many lander as you can so they go off on their own (saving fuel that would otherwise be used for moon-to-moon transfer or injection burn by reusing delta-V from interplanetary transfer). Generally this means at the minimum the Tylo lander since Tylo encounter is so common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you\u0027re slowed down a bit you probably want to head to Laythe. Going from elliptical Jool orbit to Laythe orbit is almost free since you get to aerocapture again at Laythe. Parking the mothership at Laythe instead of Jool allows you to use the mothership tanks to refuel the Laythe lander, thus making it very easy to design this particular lander for double landing. Moon-to-moon transfer from LLO is also less expensive in terms of delta-V compared to trans-moon-injection from LJO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. For Bop and Pol, the landing requirement is very similar as both are low gravity worlds. You can get away with a very small lander for those worlds. On the other hand you need a lot of delta-V going out to them due to their wide and inclined orbit, doubly so if you are tempted to attempt both landing with the same small lander. This then calls for a powerful nuclear tug stage with a lot of delta-V for moving that lander around. Logically you want to design it so the these two parts are two separate crafts that can be assembled together. as required. Take my Gilly lander for inspiration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://103.imagebam.com/download/PZRidsFI8w5ioFrDsgjYow/25596/255950423/screenshot1170.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1170.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://104.imagebam.com/download/lmlnvc98aBx7WrjcOFzmdw/25596/255950622/screenshot1330.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1330.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Tylo lander design will be critical to the mission since it\u0027s going to be by far the biggest lander. If you like me and you consider it too \u0022gamey\u0022 to have a command chair only lander for the whole Tylo lander you could still save weight by breaking down the lander into three pieces:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eorbital module that will remain in Tylo orbit for the crew to come back, contains habitation and is only responsible for bringing the crew back to the mothership after taking off from Tylo\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Epowerful descent stage with habitation for the crew to live in while they\u0027re on the surface\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Etiny ascent stage using command chairs that will bring the crew back\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERational being since the crew is only going to be in the ascent stage for a few hours at best it doesn\u0027t really need to be a pressurised spacecraft\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T09:00:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 09:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T00:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just started building for my Jool Mission.
