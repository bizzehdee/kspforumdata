While sitting on the surface of Mun, think about where Kerbin is located. If you are on the \u0027face\u0027 of Mun, Kerbin should be somewhere in the sky. In this case, you should go east-ish. Conversely, if you are on the \u0027back\u0027 and Kerbin is not visible, go west-ish.

As a rule of thumb, this seems to be the case at a TWR (thrust-weight ratio) of roughly 2:1. So far, I didn\\\u0027t manage to build a Mun-capable rocket with a TWR coming even CLOSE to 2:1 (mine usually have a TWR of about 1.2:1 to 1.4:1). So I guess as long as your rockets are \u0027too heavy\u0027 to be near 2:1, full throttle it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EORBITAL INSERTION\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no absolute answer to this, it depends on too many variables. It IS in general more efficient to keep the engines on and on full throttle (at least as soon as atmospheric drag is no issue anymore) due to the law of conservation of momentum, but that may not be in your interest since it might burn fuel to get where you don\\\u0027t want to go (e.g. it would lead to a high Apogee opposite of your intended flight direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy usual approach is to cut the engines when my apogee is high enough to stay out of the atmosphere even after I leave it (as long as you\\\u0027re in the atmosphere, your apogee will fall due to drag loss) AND I\\\u0027m certain I will have enough thrust to keep the AP ahead of me when I turn them back on. Hence I tend to bank rather early in the flight and get to a mostly horizontal thrust well before leaving the atmosphere (usually I have about 2200 m/s when my engines get turned off, most of it horizontal movement).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EORBITING\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is modeled that way and yes, you need less fuel orbiting towards 90\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOHMANN TRANS MUNAR INJECTION\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027fact\u0027 that you burn at rising/setting Mun is due to how fast the Mun revolves around Kerbin and how far away it is from Kerbin. I\\\u0027d guess the game was built that way to make the trip there easier. Personally, I burn based on the overview map, because then it is (mostly) independent of my actual altitude when initiating the TMI. I burn when I fit the Mun in the fully tilted orbital map right into the upper right corner of my screen (at the correct zoom), with Kerbin as the target and my craft right \u0027below\u0027 Kerbin on the overview map. That puts me a bit ahead of Kerbin, despite aiming for an Apogee that\\\u0027s a bit short of the Mun orbit. I guess it\\\u0027s about the least fuel consuming option I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is simple: Your Apogee will be opposite to where you initiate the TMI. Since your previous Ap/Pe pair was insignificant compared to the target Apogee (about 70km vs. 11.000), you WILL be at Perigee when you shut the engines off. In other words, you will fly towards wherever your opposite end of the orbit is pointing. Add that the trip to the Mun takes approximately 1/6 to 1/4 of a Munar orbit around Kerbin and you know why you burn at Munrise/Munset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMUNAR LANDING\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I get into a Munar orbit first. It\\\u0027s not necessarily a stable orbit, more a result of the way I get there. First I install a Perigee of about 5-10km, then at that perigee I bring down the Apogee (which then turns into the Perigee, of course) to the ground a bit behind my intended target area. That usually gets me in position for landing at about 2000 meters. There I do a burn to kill lateral speed, put my rocket upright, zero the lateral speed with RCS and then, well, land. Personally I think there is no easier way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELEAVING THE MUN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy as pie. Start, bank towards 90\u00C2\u00B0 and get into an orbit. Altitude doesn\\\u0027t really matter, just keep it low to conserve fuel. Keep an eye on the overview map, it\\\u0027s VERY easy on the Mun to suddenly end up with an Apogee of 20\u002B km and you don\\\u0027t know where it came from. Just put enough thrust into it to get an Apogee that\\\u0027s a bit ahead of you, switch to the overview map and keep that AP ahead of you a few meters until you have a more or less stable orbit. Then wait until you reach the \u0027orbit line\u0027 of the Mun around Kerbin on the \u0027front\u0027 of the Mun (i.e. the side the Mun is going to. It\\\u0027s where your flight indicator points towards Kerbin. There, throttle up to about 900m/s. Yes, that results in an escape trajectory from the Mun that points to the \u0027left\u0027 of Kerbin. No problem there. You see, as we move, and Kerbin does, it will catch us. You will end up in a very elliptical orbit, but that\\\u0027s no biggie. Now, depending on how much fuel you have left, either lower your Apogee a little to enable a smooth landing or, if you\\\u0027re low on fuel, wait until you\\\u0027re at Apogee and lower the Perigee down to Kerbin\\\u0027s ground (or at least about 30km above, give or take depending on your Apogee, the higher the Apogee, the lower you\\\u0027d have to get the Perigee unless you don\\\u0027t mind taking another round around the marble).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that in \u0027reality\u0027 you would want to get a low Apogee to ensure a smooth reentry.
