Complexity of rocket didn\u0027t matter. Asparagus didn\u0027t matter. So long as there were only rocket nozzles on the ship, they marched together towards zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed while launching a massive Jool-5 drive section the other day (10 orange tanks) that at the end of the launch, I had significantly more fuel left than oxidizer. I switched it to 4-sym (20 tanks) and watched in fascination as some tanks ran dry of oxidizer and the ship went into a spin. When I finally managed to make orbit, I had something like 200 units of oxidizer left and 4000 fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disproportionate consumption seems to be essentially symmetrical. My spin was caused by the slight timing differences in when the rockets kicked out, but honestly we\u0027re talking fractions of % here which I put down as floating point errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a 20-orange tank assembly with 20 skippers. It drains fuel to the skippers from the main tanks. It is designed to hit 120 KM aP, then I transfer around fuel, blow off the skippers, and use the 20 LV-N\u0027s to circularize with basically no fuel left. Then I send hundreds of refuel missions. The point is, up until the last 2 launches, which are the first 2 I have done in 23.5, I have never seen the fuel and oxidizer ratio get out of balance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan supply pix if needed but this is a more basic question. Did I miss a change? (Also what\u0027s up with the auto-correct stubbornly changing the word \u0022ratio\u0022 to \u0022ration\u0022?
