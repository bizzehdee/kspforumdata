I have spent the last 2\u002B months watching my giant spaceplanes which were designed to be SSTL (without any refueling stops) get to altitude hdeath (where hdeath = 20,000m \u002B the square root of the log of the effort that I put into improvement of the design) before careening into oblivion. I must have killed poor Gus 100 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I caved and decided that it was morally OK to stop in at a gas station in LKO and refuel the beastie before heading out to Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I spent, dunno, 10 minutes (?), building a massive fueling station in the VAB, launched it, wound up with about 3 SSTL\u0027s worth of fuel (yes, that is a unit, look it up) in orbit with plenty of docking bits and such for easy refueling. 0.23.5 parts make that a breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlipped back to Gus (one has to wonder why he keeps climbing into these things) on the runway, realized that I should oughta put some kind of docking port thingy onto the front of the plane (plus some mono and those wee RCS things), so I went back to the SPH, moved a couple of bits around, and headed out. I figured while I was at it, I would try to optimize my ascent path a bit more. So I spent a little bit more effort than usual keeping my pitch balanced by moving fuel around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpshot - here I am in 100 km LKO with 8000 dV left, prior to the visit to the refueling station.

They are full of fuel and I suspect are only feeding the rams - that\u0027s why the MJ calculator has decided to split up the dV calcs. Usually there is only one line showing total dV and it changes dramatically depending upon which engines you have engaged. It\u0027s too late for an easy test because I have begun to refuel after a rather eventful docking procedure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for not commenting on the... slapdash design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T22:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James_Eh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022James_Eh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for not commenting on the... slapdash design.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hardly one to criticize, most of my spaceplanes end up closely resembling a pile of parts spread around the apron at the end of the runway.

Anyway, Ritier is safely off to Jool, now I want to fiddle with a smaller plane and the suggestions above about optimizing the ramjet performance. I\u0027ve always viewed that as a derivative of everything else I am doing, not as a control variable. I feel a bunch of backflips into the VAB coming up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
