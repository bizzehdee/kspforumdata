By \u0022directly in\u0022 do you mean that you\u0027re hitting atmo without orbiting first? If so, try burning 90 degrees away from prograde to the east or west, and watch how your path changes. It should round into a loop around the planet. Note that this may waste fuel, if your intention is to land on the planet anyway. Also, I\u0027m not suggesting this as a precise technique. I\u0027m just pointing out that there are burns you can make to alter your trajectory into an orbit.

It is how fast you need to go to break out of orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom an encounter trajectory you are in almost all cases going much faster than the targets escape velocity. So your trajectory will be a gravity slingshot, where you may get near the planet/moon, but only end up getting pulled by the body and sent in a new direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo orbit a body you must slow down enough for that gravity pull to form an orbit. If there is an atmosphere you can do it for free -- until we get atmosphere/heat physics. Absent an atmosphere you will have to burn retrograde ideally at the closest point to the target and turn your gravity slingshot into an orbit/capture by getting your speed below escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T20:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol...

From there you can use warp until an encounter with the target appears, or you can adjust your orbit out more and hope you have enough fuel. I could explain it better with images, but not enough time or motivation to get those right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really were looking for ways to get into orbit from being already inside the SoI, gonna need even more luck, fuel, or math to get the moon in exactly the right spot during your approach, or rely on air braking. Really, unless you want to do a lot of math I recommend just overbuilding your spacecraft a little so you have enough fuel that you don\u0027t need to get the exact least quantity of fuel possible. It is impossible to actually enter orbit with just air braking though, no matter how you try it your periapsis will always be in the atmosphere at the end, causing your orbit to degrade over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-03T20:29:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2012 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by kamilDrakari\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-03T20:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts not that hard to hit a moon of a planet several days out on interplanetary approach.
