It\u0027s what I usually do, because direct landings are a bit hit and miss. Get them wrong and you\u0027ll \u0022land\u0022 at 500m/s. You also get to check your fuel later to see if you can make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off: Your altitude is a little high for an efficient mission. Generally I try to circularise at 125km or under to save fuel. No big deal though, as long as you\u0027ve still got enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to do now:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Wait until the mun \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Erises over\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Esets under\u003C/strong\u003E the horizon of kerbin. (Thank you Pyre)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Point the craft prograde, switch to map view, Immediately burn until your apoapsis is at about the right height. Some time before this, the patched conics SHOULD show you entering the Mun\u0027s SOI. If it doesn\u0027t, just shut off the engine and timewarp until the mun comes into the right position a billion orbits later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Warp until you get captured by the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Finetune your path according to the orbit you want. A 50km holding orbit is an OK place to start, and requires a 50km (or so) periapsis. A 10km orbit makes landing extremely easy, but you don\u0027t get to use timewarp past about X10. My standard holding altitude is between 10 and 12 kilometres for an equatorial orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. When you get to your desired altitude at periapsis, circularise. You should still be using your main rocket for this, rather than your lander, although that depends on the spacecraft design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Congratulations. You\u0027re now in orbit around the Mun. If you have a lander with enough fuel, you\u0027ll want to attempt a descent. On the light side, so you can see the shadow of the lander at low altitude and know when you\u0027re about to touchdown. Otherwise, you can return to Kerbin by orbiting until the planet rises above the horizon, then burning while pointing to prograde. That will eventually put you on either an elliptical orbit or a direct return trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Landing is fairly simple. Use ASAS to keep steady (or a lot of button mashing) on retrograde the whole way down, and make sure you end up going straight down. Don\u0027t let your speed get too low before you\u0027re at low altitude: 30-50m/s is my general approach speed between 1 and 2 KM up, higher than that you just want to be going slow enough you can quickly get to a safe speed when you need to (so, 80-100m/s). About 500-1000m above the surface (NOT 500-1000 on the altimeter) reduce speed down to 30m/s or so, check you\u0027re going straight down....and aim to slow your speed down in the last 50-100m, slow to under 10m/s, with no horizontal component. Try not to land on steep slopes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. To get back, take off, head east into a low altitude orbit as soon as you can. Use the same \u0022burn prograde when the planet rises\u0022 trick to get back on a return path, or into an orbit where it\u0027s easy to return from. If the planet rises while you\u0027re getting INTO orbit, just keep burning and you should get there in one burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that flying below 10km over the Mun at orbital speeds makes for some nice landings (and lets you see the surface details that higher orbits do not), but is risky due to terrain clearance (especially since you will not have a perfectly equatorial orbit without extra correction burns).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-13T00:45:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2012 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Fendleton\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyre","CreatedById":20921,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T00:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour orbit looks circular enough that where you do your injection burn shouldn\u0027t matter too much, however, I noticed that your prograde heading is 270 degrees.
