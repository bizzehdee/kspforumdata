I have a few low-mass tugs for use on small things (gets things decently into place), and I recently put into orbit a pair of tugs with claws on their sides for use in pairing up and grabbing more massive payloads. However, I tried using this pair on my 500t fuel depot, and, lo and behold, my acceleration is near zero. There\u0027s no feasible way I would be able to dock this thing - I can\u0027t close the distance faster than they would drift apart due to orbital distances (right now, my game is paused with my space station ~500m away).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the craft file for my half-tugs (they are identical):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50345936/Half-Tug.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50345936/Half-Tug.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve tried using Vernor engines, but they tend to increase part count to the point where the lag fest is ridiculous, and they also don\u0027t seem to be particularly effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this is an intractable problem - are there any good ways to make massive payloads maneuverable?

MechJeb is awesome, particularly SmartASS. It makes cancelling relative velocity with the target really easy. Don\u0027t use the automatic docking or the RCS balancer thing - it will use way too much monoprop. Have each craft target the other craft\u0027s docking port, \u0022control from here\u0022, and then have each craft point at the other using SmartASS. Use a tiny burst from the main engine (thrust limit the engine before trying this if you need to) to close at 0.3 m/s or so. As long as you have good enough reaction wheels, you can still be a little bit off and dock. Each ship will pirouette around the other, and should still connect.
