Right now I go to each engine and manually change the value of each one ... tedious, to say the least. Even when I make sure symmetry is enabled, it seems I have to visit each one separately. What I\u0027d like to do is find a way of using an AG to modify the thrust limit, and have it apply to all associated engines.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-02T20:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes. I often bind it to an axis custom group but wheel throttle and wheel steer also works just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-02T20:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can do this by using the \u0022Axis Groups\u0022 which work similar to action groups and can be configured in the same menu but they allow you to control \u0022sliders\u0022 like the thrust limiter of engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to define control keys for these axis groups in the input settings first, by default they are set to \u0022none\u0022. For example, I like to use \u0022Page up/down\u0022 to increment/decrement my axis group 1. In the game, you can then add the \u0022thrust limiter\u0022 of one or more engines to the axis group 1 and then use page up/down to increase or decrease the thrust of the engines all at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog59","CreatedById":205063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-02T21:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent ... I remember that I saw Axis Groups when I first started using AG\u0027s, but then they \u0027disappeared\u0027 from my attention over time. I\u0027ll give them a try. Much obliged!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
