simply accept based on your own experience that they are inadequate to the task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of these two missions in the campaign is to show both the basics of how to fly and the advantage of staged rocket designs. \u00A0You\u0027re meant to keep a full fuel load for each but if you wish, you may turn down the thrust limiter to keep the thrust-to-weight ratio at about 2. \u00A0For your first rocket with just the Stayputnik and the RT-10, the mass is 3.61 tonnes. \u00A0The weight on Kerbin\u0027s surface is therefore 3.61 * 9.81 (this is the acceleration due to gravity at the surface) = 35.414 kilonewtons, or kN. \u00A0The thrust of the RT-10 at sea level is 197.90 kN, so the full thrust-to-weight is 197.90 / 35.414, or approximately 5.59. \u00A0To start\u00A0with a thrust-to-weight ratio at around 2--and do keep in mind that this will change with altitude (gravitational acceleration decreases as you go higher), with air pressure (thrust increases as air gets thinner), and with the rocket\u0027s mass (weight decreases as you throw propellant out the back)--turn down the thrust limiter to about 36%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the second rocket, the idea is that you take your first rocket (or something close to it) and add a decoupler and second RT-10. \u00A0Since you\u0027ll be higher up when you light it, you may want to consider turning down the thrust limiter on the second stage (the original part of the rocket) even further, to about 30%, but for the first stage, the second RT-10 and decoupler add another 3.61 tonnes. \u00A0Forgetting the battery and parachute for now, the weight is 70.828 kN, but the thrust is the same, so the new thrust-to-weight ratio is 2.79. \u00A0To turn it down to 2, set the thrust limiter to 72% on the lower booster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reasons for turning down the thrust are several.\u00A0 First, you have fewer drag problems in the lower atmosphere, whether they come from heating or from the air tearing off pieces of your rocket. \u00A0Second, the rocket is easier to control if the high relative wind speed is not forcing it into a particular orientation--efficient rockets need to turn. \u00A0Third, it is inefficient to burn so much fuel so low in the atmosphere; all rockets perform better in vacuum than they do at sea level, so while it is important to get out of the lowest part of the atmosphere quickly, there is also a diminishing return where you burn the fuel that you would otherwise save to make it happen faster than necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you will see for having done this is that turning down the thrust limiter makes your rocket go higher on the same load of fuel (to a point).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the second mission, the idea is that your first stage will not go so high as your earlier rocket\u00A0(because it\u0027s heavier), but because you have a second stage, you\u0027ll go far higher than you would any other way. \u00A0If you want to test this more thoroughly, you can do so with a rocket that uses\u00A0two RT-10 boosters side-by-side and another that has them staged in sequence. \u00A0I will leave the problem of designing a balanced twin-booster rocket to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. \u00A0I will say that inasmuch as this campaign is meant to re-enact historical space flight, you\u0027ve done especially well: \u00A0your second rocket is your very own\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Redstone_1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFour-Inch Flight\u003C/a\u003E!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S. \u00A0Don\u0027t try to save money with solid rocket boosters. \u00A0They\u0027re already the cheapest rockets in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-04T17:03:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2017 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-13T04:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223139889\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164031\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221501865548\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zhetaan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/4/2017 at 9:52 AM, Zhetaan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.P.S. \u00A0Don\u0027t try to save money with solid rocket boosters. \u00A0They\u0027re already the cheapest rockets in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLol challenge accepted!
