This isn\u0027t a fairing issue. This is a payload issue. The thing you are trying to launch just isn\u0027t stable enough. The game borks out on you not because there\u0027s a fairing, but because the thing inside the fairing is clipping through it as it wobbles, causing all sorts of unintended effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might not like it, but you\u0027ll have to redesign that craft. The easiest solution I can see is splitting it in two: you launch the main craft first, with a docking port in place where the wing cluster should connect. Then you launch the wing cluster separately and dock it in Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-12T08:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few options come to mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E says; Launch in sections and assemble in orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild in orbit with a mod like ExtraPlanetaryLaunchpads.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t try to lift your entire Eve launcher.
