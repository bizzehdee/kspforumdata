I wanted to go and visit it by rover. I\u0027ve tried a few times with more than one rover, but everytime, there seems to be a bump that miraculosly flips and destroys the rover. It\u0027s almost like a huge wall or speed-bump. Does this happen to anyone else?

No physics warp whatsoever, its literally just as Mr.Rocket describes, for some reason it just suddenly flips with considerable force, almost like the terrain altitude is slightly different at the edge of the KSC zone. So far I\u0027ve encountered this issue approaching KSC\u0027s Northern and Western edges. Using Rovemax M1 wheels within their described limits. Even if you can fly over it, the game is in Alpha and solving these bugs makes for a better end product. Best guess is its not user error, probably a glitch (might only occur while using the Rovemax M1\u0027s? will test further...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T21:44:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve encountered this too. i don\u0027t remember what my terrain settings were on. i\u0027ve switched between high and low so many times (just messing with settings to see different effects). but yes. the first time i found it one of my kerbals died right beside the monument. but after a second attempt and going really really slow i got close enough to plant a flag. i\u0027ve found it other places on kerbin too. haven\u0027t really noticed it on other bodies. except the sink holes. the wheels/legs just disappear below the ground and attempting to move causes explosion. lol it seems anywhere the terrain has a seam in it causes crazy things to happen with rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
