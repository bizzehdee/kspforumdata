Use \u0022control from here\u0022 on lander\u0027s OKTO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. decouple the rover from the lander and land the rover next to the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. change control back to lander and EVA the kerbonaut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. go with the kerbonaut to the rover, drive with it on the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. drive back to the lander, board, and fly back home\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps 1-4 work fine and as intended. However, I am unable to change controls back to the lander/kerbonaut (step 5), after I have landed the rover. Maybe this is not how it is supposed to do it. But if so, how else can I accomplish this manouver?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/ThmCMF0\u0022 alt=\u0022ThmCMF0\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThinkOutsideTheHangar","CreatedById":100722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T02:21:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to map view, and right click the lander so you can switch to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"treesniper12","CreatedById":71673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T02:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse [ and ] for objects within render range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T03:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022treesniper12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022treesniper12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUse [ and ] for objects within render range.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the above if you are within 2.5 km.
