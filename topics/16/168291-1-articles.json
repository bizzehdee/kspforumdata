the satellites are spaced 120\u00B0 apart with respect to the planet--the triangle is equilateral and the angles between the three satellites is 60\u00B0.\u00A0 This makes an arrangement where, because of some interesting mathematics, the end result is that the altitude (in km) of the satellites must be no greater than the antenna\u0027s range divided by the square root of 12, minus 600:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAltitude\u00A0\u2264 (r /\u00A0\u221A12) - 600\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhere\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Er\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is the antenna\u0027s maximum range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe altitude must be no less than twice the effective planetary radius minus the actual planetary radius (if you set the occlusion value in CommNet to 1.0, this equals Kerbin\u0027s radius of 600 km, but it can be changed):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAltitude\u00A0\u2265 2P\u003Csub\u003Er\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0- 600\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhere P\u003Csub\u003Er\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0is the effective planetary radius (for Kerbin, it\u0027s 600 km times the atmospheric occlusion multiplier you set in the CommNet difficulty settings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 600 accounts for the radius of Kerbin.\u00A0 The rest follows from the 1, 2,\u00A0\u221A3 triple for a 30\u00B0, 60\u00B0, 90\u00B0 right triangle.\u00A0 The minimum altitude calculation is necessary because, while the satellites may be in a stable orbit, the lines of communication that connect them necessarily dip through lower altitudes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a 4-sat constellation, the satellites are spaced 90\u00B0 apart.\u00A0 In this case, the satellites must be placed at an altitude such

your constellation.\u00A0 Once you have that altitude, it is actually sufficient to get only approximately close--the trick to orbital synchronicity is not orbital altitude, but orbital\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eperiod\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 So long as the orbital periods are identical, the satellites won\u0027t drift.\u00A0 The problem is that KSP uses floating-point maths, and that leads it to make rounding errors that build up over time to alter the orbital period and thus the spacing.\u00A0 My solution is to get the satellites to agree on an orbital period, hopefully within a tenth of a second (this requires\u00A0Kerbal Engineer Redux or equivalent, thrust limiters, and tiny engines), switch views to something else, set the correct values in the persistence, and then never focus on the satellites again so as to keep them on-rails and immune to orbital recalculation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, for an evenly-spaced constellation, you\u0027ll need to do a couple of additional things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get the correct spacing, you need to phase your orbits.\u00A0 This is generally easier to do with one launch (set the launch vehicle to orbit at 4/3 or 5/4 of the target orbital period and release satellites at every periapsis; the released satellites then burn for the correct final orbit) but it certainly can be done with multiple launches, provided you have an informative mod such as Kerbal Engineer Redux that can tell you the phase angle and are willing to calculate the needed adjustments to set up such irregularities as, for example, a\u00A0478/360 phasing orbit if you want to get things\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ejust so\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 To get phasing with a 4/3 orbit (for a 3-sat constellation), set the semimajor axis to 1.2114 times the target orbit semimajor axis.\u00A0 This requires you to make the adjustment using only the apoapsis--you want the periapsis to remain at the intended final orbit.\u00A0 To get phasing for a 5/4 orbit (for a 4-sat constellation), set the semimajor axis to 1.1604 times the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get \u003Cem\u003Estable\u003C/em\u003E spacing, however, you need to get the target orbital period as exactly as possible.\u00A0 Orbital periods relate to the semimajor axes of the orbits:\u00A0 specifically, the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis, and the proportion is constant for a given primary (Kerbin in this case), so while you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0calculate the exact orbital period in seconds, you can do an equivalent job just by setting the semimajor axes equal to one another.\u00A0 Since the semimajor axis is equivalent to the radius for a circular orbit, it\u0027s easier to calculate when you have a circular orbit, but it is generally easier to establish with an elliptical orbit.\u00A0 So long as your apsides don\u0027t fall outside of the maximum and minimum altitudes, you\u0027ll stay connected even though the total satellite coverage at the outer extremes will pulse periodically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve picked a good test of both piloting and navigational skill, but make no mistake:\u00A0 KSP has some very specific limitations to what it can do because of the nature of the simulation and the amount of computing power it has available.\u00A0 The best overall solution is to get your constellation in the sky so you don\u0027t have to worry about controlling probes, and once you have a constellation that will stay reasonably functional for a year or so, simply make certain that you put a relay on everything else that you put in the sky.\u00A0 Eventually, you\u0027ll have enough of them that it won\u0027t matter what the spacing is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime

just put 3 satellites in an equilateral triangle around the equator.\u00A0 Easy way to get them equally spaced is to just launch them 2 hours apart.\u00A0 (Why two hours?\u00A0 Because Kerbin rotates once per 6 hours, so 2 hours = 1/3 of a rotation and the satellites will be 120 degrees apart.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy usual pattern in a career game (where I have the same comm settings
