When my velocity vector (the little yellow dohickey) finally reached zero, I lifted the nose to keep myself from falling down again. Eventually, as I neared orbital speeds, I found that I needed less effort to keep my velocity from dropping downwards again, so I gradually reduced attitude to maintain a level flight direction. When my attitude hit zero (signifying I didn\u0027t need to \u0027hold\u0027 myself up anymore), I throttled back and coasted through a full (elliptical) orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I went and looked up actual orbital speeds for Kearth, and now my orbits are much rounder. My present casual technique for achieving low orbits is largely the same, but now I have a target speed that I shoot for during the final phase (generally 2350something). But I never stop steering the ship to where I want it (i.e. flying level, at target-speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it makes it easier if you know how to handle a ship in a vacuum (i.e. start AND stop a rotation), and also the CommandPod\u0027s SAS (damping-only) is useful for learning this precision-steering. I actually DO NOT recommend putting SAS modules anywhere but in your first stage, as they tend to lock your heading in and you have to continuously toggle them on and off to turn (thus losing their damping effect).

(Apogee varied depending on mission profile, but perigee was generally around 60 miles.) The OMS-2 burn at apogee was required to circularize even on the direct-insertion profile.
