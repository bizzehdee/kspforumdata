The result is that you can attatch a part to only 1 other part.

Use struts to brace. For asparagus, this bracing pattern works quite well;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PPeWgVW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PPeWgVW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a ring of SRBs, this pattern works with no bracing needed across the decoupler. It appears that decouplers are strong enough so long as there is no twisting forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o2gytqU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o2gytqU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
