What a great game! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a question. In sandbox mode I was using protractor to calculate my phase angles for departure. Protractor does not seem to work with career mode. I found the website that calculates the needed angles. I have been placing a plastic protractor against the monitor, but it is kind of a sloppy way of measurement. Is there an accurate way to measure these angles in-game without using mods? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T12:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis site\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027d recommend giving it a look in case it\u0027s not one you\u0027ve used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for measuring the exact angles, no there isn\u0027t any way ingame without mods. The site I linked will give you the specific date/time for when to do your burns (as the KSP universe is on rails you can calculate planet positions in advance), I usually just eyeball my burn locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne trick to use with the aforementioned site is to timewarp to the day you want to launch, set a manouver node and drag the prograde burn marker until you have the exact same delta-v count you need for your ejection burn, then click and drag your manouver node around your orbit until it either gives you the planet encounter you want, or at least a close encounter that you can then tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T13:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the site Johnno gave you which is excellent and especially for planet on excentric/inclined orbit as you can get the optimal launch dates, you might like kerbal alarm clock, which can either gives you launch windows (works great for planets on the ecliptic) or let you to warp till a certain date you get from the launch window planner website.

Set up a maneuver node for it to just escape Kerbin, then another maneuver to transfer to desired planet\u0027s orbit. By rotating the second node i around the Kerbol orbit I find the position for intercept. The angle between the node and destination planet is (roughly) the phase angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need some experience to do transfers like that but its quite natural. And also that way you can plan more complicated transfers that require more than one burn, like bi-elliptic etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grump99","CreatedById":85328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T00:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iansoreta","CreatedById":23122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T14:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merlinux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merlinux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn addition to the site Johnno gave you which is excellent and especially for planet on excentric/inclined orbit as you can get the optimal launch dates, you might like kerbal alarm clock, which can either gives you launch windows (works great for planets on the ecliptic) or let you to warp till a certain date you get from the launch window planner website.
