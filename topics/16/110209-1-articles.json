The only place where it could screw up is when you dock with the ISRU tanker, which is launched before the contract. Not sure whether this will contaminate your SSTO with the old ID (so that after docking it might be recognized as old) - I\u0027m just suspecting. No evidence for either side. I guess it should be fine, but I\u0027m not confident myself (and didn\u0027t get a chance yet to have a try)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T11:46:40Z","Content":"Funny how you only think about something when questioned about it ... I have no clue how the game decides if the ore is from Minmus - worst case: it wants you to build a whole new rig, in which case the contract is description might be misleading. Maybe the designer had in mind to first send the player to build a base and later to have him add a mining rig and return some ore (in a tank that was launched at the same time)."},{"CreatedByName":"kulkan1","CreatedById":143911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T13:14:20Z","Content":"What exactly does the contract ask of you?\n\nDoes it sound like this:\n\n\u0022- Mine x amount of ore from Minmus\u0022\n\n\u0022- Have x amount of ore in craft\u0022\n\n\u0022- Landed on Kerbin\u0022\n\nOr is it simply \u0022- Orbiting Kerbin\u0022? I have seen a lot of contracts that just requires you to be in orbit for a ore return contract. Even though it\u0027s named \u0022Return ore to Kerbin\u0022, it might just ask you to deliver it to orbit. But if it sounds like the criterias I listed, then it shouldn\u0027t be a problem. I have a stationary mining base on Minmus, and for the \u0022return ore to kerbin orbit\u0022 contracts, I just have a designated ore lifter which I send out of Minmus SOI, and then right back after being in Kerbin SOI for 10 seconds. Not sure if it works in a special way because I have the vehicles docked while mining, but I think I remember it working after transferring the ore over too."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:47:46Z","Content":"TL:DR version- The game doesn\u0027t care where the ore is from. Just mine the amount needed from the target, and you can spawn a new vessel with ore, have it do a 2 meter hop, and complete the contract.\n\nSo... I launched a craft to go to minmus and collect the ore, to bring back to kerbin....\n\nI had 1 condition checked: Mine 500 units of ore from minmus\n\nThe next condition: have 500 units of ore in your cargohold (My ISRU operation didn\u0027t have that much... because.. conversion and all, but I could easily get it)\n\nNext condition: land the ore (?) 500 units of ore (?) on Kerbin\n\nNext: maintain stability for 10 seconds...\n\nI wondered... after the first condition completes, could I just launch a vessel with 500 ore, and immediately recover it to complete?\n\nSo I filled up some ore tanks in the VAB... I got the 500 in cargohold checked, but not the landed on Kerbin condition.\n\nI attached some basic jet engines, got up a few meters, and set back down: CHECK!\n\n10 game seconds later, all conditions were met, and the contract was completed."}]}
