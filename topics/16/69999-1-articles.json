There\u0027s 10 or 12 flags on the Mun that I\u0027ve planted, marking where I\u0027ve been.(So at least I think I\u0027ve got the T-shirt). So anyways, I\u0027m descending to a crater not yet visited, decreasing horizontal velocity, still about 20,000-25,000m up. Clicked on the trajectory (blue line) to set up a new nav node, and it would not respond. I know if your too low in altitude, it won\u0027t give you a nav point, but I was nowhere that low! Tried to set the nav point numerous times, but to no avail. So then I tried to \u0022eyeball it\u0022 and do to my poor piloting skills, Jeb died.

In these cases I find it helpful if you move the camera near the body you\u0027re orbiting, in this case the Mun, such that your perspective view is nearly parallel with your approach. For some reason, by doing this the GUI will allow you more freedom in placing the maneuver nodes. After it is placed you can adjust it but you can\u0027t slide it along your trajectory. If you want it at a different time you have to delete the maneuver node and try again, adjusting your perspective and placing a new one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doozler","CreatedById":103369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T09:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had this a few times as well, on standard orbits.
