Many of them list the same drag rating, and in the past it was stated mass was related to drag.\n\nSo I have done some tests with nose cones that I thought I\u0027d shared. I placed 4 basic fins at the bottom of a RT-10 rocket booster, and launched it without a nose cone, let it run out of fuel, and observed what altitude it reached, then did the same with various nose cones.\n\n![EfkvbTC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EfkvbTC.jpg)\n\n[TABLE=class: outer\\_border, width: 600]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Test Case[/TD]\n\n[TD]Max Altitude (m)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]No cone[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]8100m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Aerodynamic Nose Cone[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]10500m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Advanced Nose Cone - Type A[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]15000m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]AE-FF1 Air Stream Protective Shell (tiny shallow fairing)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]9050m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]AE-FF1 Air Stream Protective Shell (very large fat fairing)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]flipped[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]AE-FF1 Air Stream Protective Shell (sharp fairing, picture below)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]18500m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Small Nose Cone (Note: this does not match rocket diameter)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: right]8850m[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]Tail Connector A (Reversed.

A nose cone that is only slightly better will produce a disproportionately larger number since it was able to get the rocket into thinner air more quickly, and further from Kerbin\u0027s gravity.\n\nOne thing with the sharp fairing, is it matched to the angle of the drag \u0022wisps\u0022 that are deflected at high speeds. So maybe these are more than graphical embellishments, and actually have some indication of the ideal deflection angle of a nose cone.\n\nIf I were to do this test a little more scientifically, I\u0027d have found a way to add extra weight when using lighter cones, so that all of the builds weighed exactly the same. I think the weight played a very minor role here though. For example, the best run of the AE-FF1 performed much better than the \u0022tiny shallow fairing\u0022 which weighed slightly less. It also performed better than the lighter Advanced Nose Cone.\n\nThen I took a tail connector, reversed it and put it on top to function as a nose cone. **I did it only as a silly footnote in the table.**  I *expected* the rocket to flip over, but it didn\u0027t. Not only that, it performed better than all the other nose cones! I imagine if I made a fairing that matched the tail connector, it\u0027d do almost as well or better.\n\nNote: the rockets are tipped over in pictures because I waited for the ascent meter to 0, their ascent was straight up, but only guided by the fins.\n\nI was also surprised that an air intake performed better than the basic nose cone. I incorrectly assumed they generated lots of drag. The radial intakes do seem to generate considerable drag though, which probably also corresponds to why they overheat and blow up quickly on high speed planes.\n\nThe Mk1 Cockpit performed well, and probably was hindered by the fact that it weighs ALOT more than any of the cones tested, but I ran it out of curiosity. For a better comparison, I then ran an inline cockpit with the best performing nose cone, for a better comparison in that weight range. The Mk1 weighs 1.28t. The Mk1 Inline weighs 1.03t and the reversed Tail Connector A weighs .2t, making a very close total of 1.23t. So from that test it seems anytime I want to use a Mk1, I\u0027m probably going to put a giant nose on it and use the inline cockpit ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEver seen that Portlandia skit \u0022put a bird on it\u0022? My new motto is \u0022put a reversed tail connect on it\u0022.\n\nI wonder if you can make a protective fairing that \u0022noses\u0022 in on the reversed tail connector\u0027s performance, and also provides enough of a cylinder at the base to house a probe.\n\nThis new info should help me make some serious improvements to my high speed planes. I suspect the best design is inline air intakes with reversed tail connectors as a nose cone.\n\n![vouXq09.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vouXq09.jpg)\n\n![Eq9V5b1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Eq9V5b1.jpg)![PXwdRJM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PXwdRJM.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T03:17:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 03:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AaronLS**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T03:34:54Z","Content":"Great testing, thanks for sharing your results.
