From there it is ensuring you have action groups mapped to switch off the jet engines and turn on the rocket engine. It takes a little bit because you have to sort of dance in the upper atmosphere to keep your air intake above the stall threshold, and a lot of trial and error to tell you exactly what that is for each vehicle design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally had my first successful SSTO plane launch not too terribly long ago. Elliptical orbit but success nonetheless. And made it back to Kerbin and landed safely as well.
