And yet when going to land I kept having a nasty spin start up near the Mun surface. Upon research I found that All the tanks were burning at different rates and one nacelle runs out of fuel about 2000m up.\n\nSO after some re-balancing and shuffling engines on and off during the de-orbit burn I was able to get it on the ground at least. \n\nI went to review my fuel situation as far as returning to Kerbin..... Yeah, probably not going to happen. One tank is not even reporting, and another tank is 100% full still? \n\n[![Rocket%20fuel_zps1diy7boo.jpg](http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a116/Elfmaze/Rocket%20fuel_zps1diy7boo.jpg)](http://s10.photobucket.com/user/Elfmaze/media/Rocket%20fuel_zps1diy7boo.jpg.html)\n\nI have a ton of science on this one. As I understand if I transmit the data i get a portion and then I get the rest if I ever recover the craft?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI will try blasting off with just the two outer engines and a little push from the center. I\u0027m thinking eva and gather the data(might be tough as they are tucked into service bays). and hopefully bring the pods and two pilots home"},{"CreatedByName":"Elfmaze","CreatedById":136622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T21:07:57Z","Content":"there was something wrong for sure. I even checked the thrust limiters and all were 100% but as I tried to blast off it spun more even with the three engines. (weight difference between sides?) and the engine with 100% fuel read ~10% on the stage fuel gauge.....

Fuel is drained asymmetrically from twin stacks of attached fuel tanks or constructions on lateral separators or things like that. In a weird way, the program prioritizes some fuel tanks over others, draining some and leaving the rest. This might lead to a premature shutdown of engines that are attached to the drained tanks, because they obviously can\u0027t get fuel from the rest of the ship while the other engines can drain this tank. Not fuel pipes attached, but there are some one-way fuel flowing mechanisms that definitely shouldn\u0027t be there."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T06:53:16Z","Content":"Although I don\u0027t know what could have affected the fuel this way, there\u0027s a way to fix the fuel levels. You will need to upgrade your R\u0026D building for fuel transfer capabilities though.\n\nYou seem to have just enough fuel for two full tanks plus a bit in another, thus:\n\n1. Fill both tanks below the pods.\n\n2. Transfer the remaining fuel to the center tank.\n\n3. From both full tanks, transfer fuel to one of the empty radial tanks until it fills completely. You\u0027ll now have two tanks half full, one full, and one empty. Plus the central one.\n\n4. From the full one, transfer half the fuel to the empty radial one. This might not be perfect, but at least you\u0027ll have just a slight fuel unbalance in one direction.\n\n5. Transfer fuel from all the radial ones into the central one until all are level or the central has as much fuel as you want. You can even fill it if you want.\n\nThere are better ways, but this was the easiest I found that could be made quickly.\n\nAnd for you problem, try disabling any and all mods that you are using before lifting off again. One of them might be causing the problem. \n\nFor further troubleshooting a craft file or more pictures can help."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T13:19:43Z","Content":"From the numbers, the two tanks with material bays are draining the samewhile the tanks with the command pods are draining differently.\n\nAssuming that the root part of this vessel is on the center stack, then Raidial fuel flow rules **Should** mean that all of outer tanks can drain from the central tank which should burn out first. before each engine starts to drain its own tank because of the girders.\n\nHowever if this vessel was decoupled from something else then then One of the command pods may have become the root, and something odd may have happened to the parent child relationships between the tanks causing the wiedness\n\nJust my guess anyway"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T13:34:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E However if this vessel was decoupled from something else then then One of the command pods may have become the root, and something odd may have happened to the parent child relationships between the tanks causing the wiedness\n\u003E Just my guess anyway\n\nThat would be my guess as well.

Just because your rocket isn\u0027t built straight up and down, doesn\u0027t mean that isn\u0027t how it is in the save file. It will still progress through the tree of parts and find the first one with fuel and proceed to drain from there.\n\nIt is a bit complicated, but in the craft file/persistence file, everything starts from the root and moves linearly in a tree fashion. When you build outward, the tree may get harder to follow. DasValdez explains this concept very well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T01:34:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 01:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"}]}
