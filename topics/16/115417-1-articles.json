Its not an issue of lack of SAS / reaction wheels, since you can still manually steer correctly. I also seem to remember it did a decent (but not perfect) job at holding the current heading, but prograde / retrograde didnt work at all. I dont know WHY this happens but can confirm its not an isolated incident in 1.0.4. I\u0027ve also had a similar problem as this in 1.0.2, making me think this is a long standing bug.\n\nI dont think this it tied to a specific SAS unit, as when this happened to me a lvl 2 Jeb was piloting and I didnt have SAS iirc. It also doesnt sem tied to RCS use, as I had RCS off (asnt even on this craft) and it still happened.\n\nThe only thing that fixed this for me was actually returning the flight to kerbin and recovering and launching a new flight. Resetting the game didnt work, but thankfully my next flight worked correctly.\n\nEDIT: I also seem to remember that when I turned SAS off this craft would decide to pitch up and rollaround in circles for no reason whatsoever (like I was holding \u0022s\u0022 only I wasn\u0027t). Dont know if this is a related bug or if that craft was just kraken bait.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T13:58:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jkool702**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T13:51:29Z","Content":"Same problem here. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128168-Decoupler-Propulsion-Rocketry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128168-Decoupler-Propulsion-Rocketry)\n\nWatch the video around 2:10 - I\u0027m switching Prograde stabilization and I\u0027m completely ignored - I need to keep stabilizing manually.
