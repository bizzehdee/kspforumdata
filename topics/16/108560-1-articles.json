The parachute part looks like it\u0027s safely situated out of the airstream, but obviously the deployed parachute won\u0027t be! And since 1.0.1, parachutes don\u0027t survive being popped open at hypersonic speeds."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:54:07Z","Content":"Because you\u0027re not pointing to retrograde, so the chute has some drag, though small. Look carefully - the big red arrow is for pod. The arrow for chute is the smaller one beside it."},{"CreatedByName":"Josefpm","CreatedById":141015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:46:05Z","Content":"Ohh thanks.\n\nI see Chute appear intact but isn\u0027t it was i open after and its burn my fault but i can\u0027t find it because it\u0027s appear intact i see my fault now, i open in upper atmosphere and burn but look like intact ....\n\nThank all for your answer."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:05:09Z","Content":"FWIW, I leave the pressure setting on chutes alone as I don\u0027t fully understand it and it seems to work fine at the default. If I change anything about chutes, it\u0027s to slightly vary their fully open altitudes so that multiple chutes don\u0027t all open at the same time and jerk the ship apart. And I never stage chutes until the ship is doing 250m/s or less. Following these rules, I\u0027ve never had any chute failures."}]}
