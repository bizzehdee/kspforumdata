Wings produce a lot less drag than fuselages even when they are making lift. The right amount of incidence will allow you to punch through Mach 1 with your nose aligned with the prograde vector, dramatically reducing parasitic drag. This means you can get more mass supersonic and beyond with less thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many degrees of incidence would you recommend starting with?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T22:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clipperride\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Clipperride\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECheers Slashy. \u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be trying that out a little later (after Big Brother USA vs UK, a guilty pleasure of mine).
