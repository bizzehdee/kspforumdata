You can alter the periapsis of the SSTO to 45 KM at once from the 350 KM orbit or you could alter the orbit to 75 km and then alter the periapsis to 45 KM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the impression that the second way is better.

Too low, and you gain heat too fast and incinerate yourself, too high and you\u0027re not burning off orbital velocity for free. For that reason, I\u0027d generally suggest entering an \u0022orbit\u0022 of 55-60km and then pitching your nose up so that you\u0027re converting some of your lost velocity into lift and not just drag and thus can stay in that sweet spot for longer. On the other hand, doing it this way will make your eventual landing site less accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-12T09:14:46Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2016 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Grumman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T09:23:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe 2nd way takes more dV but will be a little better in terms of heating, as velocity at perapsis will be lower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n45km isn\u0027t very low... odds are from 350km, you\u0027ll go back into space again with a lower apoapsis, and basically accomplish the \u002275x45km option\u0022 using less dV (but making the timing of your landing more difficult).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI typically put my SSTO perapsis at about 30km, but that requires a relatively high AoA during reentry... and not using the mk1 spaceplane cockpit (the inline one is ok)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-12T09:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2016 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T15:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI re-enter my Nastybird shuttles with a 15km periapsis - works fine, IMO.
