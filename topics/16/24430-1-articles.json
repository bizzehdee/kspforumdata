Took a while, but I eventually noticed in settings that the zoom buttons were mapped to NUMPAD \u002B and - keys. Problem is, I\u0027m using laptops, so there is no NUMPAD. I remapped the zoom to the regular \u002B and - keys, zoom now works great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, perhaps check what your default zoom buttons are, and change if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
