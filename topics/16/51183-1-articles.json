The main influence I\u0027ve noticed is how far out you place your asparagus boosters; try to keep them close to the centre of the ship in the VAB. Two other influences I\u0027ve noticed are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Struts. If you don\u0027t strut the bottom AND top of boosters directly to each other, they will wobble to correct pitch and yaw, and your spin will slowly increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Too many boosters. Sounds silly but if you place 4 boosters on an asparagus ring, it is less likely to spin than with 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend you try a few of these things, but in order to achieve optimal performance your craft will have to spin a bit.

I\u0027m not certain, because by then I\u0027ve usually always dropped all the boosters. However, on occasion I will purposefully launch with much more dV than needed, and thus still have the last two boosters attached when making my circularization burn. It doesn\u0027t rotate once it leaves the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I can\u0027t replicate the problem because when I took the ship apart to rebuild the core stages I messed something up and now I can\u0027t get the payload to stay put on ignition.

That thing had more struts than a cage full of indignant peacocks. I already had a bunch on the habitation module, but I put several more and then attached it to the base rocket. I moved the ASAS to the middle of the primary rocket (between two -32 tanks) and then put on some winglets with 6x symmetry. I then built out from there, doing a 6x asparagus, strutting the whole thing from top to bottom, and then another 6x layer of asparagus boosters, with even more struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial flight ended 30 seconds in when one of the jettisoned 7th stage boosters nailed one of the 4th stage engines, thereby throwing the whole ship off kilter. It happened on the opposite side of the craft from my viewpoint, so I couldn\u0027t shut down an engine fast enough to save it. I reverted back to the VAB and considered putting some sepatrons on it, but decided to just let it go again. That\u0027s probably the first time I\u0027ve ever had that problem, and I figured if it did happen again I could change something. So the second flight was uneventful and I reached orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, except that in my circularization burn the ASAS separated and the engine, going at full throttle, rammed itself into everything else and exploded it, and then I couldn\u0027t get the engines on the habitation module to fire fast enough to get out of the way. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered anyway, since the explosion sheared off a crucial docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I\u0027m calling this a success, since my initial question is answered.
