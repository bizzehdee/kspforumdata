Since thrust will magically fix itself once you pass mach 1, you need to figure out how to get there. You need to find the height with the best compromise between losing thrust to altitude and lowering drag, i.e. the height at which your plane accelerates best. Then go level there, and see if you can get past 350 m/s. If level flight won\u0027t get you there, then try flying a little higher, and then diving down trying to accelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work - if you cannot get past the sound barrier no matter what you do - then your plane needs more thrust. Not intakes usually; you should be able to rightclick jet engines now in 1.0.5 to see if their air requirements are met or not, that\u0027s how you can check if you need more intakes, but in 95% of all cases they are not the culprit. More subsonic thrust however will get you supersonic, which is what you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can achieve that thrust with extra engines - one or two afterburning Panthers, perhaps, or maybe even a pair of SRBs that you light once you\u0027re approaching the sound barrier and then drop after they burn out.

At that point, I put it into a climb at about 35-40 degrees pitch or so, ensuring that I maintain around 300 m/s, steadily reducing the pitch angle as the engines lose thrust with altitude.
