I peaked at ~60 km up before the rockets ran out and I fell back down. What bothers me is that I\u0027ve seen people create massive space-plane SSTOs that could haul entire orange tanks up into orbit. It was in a weekly reddit challenge of some sort. I\u0027m not even doing that! I just want a plane that will take 3 guys up to my space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen not reaching for space though, the design is pretty decent. I was able to fly across the Eastern sea, land, take off again, and come back to base with fuel to spare.
