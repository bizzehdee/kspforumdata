Your wheels are the focal point, your control surfaces are providing the force and your plane\u0027s mass is the load you\u0027re trying to move. Now, like most levers, the closer the fulcrum is to the load, the less force that needs to be provided to lift that load. Conversely, the further away the fulcrum is from the load, the more effort you\u0027re going to need to make the load move. Your plane works in the same way - the closer the wheels are to the center of mass, the easier it will be for your control surfaces to lift up the nose, and then it\u0027s simply a matter of providing enough thrust for the plane to get off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have two options here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Move the rear gear forward (or turn them around) such that the wheels are positioned under the center of mass and slightly behind. This is the easiest option, but if you get them too far forward your plane will have a tendency to nose up while it\u0027s standing still with the end result being a tail strike. Gear placement is tricky business - too far forward and it tilts, too far back and it won\u0027t take off. I\u0027ve occasionally combated this phenomenon with a \u0022kicker\u0022 gear whose sole purpose is to hold the tail end of the plane up until the plane has picked up enough speed that it\u0027s no longer necessary. Those designs generally don\u0027t work too well as a rule though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Add more pitching control surfaces - dedicated elevators and canards. This works, though you have to be careful about what their addition will do to your center of lift - you don\u0027t want it to shift ahead of the center of mass during flight unless you\u0027re in to unplanned aerobatics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that\u0027s helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-10T19:39:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2014 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T19:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, what capi\u0027s saying.
