How do you do that? I would love to know as I\u0027m planning my first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E missions and I can\u0027t get enough fuel off the ground with my MK2 parts that are nice and aerodynamic. Maybe these propellers will help? no craft files please, as I\u0027ve already found two outdated ones. Just show me cutaway images please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-31T03:21:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPure stock, there\u0027s been a couple recent threads, and I know there\u0027s some tutorials in that subforum.\u00A0 Have a peek there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you\u0027re up for a mod, Firespitter has a bunch of propellers for your use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-31T15:11:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to invent them yourself, you\u0027ll need to know that they almost always involve using clusters of \u0022place anywhere \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 balls as bearings, and (for electric power) use reaction wheels for drive (the turboprops use two or more jet engines blowing on structures attached to the shaft to power the propeller).\u00A0 How the power gets from the main craft to the reaction wheel, I don\u0027t know, because they\u0027re built with a docking port or decoupler holding everything, and you have to decouple to allow the motor/shaft to rotate (this will disconnect any crossfeed that provides power from the main craft; it\u0027ll also render the engine a separate \u0022craft\u0022 and you\u0027ll need to use [ or ] to switch from the airplane to the engine to change power settings).\u00A0 The propeller itself is just some lifting or control surfaces, symmetrically arranged around the shaft and angled to provide thrust -- if they\u0027re control surfaces, like elevons, you may be able to switch craft to the propeller and use trim (Alt key, or right shift on Linux, plus S or W, E or Q, depending whether the decoupled \u0022craft\u0022 that is the motor and propeller sees them as roll or pitch control) to change blade pitch in flight (you\u0027d switch craft to the \u0022engine\u0022 and use roll trim for throttle with an electric propeller).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lego_Prodigy","CreatedById":187421,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-31T17:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I have a bare bones side view image? that would help a LOT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-01T15:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have anything like that on file, because I\u0027ve never built a propeller, but there is at least one tutorial video on YouTube on how to build a stock propeller (based on reaction wheels).\u00A0 If you find multiples, view the newest one; KSP has changed significantly over time, and while things that worked in 1.2 probably still work, stuff that worked in 1.0 or older versions are likely to fail in spectacular ways at this late date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
