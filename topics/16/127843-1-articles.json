Within one year around Kerbol, I had hundrets of asteroids between me and Duna. Worse, my frame rate degraded severly (from 45 fps down to 25 fps in the tracking station view).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed AD and repeated the experiment, now very few asteroids are spawned (or already in the game from the start?), no fps degradation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just cleaned up my main save by eliminating manually most asteroids from the persistence file (they are VESSEL{...} objects). Now the main save looks less interesting, but the \u0022spawn of death\u0022 is stopped, and I have 40\u002B fps again in the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=\u0026gt; I can highly recommend this if you are using Asteroid Day, and find you have way too much garbage in your system...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
