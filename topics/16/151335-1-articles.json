This ties into the next point:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nyou\u0027re carrying a lot of engines that are doing nothing for most of the flight. This adds dead weight (and drag, since many of them have open nodes). Ideally engines should be firing all the time at full thrust, or ditched because they\u0027re surplus to requirements. Specifically:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe lander\u0027s engines being off to start with is understandable, but with some fuel routing from the lower stages, they could be contributing from the upper atmosphere and onwards (negating the need for the Hammers, for example). Their I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E is better than any of the other engines you have there, so you\u0027ll end up using less fuel if you use them more.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThat looks like three Swivels on the upper transit stage, plus four (and a Mainsail or Skipper) on the stage before that, all doing nothing and being effectively dead weight on liftoff. Total fuel for all of the pre-lander stages looks to be about 5 or 6 orange tanks. All of those engines could be merged into the very bottom stage, using just a central Skipper \u002B 1 orange tank, two Mainsails on the sides with decouplers carrying two orange tanks, and a couple of Swivels (also on decouplers) with a couple of FL-T800s each. By feeding the Mainsails\u0027 tanks to the Swivels\u0027 stacks, and from them to the core, you should end up with much the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at all stages, much less engine weight and much more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E for the same amount of fuel. You certainly wouldn\u0027t need the Hammers at all, and probably not the Thumpers (though there\u0027s no reason not to include a couple).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T16:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will work, but it will work poorly.
