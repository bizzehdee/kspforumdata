For example: If you have one plane on top of another seperate plane (or a rover... whatever) and you reload this scene both ships get a shake by the game-engine and in most cases the top one will fall of the lower one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its getting enforced by wheels for example. The game just saves the position of parts but not the force they deal to each other. A compressed landing gear isn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t compressed when the save game is loaded so it will do some force to the structure when the game realises that there is some weight on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the wheels get you in trouble but when there are 2 seperate vessels that deal force to each other by theire weight (see first example) a reload of an quicksave will nearly always do the mission fail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.. is there any way in the options or a trick to stop this annoying behavior?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be the best solution but if i could get the game to slowly calculate the forces of the vessels to each other when loading a quicksave, i think the vessels wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t behave like compressed springs to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T07:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo way to completely stop it.
