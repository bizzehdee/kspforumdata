However they are still far too great, so I\u0026#39;m wondering if they would be lower further up. Should I just give up on the Oberth effect and depart from a 500x500 orbit or higher? What\u0026#39;s good altitude for interplanetary ejection when using Nerv?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T20:43:30Z","Content":"\nThe lower the better.

Multiple passes will give you the same result at much higher efficiency.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T21:11:50Z","Content":"\nOne trick is to split the burn. You have to do the last X m/s (where X is about 1000m/s less than your total burn) all at once because once you eject from Kerbin\u0026#39;s SOI you can\u0026#39;t swoop around for another try, but if your total burn is - say - 1500 m/s you can do one 500m/s burn, loop around, do another ~500m/s burn (just don\u0026#39;t escape SOI), swoop around, and then do a 3rd one to eject.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou have to start early (multiple days in some cases considering you\u0026#39;re talking about orbiting up past Minmus\u0026#39; orbit) and watch out for Mun (and to a lesser extent Minmus) encounters, but if you find that kind of thing fun (and let\u0026#39;s face it we find that kind of thing fun) it\u0026#39;s well worth at least doing once.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T21:12:12Z","Content":"\nIt depends on your burn time. I think the general rule is that you don\u0026#39;t want to burn more than 1/6 of your orbital period (of a circular orbit). As stated, you don\u0026#39;t need to burn all at once, and you can raise your AP through several passes.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T21:18:57Z","Content":"\nMy Jool 5 expedition\u0026#39;s composition, summed up: 3 landers, 4 NERVs, and a bunch of MK3 liquid tanks. This resulted in a stupid amount of DeltaV (KER just said NaN.. it was literally off the charts), but on the downside was that it had a TWR of 0.05. I assembled it in a 75x75 orbit, and when it was time to leave I did multiple burns to raise my AP. I think I made maybe 10-15 orbits, each time burning at PE for about 2 minutes. In the end I ejected as planned and my PE never got above 80km.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTips:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Start raising your AP early. After a while your orbital period will be so long that you run the risk of missing your transfer window while still working on raising your AP. And remember, a kerbin day is only 6 hours long. I spent around 2 weeks of ingame time raising my AP\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Don\u0026#39;t let the mun toss you around in the process\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. A low TWR ejection usually means a looooooong orbital insertion burn for when you arrive at your destination. My Jool5 expedition burned for 5 minutes continuously when arriving, including a triple reverse gravity assist by Laythe, Tylo and Vall\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T21:26:24Z","Content":"\nMaybe I\u0026#39;m just underestimating how wide transfer windows are then.

It barely affected me and even gave me a boost. It would have even been somewhat useful if it hadn\u0026#39;t turned out that I accidentally time warped past my Moho window and found out too late that Moho was going to outpace me by far. As luck would have it, Dres was in just the perfect position and even though I need to speed up from an orbit I purposefully slowed down to get to Moho, it looks like I\u0026#39;ll still have 700 nuke DV to spare after getting a Dres parking orbit.
