So, heres the issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy spaceplane is perfectly balanced and flys great atmospherically and in space. However, on return, it seems to be extremely rear-heavy due to being bingo on fuel. I am unable to make a powered landing; the moment I take off the ASAS, my nose lurches skyward due to the unbalanced weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow does one design a spaceplane that is stable when both full and empty? any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage of my spaceplane attached, although I am unsure it will be any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Cobbler","CreatedById":30259,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T02:42:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf youre too lazy, like me, you can tryvusing smart sas on mechjeb.

This is possible to do by placing underslung engines near the middle of the craft, among other options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this may or may not upset the balance in space or prove to be a large hassle, it may be worth investing in VTOL. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fowlplaychiken","CreatedById":30748,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T04:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am unsure; the COG seems fine. I suspect it has something to do with my fuel cross-feed; I can not seem to get the lines to work properly for the life of me.

I initially asumed, this would be the case for planes as well (from the front backwards) and connected the aft fuel tanks via fuel lines to the tanks in front of them. The Engines where under the wing and connected to one of the middle tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat setup did work but due to the fuel lines the plane used the aft tanks first.
