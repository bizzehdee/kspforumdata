And then you\u0027ll need some artistic vision as to what your badge should show. Since it\u0027s about the Apollo program, you could use pictures of the IRL Apollo spacecraft, or a KSP recreation thereof - but it can be anything you feel that fits, honestly. You then choose a source image that shows what you decided on (either found online, or produced yourself using KSP), load it into GIMP, resize/rotate/crop it as needed, and then pretty it up somewhat. Give it a caption, maybe an effects filter or better contrast. Maybe you can even cut elements from different source images and paste them together into the badge (like a real CSM picture together with a floating Kerbal). Which of course gets slightly more complex...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly the simplest solution, for the uninitiated, would be to find someone who\u0027s excited about participating in your challenge who\u0027s made such a thing before.
