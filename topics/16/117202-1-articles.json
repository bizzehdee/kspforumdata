I\u0027m not a novice KSP player (have about 100 hours) but today, I made a few bad mistakes haha. I sent a tourist to the Mun and back , and now he is stranded in a highly elliptical orbit around Kerbin. Why? well I may have forgotten to put a parachute on the craft. I tried a rescue mission, but tourists cannot EVA. The ship he is on is just a probe and a lander can, so I cannot put Jeb inside to save the day. There are also no docking ports.\n\nIs it possible to save the tourist?\n\nCan a grabbing unit carry something through reentry?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T22:48:00Z","Content":"First, welcome to the forums ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nYou can actually use the Klaw to transfer resources (according to [here](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Advanced_Grabbing_Unit)); on the other hand, you could use a tug with a Klaw, fuel to deorbit and chutes, everything should be fine as stock reentry is not destructive enough to harm such a vessel.\n\nWhat you can try to do is left click on the crew hatch and transfer the tourist to another pod, docked to your ship (with the Klaw). I\u0027m really not sure about that one, but still give it a try."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T22:49:27Z","Content":"Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nWelcome to the forums.\n\nChallenges go in the challenges forum.\n\nGameplay Questions (and Tutorials) go in that forum.\n\n100 hours and you\u0027ve only just got here!

It\u0027s not as terrible as everybody says. Hit F5 right before clawing and the Kraken can\u0027t touch you (because you can revert to the quicksave).\n\nYou can claw through re-entry. I personally would make a ship designed to enter in this orientation: Heat shield / probe body / claw / saved tourist. Once you\u0027re coming down, transfer all the fuel you\u0027ve got into the fuel tank closest to the heat shield and you should then be front-heavy. This is good, as it\u0027ll keep the heat shield pointed into the airflow. Should be fine. Honestly the shield is probably overkill but hey, you\u0027re rescuing a person so why not do a bit of overkill?"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbochuck","CreatedById":149032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T00:47:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How-to question moved to the how-to section.

But somebody made a rescue claw out of LT-2 landing struts. What you do is you mount the struts to the BOTTOM of the rescue ship (not the sides, as you usually do with landing struts), and you mount the struts backwards by hitting A or D twice. They should be facing radially outwards.\n\nWhen you approach the target craft and hit G to deploy the landing legs, the LT-2 struts will swing around and down--and inwards! They will close like a claw around the target craft. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It was pure genius.
