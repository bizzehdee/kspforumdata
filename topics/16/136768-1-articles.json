Do they do this over time? If not, why do I not have enough power now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T14:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you dock anything to it?

That should happen naturally as Kerbin revolves around, and can affect solar panel effectiveness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peewee69","CreatedById":161551,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T14:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the replies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing else docked to it,\u00A0I\u0027ve only ever played 1.05 and yes; I am fully recharging each and every day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust double checked, and guess what; the problem no longer exists!
