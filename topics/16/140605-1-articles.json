There are many things you need to learn in order to understand \u0022rocket science\u0022. When you are just beginning, turning on \u0022infinite fuel\u0022 helps you learn. Turning on \u0022infinite electricity\u0022 helps avoid wasting several hours because you forgot to deploy a solar panel. Turning on \u0022show biomes on map\u0022 lets you understand how the game works. It is just too big to figure out all of these things by trial and error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The game still has bugs. As long as the bugs exist -- if you get bitten\u00A0by one, it\u0027s perfectly reasonable to click a button to temporarily get around the bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) As sumghai said, the debug menu is to help devs debug the game, as the name clearly implies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) All games have cheat codes. This game is just honest about it. People will simply sometimes decide to cheat at some time or other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Once you fully understand how to do something in the game and it becomes infinitely dull by repetition, you can enable a cheat and skip it. This keeps the game a little fresher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
