Depending on the orientation of docking ports fuel will not flow automatically through them and can only manually be transferred. Check if fuel is automatically drawn from those tanks when the engines are run. If the engines do automatically draw fuel from those tanks then it must be a bug in mechjeb and should be reported (though I think there might be a different bug in KSP itself that occurs when you manually disable the flow from some tanks which for some reason alters the behavoir of some cross-feed parts).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T02:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sovek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sovek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027ll need to calculate it manually, the formula for doing so is Ln(Mf/Me)xISPx9.81.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add an extra little tidbit that might help with calculating delta-v on the fly: Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer both have 0.005 tonnes of mass per unit.
