One, you wish to use junior drills, which only work above a given threshold. Two, you want the setup to run on fuel cells that consume fuel you convert from ore, which means you need a certain concentration to break even and make surplus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have one of those cases on your hands, your landing sites will be limited by that, and you\u0027ll be forced to go to the hotspots away from the equator. But if you don\u0027t have one of those cases, then you might as well plop down wherever it is convenient - you just use the scan data to find the highest equatorial concentration. Because then, a lower concentration just means having to timewarp for a few moments longer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ineon","CreatedById":152379,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T08:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother consideration is how quickly you need the ore. I assume that you are mining it to hit some biomes for science, deploy a base, get probes into different orbits, and/or plot a transfer back to Kerbin. If you have a transfer window looming then higher concentration might jump up the priority.\u00A0On the other hand if the everyone is going to sit around for a few months (or years) waiting for the correct window then they might as well wait while getting ore from a convenient location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T11:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternately, if you will have an infinite amount of fuel available to you at some point in time, then an efficient transfer window becomes much less important. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Montag","CreatedById":62945,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T16:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you have a contract requirement, then I would suggest mining on Ike instead.\u00A0 But I am guessing you have a contract requirement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T18:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222648588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142546\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466968938\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113955\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022THX1138\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, THX1138 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna has a slightly higher concentration of ore away from the equator but I figure that it might be more efficient to go for ore nearer the equator due to the possible necessity of plane changes.
