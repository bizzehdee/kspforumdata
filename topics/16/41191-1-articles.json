I have found that if the centre of lift is within the Centre of gravity sphere the plane does smarten up quite a bit in regards to more level flight, but at a risk of going all snakey when you hit stall aerodynamically. Either reposition the main wings or add some weight to the rear end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso air pressure and density does have a strong influence, and the only way to beat that in this game is raw power and speed.

I typically have to hit every single one to figure which one will in this case tilt the wing 5 degrees, so that when the cockpit is going straight, the wing is at a positive angle of attack. You have the same angle of attack for the wings as if you had your nose pointing up, but your intakes can point in the direction of your flight path. Lift increases up to an angle of attack of a bit over 30 degrees, then it declines. If you point the wings up two or three notches, you can fly with your nose close to level, and not be in danger of stalling when you pull up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T05:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think he\u0027s referring to Angle of Attack, not pitch control. Wings in KSP use fully-symmetric airfoils. Thus, they generate no lift at 0deg. As AoA increases, they create more lift. If you had a higher lift/weight ratio, your planes would fly at a lower AoA. Alternatively, you can use shift-wasdqe to pitch your surfaces upward slightly (5-10deg) on your ship, thus inducing a nonzero AoA and producing lift even when your navball reads 0deg (but upside-down flight will require an even higher AoA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoL/CoM position only affect what your plane does with no control inputs. Control surfaces dramatically move your CoL, so as long as they aren\u0027t too far apart you can compensate for any discrepancy. What I find to be much more important is Center of Drag. If your CoD is in front of your CoM, your plane will attempt to flip around and fly backwards. The further back your CoD, the easier it will be to recover from spins and tumbles. This is especially an issue for spaceplanes, which experience massive drag forces on re-entry. You want as many of your lifting surfaces as possible to be behind the CoM, with just enough in front to keep your CoL close to the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T08:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause you don\u0027t have enough lift and are having to use part of your engine thrust to keep you from going upward.
