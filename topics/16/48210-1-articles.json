This is a common problem when attaching wheels to wings. What you could do in this case is to attach the pylons to the outside edges of the wings (the delta wing geometry results in a perfectly straight alignment if you attach here with angle snap), and then rotate them 90 degrees so they\u0027re facing down. Another way is to change your attachment mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you have another problem too: Too much weight! Those rocket fuel tanks are much heavier than jet fuel tanks. The wings and gear will flex on the runway since there is nothing directly under the fuel tanks to support their weight, and this flexing is going to result in further misalignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can fix this by putting landing gear directly under the fuel tanks at the back. Now, this alone will create a problem because your craft will no longer have any nose-up on the runway and it will make it difficult to launch. You can solve this by, again, attaching two landing gear to the sides of the tank as rear landing gear, and using shift-rotate to angle them until they are straight up and down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave the wing gear on as well, otherwise your gear tricycle will be much too narrow and your plane will tip over!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - one final thing. Once you do get airborne, this plane is going to be unstable. Part of the reason will, of course, be because of the centre of thrust problem mentioned by others here. But you have another source of instability: your centre of lift is also far below your centre of mass. A way to solve this is to give the wings some dihedral... that is to say, angle them up towards the tips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some easy to follow (GREAT PICTURES!) aircraft building information, see this thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T15:06:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T15:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EO...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif it tips on the runway, it\u0027s that the wheel and the plane body are not relatively stationary enough (aka, the plane is not rigid enough)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto fix this, add more struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T13:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to all, and, yes, the problem happens yet while on the runway, it tips to one side or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the concepts of aircraft well enough since years ago, but tried to make something rather unusual here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eallmhuran: thanks for the tips. I aligned things as much as I could, and the center of lift is perfectly aligned with center of lift. Note: the wings start above the center of the bottom fuselage.
