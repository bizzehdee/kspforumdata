The only problem is that it is incredibly hard to control, as in I have never been able to fly more than a few hundred metres from the runway. If I want to use this in a carrier, then I will need much more prescise controls, and I can\u0027t figure out why it flys so badly. \u00A0I would really appreciate any thoughts or suggestions with this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\npics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vkbD7is.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vkbD7is.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220Progll.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0Progll.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone wants to test it, the launch predure is: stage, switch to tail rotor, hold Alt\u002BE until full trim, switch back, stage and repeat with the main rotor.

I am alternating between my joystick and keyboard, but they have no real difference.\u00A0I\u0027ll test some things out today. There are no jets, partly because I wanted the helicopter to run entirely of electric power, and partly because the margin of lift for the rotors isn\u0027t very big. The main bearing is made out of a 1.25m structural fuselage with 2 stayputnik\u00A0probes and a LOT of reaction wheels attached on a decoupler, and the tail rotor bearing is basically a one ended thermometer hinge made with\u00A0upscaled parts\u00A0for reliability.
