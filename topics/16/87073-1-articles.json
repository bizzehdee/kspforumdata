It wouldn\u0027t surprise me if that buggered it, though, because the asteroid is more like a part/ship than a heavenly body, and the claw docks with it. I\u0027m surprised the asteroid even survived the termination of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you made a save prior to terminating the ship, try going back to that and NOT terminating the attached ship before you undock it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, all I can offer are the usual things to check. Such as, making sure the 2nd ship\u0027s claw is armed and that the surface of the asteroid isn\u0027t at too great an angle to the claw. It seems like the claw will only grab if it\u0027s at no more than about a 30^ angle to the local asteroid surface. Only a small spot in the center of the claw actually grabs and the extended arms can keep this from touching the surface if the angle is too great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
