Small ship at 8m/s seems relatively fast in comparison to a bigger vessel at the same speed. The hull of a ship will break at only several meter per second (usually much less especially when loaded)\u00A0against a solid object whether it\u0027s a small fishing boat or the Titanic. At high vertical velocities water works like a wall. \u00A0Depending on how you\u0027ll hit the water 8-12 m/s is quite a hit actually, and it\u0027s very likely things will break on contact with water at those speeds depending on the weight and surface area of the object or vessel hitting it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHorizontal speed matters much less assuming there are little to no waves, not at all perhaps in KSP although I do not know that for a fact.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing you should take mind of is that your craft might have\u00A0a very deep draft, so stacks of parts above the bottom parts will still accelerate into the water beyond their crash tolerances until the vessel settles around its floating point.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can cut the engines when touching the water gently,\u00A0but within that moment the distance of one or more parts will freefall\u00A0past their crash tolerance values while on your\u00A0monitor\u00A0it may look like your kissing the water.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolutions:\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t think parachutes will help you.

And when using a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E design only kill engine power once the vessel has settled close enough to it\u0027s floating point. Which is not when you make first contact but after it sinks slightly into the water.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe best way to minimize crash damage on parts using a floating vessel like a large ship is to use a catamaran system whereby specific stacks of parts used for floatation will hit the water first so that anything above it doesn\u0027t crash into it. I use the structural fuselage and mk3 cargo bays mostly for this purpose coupled with Vector engines tugged away in the Mk3 cargo bays to be used as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E assist when my vessel gets into the big vessel categories.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other reason is that Mk 3 cargo bays have ridiculous crash tolerances that defy normal reality. They have a impact tolerance of 50 meter per second which is close to 200 Kp/h. Because they are also big and very floaty they usually protect parts that will float above the waterline if the Mk 3 parts are used for floatation but the Mk1 structural fuselage works very well to if they are to big for the craft you\u0027d like to use.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ilja89","CreatedById":187371,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-27T11:02:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thanks you all, I will try to use your advices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessel screenshot:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://savepice.ru\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f0b6a9aec870572e8d2db09b52383d2d-full.jp\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn1.savepice.ru/uploads/2018/3/27/f0b6a9aec870572e8d2db09b52383d2d-full.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-27T11:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2018 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ilja89\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
