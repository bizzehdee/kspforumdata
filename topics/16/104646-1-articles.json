One of the first things I noticed was the upradeable space center buildings. I had my fun with the first few missions, establishing an orbit, etc. Once that was done I went to do one of those simple \u0022rescue XXXXX Kerman from orbit around Kerbin\u0022 missions because it was the only one with a decent payout. It\u0027s worth mentioning at this point that I forgot that you can\u0027t use maneuver nodes without upgrading the tracking center. About a (very stressful) half hour later I managed to pull off the rendezvous and rescue without manuever nodes, which I don\u0027t recommend.\n\nAnyways long story short how do I make any substantial amount of money without grinding the crap out of the boring and mundane \u0022test this part at Kerbin\u0022 missions?? I want to get on with exploring the Solar system, not fly out to sea and test 37 different parts.\n\nI saw a similar thread about this question earlier, but that particular person was much further along the career than I was, so I was wondering if there\u0027s any way to make a quick cash flow early in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T04:02:54Z","Content":"Save file editing......\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9I told you nothing........"},{"CreatedByName":"Ekkoria","CreatedById":72460,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T04:08:43Z","Content":"Honestly, I\u0027m kind of feeling like doing that.

This allows you to leave Kerbin a lot easier and start doing the \u0022explore\u0022 contracts for Mun and Minmus which offer good payouts and will allow for better local contracts. The career games require a decent amount of planning and efficient use of each launch. If launches are done this way then you shouldn\u0027t need to grind boring contracts repetitively. Also, I would recommend against using an admin strategy that converts your reputation to funds or science, you need that reputation to obtain better contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T04:54:17Z","Content":"New contracts come along from time to time. If you don\u0027t like what\u0027s on the menu, time-accelerate a few hours and check again. Generally the biggest payouts come from testing very large and heavy parts.\n\nIf you get a contract to test a very large Kerbodyne engine or booster in flight, you\u0027re in luck because they generally pay very well.\n\nBTW for engines or boosters, you can use the test part itself to get yourself into the required flight regime and then just reposition it in the staging stack so it will get activated again at the appropriate time. I got a contract to test the Kerbodyne 1x2 booster in sub-orbital flight and built a rocket consisting of nothing more than the booster, a battery, and a probe core. Once it was in space, I re-staged it and activated it again.

For example, rover contracts won\u0027t show up till you get rover wheels, there will be sattelite contracts, base building contracts, flight survey contract (can be done with plane or rocket, but plane is usually easier when atmosphere is available). Furthermore, contracts for other bodies don\u0027t show up till you have visited them (except the one that asks you to visit them, which you only get once per body).\n\nSome won\u0027t show up until certain conditions are met, others will stop showing up under certain conditions. For example, I think contracts to return science from the Mun will not be given if a Kerbal is on the Mun (though I think a remote probe won\u0027t hinder them at all).\n\nIf that\u0027s not enough, there are a lot of contract mods now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T05:04:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T06:28:34Z","Content":"Be sure to match up as many contracts as you can to do them all together.

(This is all based on my playing stock; mods likely will change the picture as well.)\n\nKhazar already said it, but I want to emphasize: your first building upgrade should be to mission control, so you can take on more contracts at once. It\u0027s a cheap upgrade, and it gives you much more scope to find combinations of contracts to fulfill with a single launch (which is more profitable, and makes the mission more interesting too). It also lets you take on the first few \u0027explore x\u0027 contracts and get their up-front payments, even before you\u0027re ready to start tackling them.\n\nSelect contracts carefully; they need to both be profitable (total funds payout should be several times the cost of the rocket you build to fulfill the contract) and worth your time as a player. For example, testing parts landed or splashed down on Kerbin is almost pure profit, but the contracts are so small that they usually fail the second measure: not worth your time. Very early on, I liked the \u0027science from space around Kerbin\u0027 contracts a lot -- they could be fulfilled with a very cheap rocket (a capsule and two stages of small SRBs) and a quick straight-up, straight-down flight was quick to fly. For me, the contracts for readings (or crew reports or whatever) from specific locations on Kerbin fail on both counts; but that type of contract on other bodies is often worthwhile. Interplanetary contracts and rescue contracts are time-consuming; the interplanetary ones can have payouts to match though.\n\nBuild your final stage / payload as small as possible; build your first stage as cheap as possible. Once you have access to decent probe cores, every rocket that can be made unmanned should be. My first stage is almost always SRBs, or for rockets too big to be lifted with 4-6 SRBs I add four or so to burn in parallel with the first stage.\n\nReusability isn\u0027t worth your time, in almost all circumstances. Build cheap rockets to fulfill contracts that pay decently, and the few percent that you could improve your profit margin through reusability just won\u0027t matter. (OTOH, if SSTO spaceplanes are your idea of fun, then go for it! But don\u0027t feel that you have to.)\n\nYou\u0027ll probably make your first missions beyond LKO before upgrading your facilities to the point of having patched conics or maneuver nodes. Remember that the Mun\u0027s SOI is larger and easier to hit, but landing on and returning from Minmus is cheaper in terms of delta-V. Minmus contracts usually pay slightly better. You can get to either moon, at least to high orbit around either, with tier-0 facilities.\n\nCareer mode, especially at higher difficulty levels, really pushes you to go out as far as possible and do as much as you can with limited parts, limited launch weight and part counts, limited assistants. It also pushes efficient rocket-building and -flying. (Or, you could say it heavily punishes **in**efficient rockets and **in**efficient flying.) That won\u0027t appeal to everyone; if you don\u0027t want to play on those terms you\u0027ll likely find other game modes more fun.\n\nThe worst part about KSP career mode is that it usually can\u0027t tell you when you\u0027ve lost! If you find that, for whatever reason, you\u0027re stuck flying the same old missions over and over, and it\u0027s become tedious -- then you have lost. Technically you can keep playing and it\u0027s possible that you\u0027ll improve and eventually progress in the game, but if you\u0027re not enjoying it then what\u0027s the point? Better to just give up that save (or \u0027put it on hiatus\u0027 if that\u0027s easier to swallow) and start a new game at a lower difficulty level or in a different mode and get back to doing things that are **fun**."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T18:53:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the recommendation, this is EXACTLY the kind of thing I was searching for! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) hahahaha, me? determined to run stock?

I make most of my early/midgame funding from satellite contracts, including those from RemoteTech and ScanSat. Work on building an ubercheap satellite delivery system and then just make the minor tweaks as contract conditions demand it. Get a basic sat with enough onboard Delta-V (my workhorse sat has a good 2000 dV for use after reaching orbit) and you can even fulfill multiple sat contracts with one unit. You only have to stay in the required orbit for a limited time to fulfill the conditions, and then you can move on to another. Granted, this IS a tad bit cheaty from an ingame perspective. Single launches of cheapsats still make a solid profit for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T22:28:53Z","Content":"More money is earnt on 2 and 3 star missions near the bottom.
