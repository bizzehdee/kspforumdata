anything even a little draggy is very expensive.\u00A0 Wings = drag.\u00A0 Therefore, they\u0027re best avoided unless they provide some significant benefit that can outweigh the drag penalty.\u00A0 (Plus there\u0027s the practical matter that reentry heat on Eve is just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebrutal\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Heat shields are pretty much mandatory, and wings have an unfortunate habit of poking out in places that are hard to heat-shield.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, when an airplane ascent \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E make sense is if you can find some way to free yourself from the tyranny of the rocket equation, typically with a mod.\u00A0 For example, RoverDude\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/80650-105-karbonite-mineable-burnable-and-community-driven-0660-20151109/\u0022\u003EKarbonite\u003C/a\u003E has a jet engine that works in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, so the huge boost in jet Isp over rocket power pretty much dominates all other considerations.\u00A0 Ditto \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/119480-105-kethane-plugin-and-parts-094-new-maintainer/\u0022\u003EKethane\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Another example is Porkjet\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94519-105-atomic-age-nuclear-propulsion-red-hot-radiators/\u0022\u003EAtomic Age\u003C/a\u003E, which has a nifty nuclear turbojet that runs in atmosphere without fuel at all.\u00A0 Eve airplanes work great with all of those, because you can build a plane that climbs very cheaply and efficiently to well above 20km before you have to start spending precious rocket fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222438316\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133212\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456933565\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n58 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, this is what I used to get 3 kerbals down to eve sea level and back up...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice ship!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the things I love about KSP is that there\u0027s so much flexibility, and I always enjoy seeing the various ways that different players solve the same problem.\u00A0 However, I gotta say that for Eve ascent, I suspect that there must be a certain amount of convergent evolution going on:\u00A0 most of the screenshots I\u0027ve seen for successful Eve ascent vehicles, post 1.0, look \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Every\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E similar.\u00A0 Just about all the ones I\u0027ve seen consist of a tall skinny central stack (either a lone Big Orange, or a couple of stacked FL-T800\u0027s), with 4 to 6 radial boosters consisting of stacks of two FL-T800, and a final stage with 2-ton LFO \u0026amp;

Without actually doing much math at all, I just decided that my limit would be a TWR of 1.1 ... and since I had to pick fixed size tanks, I ended up with 1.09... knowing that in that case... 90% of the dV spent is initially lost to gravity, as opposed to about 50% later (assuming a TWR of 2:1, which is what you need to travel at terminal velocity... though in practice, you\u0027d need more than this as terminal velocity increases as you get higher... and then it gets more complicated as you start climbing at an angle) But then again, almost none of that initial dV spent is lost to air resistance at the lower speeds. Climbing slower than terminal velocity wastes dV to gravity drag, but less to air resistance. So while its not optimal, a lower TWR is not as harsh of a penalty as it initially appears I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I think 1.2 or 1.3 are probably better \u0022minimum acceptable initial TWRs\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s other things to worry about...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs eve has a thick atmosphere, and strong gravity. When travelling close to terminal velocity (to minimize dV loses), the aerodynamic forces are quite high. To minimize dV losses, one wants a tall skinny rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis results in prime conditions for rocket flipping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of that, most designs enter engines first... so your design needs to be aerodynamically stable travelling in two directions. Fins to stabilize it on the ascent make it unstable on the descent. The tanks draining top down are a problem for stability, I had my fuel lines set up to drain the reverse direction from the side tanks (and yes, my final tweaked design did add aerospikes to the side stacks), but no such tweaking is very effective for the vector stacks because the central aerospike drains so little fuel compared to the vectors... between the first and second staging event is when my craft would flip the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make it stable on entry into eve\u0027s atmosphere... thats what those side pods at the top with airbrakes and fins are for... they also double as science packages and points of attachment for the parachutes. Additionally, as others have noted, even landings slowly with a big massive craft in eve\u0027s 1.7g gravity field... can break your craft. I use a quick retroburn just before touchdown, and the fuel tanks in the side pods supply that fuel without cutting into my ascent fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeating is also a major concern. If I start turning too soon, the pod explodes, if I start turning too late, its too inefficient and I may no make orbit. If I wait a little long and make a more aggressive turn, it risks flipping (the strong vector gimbal can help there though, but I fly with their gimbal limited for most of the ascent... I wish I could change the gimbal limit with an action group.. just like I wish I could enable/disable fuel flow from a tank with an action group to make the top tanks drain last)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... landing it empty or nearly empty and filling it with ISRU can be a good idea. You could leave the top tanks empty, and the bottom tanks full, just to help make it tail heavy to make it stable during the descent. Its something I considered, but I wanted to make a lander that could land anywhere on eve regardless of the ore concentration... and be a \u0022standalone\u0022 craft, rather than one that would need surface rendezvous to fuel it (in which case you could send it down empty, and then send down separate fuel tanks to fuel it if there\u0027s no ore nearby). But... if you\u0027ve got a landing site in mind that has a good ore concentration, go for it, the ISRU is a good solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is much tougher, with many more problems to overcome with a design, than before 1.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople said it would be too easy when the dV requirements were coming in at 8km/s...
