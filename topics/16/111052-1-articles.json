Axial tilt is what causes seasons (parts of the world are subjected to more/less light over a given time). Since KSP does not simulate this, all bodies essentially have one season... or no seasons.\n\nIf this doesn\u0027t make sense, I\u0027m sure someone else has a better way to put it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: Actually, this may not answer your question at all, now that I read it again. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif) In cases like Dres, which has a different inclination from most of the system, I don\u0027t know whether the poles are pointed the same as Kerbin, for example, or if they are based off the orbital inclination (so the poles are pointed a few degrees off, comparatively)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T20:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:33:11Z","Content":"Each axis of the planets and moons is perpendicular to the equator of the sun."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:46:45Z","Content":"Afaik all celestial bodies in KSP have zero axial tilt, i.e. their axes are perpendicular to their orbital planes.

All KSP bodies have zero tilt relative to Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane, i.e. all planetary rotation axes in KSP are parallel to each other regardless of the inclination of their orbits.
