The center of mass on a plane must be in front of the center of lift, or else it will uncontrollably flip over. You can see the center of mass and lift in the SPH by clicking on the buttons on the bottom left. The blue marker is the center of lift and the yellow one is the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how lift in the game works, but I think that planes in the game do not stall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sathurn","CreatedById":58040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T19:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeh, real planes have a cog forward of col, so that when you \u0022stall\u0022 the nose falls restore flying speed over the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far anything with a forward center of gravity just stays on the ground for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholas4132","CreatedById":30242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T19:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lift number on wings means essentially nothing. The amount of lift wings give is based primarily on the angle of attack, so at an AoA equally zero will give you roughly zero lift. I think the lift number is just multiplied by the AoA to get lift, but there isn\u0027t a real reason to try and calculate this yourself. to figure out how much lift a plane needs, just look at your plane and ask: do my wings look big enough? After a while it is just intuition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no wing stalls in the game, though with an angle of attack higher than 45 degrees, wings start to lose lift and gain drag. There are engine stalls: if a jet isn\u0027t getting enough air, it may flame out, losing all thrust. In multi-engine aircraft this may cause a flat spin. To see of much air your engines are getting, look at the \u0022Intake Air\u0022 resource in the upper right menu. The amount of Intake Air is determined by altitude, speed, and the types and amount of intakes on your craft. (The ram air intakes are the best)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep the center of lift behind the center of mass. Also, don\u0027t place control surfaces near the tips of wings. The game makes no distinction between elevators, flaps, or ailerons. Also, keep landing gear perpendicular to the ground. Any kind of camber or toe-in on lander gear may cause craft to veer off the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sathurn","CreatedById":58040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T20:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried building in AOA by making the front landing gear taller than the back.
