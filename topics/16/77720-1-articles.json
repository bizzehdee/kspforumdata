I noticed rather quickly EVE was harder compared to the rest. As far as being new, you could say that. Only been playing a few months. I learned the add a maneuver feature (should of learned of the bat) and its helped immensely. I dont think I\u0027ve hit up any of those planets yet but its worth a try.

The first is to burn from low Kerbin orbit to eject and get on course to the target planet. You\u0027re moving faster in low Kerbin orbit than in solar orbit, and rockets give you more energy when you\u0027re moving faster. This is known as the Oberth effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is to go at the right time. The most fuel-efficient transfer has you going halfway round the Sun to meet the target planet, known as a Hohmann transfer, but obviously you need the target planet to be there when you are! You thus need to leave when the angle Kerbin-Sun-Target is about right. There are various tools to help you do this, such as \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you know it\u0027s the right time to depart, you can set a manoeuvre node and play around with it. It also helps to have an idea of the delta-V you\u0027ll need from the manoeuvre, which you can get from a delta-V map such as \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/7/73/KerbinDeltaVMap.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re en route, I suggest setting up a mid-course correction, and using it to tweak your periapsis, bring it nice and low to the target, that will make getting into orbit round it more efficient. Make another correction using radial and/or normal burns right after entering the target\u0027s SOI if you need to. If you\u0027re going to land on Eve, Kerbin, Duna or Laythe you can just set an impact course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is IMHO a great target for a one-way landing. Enter the atmosphere, deploy chutes, float down, job done. The actual landing\u0027s the easiest of anywhere besides Kerbin.
