Mun is eclipsed by kerbin pretty much. I started my burn at the sunset line. The resultant of this slingshot would place my Kerbol orbit periapsis (I forgot to screenshot) about half way between eve and kerbin orbits almost. Alas, I am heading to dune so this path isn\u0027t really any use to me. However, I can only assume that if it was done the other way, with mun on the sunside, and the burn taking place at sunrise, this can really help alot. If timed correctly and you hit the apo closer, I suspect it could be done even better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the very narrow apo. Being almost stalled on mun capture means an intense duration of pull, plus relatively close to the surface. In fact, with slight course adjustments, It was \u0026lt;90km from munar surface. Should really help my big rockets, this might become a new standard for planetary launch should I be able to do it consistently. With better alignment, I expect even greater results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly safe :cool:/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit edition! Did a flyby with another craft and launched it to \u0022stall\u0022 Apo just past munar orbit. Gravity caught, pulled me into a sharp orbit around mun with an Peri of onl 11km! Resultant was an Apo in kerbol orbit of 13.3 mil km (kerbin orbit) and a peri of only 11.8 million. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i529.photobucket.com/albums/dd332/KwKiller/Kerbal%20Space%20Command/screenshot26.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot26.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is possible elsewhere, then this strategy could be applied to leaving any Munar body to escape planetary at considerable fuel savings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-12T19:32:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2012 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Limit","CreatedById":34418,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T23:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did alot of testing in 0.16 for slingshots in preparation for interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts all about pre-planning. You need to make sure the moon is in the right place in order to escape kerbin prograde or retrograde (ie head away from the sun or closer to it). I try and get my mun periapsis at about 2km from the surface (as close as possible), then when at mun periapsis I do another burn to get my kerbin preiapis to about 70km (as close as i dare to the atmosphere). Then i finally do a burn a kerbin periapsis depending how far out I want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LegitBro","CreatedById":52801,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T18:59:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhy is your orbital trajectory purple? wait no, why are there 3 of em. the blue line, the yellow line and a purple one. is this a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pwnedbyscope","CreatedById":47191,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T19:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eno. the blue like is the current trajectory, the yellow is munar capture trjectory, and purple is munar escape trajectory\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatisthisidonteven","CreatedById":41660,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T19:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LegitBro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LegitBro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhy is your orbital trajectory purple? wait no, why are there 3 of em. the blue line, the yellow line and a purple one. is this a mod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn his settings.cfg file he has changed CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT = 2 to CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT = 4 or more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Szkeptik","CreatedById":40456,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T19:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to get a higher interplanetary orbit to get to Duna, launch from a 270 degree angle and sligshot as low above munar surface as possible.
