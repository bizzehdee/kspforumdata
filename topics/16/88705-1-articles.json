Are you using SAS to stabilize your rockets? Are there aerodynamic control surfaces in weird places? Are your aerodynamic control surfaces properly placed on the bottom, as far behind CoM as possible? If you haven\u0027t done the tutorials, you should, because they are rather helpful for getting down some of the basics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T00:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you had a contract to test an experimental part, you\u0027ll have it available until you complete the contract.

The most efficient way to do that is to gradually lean further and further as you ascend so that more and more of your thrust is given to horizontal acceleration.

Orbit isn\u0027t about height beyond just getting above the air that\u0027ll slow you down - they\u0027re about horizontal velocity. By the time your rocket\u0027s 40 clicks up you definitely ought to have leaned it over near horizontal by yer own choice, just to be pouring on that horizontal speed.
