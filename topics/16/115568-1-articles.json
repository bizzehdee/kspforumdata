Essentially, if I wanted to refuel a vessel before it carried on. \n\nI\u0027ve seen some photos of players who built landing pads out of large hatches, or built a rover/tug which could position a landed vessel. But I\u0027m curious what other solutions are out there?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T21:37:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spinomonkey**"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T17:17:47Z","Content":"There is the KAS/KIS mod for it\u0027s resource transfer parts - requires an engineer on EVA but if you are building a base, shouldn\u0027t be an issue.

There is a version of the base that inspired mine called Kassandra (Its not called Kassandra!) that has long connectors between each module/habitat that might make it easier to assemble. The base craft files are on here somewhere complete with landers \u0026 boosters I think.\n\nIn the end I installed KIS/KAS and had my engineer hook up a fuel line instead of trying to fly my tanker onto the docking port with RCS and thrusters. I\u0027m about to decommission the base because it keeps suffering from spontaneous explosive deconstruction and replace it with a single module mining rig.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T03:09:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ChrisD**\n  \nIts not called Kassandra"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T12:06:41Z","Content":"The issue there with aligning docking ports comes with heavier vehicles \u0022squatting\u0022 more on their gear, and docking ports not lining up properly and bugging out, which happens far too regularly for my liking.\n\nI\u0027d \u002B1 on KAS. Just put your things near each other and hook up hoses. Have an engineer up there who can attach/detach ports in case you need to muck with things."}]}
