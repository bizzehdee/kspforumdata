The ship on the other side brought the panels and then redocked closer to the crew unit for some EVA fun. I had the great idea to make the solar array symmetrical, so there was quite some mass on both ends. The best way to describe the station was \u0022metronome\u0022. Not a big success. I moved the crew to another station and sent it back into the atmosphere after about 8 in-game-hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what I learned there about building rockets that launch unwieldy stuff, docking unwieldy stuff to even more unwieldy stuff, and avoiding that stuff becomes unwieldy in the first place, will improve my skills in station building for sure. Really, build you own stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s so much more satisfying to do your own thing than to just copy the designs of experienced players.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-20T21:01:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2013 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Chruschtschow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
