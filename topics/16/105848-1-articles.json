Are you clipping any parts? It looks like such down at your engines. That can result in some phantom forces.\n\nAre you sure that\u0027s not the issue? ...Really? Well, I\u0027ll take your word for it.\n\nI\u0027d blame on the aerodynamics, but somehow I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the problem... At least, if you\u0027re not trying any gravity turns.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to tell just from a picture.\n\nUpon launch, look at your torque displays. See them with, and without SAS on. If you see them off center, hit Alt\u002BX to reset them.\n\nI\u0027d go back to the phantom forces idea if that doesn\u0027t work. Perhaps it is somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:57:10Z","Content":"A TWR of 1.6 seems high.

I know you say you have no control but you should have enough that early for a slight turn of say 3-5 degrees. I have launched similar rockets, without clipping the motors, with no control surfaces, no gimballed engine and only SAS for guidance. Really need to watch your speed, try turning early but not too much, then just let it go and handle itself until it clears the lower atmosphere. Took me rather a few tries to get it right."},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:01:47Z","Content":"That payload looks like there are 4 winglets on it clipped in, i think they create some drag and drag on the top isn\u0027t too good to have."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:25:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That payload looks like there are 4 winglets on it clipped in, i think they create some drag and drag on the top isn\u0027t too good to have.\n\nThis is almost certainly the first problem. Those fins create not only drag, but destabilizing lift forces. You need to either put them in a fairing or add fins to the bottom of the rocket. I would recommend at least as many fins on bottom as you have on top, and probably a few extra to be safe. Since you are using fins, you can also turn on the CoM and CoL indicators to help you out.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:57:24Z","Content":"It seems the winglet *was* the problem, thank you!
