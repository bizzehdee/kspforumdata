The TWR is also really important because it gives you information about how quickly your ship can get up into the air. If you got a TWR of 1, your ship can hover. Nothing more, nothing less. With a TWR under 1, it won\u0027t be able to lift or hover, because the weight is to high for the thrust provided by the engines in your stage. A TWR over 1 gives your ship the ability to liftoff, at around 1,6 you get kind of a comfortable liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne personal \u0022rule\u0022 I\u0027ve got for my ships: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stages I use to get in orbit (the stages that lift the rocket in the atmosphere) must have a high TWR, goal is 2, but under 1,4 it gets really uncomfortable when you fly upwards. You should find that out yourself! A rocket with a huge engine and tiny tank for example has a high TWR, which means that it will accelerate really quickly BUT if the TWR is too high, the atmospheric drag will slow you down so your rocket will become ineffective. Experiment around with that a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first tutorial in my signature shows some good ships that also helped me with ship design.

I thought \u0022ohmergawd that yesterday was SOOO close I need MOAAAAAR \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V!!\u0022 so after landing on and setting a collision course on Kerbin I still got about 1.300m/s of \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V left. I\u0027m sure I could\u0027ve gotten to Minmus... My rocket wasn\u0027t really cheap, it costed about 75.000 funds. I still made a lot of profit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m drifting away from the topic.
