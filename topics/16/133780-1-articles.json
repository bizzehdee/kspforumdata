Burns done inside a gravity well are supposed to be more efficient due to the exhaust being left with less total energy, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried nudging the arrival trajectory so that it passes by Jool inside the Laythe orbit. If I do this, I can get into an elliptical orbit touching the orbit of Pol from the inside by doing a retrograde burn at the periapsis with \u003Cstrong\u003E537\u003C/strong\u003E m/s. However, to circularize the resulting elliptical orbit, I need another burn with \u003Cstrong\u003E865\u003C/strong\u003E m/s at the apoapsis. So the total delta-v in this case is \u003Cstrong\u003E1402 \u003C/strong\u003Em/s, which is even higher than 1329 m/s needed for a direct insertion into the Pol orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there anything I am missing here, or is a gravity well generally unusable to get into circular orbits?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T21:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u0027re doing is an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOberth maneuver\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 Unfortunately, Pol is poorly placed for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn Oberth maneuver is good for getting into a very \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E circular orbit-- for example, if you wanted to end up in a circular orbit just above Jool\u0027s atmosphere, you\u0027d want your Jool-approach periapsis to be down there and do your whole burn at periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn Oberth maneuver is also good for getting into a very \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehigh\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E circular orbit-- for example, suppose Pol had an orbit that was waaaaay up near Jool\u0027s SoI boundary, where orbital velocity is only a few meters per second.\u00A0 In that case, an Oberth maneuver would work great:\u00A0 you do your capture burn at a very low Jool periapsis, putting your apoapsis right out by Pol.\u00A0 Then when you coasted up to Ap, you\u0027d have only a very small and cheap circularization burn (since the orbital velocity is so slow up there).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Oberth maneuvers are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E good at is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ein-between\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E circular orbits, which is where Pol is.\u00A0 If you dive low enough to Jool to get a decent Oberth effect for your capture burn, then your resulting ellipse (with its apoapsis at the target orbit) will be so eccentric that you\u0027ll have to do a big circularization burn to match orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, one thing you can do that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E give you quite a boost is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egravity assist\u003C/a\u003E maneuver, using Tylo or Laythe.\u00A0 The idea is to use the heavy moon\u0027s gravity in a sort of \u0022reverse slingshot\u0022 to slow you down enough to capture to the Jool system even without using any rocket power at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example of such a maneuver:\u00A0 approach Jool in such a way that your descending orbit (on your way to Jool Pe) passes right in \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efront\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of (not behind!)

Even if you give Tylo a relatively wide berth (several hundred kilometres), it\u0027ll slow you enough for a Jool capture. Take it too tight in and your periapsis will be inside Laythe\u0027s orbit, which will cost you to raise it back up to Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s very easy to do, but a bit finnicky. Simply drop a maneuvre node about three-quarters of the way to Jool, and play with a combination of radial/prograde burns. Prograde will get you to Jool slightly faster, therefore with Tylo further back in its orbit. Radial in will delay the moment you intersect Jool\u0027s orbit (assuming you\u0027re hitting it straight on, and not after looping behind) and so will bring Tylo further forward in its orbit. It doesn\u0027t matter what kind of intersect you started with, it just takes a few dozen m/s to set up the perfect Tylo encounter to send you wherever you want in the Jool system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
