I am having a problem though with the wings. When I try to attach them at some points they at like it\u0027s on a rounded surface and I am trying to connect them to each other. What I am trying to say is I can\u0027t seem to make what I am looking for because the wings wont respond to the way they should be responding. I know that\u0027s something that would have to be looked at and dealt with over a good time. I would like to make a epic space ship but I can\u0027t yet please help me out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T19:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s generally a mistake to think something that doesn\u0027t \u0022respond to the way they should be responding\u0022 is not working the way it should work.

Make small things that work, get used to what works and how, then improve in the direction that most suits you - smaller, more efficient, longer-range, higher-capacity, cheaper or whatever.
