My question is, how do I implement the numbers on Alex Moon\u0027s site into my maneuver node, particularly things like ejection angle, ejection inclination, and phase angle?

Not in the slightest. It is a valuable TOOL that provides you with an immense amount of information that is otherwise occluded from you. It is also a wonderful teaching tool. It is MY OPINION (yes the caps are intended to show that I am speaking from a perspective of PERSONAL OPINION, and not in anyway, shape, form, function, fashion or thought being nasty, rude or otherwise inconsiderate or fight provocative) that those who call MechJeb cheating, are in fact ashamed that they cannot do in full, or with as much accuracy (when mechjeb isnt being kerbal about things) by hand. I also note that YES, KER does exist and can do SOME of what MechJeb does, BUT, MechJeb is also an autopilot, which is never a bad thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, speaking in dispassionate and factual terms, MechJeb in its AUTOPILOT function, is able to do repetitive tasks, dull, protracted tasks such as 25 minute burns that otherwise must be done constantly by hand, which, is not fun when for example, you are flying a mission to a space station to refuel it, take down science, change crew or what ever menial task that must be performed for the thousandth time. I further show you as example, not even NASA, ESA or JAXA fly 100% operator controlled missions up to the ISS each and every time something needs to either go UP or come back down from Station. MOST if not ALL those sorts of tasks are FULLY AUTOMATED, which by extension, is comparable to someone using MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that I have digressed to an extensive degree, I will address the OP\u0027s post.
