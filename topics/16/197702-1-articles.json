Satellites are extremely light. Small tanks and engines can get them far. It\u0027s actually a bit difficult to design a satellite that can\u0027t get itself to its destination from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. So, I\u0027d say design 2 satellites, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get to their destinations, and just launch them as the payload of your rocket that\u0027s just good enough to get them to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.

If you don\u0027t have fairings (they\u0027re in Payload) then your best bet is to just make the satellites as aerodynamic as possible and maybe put a nosecone on top on top of a decoupler so you can toss it once you get up out of the thick atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

One of those) and if they\u0027re too far apart for that, you can go into map mode, click the one you want to control, and jump to it. As I said in 1. above, it\u0027s very doable, and likely better in this case, to actually have two individual satellites that you send different places from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Popestar","CreatedById":192906,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-26T01:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how to get them into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E from one rocket?\u00A0 Are there special design requirements?\u00A0 How do you launch them from a rocket?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-26T01:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223872781\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221603676653\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022192906\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Popestar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n48 minutes ago, Popestar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how to get them into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E from one rocket?\u00A0 Are there special design requirements?\u00A0 How do you launch them from a rocket?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the top down, nosecone, decoupler, okto with some solar panels on the side, whatever the contract requires, fuel tank, engine, decoupler, okto with some solar panels on the side, whatever the second contract requires, fuel tank, engine, decoupler, then the launcher rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make sure that each \u0022okto, extras, tank, engine\u0022 by itself has - say - 2000 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and you should be able to complete any contract Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that doesn\u0027t require a retrograde or super tilted orbit.
