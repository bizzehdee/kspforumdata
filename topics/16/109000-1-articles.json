But since the release, it seems like the contracts are asking for impossible things... here is an example:\n\nBUILD A NEW ORBITAL STATION AROUND KERBIN:\n\n-Have a facility supporting at least thirteen kerbals\n\n-Have a research lab at the station\n\n-Have a viewing cupola at the station\n\n-Have 4,000 units of liquid fuel in your station\n\nand the usual orbital station requierements (antenna docking port, etc.)\n\n13 kerbals?! 4k of liquid fuel?!?! :confused:Thats a lot! Now, I\u0027m not sure if I can make this contract with multiple launches... but considering how little they pay (190k), I think this contract just doesn\u0027t make any sense.\n\nAlso, this requirements wont let you make your stations the way you want.\n\nSo straight to the point, I have 2 questions:\n\nCan I achieve this contracts with multiple launches?\n\nCan I modify the requirements of this contracts to fulfill my desires?\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T14:14:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aristizabal95**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T04:17:42Z","Content":"That isn\u0027t too far fetched.

Now it makes more sense!\n\nThis also works for surface outposts?\n\nAnd if I wanted to modify the contract, how could I do it?? Just so I can remove the lab or cupola, since they really reduce my liberty to create something useful for my stations/bases, also I hate having like three labs on the same base!\n\nWould I have to modify the persistent? Is there a way to do it in the debug menu?\n\nThanks again"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:02:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the fast reply!

I use mine to do science while unlocking the tech tree, and to move groups of tourists around in system.\n\nThe downside is managing it all, it can get quite involved.
