The thing with interplanetary travel is that the exact fuel cost depends strongly on the alignment of the planets at the time of your ejection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying to another planet is essentially a really big, really time consuming rendezvous maneuver - it\u0027s the same as flying from Mun to Minmus (or vice versa). If you played this long, you\u0027re of course aware that smaller orbits go faster and larger orbits go slower. Therefore, the inner planets orbit the sun faster than Kerbin, and the outer planets orbit slower. This in turn means that at the time of launch, an inner planet you want to go to needs to be \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E Kerbin, and an outer planet you want to go to needs to be \u003Cem\u003Eahead\u003C/em\u003E of Kerbin. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47133-KSP-Planetary-Transfer-Quick-Reference-Chart-Now-Combined!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAs you can see here\u003C/a\u003E, if you want to go to Jool, you should launch roughly when Jool is just over \u0022three hours\u0022, or a quarter way around the sun, ahead of Kerbin. This will allow you to perform a nice, cheap Homann transfer with no need to overshoot Jool\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you have reached such a favorable alignment of planets, launch your rocket into a nice equatorial Kerbin orbit. The more equatorial, the better. Then, create a maneuver node, use \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E prograde dV, and drag the node around. Do this until your projected orbit when viewed from top down just touches the orbit of Jool, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E your exit vector from Kerbin is pointing straight ahead in Kerbin\u0027s direction of travel (if you were going towards the inner planets, it would be pointing straight backwards). You may potentially get an encounter (or at least, close approach markers) at this point already, but this isn\u0027t always the case, especially when there are inclination differences between Kerbin\u0027s orbit and that of the target. If you don\u0027t get anything, don\u0027t despair; you are still incredibly close, the alignment of planets guarantees it. Also remember to select Jool as your target so you can actually see the close approach markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s two ways you can adjust your inclination. One is a midcourse correction maneuver, using a second maneuver node. It can be very useful when your target orbit differs strongly in inclination and eccentricity (Moho, Eeloo). However, Jool\u0027s orbit is nice and well behaved, so you can easily fly a ballistic trajectory (all in one burn) instead. Because you are already spending thousands of dV prograde in your first maneuver node, you can get a certain amount of normal/antinormal adjustment essentially \u0022for free\u0022 (especially since you\u0027re getting a lot of Oberth effect from Kerbin). Just try and play with the purple markers; you\u0027ll notice that you chan lift/lower your orbit a lot with nearly no change in dV cost. Do this until you get an encounter. If the alignment is right, it should only take a few nudges in the right direction before (at minimum) the close approach markers show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have your encounter (any encounter), click on the Jool periapsis marker to make the number readout sticky. Now play gently with all six markers (radial in/out is fine to use at this point) in order to get your periapsis as low as possible. Anyting below 20,000km is good, 2,000km is excellent, 200km is perfect (it\u0027s almost touching the atmosphere at that point). Also, you may want to focus Jool at this point and make sure that your projected flyby is equatorial and counterclockwise (running behind the planet). If you later brake into orbit that way, you\u0027ll have an easy time visiting the moons. You can still access your maneuver node while you have Jool focused, with a bit of clicking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen all you need to do is perform the burn... and afterwards check how much of an adjustment you need to make, because even minor imprecisions in the burn can cause large periapsis deviations or even make you miss the encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and don\u0027t timewarp through SoI changes.
