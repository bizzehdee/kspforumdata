Being that he was the first kerbal to even touch the ground on duna, I\u0027m a little heistant to kill him. But I also have the big 3 in orbit of duna, out of fuel, but with a re-fueler on the way to come and push them home (first serious try at docking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, up until this point, every time I tried to get an intercept has met with disaster.
