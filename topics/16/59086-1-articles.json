I decided while trying to go to the moon I would play with bigger rockets for inter-planetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have created a fairly large rocket that now I am obsessed with getting to work. I built it in 4 stages. 1- Lifter, 2- Upper atmosphere, 3- Orbital maneuvering/Orbital escape, 4- Payload/lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally built the rocket in its respective stages, saved them as subassemblies and built the rocket. The problem I have with this is that for some weird reason the 2nd stage acts like the layer of rockets below it in the first stage are not even there and fall right through the first stage and epic explosion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI originally thought that this was because of minute mismatching of tanks and rebuilt extra meticulously paying attention to detail... Again, same results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then tried building the same rocket all together and then I have issues with the 4 corner rockets not properly separating from the lower stage and they won\u0027t work rendering my 2nd stage useless... It is mildly possible I have that part of the staging wrong but I do not believe so I checked it rather meticulously as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few questions... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1: Are big rockets always this much of a monumental pain to build?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2: any ideas/suggestions what may be happening and how I can fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3: any good resources on some basic tips and tricks to look at how to build/plan bigger rockets multiple stages etc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a screenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a64/jessyager/TestRocket.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TestRocket.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T21:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a fairly large rocket, and you are likely over-loading it. What is the G meter reading when you experience the failure? It\u0027s kind of hard to see in that pic, but do you have any struts running across the stage divisions?
