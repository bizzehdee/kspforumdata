Watch on the map and provided you have enough fuel you should see your orbit extend until it intersects with that of the Mun and changes colour. Time accelerate until you get to the point where you enter the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (the orbit path will change to blue, and be shown relative to the Mun instead of relative to Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get to the Mun, you will be on a flyby trajectory. Wait until you get to the periapsis point (it\u0027s marked on the orbital track) and burn retrograde (backwards!) until you see the orbital path change from a flyby to an orbit. Keep burning retrograde until the orbit is roughly circular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding is trickier - ideally you should start from a low orbit (say 20km x 20km) and burn retrograde until your horizontal velocity drops to zero; you\u0027re now falling towards the surface of the moon. Your velocity vector will start to point more or less straight down. You can bring your ship to a dead halt (hovering above the moon) but you should let it fall downwards at a steady rate. I\u0027d say use your engine to keep your downwards speed about 50ms-1. When you see the landscape getting close (you may see your ship\u0027s shadow) slow the rate of descent down to about 20ms-1; when you\u0027re very close, bring the speed below 12ms-1 and as you get to the landing bring the speed down to about 1 or 2ms-1 only.

Launch it going northward and get into a polar orbit. Once you\u0027re in polar orbit, begin making EVA reports over Kerbin\u0027s various biomes (and do a crew report for good measure too). Re-enter when you\u0027ve got as much as you want.

My biggest fight was trying to get the guy back, but then suddenly losing control of my ship because the lander didn\u0027t use engines that had alternators to replenish the energy. Once you\u0027ve got those, you\u0027re golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo using double-stacks of liquid fuel (assuming you haven\u0027t unlocked the long one yet) here\u0027s how I set up my phases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 1: The \u0022pod\u0022 with a butt-load of parachutes. At least 3. I\u0027ve tried using 1 before, but it often doesn\u0027t create enough drag to slow down the pod enough, and the parachute gets ripped off instead. Nothing worse than losing the pod at the VERY END of an otherwise successful mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 2: \u0022Pod\u0022 engine. Very small fuel tank, very small engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 3: The lander itself. A wider base made of 4 of the second to the smallest fuel cells and the smallest engines is easier to land than a tall, skinny lander. Keep the weight as low as possible, and the legs as far apart as you can. Use at least 4 or the slopes will get ya every time. ADD LIGHTS pointing down to the lander itself. This will help with landing considerably. What\u0027s more, try to put them \u0022behind\u0022 the legs of the craft so the legs will cast a shadow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 4: Double-stack of the \u0022medium\u0022 fuel cells, or one of the long ones if you\u0027ve unlocked them. The engine I use is the second one you unlock that has the ability to much better control the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 5: Another of the above, but immediately below it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 6: 4 of the above, but put AROUND the rocket for phase 4 with the lateral decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 7: A buttload of rockets. You\u0027ll need struts to really make this stable, but if you haven\u0027t unlocked them yet, you can be REAL careful with your throttle control and get this thing into the air till it burns out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase 8: A bigger buttload. At this point, you hit the point of diminishing returns (and you\u0027ll NEED struts) so it\u0027s totally optional. I\u0027ve actually had better luck with some designs without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing only some of the base stock stuff, you can get there using this kinda rig, but the trick is in conserving fuel as much as possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Phases through 4 will be used JUST getting your orbit around Kerbin steady, and then the remainder of the fuel in phase 4 will be used to get you to the Mun. Start by burning through phases up to phase 5 to get you to 50K (just out of the atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * At this point, turn to the horizon line at exactly 90 degrees (270 uses more fuel) and fire through the phase. You should have a pretty decent Apoapsis near 100K now, so kill the engines and wait until you\u0027re close to it, then fire through half of phase 3 to make it circular. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Now set up your waypoint, and play with it until you figure out the optimal position to get your Mun Periapsis AS CLOSE TO THE MUN AS POSSIBLE! (I mention this because I didn\u0027t even know the waypoint system existed until my 2nd day playing). This will not only make things FAR easier, but will significantly save on fuel. You save more fuel the closer you are to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * When you get there, use the remainder of phase 4 to come to a screeching halt. You\u0027ll probably have to burn through it, then even use some of your lander\u0027s fuel. You want to come to as close to 0 m/s as possible so you\u0027ll drop straight down and not have to do too much correction of your lateral movement when you get close. AS SOON AS YOU get rid of phase 4, and you\u0027re on the lander phase, press \u0022ALT \u002B L\u0022 to \u0022lock\u0022 your phases, so you don\u0027t accidentally hit the space bar in a panic and blow the whole mission! Turn on your lights, and drop your landing gear. (Does anyone else\u0027s game start with the landing gear \u0022down\u0022 even though it\u0027s not really?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Make sure to use ONLY the navball to control it. I crashed a bazillion times trying to \u0022control the lander\u0022 instead of using the navball. Keep an eye on the navball, and only occasionally glance at the lander to see how \u0022close\u0022 you are. Use the retrograde marker in the navball zealously to make sure you have zero lateral movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * At 50K meters, do a burn to drop your speed to about 50 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Do this again at 10k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * And again at 4K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * By around 2.5K, it\u0027s time to keep your speed no faster than about 60 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * As SOON as you see the lights hit the ground, you\u0027re close. You\u0027ll be making out individual rocks and debris on the ground. Drop your speed to 10 m/s and use the CAPSLOCK key to give yourself more fine-tuned control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * KEEP AN EYE ON THAT RETROGRADE. Lateral movement will kill you. When your landing lights get super bright (you\u0027ll probably even be casting a shadow at this point, and can now use that to determine how close you are).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this method, I have about a 100% success rate for landings on both the Mun and Minimus. (Minimus is far easier.) But then you gotta get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the lander\u0027s fuel to jet you into the air, and get you moving around the Mun. You don\u0027t really need an sort of fancy maneuver here, as pretty much ANYTHING that gets you away from the Mun\u0027s orbit is going to catch you in Kerbin\u0027s orbit. You\u0027ll probably run out of fuel and have to dump the lander parts at this point, but you\u0027ll be good with just a minimal engine and amount of fuel. Once you\u0027re in a massive, wide orbit around Kerbin, you don\u0027t even have to wait until you\u0027re at any particular position to start a retrograde burn. Zoom in on Kerbin\u0027s Periapsis side, and once again, using the CAPSLOCK to give you fine tuned control, slow yourself down until you\u0027re within about 35K meters of Kerbin\u0027s surface with your Periapsis. This will cause you to do an \u0022aerobrake\u0022 (using the friction from Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to slow you down). After passing through the atmosphere about 3 times you\u0027ll slow down enough without having to even use the engines to start a final descent. At this point, if you want, you can use the remaining fuel to try and control the general area you land in. Oceans are better, because you get further to fall meaning more time for the drag on your ship to slow you down. Dump the rest of the rocket, and deploy all the chutes on your pod when you\u0027re down to about 700k (keeping the ship together until then will provide more drag, though I\u0027m not sure if the mass negates that). Popping at least 3 of them when you\u0027re down to about 700 m/s should provide enough drag to get you into the \u0022safe\u0022 zone before they fully deploy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m sure someone else has written a far more concise and understandable \u0022tutorial\u0022 but that\u0027s my 2 cents from another newbie!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T12:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Javin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tanelorn","CreatedById":100167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T23:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

Assuming you\u0027re using SRV Ron\u0027s design, you\u0027ve definitely got a craft that can do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I typically do one stock: straight up to 10,000 meters, turn 090 at 45 degrees elevation, stay there until you\u0027re 35 seconds from Apoapsis, then turn and follow the prograde marker. Return to 45 degrees if you fall below 30 seconds to apoapsis. If you go over a minute to Apoapsis, turn and fly along the horizon. After the turn at 10k, keep your gee meter right at the top of the green zone and throttle back if necessary. Stop your burn when the Apoapsis reaches 100,000 and your altitude is at 60k, 110,000 at 50k at 130,000 at 40k or 200,000 at 30k. Set up a maneuver node at the Apoapsis once you\u0027re in space (above 70k), and perform your circularization burn such that half of it happens before the node and the other half happens afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that close to what you\u0027re doing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nothing wrong with unmanned flight - the only thing I\u0027d suggest is if you decide you want to use the same design for a manned flight later on, you should add some ballast to offset the difference in mass. For example, a Mk1 Command Pod has a mass of 0.8 tonnes, a Stayputnuk 0.05. So you need to add 0.75 tonnes of extra weight to ensure it has the same flight characteristics. Five Goo Containers weigh that much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T19:29:09Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Belgiumruler","CreatedById":101631,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T19:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eokay, after another try, I missed the moon by, let\u0027s say 2 million km and, now I am in an orbit around the sun....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T19:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could try this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVPMTQfOvYQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith your tech level you might need to use a few different parts but it should be possible to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T19:33:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javin","CreatedById":101637,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T20:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Belgiumruler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Belgiumruler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eokay, after another try, I missed the moon by, let\u0027s say 2 million km and, now I am in an orbit around the sun....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELMAO!
