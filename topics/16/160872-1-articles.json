Oh, men.. what an action it was! 135 ton rocket full of fuel, space for 5 more kerbals, solar panels (there is always not enough power for the lab), 8 monoprop tanks, newly discovered gravioli detector, all controlled by a probe core (Kerbals need rescue missions). The start was a great test for my \u0022launch2\u0022 kOS program. In mere 3 orbits the \u0022extension\u0022 was 2 km from the station, 60m/s relative speed.The docking was a masterpiece!

Your contract specified the name of the station, and it sounds like the station lost its name when the attachment docked.
