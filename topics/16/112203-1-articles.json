I heard that there is a memory leak from PPFX, but I thought the temp gauge one was it\u0027s own memory leak?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T22:11:03Z","Content":"They seem to be different, IME. I was under the impression that it was the PPFX that caused leaky memory, and indeed when I disabled it the out of memory crashes disappeared for my smaller craft. But when I used a larger craft that had more parts that got into critical temperature ranges I started getting crashes again. So now I run with PPFX off and only enable the gauges for a few moments at a time to check temps.\n\nThis can\u0027t be fixed soon enough, we need some indication of heating problems before parts explode. Hopefully 1.0.3 nips it in the bud."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:37:10Z","Content":"I recommend the [Critical Temperature Gauge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119686) mod to replace the default temperature gauges without leaking memory, and [Temperature Gauge Killer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731) to keep the default ones off unless requested (F10)."}]}
