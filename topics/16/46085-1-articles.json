If the first stage has 12 orange tanks worth of fuel, how much fuel should the second stage have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very complicated question. There are two ways to answer it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first way is to do a bit of math. The first point to think about is to ensure that you have sufficient thrust-to-weigh ratio in each stage. As a general rule of thumb when starting out, each stage should have a thrust to weight ratio of somewhere between 1.5 and 2. The easiest way to figure out if your rocket is \u0022correct\u0022 according to this rule of thumb is to install the kerbal engineer redux mod. This mod will add a little information panel inside the VAB which will tell you the thrust to weight ratio of each stage, as well as the delta-v in each stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other way is (in my opinon) more fun: Just try it and see! Build a few different designs changing things around until the rocket behaves the way you want it to behave. After a few tries you will get a \u0022gut feel\u0022 for the basic design and then you can go crazy imagining new and interesting ways to make your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
