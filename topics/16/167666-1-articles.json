Try moving the mechanism to move the shaft so it spins more freely. Sometimes the rotation is just not fast enough due to slight clipping, something which is hard to eyeball when it\u0027s rotating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRPM is based on the total amount of reaction wheels, how freely the shaft turns and the angle on the propeller blades.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt could also simply be that your craft is to heavy. Try to make a subassembly with a large fuel tank and attach the propeller to it. Spin it up, then keep adding/reducing weight until it lifts of vertically to determine the actual thrust produced. Compare that thrust to your vessels weight.
