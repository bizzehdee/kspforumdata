Docking itself i can handle, but i don\u0027t know how much fuel i\u0027ll need to get my habitation module and docked. my module itself consists of three 2.5m battery banks, samwiched between two hitch hiker storage containers, a rockomax brand adapter on either end and a clamp-o-tron on the end of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS:does Mechjeb 2.0 include a working interplanetary autopilot and, back on topic, how reliable is the docking automaton?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberick","CreatedById":65954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T22:27:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to get into orbit around Kerbin requires approximately 4500 delta v. To reach a 400km orbit should require a few hundred more, so try to give your vehicle 5500-6000 d/v and that should do it. My recommendation would be to bring a little extra fuel if you use your station for refueling. . . it can\u0027t hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miketheveeg","CreatedById":59572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T22:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TerrificToby\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TerrificToby\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS:does Mechjeb 2.0 include a working interplanetary autopilot and, back on topic, how reliable is the docking automaton?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the docking autopilot and shut it off as it wasnt going where it should have and gave up and been docking myself these days\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit : opinion: didnt like auto-dock.. just been trying damn hard to make my RCS center of gravity\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SouthPhilly","CreatedById":62599,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T22:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t really give you an answer as to figure out how much fuel you will need to get your station part where you need it to be. The answer depends on a lot more info than you gave...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like how much does the payload weight, what motor you\u0027re planning to use and a bunch of other factors. The biggest thing is getting the payload to orbit... after that most orbital maneuvers really don\u0027t need a lot of fuel to complete if you think out what your going to do and in what order. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general setup for putting up station parts is to have a 3 stage lifter thats usually a 2.5m main core with 2 large SRB\u0027s and 3rd stage to circularize my orbit.

I let MJ get me to a 100k orbit then I hook up a unmanned tug(I\u0027ve got 3 in orbit at all times) that consists of the docking port with the cover, and a KW 2.5m RCS tank, KW 2.5m Fuel tank, can\u0027t remember the motor I used but you don\u0027t need anything big and some other pieces to make it look pretty and work. I keep the tugs fueled up by transferring fuel from the 3rd stage tanks (always remembering to leave enough fuel to deorbit the 3rd stage), then I kick off the 3rd stage and send it home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I use MJ to raise orbit to either 10km above or below the target stations orbit to get myself with in a km of it. Then I use MJ to match velocities and get me to about 100m\u0027s. Then most of the time I just dock myself. But MJ does a nice job at docking, a little to slow for me. But it does it good and clean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick question... what are you planning on doing with 3 2.5m battery stacks!!!! Thats a lot of uneeded wait... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
