The wolfhound has a thrust of 375 KN, or 37.5 tons (it\u0027s easier to think the thrust in tons). To have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E 2, you can lift 18.75 tons. 3.3 tons are the engine itself, so you have room for 15.45 tons of fuel. Of course 1/9\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E of that will be the weight of the fuel tanks, so 1.72 tons of fuel tanks. Your ship will have a dry weight of 3.3\u002B1.72=5.02 tons, and a wet mass of 18.75 tons. Apply the rocket equation, 380*9,81*ln(18.75/5.02) = 4912 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClose enough to make it viable.

It\u0027s up to specifications. If you want more dry mass, you have to add proportionally more wolfhounds and fuel. Yes, the weight escalates quite fast. For example, if you want a large convert-o-tron and 2 drills, that\u0027s 7 tons. 10 rtgs to use it with some speed, a couple large reaction wheels to have some manueverability, and a Mk3 command pod, that\u0027s close to a 10 tons payload.
