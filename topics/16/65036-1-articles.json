Therefore, I try to avoid this problem as much as possible, and minimize it when its unavoidable. The best way to avoid the problem is by never trying to translate an assembly, just individual modules. Thus, when assembling 3 or more modules, the previously assembled part is the passive ship and the incoming module is the active ship. I also try to design things so the need to dock completed assemblies together is eliminated as much as possible. When I have to do this, I minimize the balance issue by trying to make the assemblies as balanced as possible. This is fairly easy to do if you keep the design of the assemblies within reasonable size limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this leads me to doing flotillas instead of single monster ships. For instance, when building a station at some other planet, I send each module separately and assemble them on location. Each station module goes out as a 3-module, linearly connected ship: payload, fuel, and engines. The payload and engines weigh about the same and the fuel goes in the middle. Such ships are usually balanced well enough that they translate with only a slight tendency to rotate, which is easily dealt with. If for some reason it\u0027s not well-balanced, no biggie because the station module by itself is perfectly balanced; the fuel and engines aren\u0027t going to be part of the station anyway. So once this gets to the destination, I can separate the station module and dock it no problems at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T13:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m trying to do is design a large modular ship, with interchangeable engines (because I haven\u0027t gotten my nuclear ones yet), and a separate truss to accommodate an indefinite number of unpowered dockable fuel tanks to arbitrarily extend the range of the ship.

There is just one trick you need to know, and the whole thing becomes about as easy (or as hard) and as efficient as docking with balanced RCS. Unless you are doing something terribly wrong, even the most badly imbalanced monster is going to have balanced RCS on its main axis of thrust. So instead of translating in arbitrary directions, you just rotate the craft and translate on that axis, until you have almost reached the destination. Then you turn to face the docking port, thrust forward, and dock. The final corrections with imbalanced RCS may look interesting or even alarming, but all you really need is a bit of patience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4rt14n","CreatedById":101179,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T13:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might need to use them in pairs..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T14:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... you just rotate the craft and translate on that axis, until you have almost reached the destination...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...
