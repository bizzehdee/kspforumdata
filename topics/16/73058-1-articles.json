Also, try not to have big pieces sticking out sideways, or if you must consider putting engines on them so the thrust is spread out instead of all in one place. If you do have one main engine section, try and have \u0022control from here\u0022 set on a part close to it, either a probe core placed for the purpose or else the docking point that joins it to the module in front, that way SAS responds to the motion of the engine section and ignores the rest of the ship flexing. For long slender ships, pulling can be more stable than pushing, but remember to lock the gimbal on puller engines because SAS gets confused by them. And watch your reaction wheel placement, and consider disabling wheels on your payloads that you don\u0027t need when doing the transfer.

Using a cluster of ion engines on a big ship is perfectly possible but results in a high part count since the stock ion parts are so tiny. For small ships making short journeys, say to the Mun, though a lighter chemical engine like the LV-909 or Rockomax 48-7S can work out better, while for small ships making longer journeys the ion engines are very viable, just watch out for darkness stopping your burns. For very large ships or impatient people, the KR-2L can be a good choice due to its high thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T17:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEfficiency of engines from best to worst (imo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuke rockets (NERVA)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel Booster\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbodyne single bell (KR-2L) -Best capital cruiser engine IMO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E//below this point your mileage may vary and you may think one engine is better than another and thats OK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax small single thruster (forgot the designation but it\u0027s the one that weighs .1 tons) -Best engine for small non-planetary landers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax Poodle -third best lander engine... for when your lander is huge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax Skipper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELv 909 -second best lander engine behind the rocomax above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELv T30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELv T45\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbodyne 4-bell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocomax Mainsail\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWonder why you see those Thrust to Weight ratios in Kerbal Engineer for other planets/moons? That\u0027s because you need to beat that TWR to get off that planet/moon. In space there is no TWR but having a high TMR (which is roughly equivalent to what you see on kerbin) means you can stack more fuel to use it up and result in higher deltaV than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile you could get 8k delta V from a stack of NERVAS you could get 12k from a stack of KR2Ls and enough gas in front of them. Here are some of my high deltaV motor designs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKR-2L and that huge kerbodyne tank: 5k dV for a modest payload and a decent TWR. You could potentially see 8k with 2 of the huge tanks if you don\u0027t care how fast you get to where you\u0027re going. This design can single move up to a class C asteroid with 800 deltaV attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV909 and FL800: comes in at around 4k deltaV and stacks easily under the tri-stack adapter.
