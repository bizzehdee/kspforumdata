Crew Manifest is the only plug-in I run these days. Everything else is stock, but I still find Crew Manifest to be insanely useful. All you do is download the folder and then put that folder in the GameData directory, next to the Squad folder. It simply gives you a little icon to click that lets you move crew around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is better than the current astronaut complex because you can create your own kerbals, and give them good names like Neil Kerman, Buzz Kerman, Sally Kerman, Valentina Kerman, and of course Maynard G Kerman. And you can move kerbals off of vehicles while on the launch pad, or add them. How many ships have you hit LAUNCH only to realize you forgot to add someone from the astronaut complex? And finally, you can move crew between pods. So very, very, nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the plunge on this one. Trust me. So good, so easy, and probably should be implemented as stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jananton","CreatedById":83920,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T22:31:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I wasn\u0027t completely honest when I said I use no plugins/mods yet, I use \u0027Kerbal Engineer Redux\u0027 to get a feel for the contraptions I build, so in a way you\u0027ve got me convinced to try this one out as well. ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand with the next version out today I probably have a look what\u0027s under the hood in that one first. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJan\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
