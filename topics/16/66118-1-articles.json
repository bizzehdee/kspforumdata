For this, the passenger section must be attached to the back of the cockpit if there is one. It should work during the upper-atmosphere part of the ascent and during reentry. It consists of the cockpit separating using a chunk of sepatrons (and maybe letting some control surfaces go with it for steering), and after decelerating deploying a drogue chute to kill horizontal velocity; after that, when it stops flying and starts falling, main chutes semi-deploy and then deploy to generate a soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T09:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does no one rate this idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T09:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the general consensus is \u0022it sounds cool, go ahead and build it\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T11:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy don\u0027t you consolidate your ideas into one thread?

Give it some time. Consolidation is a good idea also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape systems are handy, but you do need to ensure you have some way of giving the escape piece a push after separation. If you just decouple, the escape pod can get caught up, especially if there are engines firing. So your sepratrons are a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso think about escaping at low altitude.

This will ensure that once decoupled, the two parts will part ways even if they might be going the same direction. The separators will push a gap between the parts and air resistance will take care of the rest. Don\u0027t put separators facing just forwards and backwards, make them split the two parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: this way you only need minimum amount of separators as the tiniest gap will be torn apart by the air resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T14:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice design tip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T18:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdea: add a truss, with an SRB at an angle, to pull it out of a crash\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T19:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m the sort of player that likes to over do my designs, with failsafes, and backups for any situations. Most of my SSTO\u0027s come with ejection systems, in case the plane is unstable, or unable to land. The biggest one I\u0027ve done is very similar to your idea. It was an failed SSTO shuttle design that used sepretrons to eject, a decoupler and a chute. Fairly basic stuff, but I haven\u0027t gone much bigger, as I always contested:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NASA space shuttle didn\u0027t have an ejection system, so why should mine lol.
