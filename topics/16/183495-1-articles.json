Although I do not get slow as I see. but it is yellow. Thank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-07T04:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m not sure what you mean by weather numbers. Do you mean the time/date numbers in the upper left? Green means the game is keeping up with the frame rate. Yellow means the physics calculations are starting to lag\u00A0behind, so the frame rate (frames per second) slows down a little, but you may not notice.\u00A0Red is when there are so many calculations going on (high part count crafts) that the frame rate gets choppy, and may better expressed as \u201Cseconds per frame\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
