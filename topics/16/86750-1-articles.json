Some people add up to about 15 intakes per engine but this looks silly or can lead to needing to clip many parts inside of each other thus enticing the Kracken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always stick at least on nuke on an SSTO so that I can do orbit alterations or deorbit burns for half the fuel BUT this is only worth it on larger SSTO\u0027s as on smaller ones the mass of the nuke (2.5) is more than the fuel mass you save. You need to have at least 2.5 tons of fuel left before this helps. You can however use the nuke in the assent burn (after running out of air) as past about 2k the nuke is a better rocket than anything else that uses oxidiser.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the Rapiers as they tend to have a much lower burnout ratio than turbo jets. As long as you don\u0027t give them access to all your fuel they can also give you the thrust to get out of most of the atmo. With the new (ish 0.24) nacelles I build rapier nacelles with one nacelle, one FLT-200 tank, one rapier and one ram intake. This doesn\u0027t give them quite enough air or liquid fuel but you can make some intake nacelles and pump some fuel from them and just generally customise from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like to add a few reaction wheels to keep the craft steady and also to point it\u0027s nose upward for the escape burn. Quite often at high speed the momentum forward is so strong that getting the craft to turn more than 20 degrees upwards a problem and you use a lot of rocket fuel burning forwards in the atmosphere rather than upwards out of it. The more you turn upwards the less air goes to the intakes so starting the turn ends your air breathing mode and you want to get out of the atmo as fast as possible before it saps your forward momentum or you use rocket fuel to fight it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ebut if you\u0027re so happy with rockets why not simply SSTO with them?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps for the same reason I started building them. After a while I realised I hadn\u0027t built any and it was a skill I wanted. Rockets can build fast and heavy SSTO\u0027s but they aren\u0027t much of a challenge once you have them learned. The other point is that without mods, landing an SSTO rocket on the runway or landing pad of KSC in carrier mode is very VERY hard. My deorbit burns usually only put me within 2-20k of KSC and I then fly my SSTO or shuttle back to the landing pad. This kind of distance is very inefficient with a rocket SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T11:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022joethebeast22\u0022 data-cite=\u0022joethebeast22\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emy rocket game is off the chart, too comfy with rockets, and i have been going through dozens of SSTO\u0027s, and for them to either lose air at the end of the climb and spin out of control, or spending all the fuel getting to orbit OR once in orbit, only running on fumes and not being able to do anything but retro fire to get home :/ need help and tips here, thanks guys, i have been trying oh so very hard for months, with little to no success :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a long-time rocket guy/newish spaceplane guy, so I am sympathetic. Air-breathing spaceplanes are a good bit different from pure rockets both in construction and ascent path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy observations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The advice about intake/engine ratio and order of placement given above is good. However, it will not prevent asymmetric thrust but instead delay it until later in the climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Intakes are draggy. If possible, place them behind the CoM to increase stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- About one turbojet per 10 tons or so of total vessel mass is a good rule of thumb for beginners. More mass per engine can be made to work but is more challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More SAS makes asymmetric thrust easier to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Action groups are nearly essential. One to toggle the air-breathing engines, one to toggle the rockets, and one to toggle the intakes. If using Rapiers, disable automatic mode switching and use an action group to toggle modes (the automatic mode is very conservative and switches to rocket mode too early for my taste).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ascent profile is different from a rocket. I\u0027ve had good success with: Climb at around 45 degrees until about 15km, then level off. At 20km your climb rate should be less than 100m/s, by 30km it should be less than 20m/s or so. This is where the plane builds its speed to near-orbital velocities. Alt-right click the engines and watch their thrusts carefully, when one drops below the other(s) throttle back a bit until it returns to even. Repeat until there is not enough air to keep running the engine at all (usually at ~55km altitude/~2300m/s orbital speed), then shut them down. Close intakes and coast to AP (should be well out of atmo) and perform the small circularization burn with rockets (usually 100m/s or less).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Designs with only one air-breathing engine are much easier to manage because there is no thrust asymmetry. Start with a small design, just enough to carry a crew without payload to orbit until you get the hang of the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this advice applies to the stock aerodynamic model, if you use FAR/NEAR things are a bit different.

IOW, you have a payload you want to get to LKO. You can either put it in a spaceplane or stack it atop an orange tank and Mainsail. But just as you don\u0027t expect to take the Mainsail with you to another planet, same goes for the spaceplane. So bottom line, the typical spaceplane can\u0027t do much more than get itself and its payload to LKO. After that, the payload needs some other way to get to its ultimate destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, of course it IS possible to get spaceplanes to other planets, but it\u0027s usually not worth the hassle unless the spaceplane itself is the mission payload, like to fly around on Laythe. There are a bunch of ways to do this, none of which are particularly good, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERefueling the spaceplane in LKO. This is limited by the efficiency of the spaceplane\u0027s rockets and its rocket fuel capacity. RAPIERs suck at efficiency, 909s are better, but you\u0027re still not going to have a lot of transfer delta-v this way and you\u0027ll definintely need to refuel again at your destination.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUsing LVNs as the spaceplane rockets, but their weight and low thrust limits the size of the spaceplane and any payload it can carry.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUsing ion engines on the spaceplane for transfer burns. This has the least impact on the size of the spaceplane and its payload but results in horribly long transfer burns.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDocking a transfer tug to the spaceplane.

And in any case, the only stock cargo bay is the new SP\u002B Mk2 thing in 0.25, which only holds 1.25m parts and a 1-man lander can won\u0027t even fit inside without poking through the top and bottom. So unless you go with B9 or whatever, you can\u0027t use a spaceplane to carry any significant payload anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the bottom line on spaceplanes is that they should be viewed primarily as a complicated, time-consuming way to get relatively small payloads (probe satellites or multiple Kerbals) to LKO. This is all they can reasonably be expected to do, and even this requires way more design effort and playing time both ascending and landing than you\u0027d spend lifting the same load on a rocket. It\u0027s possible to make spaceplanes that can do more than this, but the hassle involved increases exponentially with the spaceplane\u0027s utility. There\u0027s really no trick to building SSTO spaceplanes; once you\u0027ve done it once, you\u0027ll have no trouble in the future. The main reason most folks don\u0027t use spaceplanes is because of their limited payload capacity, the time they consume, or both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T13:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022joethebeast22\u0022 data-cite=\u0022joethebeast22\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emy rocket game is off the chart, too comfy with rockets, and i have been going through dozens of SSTO\u0027s, and for them to either lose air at the end of the climb and spin out of control, or spending all the fuel getting to orbit OR once in orbit, only running on fumes and not being able to do anything but retro fire to get home :/ need help and tips here, thanks guys, i have been trying oh so very hard for months, with little to no success :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen there myself - I can/have rocketed to Jool and back but still have issues with spaceplanes.

Things that should fly, won\u0027t and things that shouldn\u0027t do. The biggest thing I can suggest for those who want to build planes is NEAR or FAR, because only with one of those will the plane fly as you would expect it to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor engines, your going to have a few of options, you can use an dual mode like Rapiers, but you can also build with separate rockets. The key is avoiding asymmetrical thrust when one flames out. The problem is you must have your thrust centered with the CoM so you end up with either 2 jets 1 rocket, or two rockets, 1 jet (at least till you get to bigger, more complicated designed). 2 jets give you more power if the plane is bigger, but you have to manually shut off the engines to avoid flameout. 1 jet is less powerfull but you can allow the jet flame out on it\u0027s own without consequence. Rapiers, 48-7S, and Toroidal Aerospikes are your best rocket options. You can of course use any engine but these will offer the best fuel efficiency without overloading the plane (like an LV-N would) and you don\u0027t need a lot of power because your jet engines do all the atmospheric work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E LV-1R and 24-77 make good counter rotation engines. While in space, some planes have a tendency to want to rotate hard because the wing, tail, or jet position raises or lowers the CoM. It\u0027s a symtom of only being symmetrical in one direction, unlike a round rocket. You can aim the LV-1R and 24-77 to counteract any rotation you might have from the main engine. I have one plane in my imgur album in particular that has high mounted engines (named Hawk). The fuel for those engines causes severe rotation, while in the atmosphere the ailerons can more than compensate, but that doesn\u0027t work in space, so I added 24-77s aiming slightly down to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to browse my Imgur album in my signaure, I\u0027m going to be re-doing it soon and adding a bunch more designs I don\u0027t have in there yet and even making the craft files available. But you can see several of these design options. Just be warned all of my planes are designed for Ferram Aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor practicality, capi3101 is right. Rockets are easier. However, designing planes is it\u0027s own reward for those who enjoy it. If all you want is a station builder or to go to other planets, stick to rockets. That said, I\u0027ve built 2.5m stations using nothing but planes, but I only did it to prove I could. That\u0027s kind of what planes are, at least to me. I just enjoy challenging myself to see what I can design next.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T13:54:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 01:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joethebeast22","CreatedById":73826,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T17:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJets can be a problem, but if you\u0027re so happy with rockets why not simply SSTO with them?\u003Cp\u003EMuch simpler builds over a wider range of payloads and easier to fly as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidk, just like the bigger challenge posed by jet to rocket ssto\u0027s i guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T19:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022joethebeast22\u0022 data-cite=\u0022joethebeast22\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...just like...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all the reason you need :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust making sure everyone was aware that SSTO rockets are available, practical and easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s always \u003Cem\u003Esomeone\u003C/em\u003E who thinks \u0022Single Stage To Orbit\u0022 means \u0022spaceplane\u0022 or \u0022a vehicle that goes to Mun\u0022.
