The QBE doesn\u0027t have reaction wheels now, but a QBE plus a Small Inline Reaction Wheel costs 960 Funds and weighs 0.08t. The OKTO and HECS are both 0.1t, and cost 450 and 650 respectively. So for a bit more money, you can use the QBE and the reaction wheel in tandem to create a rather cheap, light probe core. The QBE only holds one Electric Charge, but even a Z-200 battery pack will let the probe be at 90kg. At this point it is more expensive, but still lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Stayputnik could replace the QBE in this configuration, but it is heavier and has no SAS control. It is 300 Funds, and the QBE is 360 Funds. Saving 60 funds is not worth the hassle of having no SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest con of this is that it will gulp electricity faster than a normal probe core. Also, you will have a very overpowered reaction wheel for a smallish probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for batteries, I didn\u0027t use the radial ones because I am not sure about massless parts in this version - a Z-200 is always massed, so this is worst-case.
