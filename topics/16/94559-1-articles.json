Since the .90 update, I have been struggling to make an effective heavy cargo spaceplane for delivering large components to orbit in a cost-effective manner. These components are intended to be attached together into more complex structures, such as space stations or larger interplanetary vessels. I have certainly proven I can build effective spaceplanes that can reach low and mid-Kerbin orbits (almost but not quite as far as Mun in one of my models) but only for the lightest of spaceplanes. Building ones that are as heavy as I need this to be has proven much more challenging. Not the least of which is simply getting off the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, every design I have attempted (and this is only the latest of many) has trouble even getting off the runway. I try to build them with large amounts of wing surface area to give them a lot of lift, but no amount of lift ever seems enough, the speed caps out around 70 M/s by the time I hit the end of the runway on only its turbojets, and only a little more than that if I burn the rockets early to give it just that little extra thrust. Even after getting off the runway, I tend to sink just slightly faster than the ground falls away beneath me toward the shore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me illustrate with a few pictures: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3LHbczG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223LHbczG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove is the side view of my current design.

My goal is to be able to transport an entire orange fuel container into orbit. It is the volume and mass of it that is more important to my design goals than the amount of fuel itself, since this is not necessarily a tanker, just something that can convey a similar size and mass to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/siRaL6o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022siRaL6o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView from the front, shielded docking port for utility\u0027s sake. You can also see that there are sixteen conical air intakes on this thing to ensure plenty of airflow for the engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QvaovBq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QvaovBq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course the reason for all those intakes being the six radially-mounted turbojet engines on the back, though I fear that may not be enough. Nestled between them is a quad of aerospike engines for atmospheric escape and orbital maneuvering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yjJM46y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yjJM46y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetail on the intakes. I angled the ones hanging under the wing slightly downward, because I know a spaceplane of this mass flying at high altitude will likely have some serious incline and I want to ensure my air intake remains relatively efficient during that stage of the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w2KP7Jv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w2KP7Jv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, detail on the landing gear. Note the two pairs of landing gear positioned just behind the center of mass. Both are equally level and adjacent to spread the weight of the plane across them so that they do not end up breaking me just by the weight of the plane pushing down. There is also a single landing gear nestled among the engines which actually hangs off the ground while on the airstrip, but the wheel extends just slightly past the radius of the engine cowling to ensure it does not scrape across the ground while taking off or landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice on how I can get a beast like this actually in the air? I mean, I know smaller and simpler is better, but in this case the size is part of the point. I have seen pictures from other people who have constructed absurdly massive spaceplanes that against all common sense make it to other worlds (very Kerbal) but I would be content just to get this into equatorial orbit and back down again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T22:41:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fearless Son\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TokiTech","CreatedById":131500,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T14:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello new forumer.

But never the less, fly it does, this big baby gets off the ground under its own forward-thrusting jet power, if only just barely. Once clearing the runway, it still coasts while very slowly losing altitude, with the ground falling away toward the shore just slightly faster than the plane falls.

But once that nose is up, the plane is off and climbing strongly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I am now running into is that the plane begins to struggle to stay on course when it gets going high and fast.

This is controllable though, requiring me to babysit the yoke and make a few minor corrections. However, once I get to a few hundred meters per second and around fifteen kilometers off the deck, this becomes more pronounced, with the plane yawing left and right, overcompensating each time I try to correct, eventually losing meaningful control as it spins. I suspect this is due to the new fuel takes and flow. I can probably solve that problem by removing the new fuel takes, adjusting the fuel to fill up some existing empty tanks more toward the middle of the structure to make up the difference. I might also re-position the intakes to be more toward the back of the plane, resting on the trailing rear of the wing to shift the center of drag back and more toward the middle.

Not sure how drag affects a plane based on position relative to the center of mass, but I wanted as many intakes as close to the center of mass and as far behind it as possible to make sure the plane stays stable while air-breathing. As you can see, I also placed a large number of reaction-wheel stabilizers because this thing is so heavy it needs all the help it can get to turn effectively in atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UiVtFXB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UiVtFXB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason for the twenty-six intakes (which I now realize I may need to increase by a few) are these eighteen turbojet engines to get this massive beast off the ground. Originally I had four to six aerospike engines here, but they proved insufficient thrust and the only places I could add them upset the balance of thrust across the center of mass. So I ended up ripping out that whole assembly and replacing it with a KR-L2 Advanced Engine. However, that is sill not enough thrust to get from the apex of my air-breathing flight to orbit. I might need more areospikes to supplement it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of flying profile, this still has some problems. Flying it obviously slows framerate, but I accepted that when I built it. It turns quickly enough, but requires some time before velocity vector becomes parallel with the direction of the plane (it has a lot of inertia, obviously.) When it gets to a certain altitude and speed at full thrust, it has a problem where the nose starts to point upward and I have to reduce thrust to keep the nose where I want it to be. Normally I would think the problem was draining fuel from the front of the craft, but I deliberately lock down the front fuel takes to keep the center of mass forward (and I can transfer fuel back once the rear tanks are exhausted.) So far though this is not too much of a problem because this kicks in just before I have to start reducing throttle anyway to keep accelerating without flameout. Landing has been troubling. I have been able to fly up and turn around in a big arc and head back to the Space Center easily enough. By the time I am lined up with the runway am I essentially falling in an unpowered glide, plane perfectly level with the runway, forward speed less than a hundered meters per second, vertical speed feeling reasonable though it is hard to gauge that considering the framerate is slow. It ends up crashing the plane anyway, then crashing the application. That is some crash!
