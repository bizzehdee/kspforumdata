I took the screenshots in KSP and took them out of the screenshot folder and put them on my desktop in a folder and just dragged and dropped them into the thread i was making. I was wondering if there is a way to make the photos smaller in size so that i can actually post my mission here\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T01:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to post the images to a sharing site like photo bucket or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eimgur.com\u003C/a\u003E Imgur is nice because you can make those nifty albums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you can post the links to images here.
