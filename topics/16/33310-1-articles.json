ANd I have to manually disable the top stage RCS tanks from being used, but its impractical to switch them on again at flight.

You should be using gimbals or (if you are using fixed engines) winglets. You\u0027ll save a lot of weight by getting rid of all that RCS hardware and fuel. Usually all you need is one mainsail on the center stack with the gimbal on and that will be plenty of steering authority.
