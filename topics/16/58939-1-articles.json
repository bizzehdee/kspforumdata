Yes, it mostly involved sticking parts together at random. Considering that, it actually flies quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat it doesn\u0027t do, however, is launch off the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I launch the plane off of a clamp high up and let the turbines spin up a little, I can get enough speed to stay airborne and fly. But when I am on the runway, on my wheels, and try to accelerate I invariably see my plane make a very sudden and very sharp turn to the side at some point. Which side varies, sometimes left, sometimes right. If I have no supporting wheels on the wingtips, the plane immediately crashes and explodes; if I do, it just drivers straight off the runway. It doesn\u0027t matter if I gently increase my thrust or if I go full throttle. And it happens before I have enough speed to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw the same phenomenon on an earlier test run with rocket parts. I assumed it was because I was not using proper airplane parts, but now it just feels like the physics simulation is giving me the middle finger for no reason I can discern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is this happening, and how can I stop it from happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I should maybe link the screenshot before posting...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-05T13:12:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2014 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T12:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnity\u0027s wheel physics aren\u0027t great, and those engines are causing a large pitch-down moment because they\u0027re mounted high up. They\u0027re probably putting too much pressure on the wheels and causing your problems on the runway, and it\u0027s also why you\u0027re having trouble rotating upward. The tail wheel is very far back increasing your takeoff rotation problem. You could shoulder mount the wings and put the engines under them to reduce the torque the engines cause and move the tail wheel further forward. Finally, those tail fins at the back don\u0027t look like the canards.
