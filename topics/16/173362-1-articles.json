And since orbital rendezvous\u00A0around Eve is\u00A0no fun, I prefer to avoid it whenever possible.\u00A0This design was for the old Mk1-2. Worked very well in that, but I converted it for a different mission. It now carries the Mk1 Command Module and Service Bay from Eve sea level, on a direct ascent return to Kerbin. I have a little island at sea level I like to test launches from now. The goal is to get from there back to Kerbin without any refueling.
