Still plan on using it for planning, but human control at all times. I got so bad I would autopilot a ship to orbit, set all the maneuver nodes, to the mun for example, in advance. Then I would go smoke and get a cup of coffee and magically find myself orbiting the mun when I got back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I am trying to figure out how to circularize without affecting both AP and PE, the tutorial says just burn prograde at whichever, but when I do that before my PE gets to where I want it my AP raises a ridiculous amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King Arthur","CreatedById":73849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T22:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor simple orbit-raising circularizing, perform your prograde burn at your apoaps to boost your periaps up to approximately the same altitude as your apoaps. To circularize at a lower orbit, do the opposite by burning retrograde at periaps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T23:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECircularising orbit would be a simple matter of doing your burn at peri or apo without affecting both \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E your burn was instantaneous, but it\u0027s not.

Another casualty of overusing mechjeb, I had the UI scaled way down. I never noticed the node on the ball was offset from prograde.
