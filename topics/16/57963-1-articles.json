Use the Left \u0022Shift\u0022 key to increase your throttle and the Left \u0022Crtl\u0022 to decrease it. \u0022X\u0022 allows you to instantly cut it off as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T00:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is that the engine is getting stuck inside the launch pad during physics load. If you have decouplers you can put one under the engine and have it activate on the same stage as you activate your engine. If you don\u0027t have that tech node unlocked all you really have to do is put a pod on the launch pad, do a crew report, EVA and due an EVA report and surface sample from the launchpad. Then walk off the launch pad and take an EVA report and surface sample off the launch pad (Be sure you store your reports in your pod first) and you should get enough science to unlock the next tier and most of tier 2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T03:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow big is your rocket?

Its mass is 1.25 (tons). (1.25*17.5) \u002B 1.25 = 23.125 so that\u0027s about your maximum lift off tonnage. Total up the tonnage of your parts in the VAB and see how your ship compares with this.

If those are all okay, there\u0027s a bug at work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy delta-V calculator says that with twelve FL-T200 tanks and one engine you should have 4,569.87 m/s and a launch TWR of 1.42. Obviously that\u0027s a single stage rocket and matters are complicated by the fact that the LV-T30 hasn\u0027t got thrust vectoring. Essentially you have what one forum member called a \u0022derp stick\u0022. You\u0027ll have to fly with SAS toggled on the whole way and make any changes in orientation \u003Cem\u003Egently\u003C/em\u003E unless you want to wind up pointed the wrong way. Straight up to 10k, 45 degrees at 090 until you\u0027re 30 seconds from apoapsis, then follow the prograde marker. Go horizontal once you\u0027re a minute to apoapsis. Watch your gee meter as you ascend and throttle back if it climbs out of the green zone (ideally you want it to stay right at the top of the green zone). Stop your burn when your apoapsis is as high as you want it (plus 10k if you\u0027re around 50,000 when that happens, plus 30k if you\u0027re around 40,000 when that happens). Make a maneuver node for orbital insertion and burn when indicated. You should have enough delta-V to make orbit easily; deorbiting afterwards will require a small burn - 50-100 m/s, tops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry to land engine down and don\u0027t panic when parts of the rocket start \u0027sploding on impact. You\u0027ll be somewhere around 3.65 tonnes empty which is too much weight for a single small chute to slow to a safe speed but not so much that the chute will rip off (provided you deploy the chute early - say hit the button around 40k; it\u0027ll do its job once the atmo\u0027s thick enough). Once enough of the empty fuel tanks have blown, the rest of the craft should slow to a safe speed for landing (this from experience, BTW).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-28T14:44:43Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2013 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T05:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWanted to confirm I wasn\u0027t steering anybody wrong with the advice in my previous post, so I built said craft described above and launched it this evening. Actually, I\u0027ve got a mod that allows KER functionality without KER parts, and it told me that the twelve tanks would give me 5300 m/s (more than enough for an orbit and return). So I started taking tanks off; nine tanks were sufficient to get the craft into orbit with sufficient delta-V for de-orbiting (was left with 60 m/s of delta-V when everything was said and done). The landing was hairy on account of the thing started tipping over rather than land straight up and down, but the important thing is that the command pod/pilot survived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you go. Launch a craft like the one I described into a polar orbit (steer north or south instead of east when you make your gravity turn). You should be able to make EVA crew reports over multiple biomes, and then once you\u0027re down you can collect a surface sample from wherever you wind up. Should be a worth a goodly amount of science and you can actually go into space rather than muck about the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
