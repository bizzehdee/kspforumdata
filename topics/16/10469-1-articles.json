Burning in any direction will alter the orbit. As sal\\_vager said, to move faster, lower your orbit temporarily. Then, raise it again. it might need to be altered for only a very short period of time, depending on how close you are to your target."},{"CreatedByName":"Trekkin","CreatedById":23636,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T04:00:02Z","Content":"Thanks, everyone. It turns out it\\\u0027s not as hard as I thought to just set up a transfer orbit that gets me where i want to be in the middle of it, then circularize, which is probably the closest I\\\u0027m going to get."},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T04:07:26Z","Content":"Maybe this will help you a little.\n\nSkip to 2:26\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QG_b1VK82Y?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
