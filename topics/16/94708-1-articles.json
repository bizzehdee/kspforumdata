The issue is my navball. I know how to rendezvous, to match the velocity and line up the orbits and what not. Trouble is that when I get the the \u0022target\u0022 section of the navball, everything screws up. I get say, within 1km of the target and when I go to kill the velocity relative to the target, instead of essentially matching up the orbits like I think I should, it puts me totally off. A 0m/s match relative to my target sends me on a completely different orbit where I have no chance on getting to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe target indicators show up on the navball and work correctly, pointing me in the right direction. But the velocity vectors are completely wrong. I found that in order to stop moving away/towards the target I have to be going 40m/s relative to it. What am I doing wrong? This isn\u0027t first time it has happened but I have had it work correctly before. It is really frustrating and any help is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T20:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMatching velocity only (almost) matches orbits when you\u0027re very close to the target and ideally more or less at the same altitude as your target. Depending on which planet/moon you\u0027re orbiting, matching velocity while 1km from target if you\u0027re above or below could be either not too bad, or far away from correct. At that distance, you shouldn\u0027t get your relative velocity down to 0 completely, instead make sure the velocity vector is aiming roughly at your target. Some screenshots of the flight/map views would be nice though, because if it takes 40m/s relative velocity to get an intercept at 1km away you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E doing something wrong, or have found a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StleathP{latypus","CreatedById":133544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T23:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went to take some screens and loaded an autosave where I was just matching up the orbits. Got to the rendezvous and it all worked fine this time. The prograde and retrograde made me match the orbit correctly and I was able to dock. I have no idea why it screws up sometimes like this. I know this isn\u0027t the first time it\u0027s happened to me. I\u0027ve have it happen in .23.5 yet and I recall now that after I loaded a save it worked for me just like this time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing it\u0027s a bug or something. All I know is that it\u0027s very frustrating when it happens and I guess I\u0027m just going to have to quicksave before all my rendezvous\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
