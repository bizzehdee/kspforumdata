There is \u003Cstrong\u003Eno\u003C/strong\u003E orbit with a periapsis above the surface of Laythe that will leave you with 347 m/s when leaving the sphere of influence. The reason for this is that an orbit with a periapsis altitude of 0 (on the surface), and a apoapsis equal to the edge of the sphere of influence, has a speed at apoapsis of 353 m/s. The higher your periapsis above the surface, the faster your speed at apoapsis will be, so 353 m/s is your minimum excess velocity for a single burn ejection from Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, it is not possible to execute a pure Hohmann transfer from Laythe to Vall (which is too bad, since they\u0027re the only two bodies in the game with zero inclination and eccentricity around a common parent, i.e. the only two bodies for which a Hohmann transfer is actually correct).
