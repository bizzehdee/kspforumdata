Save file editing in and of itself is risky enough. Craft editing however has always lead to \u0022rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022 for me. If you really want to try I suggest giving your ship a unique name (otherwise it can be hard to find in the save fail) then quicksave and switch to desktop. Find your KSP directory and BACKUP YOUR SAVE FOLDER. I cannot emphasize this enough as lack of doing so has ruined multiple savegames for me.\n\nNow, goto gamedata--\u003ESquad--\u003EParts and then look for the ladder since you need to know the name by wich the game references it. When you have that, open your quicksave file and search for the unique name. Then search for the ladder on that craft and change one of the positional values. Save changes and go back to KSP, reload and wonder why things are, or are not, exploding.\n\nAlternatively you could use a method I came up to help someone else with, detailed [thread=115059]in this thread[/thread].\n\nHope I could help, all the best\n\n-TXR\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T19:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 07:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cannon","CreatedById":109645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T18:58:39Z","Content":"i don\u0027t like using cheats :/"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T19:11:00Z","Content":"Editing your craft after launch is a kind of cheating ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIf you want to do it legitly you will have to send a rescue mission, depends on your dedication I guess.\n\nOh, I\u0027m not sure but I think ladders can be moved from IVA using [thread=92514]Kerbal Attachment System[/thread].\n\nIn stock, as in real life, there is no way to edit your vessel once you have launched.

Theoretically, you could grab one ladder (so your Kerb is carrying it on his back), then climb the one that\u0027s still there, and at the top, attach the next ladder where you can transition to it.

That was my idea too.\n\nPick up the bottom ladder and place it between the other two. In theory that should work. If the gap is still too wide just pick up the other ladder and leapfrog.\n\nEdit:\n\nNow that I think of it. I have an even better KAS solution. Pick up the bottom ladder and place it upside down above the one your standing on.

If so, you could (gently) lift off the ground a few hundred meters while your kerbonaut is holding onto the top of the ladder, then shut off the engines and jetpack your kerbonaut up to the next ladder while the vessel is falling (i.e. in weightless conditions), then quickly fire the engines back up to ensure a smooth landing.\n\n... or for that matter, just finish the surface mission and take off back into orbit with him hanging on the ladder, then get him back inside the capsule later.\n\nBTW I often stick a probe core on vessels undertaking long or complex missions precisely to allow more contingency options in case the need ever arises.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T22:23:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky**"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T22:26:32Z","Content":"In all honesty, this would be an exception that I\u0027d make regarding cheats. Just by looking at the picture, I can see that the Kerbal should be able to stand on the highest rung of the ladder, reeeeeaaaach and just barely be able to grab the next ladder. To simulate this, hack the gravity and get him on the ladder. Then unhack the gravity and just say he reached real hard for that ladder.\n\nNow if there weren\u0027t any ladders at all, then I\u0027d say you dun goofed and need to send a rescue mission. But as it stands, it\u0027s riiiight there.\n\n-----EDIT-----\n\nAlternatively, you might be able to jump onto those lights depending on how much gravity there is (never been to Tylo). You could maybe jump onto the light and then from there try to jump onto the uppermost ladder.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T22:32:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Greenfire32**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T22:27:04Z","Content":"You may not like this one, but... from the top of the ladder is he close enough to manually fire one of the radial decouplers? Maybe you can unbalance the craft enough to get it to tip over that way, which might bring the capsule close enough to the ground to get him back inside.\n\nOf course it might also just blow up your entire ship, and even if it doesn\u0027t, you\u0027re probably stranded on the surface in an unflyable craft at that point.
