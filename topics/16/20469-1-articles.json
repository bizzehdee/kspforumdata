Think of it like a clock, and Kerbin is at 3 o\u0027 clock, and Duna is at 12 o\u0027 clock. Duna\u0027s planetary phase angle would be 90 degrees. According to the interplanetary calculator at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E, ideal phase angle for Duna interception and capture is 44.36 degrees, which is an acute angle, which is slightly over halfway between 12 and 3 on the clock. A picture is shown on that website describing what I mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEjection or escape angle is a little hard to describe. If you zoom way out in map view, you\u0027ll see an orbit line coming out of every planet. That is the planet\u0027s prograde. It follows that line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ejection angle is the angle of your ship in relation to that line on a vertical axis. The website also shows pictures. The blue line coming out of Kerbin in the picture is Kerbin\u0027s prograde, and that angle is where your ship needs to be for a proper ejection to occur in order to achieve an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn easier way to see Kerbin\u0027s prograde as by looking at the \u003Cstrong\u003Eshadow\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s basically always line up with Kerbin\u0027s prograde. The shadow follows the same direction as the prograde line, at least when you\u0027re zoomed in that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new MechJeb beta .dll gives very accurate, detailed information about phase angle and ejection angle if you wish to download it.
