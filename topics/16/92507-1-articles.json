Well, the issue is that when I make a basic plane design (Mk2 pieces) and put it on the track, it begins to move to the right or to the left inevitably, until it becomes destabilized and crashes before takeoff. That happens even when I\u0027m going at 25% trust. I use 2 small gear bays on the center of the wings and another one at the nose of the plane. My center of mass, lift and all this stuff is well situated (I think), so I do not understand why is this happening to my plane! Thanks 4 the help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T01:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s generally a sign that your wheels aren\u0027t set straight up and down, perpendicular to the ground.

My single biggest problem with plane design. I have found that a quick-and-dirty solution to gear alignment is to attach the gear to a pair of I-beams sticking out from the fuselage and hide the beams in the wing roots, then add a few discreet struts between gear and wings to cope with the \u0027occasional\u0027 heavy landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think one of the problems is that, with SAS turned on, if there is any drift off course on the ground the SAS tries to correct using the rudder alone. Once the wings start to lift this causes roll as a response to the torque of the rudder. This makes the situation worse and everything quickly goes pear-shaped...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have just started experimenting with steering down the runway with dabs on the nosewheel steering and not turning SAS on until rotation (I have set up separate keys for rover and ship controls) but I haven\u0027t done enough takeoffs yet to prove any advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the long-winded post but that\u0027s my interpretation of the problem.
