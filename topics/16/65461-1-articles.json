Switch to them and observe the surface until you find a good spot. You could then de-orbit at that location, using your probe as a marker for future visits. Alternatively, you can keep a \u0022mothership probe\u0022 in polar orbit, then release smaller landmark probes from it at good landing spots. Essentially, you don\u0027t want to be doing this with Kerbals because it greatly raises the chances you will strand them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T17:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking places between Craters are good spots, but be careful you don\u0027t overshoot or you will end up on a slope.

For this, you need a biome map so you know where one ends and the next begins. I believe there\u0027s one on the wiki now but if you have SCANsat mod, you can make your own. Anyway, you decide which biome you\u0027re going to land in, pic a general area in it, then adjust your orbit so your Pe is no more than 10km and no less than about 7km off the ground over that general area. You need to be low enough to see enough terrain detail to spot reasonably good landing zones, but high enough not to hit the mountains. So you fly along until you decide you\u0027re over a good spot, burn retrograde to stop above it, then come straight down from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not after science, then you just need to decide where you want to land and follow the same general procedure as above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T18:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor this, you need a biome map so you know where one ends and the next begins.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA hint: all the really big craters are their own biomes, so if you\u0027re after science those are good places to start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Behemoose","CreatedById":87982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T18:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Geschosskopf said.

You can see them from high orbit, *IF* you know exactly where to look*, but a visual search to find them in the first place is pretty much hopeless. Consider that Minmus alone has about the same surface area as Denmark, and imagine trying to find a handful of specks on its surface.
