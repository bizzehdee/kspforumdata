Intake drag is proportional to the component of the intake\u0027s open face direction that is aligned with the direction of motion. The way you have assembled it produced a positive feedback loop in the yaw. When you yaw left, the intakes on the left are pointed more into the airstream, and create more drag on the left, pulling the plane even further to the left. In other words, you created an unstable system that is sensitive to initial conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry swapping the intake angles, such that intakes point inward slightly instead of outward. This should create a negative feedback look in the yaw and actually stabilize the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, You probably used an action group for the intake close function. Keep in mind that if you grab and replace a symmetrically placed part which already has an assigned action group, that action group will be removed from any symmetric copies of that part. This is a bug. If you closed some intakes before taking off, it is possible that only the intakes on one side of the plane are closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"128MB","CreatedById":65888,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T15:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo no its in every plane, only this one is angled!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane flies perfect untill going over supersonic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if i make the most basic ssto and not even touch the yaw controls, the plane always spins out of control after going supersonic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-11T15:08:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2013 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 128MB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T15:22:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to use modded parts.
