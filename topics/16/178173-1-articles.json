I am an aerospace engineering student so I find this game quite fascinating and with a good potential.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, I am at the initial missions where you have to test different equipment at different altitudes and speed. Is there any recommended procedure to do this? For example, if you have to be at altitude [27000,33000] m at a speed [1100,1300] m/s, is it just a trial and error thing or there could be some math behind? I guess I could do some calculations but I don\u0027t know how realistic the game is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-09T16:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe physics of the game is, for the most part, realistic.\u00A0 So you could do calculations if you wanted to, though I think most people probably do it trial and error.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t done many of the types of contracts that you\u0027re referring to, but for the ones I\u0027ve done, I haven\u0027t found it especially hard to meet the conditions.\u00A0 I think the contract parameters are generally set at values that you should be able to meet if you perform a normal launch, reentry, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-09T17:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re either reasonable for launching or landing, or they\u0027re not ... you\u0027re best off to pick and choose.\u00A0 If you really want to do one of the high altitude, low speed ones, you\u0027re best off just using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E above 1, and do it the hard way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-09T17:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim not a clever guy so probably can\u0027t help much but heres my total KSP philosophy. ....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI build what I think might work then launch.....regardless of the outcome I repeat....then repeat....then repeat until I get it right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnot much help I know but it works for me..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-09T17:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually think it\u0027s a good idea to do a lot of those contracts. After you do a bunch, it gives you a really good feel for which \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E boosters can get how much payload how high and how fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweaking the thrust percentages on the boosters will fine tune your launch if you were going a little too fast the first time. And landing your rocket again will give you a good idea of how much mass a parachute or three can handle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as said above, if you want to get it done quickly then you need to use a liquid fuel engine that can be throttled. By steering and playing games with the throttle, you can usually complete a contract in a few tries. The important thing is to be flying almost horizontally in the target altitude range, so that you have a long time to match the proper speed. Also note that the speed requirement is always a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esurface speed\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0-- which means you may need to change your navball mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-10T23:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also do the calculations, but there\u0027s a couple things to keep in mind:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP\u0027s aero model is not 100% realistic.
