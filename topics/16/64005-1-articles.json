Somewhere in there (depending on your windows version) is an \u0022attributes\u0022 section that says \u0022Read Only\u0022. Make sure \u0022Read Only\u0022 is NOT check marked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work, go to your KSP directory, right click and go to properties. Exactly where you need to go will depend on your version of windows, but you\u0027re looking for a \u0022security\u0022 tab. Click on that and edit the permissions for all users. You can allow all users \u0022full access\u0022 to the files (or whatever level you deem appropriate for each user). It might take a couple minutes to apply those properties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think KSP locks the file when you launch, but you might also want to make sure you close out KSP before saving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T00:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
