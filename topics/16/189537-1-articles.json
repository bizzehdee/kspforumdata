Worked well for landing, but on takeoff I find that engines remain fixed while the nacelle gets swiveled about.

So it\u0027s as if the servo had flipped sides, now moving the end that\u0027s supposed to remain fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone an idea why this happens, and if there is is a solution?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nETA: saveloading doesn\u0027t work. Or rather, it seems to cause the problem. I can reproduce it thus: roll out vessel, use servos (work as intended), save. Load vessel, use servos: they swivel at the wrong end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-03T14:49:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2019 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-03T15:40:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolved, kinda, sort of: problem occurs if kRPC was the last to touch the servos.
