To fix this, you have attached large fins. This works... tenuously so. But it also causes a cascade of interdependant problems that you would not have if you designed your rocket differently from the get-go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, there are two main forces that fight each other over the heading of the rocket: your center stack is trying to reverse itself because its front is extremely draggy, but the fins on the side boosters are trying to keep the rocket straight because they are also extremely draggy. Two strong forces that push and pull against each other. And guess what\u0027s in the very middle of them? The radial decouplers that attach the boosters to the center stage. The center stage literally wants to turn 180 degrees, and the boosters don\u0027t want the center stage to turn at all. So the radial decoupler... \u003Cem\u003Eflexes\u003C/em\u003E. Just a tiny bit. The center core is now just a miniscule, impercetible amount off-center. Or actually, since the center core is the one that creates the reference frame for the direction of the rocket, the boosters are off-center. Also, the force that presses the decouplers into flexing is not static. Your rocket\u0027s acceleration changes constantly, the aerodynamic forces change constantly, you sometimes have player steering inputs and sometimes not, and so on and so forth. That means the magnitude of the flexing also changes constantly. It makes the boosters \u003Cem\u003Ewobble\u003C/em\u003E. And when the nozzles of the boosters no longer point in exactly the same direction - for example, if one points a little up and the other points a little down - they start inducing roll into your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese effects now meet other shortcomings. For example, your rocket is wide, but not long. That means there is less distance between the center of mass and the center of aerodynamic pressure, which lessens passive stability. You are launching at an incredibly high acceleration (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026gt;2.0, maybe even 2.5, it seems from the video), which causes you to hit the sound barrier very low in the atmosphere, and the wave drag just hits your rocket like a sledgehammer, magnifies all its control issues, and fights your own control inputs. Then, your pair of fins gives you stability in the pitch direction, but not in the yaw direction. Which is counterproductive, as you want the rocket to pitch (follow its gravity turn), but not yaw (deviate from 90\u00B0). Finally, you are fighting high drag by adding more drag. This is fuel inefficient and forces you to build a larger rocket with more engines and more fuel than is strictly necessary - and attaching these extra engines and extra fuel opens up construction traps like the flexing decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few common best practices for rocket building that should help you avoid these (and other such) issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTry for passive stability. Attaching fins is a band-aid, not a goal to strive for. Each fin you add adds dead weight and aerodynamic drag, reducing the performance of your launch vehicle. Passive stability is a natural result of the golden rule of rocketry, but you can help it along by having a nice, long, realistic looking rocket rather than flat, wide designs. Also by adjusting the fuel flow priority of your launch stage so that the tanks drain bottom-first. Having an engine with thrust vectoring on the core stage is not strictly speaking \u003Cem\u003Epassive\u003C/em\u003E stability, but it typically removes the need for fins as well. If you must add fins, use the smallest size you can get away with. Also, use four of them. Not three, not two, not six. Four. Attach them to the core stage only. And align them in the four cardinal directions. 45\u00B0 offset works in a pinch (if you must attach boosters) but is less efficient.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry for single-stack designs. Attaching radial boosters is a band-aid, not a goal to strive for. You can use them to push a heavy first stage off the pad, but do not make them your main propulsion stage. If you do use multiple parallel stacks: do not give the boosters any control authority if you can in any way avoid it. No reaction wheels, no thrust vectoring engines, no fins (especially not active fins). And if they\u0027re big and heavy, then strut them tightly to the center core!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry for single-size designs. Something like a tapering rocket where the first stage is wider than the second stage is fine. But do not randomly change to a different-size part in the middle of a stack and then back. This causes massive drag around that location, and additionally, smaller parts have smaller, less stable joints, which will cause your rocket to flex around a smaller part. If you wish to downsize or cluster engines, or attach small parts like probe cores in the middle of a larger stack, there are parts specifically made for this purpose: service bays, structural tubes, engine plates, and even fairings. (Some of these may be DLC only.) When building fairings, try to minimize their bulging out past the core stage\u0027s diameter - and if forced to do so, do it as smoothly as possible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry for smooth stacks. Anything you attach to the outside of the launch vehicle is going to create drag. Anything you want to carry to space with you will have to be attached to the upper stage or spacecraft, which means right at the front, which violates the golden rule of rocketry. Just like you can hide undersized parts inside service bays and similar larger parts, you can hide your science experiments, antennas, batteries, and even solar panels in them, instead of sticking them to the outside. If you wish to have them exposed, encapsulate the payload in a fairing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry for sane acceleration values. A surface \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.4 to 1.5 is recommended. Not only do such rockets need less control authority to steer, but they also experience much lower maximum dynamic pressures while transsonic. Additionally, having a high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is an indication that you brought too much engine for the job at hand. And since engines are dead mass, this reduces the performance of your launch vehicle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will frequently encounter situations where you will have to compromise on at least one of these, but as long as you keep them in mind and try to avoid doing the opposite, you should end up with fairly stable, benign, and capable rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-24T07:42:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2020 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-24T07:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to what was already said here (O.K. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E just mentioned that): your first stage has \u003Cstrong\u003Ewaaay\u003C/strong\u003E too much thrust.

That resulted in a very steep (read: ineffective) ascent with \u0026gt; 1000 m/s needed from the terrier in the circularization burn.

This is a maneuver where your rocket tips over sideways on its own, pulled by gravity, but the rate at which this happens is perfectly in sync with your acceleration so that by the time you have levelled off horizontally, you are already out of the atmosphere and close to completing orbit insertion. This is how IRL rockets fly. In contrast to IRL rockets, however, the player in KSP doesn\u0027t have a NASA supercomputer aiding in the construction of their rocket. So it\u0027s actually really hard to get the exact amount of thrust you need, combined with the exact moment after leaving the pad during which you need to initiate the pitchover, the exact magnitude of that pitchover, and the precise throttle control all the way to orbit. Still, people sometimes go through that effort. Rockets have been built that sit on launch clamps on the pad at a very slight angle, so all you need to do is throttle up, stage, and watch the thing fly itself.
