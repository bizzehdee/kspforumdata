Purely for shots/beautification of course. Is there a mod that does this?

I\u0027ve since refined my methods, and things are a lot easier now with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/134823\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWASD Editor Cam\u003C/a\u003E \u0026amp; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121034-1-0-2-May12-NoOffsetLimits-Removes-limits-for-part-offset-in-editor\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENo Offset Limits\u003C/a\u003E - I no longer need to take multiple shots of multiple loaded vessels. I can load the vessel once, place things where I want and snap a single image from any angle. I still need to do multiple images from that position to remove the UI though. On that note I also realized it\u0027s easy to get rid of the staging menu by putting everything into a single stage, then grabbing and dragging it down out of sight and taking the screenshot. I also make use of the Merge feature to get two complete craft in a photo like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NtL7f2B.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NtL7f2Bl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NtL7f2Bl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case I added a large truss to the craft on the right, then merged in the craft on the left which I had saved re-rooted via the fuel tank (instead of the probe core within the fairing) so I could attach it to the truss. Then used offset to move the entire thing to the right of the flag, then used offset to move the truss w/attached second craft outside the VAB, then offset the second craft from the truss back into position inside the VAB. Note that positions are always relative to the root part - so if I were to rotate or move the craft on the right, the one on the left would rotate too. So when you get down to doing something like this which started out as a completely staged vehicle before I tore it apart with the offset tool:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QmZQ0oe.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QmZQ0oel.png\u0022 alt=\u0022QmZQ0oel.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to be very logistical in how you move things around to place them - do it in the right order so you don\u0027t end up moving a part you already placed where/how you want it when you adjust another part. I kind of enjoy figuring it out - it\u0027s sort of like a puzzle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KristopherKerblumbus","CreatedById":132207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T15:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGaiiden!
