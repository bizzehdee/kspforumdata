turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis amounts to tipping toward the east (D key, if you built the rocket with the default pod position in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) by a few degrees when your rocket gets between 50 and 100 m/s, then following the prograde marker until apoapsis is around 80 km.\u00A0 Throttle down to zero and make a circularizing maneuver at your AP marker, and when that\u0027s done, shazam! you\u0027re in orbit.\u00A0 The amount of tilt needed at the start of the gravity turn is dependent mainly on your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E -- if it\u0027s 2 you\u0027ll need a lot more tilt than if it\u0027s 1.2, because you\u0027ll gain speed along your heading faster, and therefore have less time to build up horizontal velocity that tips the prograde marker toward the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis method hasn\u0027t changed significantly since at least 1.2 (I first played in 1.2.2).\u00A0 Earlier (before 1.0?) there was an alternate method required by the \u0022soup\u0022 of the atmosphere, to fly to 10 km before turning over, then immediately yaw to around 45 degrees and follow prograde (from there on, it\u0027s pretty much the same) -- but the atmosphere was changed in 1.0 or 1.1 to have less drag at sea level and to gradually taper off, more like a real atmosphere, so the gravity turn works better now.\u00A0 The one exception is if you\u0027re trying to launch something like a complete space station all at once -- something big, fragile, and draggy may still get to orbit best by launching vertically to clear most of the atmosphere, then turning over to the east to build horizontal velocity after you have enough vertical speed to coast completely above the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor spaceplanes, the technique is completely different from what I\u0027ve given here, but since I\u0027ve never flown a horizontal launch spaceplane to orbit, I\u0027ll let those who have advise on how to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
