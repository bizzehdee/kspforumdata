I found that using the solo capsule for the tourists and a small drone to pilot (I\u0027m still early in a new career mode) can work. I put a hammer under the capsule with four flea\u0027s attached radially. Use any larger booster to get up into the upper atmosphere and release with enough room to turn away before firing the hammer and fleas together. The fleas help give you the pickup while the hammer still has a full load of fuel and you can dump the fleas as soon as they are empty. By then you should already be in the red on the G-force meter and the hammer will only help carry you while the tourist builds up in his personal blackout meter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this was done above the point where the speed indicator switches from surface to orbital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to note that I tried a centrifugal device using rotors both top and bottom of the spinning part and attached the top and bottom frames with the launch brackets (structure that connects with the ground). With four pods equally balanced and filled with Kerbals (tourist and 3 pilots sans parachutes) I spun it up and noted no G-force activity. It seems centrifugal G-forces are not calculated, even on the individual pods. It was during this attempt that I realized the kerbals had to be in flight. Then a successful blackout in space failing to meet mission requirements confirmed they had to be in atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis test current as of the last patch before they shutdown for work on KSP2.
