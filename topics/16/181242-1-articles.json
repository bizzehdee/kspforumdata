I have hundreds of landers that never made the trip to the moons, Space stations that gravity assisted themselves out of orbit, rockets meant only to go up, and down. Most of these vessels don\u0027t have docking ports, and if they did, how do I reach them? How do I get the ones without docking ports? Mind you I can\u0027t land on any planets or moons yet, due to my lack of skill, but I have the entire science tree unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draalo","CreatedById":158993,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T14:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFocus at one problem at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSearch this forum, read and try.

In fact, they can mostly rescue themselves. Especially if there is another ship fairly close-by -- but in the direction you want to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals have jetpacks that they can use to fly around. And those jetpacks are really powerful. And flying a Kerbal around on EVA when using their jetpack is a skill that you need to develop anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if you misuse your jetpack, you can get your Kerbal into even more trouble than they already are in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, once you\u0027ve gotten to the stage where you can fling rockets around the planetary system -- then the next most important skill you absolutely need to learn at that point is rendezvous. You need rendezvous for everything. For rescuing Kerbals, or having Kerbals rescue themselves, or rescuing stranded ships, or refueling your spacetugs ... or anything. So I\u0027d say definitely look around here and on youtube for rendezvous tutorials, and practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
