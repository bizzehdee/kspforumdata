In map view (while you\u0027re still far apart) click on the other ship\u0027s icon and choose \u0022select as target\u0022 in the menu that pops up. That will highlight that ship and its trajectory and in 3D view you\u0027ll see a marker around that ship\u0027s position (if it\u0027s closer than 100 km), eventually with distance displayed when it\u0027s closer. When you\u0027re close, you can do the same with individual docking ports of that ships in 3D view - look at the other ship, right-click the docking port and choose Select as Target. Then it will draw yellow marker at its position and will show you the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you switch ships, this selection will clear. You\u0027ll need to select the other ship as target again after each switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and if you don\u0027t see the marker even though you have the other ship selected, try pressing F4.
