In the VAB at the top of the interface there are three blue tabs. The center one switches you to action group mode. Select action group 1, click on your solar panel, and click \u0027toggle solar panel\u0027 (or some such) to add this command to the AG. Then in flight, you can tap 1 to open and close your panels. Make sure to put all your panels in the action group. This is easy if you only have one set of symmetrically placed panels! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeploy your panels just as soon as you hit 70 km altitude!
