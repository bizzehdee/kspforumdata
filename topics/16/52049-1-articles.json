I left it on the launch pad and burned the engines until I was over 1.0 TWR at which point it started to list off to the right but I cannot figure out where this imbalance is coming from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 I am unsure of my RCS placement. I have nosels at the top and bottom of each of the three side tanks. Is there a better way to do this? Or should this work for docking? (Wanting to solve #1 before I waste parts on a test) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 Any suggestions on how to improve the design are welcome, though nothing that would require mods other than the ones used. (Kethane, NovaPunch, Near Future Propulsion (just he batteries/panels). Namely looking at things towards efficiency, right now I am estimating that about 40% of the kethane it drills will be used to replace the fuel it uses making the trip there and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1184.photobucket.com/albums/z335/annallia92/screenshot30_zpsd2d45ccd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot30_zpsd2d45ccd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew additions not sure if important or not... This will be space built as I am using orbital construction mod, its only role is to use gather kethane to store on my station where I can convert it to whatever I need for future space built craft. It is only intended to go to the Mun and Minmus though I do plan on re-designing a similar craft for Duna down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-06T08:39:55Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2013 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by annallia\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeFudge","CreatedById":74270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T01:51:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only used kethane a little bit but I found that some of the drills or converter/refinery(?) pieces are pretty heavy and they made my ships a little awkward.
