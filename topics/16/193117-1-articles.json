I was taking a look in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E at the communication relay antennae and a few things spring up in my mind. Now, before I go further, I am not sure which game mode you are in, and will make my reply take 2 forms, the first being as if you are in just sandbox where kerbucks and science are meaningless metrics for doing anything and the second will be as if you are in either career or science mode. Oh one other thought before my suggestions is that I think the comms net just picks which ever relay sat meets a few criteria \u0026lt;at least this is my guess, and a guess as to the criteria\u0026gt; such as what relay is in LOS, How potent is the signal. I imagine its more complicated, but, the guess I made seems to fit logically to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first suggestion is to replace your relay set around Kerbin with a set \u0026lt; I myself have a triad in orbit, seems to work well enough for me in sandbox \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E \u0026gt; of RA-100 Relay Antenna \u0026lt;the heavier of the two\u0026gt; or a set of Communotron 88-88 \u0026lt;the lighter of the two, and its animated, smaller package, but identical stats other than weight and some basic transmission differences, but those are negligible as far as I can see \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Both can reach a max range of 158GM. As to the arrangement around the planet Kerbin, that I leave to you, but, suggest a similar setup around Duna as a rover will not always have a LOS to Kerbin, but, odds are good at least 1 relay will be in LOS \u0026lt;depending again on setup\u0026gt; of the rover on the ground.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, lets say you are in career or science mode. It may be more expensive \u0026lt;I honestly have no idea as I only do sandbox as for me career and science really do not draw me in that well\u0026gt; as it may take more relay steps, but, the principle I think is sound. Pick which ever relays you can afford and are the strongest you can afford and put up several relay sets. One set around Kerbin, another perhaps between Kerbin and Duna and another at Duna itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sorry if this came off as an incoherent mess, so, perhaps a TL:DR translation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I do not think its possible to force a connection, as I think the relays just pick the best that they can see/talk to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. If sandbox use either the RA-100 Relay Antenna or the Communotron 88-88 \u0026lt;both are nearly identical in terms of data transmission and range with minor differences in transmission size/rate. Major differences are the weights and the fact that the Communotron 88-88 is smaller \u0026lt;physically\u0026gt; and can be deployed from a stowed position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. If career or science, just pick the strongest available to you at the moment \u0026lt;that you can afford of course\u0026gt; and place as many as needed to bridge the gap between Kerbin, Duna and the surface of Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPosted at 0221 central, on 4142020\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-14T08:52:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223770648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193117\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221586848842\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002278020\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, AlamoVampire said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.
