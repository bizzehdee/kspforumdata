(Like the Mk1 lander can) Because you rotated the ship sideways, it\u0027s causing the mirror symmetry to act in a sideways axis. I don\u0027t know that it\u0027ll fix it, but you can try changing the axis of symmetry with the \u0022F\u0022 key. (It\u0027s sometimes finicky and may require you to have mirror symmetry selected and the parts greened up before it\u0027ll work.)
