The problem I am experiencing revolves around how KSP treats spacecrafts that are technically controllable, and have unactivated stages, but are not the main ship. The staging system\u0027s GUI seems to quite simply break as soon as a piece of the ship is detached and then reactivated. Below are some screenshots with some captions describing what I am seeing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis screenshot details my setup to demonstrate my problem - a LEM module is supported by a launch brace and is connected via a decoupler to a empty command module with unactivated stages, one being the activation of a SPS engine and the second being the dropping of a Kethane tank. I decouple the empty pod from the original pod, and then switch to the unmanned pod in an attempt to activate it\u0027s stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/setup.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/setup.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is directly after the empty command pod\u0027s decoupler is activated, my focus is still on the LEM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot0.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot0.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is me switching to the empty command pod\u0027s focus for the first time; as you can see, the stages are missing completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot1.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot1.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is me switching back to the LEM mother-ship...as the empty stages that were observed before are now gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot2.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFigure 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is me returning to the empty pod\u0027s focus, as you can see, the stages\u0027 icons are now returned, but are all shoved into one stage, and none of them can be activated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot3.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i832.photobucket.com/albums/zz242/Sinu_Daltra/screenshot3.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-18T01:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs Kerbin orbit rendezvous allowed in addition to Munar orbit rendezvous?
