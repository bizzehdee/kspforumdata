Everything went perfectly fine, up until I flew directly over the pole. I suddenly spiralled left and fell from approx 18km to 14km in half a minute or so. Normality restarted a minute later or so. Is there anything special about flying directly over a pole?

Technically that is not an orbit, because on just about any speed craft if your periapsis falls below 32,000 km drag exerts such a retrograde force that the orbit will never again exceed the atmosphere. You could approach at much higher speeds (say 6000m/s) but from the few times I have done this the vehicle goes white hot at high altitude reentry and disentegrates (or undergoes compression g-forces). For the missions orbit is any celestial bound eclipse in which the apoapsis is a positive number greater than atmosphere ceiling (Kerbin = 70k) and the periapsis is also greater than 70k. On the mun it is somewhat different because you could orbit at a low enough altitude that you crash into terrain, there is no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PB666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PB666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust so as not to confuse folks, the camera switch occurs in my experience when your periapsis crosses between 23,000 and 24,000 meters.
