I have a level 1 tracking station. I know for the Mun the idea is \u0022wait until Munrise\u0022, but for Minmus, well, things are different. My orbit is 94kmx115km.

If you can \u0027see\u0027 how mun lines up, do the same with Minmus. Burn out to just before the orbit for your Apo.

That\u0027ll tell you where your ascending/descending nodes are, which will let you do the plane change burn without maneuver nodes. To actually get to Minmus, you want to aim to have your apoapsis about 90 degrees ahead of where Minmus currently is in its orbit.
