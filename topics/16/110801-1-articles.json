Do i have to stick to 0.25 until i decide to restart a career from scratch?\n\nthanks for your help.\n\nPS: no need to precise many parts of a 0.25 savegame are incompatible with 1.0.2 and using it produces unrecoverable glitches, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T18:55:27Z","Content":"you should just be able to copy the savegame over from 0.25 to 1.0.2.
