The idea is that the contact point of the outer edge on the wheels versus the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E location forms a leverage point. If you move the wheels further outward you decrease the angle between the wheel and the Center of mass and it is harder to tumble.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlternatively to the above point you can place a Jet engine upside down. Normally a jet engine has a interior combustion chamber which in length is longer then the actual length of the jet engine part. To compensate the Center of mass of a jet engine is away from the jet engine to simulate it being longer. The trick is to place one upside down on your rover to potentially have the center of mass below the ground. It\u0027s perfect for creating upright bikes and trikes that require to roll straight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPut friction as low as possible. On your vessel you use very light equipment, my bet the default friction settings are to high on that vessel on Kerbin, let alone a planet with less gravity like the Mun. High friction is what causes you to either drive in rigid turns or you\u0027d be drifting at lower friction settings. High friction settings will seem like you are on train rails when turning resulting in immediate turn inputs but it also creates torque on the X axis when turning that could allow the vessel to tumble. The solution to this is using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (or mechjeb autopilot) and have adequate reaction wheels onboard to straighten the vessel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegardless of that you should be able to do without any of this with the proper friction settings and wheel base width/length. If for instance you want to fit a rover in a Mk3 cargo bay restricting the wheelbase width in order to drive one out on the ramp you may need lower friction settings not to tumble when turning while having the adequate reaction control onboard.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you use the rover on a atmospheric body and it reaches adequate speeds of 30m/s plus you may need aerodynamic vertical stabalisers to have the Center of lift behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. Otherwise the rover might have trouble keeping straight when driving.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlways put friction higher on the rear wheels and lower on the front wheels. This makes sure the rover keeps straight under rolling resistance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake sure the entire wheel base is a little bit in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. This means your 2 front wheels are a little further from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E while the rear wheels are a little closer otherwise the back end would want to sway forward.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
