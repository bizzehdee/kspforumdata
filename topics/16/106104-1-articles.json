Why does it tip over ?","CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:11:12Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:11:12Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nI\u0027m quite embarrassed now because I\u0027m a KSP veteran. I used to play with FAR/DRE/etc... but with the 1.0, I have the impression of being suddenly dumb.\n\nI managed to send one or two ships in orbit, but I struggled to do so. My last attempt was peculiary nightmarish as the rocket tipped over almost immediately after ignition.\n\nI removed all the unneeded parts (batteries, antenna, science) and it seems the craft is a little more stable, but it tips over nonetheless, albeit later (when booster are almost empty).\n\nI can\u0027t figure out what happens. I\u0027m pretty sure I wouldn\u0027t have any problem with the same craft in 0.90\u002BFAR, so I\u0027m left asking you guys about what is wrong with my ship.\n\n[You can download my craft here](http://excelsior89.free.fr/divers/MunarexplorerMk1.craft)\n\nYou can launch it vertically, and it will tip over after 20 to 30 seconds. Just be careful to adjust the staging (the boosters aren\u0027t set to fire when stability enhancer release the ship).\n\nHere is a picture of the craft, with CoL, CoM and CoT shown\n\n![screenshot0.png](http://excelsior89.free.fr/divers/screenshot0.png)\n\nI\u0027ll be grateful if you could explain me what is the problem with that simple craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T18:24:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Baleine**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:48:26Z","Content":"Did you turn on the SAS?\n\nDon\u0027t stray too far from your prograde vector under 25,000 meters.\n\nIf none of those are the case, then you might have a thrust discrepancy somewhere.

To get it flying well, I added three control AV-R8 winglets at the bottom between the boosters. I then moved the launch stability arms to the boosters to let the winglets clear the tower. Also, I needed to lower the booster thrust to 60%, which might still be a touch high. I finally removed the struts, as its too small to need them and they can sometimes lead to problems by themselves. Now it flies really nicely.\n\nEDIT: Similarly to Starwhip, I also lowered the boosters to lower the CoM as well. That plus putting an even lower CoL behind it with the winglets gave very nice control.

In my head, I see a thrusting rocket as similar to a stick with a weight on it. If the stick is fairly long with the weight at the top, it\u0027s easier to balance because shifts of the bottom of the stick have a small effect and are easy to control, and if the weight starts tipping over, it\u0027s got plenty of time before it \u0022falls\u0022. On the other hand, if the weight is moved towards the bottom of the stick, it becomes much harder to balance because even a small change is going to cause it to topple over, and when it does it does it fast. I know it\u0027s about angular momentum etc as well, but this in my head makes more sense than the dart analogy, because there aren\u0027t any thrusting forces acting on the dart."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:48:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Why would the boosters being too high cause this behavior?

Before it was based on mass. Lift has also been redone.

Also, tweaked thrust to control burnout speed to a reasonable level. Liquid engine doesn\u0027t need to be powered in SRB phase. An LV-45 gives more control during powered liquid flight then just an LV-30. Key is don\u0027t turn too fast in the lower atmosphere or you will flip over due to angle of attack.\n\n![XXA8Pt9.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XXA8Pt9.jpg)"}]}
