I think the easiest way to land on target in early career is going to be through trial and error. The difficulty is also going to depend on how far away the target is from the equator. Assuming a target that is close to the equator and that the tracking station has been upgraded, set up a node that brings your predicted landing as close to target as possible. Hit alt-f5 to save the game. Now execute the node as good as you can and see where you land. If you land short of the target, use alt-f9 to reload the game, and burn say 30 seconds later that you did the first time, more or less according to how far off you were on the first trial. Keep your burn execution as close as possible each trial, only adjust the timing. After a few trials you should get pretty close. And the more times you do this, the better feel you are going to get as to where to aim in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you progress through the career game and more parts become available, then more advance techniques will become available.

I do a deorbit burn on the opposite side of the planet from Reference Peninsula, to bring my perigee to about 22 km directly over Reference Peninsula.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, given atmospheric friction on the way down, you should land almost directly at the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been trying to refine it, because (1) in new aero, the drag of your vehicle effects the equation. And (2) the exact height of your apogee also effects it. 22 km is right from a 70 km apogee, and for every kilometer above 70, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been subtracting a kilometer from 22. So a 73 kilometer apogee gives you a 19 km perigee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t 100 percent either, because 80 km apogee and a 12 km perigee does not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m getting close!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T11:11:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t even need to be a spaceplane. If the survey site is reasonably close to KSC just a regular aeroplane will do fine, and money permitting you can leave it landed at the site so it might be well placed for another contract in future. If it\u0027s further away and you don\u0027t fancy a few hours flying then try a mini-shuttle like the X-37.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least unlocking landing gear is a good idea though.
