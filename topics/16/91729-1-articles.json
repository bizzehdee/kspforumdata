Not just because it, along with the cross- sectional area and air mass, are used to calculate drag, but also because it is mass that the wings must lift (creating more drag from the higher angle of attack) and the engines must accelerate (incurring a DV penalty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is why empirical results tend to differ from the theoretical predicted results. XM-G50s usually out-perform all the other intakes on spaceplanes in actual practice. Not by much, but it\u0027s there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But more to the point, whatever intakes you use should be in the back on spaceplanes and preferably a little high for high speed stability. This is difficult to achieve with other intake types, whereas it\u0027s easy for the XM-G50. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is why I recommend that if you want to build an efficient spaceplane, the #1 choice should be the XM-G50 intake, the fewest possible needed to get over 2,250 m/sec orbital velocity. This usually works out to 4 intakes per engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Going over that number *can* yield additional kinetic energy by getting closer to 2400 m/sec and higher altitude, but you end up burning more fuel in drag getting them up there, so it\u0027s a net loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T22:41:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
