From THERE i wanna collect water to refill my Water Storage Tank. (I use water to make liqued fuel with the ISRU from the interstellar mod). i know i have to be kinda close to the coast, but what items would i need to collect the water from the sea and back to the water tank? I know the ISRU on the water could possible do the work, but i wanna keep that on land. is it possible? \n\nother ideas are welcome too ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nTHanks alot for viewing my post."},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T20:25:57Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s possible out of the water, also, addon-discussion or even the Interstellar thread might be better."},{"CreatedByName":"Wowfreakstar","CreatedById":138662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T20:31:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think that it\u0027s possible out of the water, also, addon-discussion or even the Interstellar thread might be better.\n\nah okay, i can try go there. im new on this forum ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Thanks alot tho!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T01:28:52Z","Content":"Looks like this is being dealt with elsewhere."}]}
