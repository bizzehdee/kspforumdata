If there is no any solution I\u0027d develop it, just need guidance on what are the current options. I want a system to automatically detect the impacting objects only, without having to go to the station and track all of them manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T18:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like an interesting idea. The only option in stock is the tracking station, and I haven\u0027t seen any mods that use or simulate a more realistic approach :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T00:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe asteroids in KSP are randomly generated for a short-ish period and do not have any \u0027grand\u0027 orbital life-cycle so this would not be possible. When you \u0027track\u0027 one in the tracking centre this makes it persist, otherwise it\u0027d just disappear after a while and be replaced by a new, random, one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a consequence of when they were introduced to KSP - with the NASA Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) update. The mechanics deliberately do not affect anything else in the game so, unless you track any asteroids, they have no effect whatsoever on the rest of the system. A mod(el) which simulated many asteroids, which may or may not be Kerbin-crossing, would have to do a lot more work tracking orbits than the existing computation-engine is designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T02:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill keep trying to find something and digging around for more info, but seems a very funny project to work in!
