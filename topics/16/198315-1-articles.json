So, in order to collect everything, i need to reach the ocean floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I know, the densest parts are ore tanks, so those should sink me. So I experimented a quick sinking platform, made of one ore tank, the 2 science instruments i want to sink, a crew seat, a docking port, small reaction wheels and a single battery. the idea is that the contraption should be dropped by a mothership, and after touching bottom and taking measures, it should dump its ore content to resurface, and dock with the mothership again. this works fairly well on kerbin and laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neve has denser oceans. I tried that, and i found out I needed 30 tons of ore to try and make the apparatus sink. at 0.1 m/s, no more. and if i speed up time, it stops moving. can\u0027t\u00A0 be worked. I also tried clipping, but clipped parts don\u0027t sink any better; apparently the extra volume still counts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nany suggestion on how to make stuff sink on eve? possibly without adding too much mass? (ore tanks are not a problem because i can send them empty and mine the ore on the spot. unless i need many tons of tanks, that is)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-25T03:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223885833\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198315\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221606261666\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut clipped parts don\u0027t sink any better; apparently the extra volume still counts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse service bays to toggle \u003Cs\u003Eextra volume\u003C/s\u003E open/close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-25T17:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tried this myself but two possibilities come to mind.
