Are you using the Rovemax Model 3 wheels on this vehicle? I\u0027m not aware of them causing any problems on the Mun, but they could be, I suppose. Basically they cause the vehicle to make continual small bounces and never actually settle down to rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-16T04:32:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2013 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jason Patterson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NullF0x","CreatedById":39847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T04:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHahaha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel dumb.
