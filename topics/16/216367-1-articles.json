I believe that ForScience has the ability to (basically) turn every command pod into a storage unit, and automatically collect data there. It could be grabbing all data it can whenever it notices there\u0027s some available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only other thing I can think is that nothing can store 2 identical science reports, so if you have 2 surface samples from the same biome, \u0022transfer all\u0022 won\u0027t transfer both of them into the storage pod, and will leave one where it was. You may be mistaking this action for the science report being moved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
