Are the Centre of Mass, Lift, and Thrust nodes supposed to be in a different position? I am fed up with it! Even the most simple planes with lift and mass in the same point don\u0027t fly! They just flip over and stall right after launch! Having some pictures would help loads. I don\u0027t just want to play this game with only rovers and rockets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T12:01:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prof. Endwalker**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T12:35:43Z","Content":"CoL should be more or less on the CoM [slightly behind]. CoT should be inline with CoM. It\u0027d also be a little helpful to see some of your aircraft.\n\nEDIT: Also, it is possible to balance an offset CoL and CoT, but it\u0027s very hard to do.\n\nDid I mention wings?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T12:40:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 12:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T12:37:28Z","Content":"Planes are complex objects, but it\u0027s not too bad once you understand a few simple ideas. The first of which is you never want your center of lift, the blue sphere, too far from your center of mass, the yellow sphere. You can think of the center of mass as a pivot point for the craft, and the center of lift is a upwards motion around that axis. If it is too far forwards, your plane with nose up and over, and if it\u0027s too far back, you\u0027ll never get off the runway. This is why most people place their center of lift just behind the center of mass. The center of thrust works in much the same way. If it is below the center of mass, you\u0027ll get a pitching up reaction, above it, you\u0027ll get a pitching down reaction. The last, and often overlooked, problem is the placement of your landing gear. You need, for simplicity\u0027s sake, to place your rear gear just behind the center of mass. As I said, that is a pivot point, and if your gear is too far backwards, when you try to pull up, your plane will have a lot of issue rotating.\n\nGive this a try and let us know how it works."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T12:39:38Z","Content":"[This tutorial](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures) explains the basic concepts in a simple, no jargon way with lots of pics.
