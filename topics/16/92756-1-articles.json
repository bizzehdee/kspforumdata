Ostensibly the Oberth effect should favour craft doing their acceleration nearer the planet, and one has to climb out of the entire gravity well anyway, so gravity drag shouldn\u0027t be any more of an issue than it is for escaping from a circularized orbit. Experiments did not support that hypothesis, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo test the Thomas Foolery I slapped a kerbal flight engineer chip on the side of the Kerbal-X, gave myself an arbitrary target of 9Gm solar periapse, and tried three techniques, then recorded the delta-v left aboard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Egravity turn =\u0026gt; low, circular orbit (around 70km) =\u0026gt; escape parallel to kerbin\u0027s orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Estraight up and out, just before the sun hit the top of the VAB to make up for kerbin\u0027s rotation and give a good ejection angle\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Epre-noon launch =\u0026gt; gravity turn =\u0026gt; go east, no circularization\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first two were method one--first launch left 1717m/s left in the tank after a rather sub-optimal burn, and KE got mad on my second test, so I had to calculate the 1747m/s based on ship mass and fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I tested straight up and out--1532m/s, 1544m/s, 1538m/s remaining...seems like straight up and out sucks butts, even with a very good ejection angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the gravity turn with aggressive escape--1698 w/ suboptimal launch timing, then 1770 w/ better timing. \u0027Seems the Oberth portion of the hypothesis holds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I see that there\u0027s something to getting orthogonal with the gravity field as soon as one can, but I\u0027m not too sure why.
