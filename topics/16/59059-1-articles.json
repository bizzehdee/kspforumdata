I chosen to do this in two flights - one to send the lab itself into a high Kerbin orbit, second to bring it\u0027s propulsion system to the heavens. After a successful docking I\u0027ve discovered that vessel\u0027s delta-V values provided by \u0022Delta-V Stats\u0022 tool of MechJeb\u0027s are negative (so are vehicle\u0027s Thrust-to-Weight ratio values), yet the vehicle accelerates when blowing the engines. Is it some kind of MechJeb\u0027s bug? Or are those values real and I can only dream of sending this vessel beyond Kerbin orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T14:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb computes dV and TWR values based on the orientation of the engines relative to the root part. If the root part is upside down relative to the engines then those values, while accurate, are in the wrong direction. (I assume you have some kind of probe core or docking port that you use at launch to get proper orientation.). If you open up MechJebs dV stats window on the launch pad does the problem persist, Also, is the Navball primarily blue, or brown?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T15:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe try right clicking another part and \u0027control from here\u0027 to see it that fixes it, make sure that one isn\u0027t upside down as well of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the navball is all brown then your root part is upside down.
