To use this diagram, imagine you\u0027re in the map view looking down on the solar system. Rotate your view so that Kerbin\u0027s marker is pointing directly right like in the diagram. Then, rotating as necessary to keep Kerbin in this position, time warp until your destination planet and Kerbin make the angle shown in the diagram. If you leave your starting planet when this angle is achieved, you should have a perfect encounter with your destination planet. Note that although these angles are very specific, you can still make a successful transfer within probably a 10 degree window. Also worth noting, if you\u0027re travelling from a planet in a Higher orbit to one in a lower orbit, do your ejection burn on the daylight side of the planet so that you slow down as you leave the planet. The opposite is true if you\u0027re travelling to a higher orbit. And another important point is that this doesn\u0027t account for eccentricity of the orbits either, so the values, despite being awfully precise, are actually averages, unless the planet in question is in a perfect circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the bottom of the phase angle chart there is a delta-v map as well. This map will show you the delta-v required to get from one situation to another. Red numbers are delta-v required to transfer between the indicated planets. Green numbers are the delta-v required to achieve orbit around that body (ie get captured) but this can be dramatically reduced by aerobraking wherever possible. Blue numbers are once again transfer delta-v\u0027s but this time between a low planetary orbit and a moon orbit. Black numbers are the landing/getting back to orbit values. This will tell you how much you need to land on a planet and this is also the amount you\u0027ll need to reach orbit again from the ground. NOTE: that this is much, much lower on atmospheric planets as you just need enough delta-v to drop your periapsis sufficiently into the atmosphere, at which point the air will slow you down and you can use parachutes to land. However!!! the listed values ARE accurate for achieving orbit. (yes that means that Eve is very difficult to escape, and Although there has been some controversy over whether or not 12000 is correct, this is the generally accepted number.) Once again, these numbers don\u0027t account for eccentricity nor do they account inclination. This means that for planets like Dres, Eve, Moho, and especially Eeloo, it\u0027s a good Idea to budget about 1000m/s more delta-v if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second diagram is a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8M5WfNA.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erocket delta-v graph\u003C/a\u003E. Now that you know how much delta-v you need, its time to see how much your rocket has. (I lied when I said no math I guess) This calculation actually has to be done stage by stage, remembering which parts have been jettisoned at which points in the flight, etc. Start with your first stage: Add up the total fueled mass of the rocket. Now divide that by the mass of your rocket after the first stage has burned out. I call this number the Mass ratio of that stage. With all the liquid fuel tanks, except the probe-sized ones, the maximum possible Mass Ratio is 9, but you\u0027ll never quite achieve this because a fuel tank alone is useless, and requires engine. Engines, with a mass ratio of 1 (no fuel, so full mass = empty), will decrease the mass ratio of the fuel tank/rocket assembly. The probe sized tanks have a maximum mass ratio of around 5.3. Also, worth noting, is that although I have noted the ION engine\u0027s Delta-V at nine, the stock Xenon tanks actually have a MR of roughly 2.4, meaning that without some ingenuity, their maximum delta-v is around 32000m/s, which is still blasphemously high. Find this number on the x-axis of the graph. now figure out which Isp line applies to your first stage by calculating the average Isp. If you only used one kind of engine or all the first stage engines have identical Isp\u0027s, then this number is the same as the Isp for any one engine. If you have mixed engines firing simultaneously, then you must calculate the Isp of the stage like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etotal Isp = [( Isp1 * thrust1) \u002B (Isp2 * thrust2) \u002B ...]/thrust1 \u002B thrust2 \u002B ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp1 is the Isp of the first kind of engine, thrust1, first engines thrust, Isp2 second kind of engine\u0027s Isp, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve identified which Isp line most closely resembles your rockets stage, trace that line to the point where your mass ratio sits on the x-axis. The y-value at this point is the delta-v of that stage. Once again, remember that this number is less than calculated while you\u0027re in the atmosphere and/or fighting gravity (launching basically) so it\u0027s a good Idea to over compensate by about a thousand delta-v depending on the size of your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the last diagram is a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7iBap4r.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EREALLY BIG IMAGE\u003C/a\u003E(no joke here guys, it\u0027s like 10,000px wide and 1200-1500 tall) which is a scaled diagram of the Kerbol system.

I don\u0027t know who originally created those, but some of the numbers (Dres especially, probably also Moho and Eeloo) need revision. They\u0027re quite a bit optimistic due to inclination and eccentricity.

I should note, however, that on the delta-v diagram (and many others I have seen), a figure of 3880 delta-v is given for getting from Kerbin orbit to Moho orbit. In my experience, this takes more like 7000 delta-v, although I\u0027m sure you could do it for a bit less with some fancy tricks. Even then, however, it would probably take something like a Mun gravity assist for Kerbin escape and an interplanetary Eve gravity assist during a one-in-a-thousand Kerbin-Eve-Moho inclination alignment to get as low as 3880 delta-v.
