I also like to abuse airbrakes for my aerocaptures, because I\u0027m a bad person. Like fed said, changing inclination is best done from as far from the celestial body in question as possible. So once you\u0027re captured, burn your apoapsis to some really large number, and burn normal/anti-normal at that point to change inclination. You will likely be best off doing this over the course of multiple orbits. Once you are equatorial, just circularize as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadRocketsCo.","CreatedById":101686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T11:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you both!
