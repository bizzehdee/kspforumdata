I recently updated to 1.0.4 from 1.0 and have begun making a series of bombers. The bombers I\u0027m making are using fuel tanks as bombs (I know about the BD Armory mod, I just like building my own bombs). My issue, however, is that my bombs aren\u0027t exploding! When they hit the ground they just create some black smoke with no explosions. Does anyone know why this is? I\u0027ve tried a few different tank configurations (with/without Oxidizer, and letting my craft use or not use the contents of the bombs for fuel) all with no luck. If anyone could help me out here, I\u0027d greatly appreciate it.\n\nHere\u0027s a video I recorded to show what I\u0027m talking about:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dor71jZtLqA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
