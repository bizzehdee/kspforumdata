A slightly more accurate answer is about a million years (Earth-years, not Kerbin-years). That would work out to around 1.6 million transfer windows. You\u0027d get a smaller number if you\u0027d accept an approximate alignment (say \u002B/- 1 degree from the original alignment), but that gets much harder to calculate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat certainly puts a monkey wrench into things.
