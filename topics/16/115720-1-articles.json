Should have recognized those mods earlier...\n\nWill try landing gears then. But they are not controllable like rovr wheels. Not so good for a fueling truck.\n\nIf the fuel tanks are much smaller, they can\u0027t refuel a common rocket in one go. So I was looking for an appropriate fuel wagon.\n\nThat\u0027s why it\u0027s pretty big atm.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHaha. XXXXXD\n\nI put some landing gears on and some turbo jet engines. Two for forward movement and one for breaking / reverse movement.\n\nThis thing is so ugly. But shockingly enough, it kind of works.\n\nTo get in and out, I can lower the landing gears, so the retractable ladder can reach the ground. It\u0027s like getting on and off of a camel. XD\n\nHowever, it does not steer at all and even then, the speed control is a joke for a fuel truck.\n\n![NcUgPky.png](http://i.imgur.com/NcUgPky.png)\n\nI call it \u0022a creative fail\u0022.\n\nGuess I will build a smaller, more vehicle-like verhicle with rover wheels then. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T17:47:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 05:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cairol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T17:58:15Z","Content":"If you have landing gear PLUS the rover wheels (aligned to sit very slightly higher), the landing gear can \u0022take the weight\u0022 and when the suspension compresses, the powered wheels come into contact with the ground to provide drive, while being saved from bearing too much weight?\n\nDoes that work?\n\nIf you\u0027ve then drained the tanks and it\u0027s light enough to uncompress the suspension and lift those power wheels back off the ground, then maybe it\u0027s light enough to drive on them by itself - you could raise the gear to let the rover wheels back down when there\u0027s only a light weight there.."},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T18:48:13Z","Content":"I did something like this now. I reduced the tanks to 2 and put four landing gears to support the rear half and two rover wheels for propulsion and steering in the front.\n\nIt\u0027s slow as hell. About 9 m/s max. And the rover wheels get a puncture as soon as I drive it on deep grass.\n\nIt works.

The wheels are receiving a revamp in the next update, so hopefully they will manage this sort of thing.\n\nIn the mean time, I\u0027m not sure if there is any stock way to directly reinforce the rover wheels. You could tweak the .cfg files, or try the other methods above. Setting up multiple types of wheels (landing gear with rover wheels) can be a bit of a challenge because the rover wheels might lose contact with the ground from time to time. I would place them slightly lower so that their suspension compresses slightly before the landing gear take the load. This may not completely fix your problem though.\n\nYou may even want to fiddle with the order in which you attach the wheels (if using mixed wheel types). Since physics and part modules are processed in a serial fashion, it could have an effect on how things get distributed. I can\u0027t say it will for certain, but based on my experience I\u0027d say it\u0027s highly likely.\n\nAnd congrats on at least partial success. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
