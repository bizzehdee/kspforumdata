I\u0027m on a small island on Laythe that rovers can get around easy on so I plan to maybe drive the whole thing once and see if I can maintain control of the rover so long as the kerbals don\u0027t lose their grip which happens if I don\u0027t brake slow enough. I even had a kerbal glitch and fall through the ground as he dismounted and had to swim, under the ground to the shore to escape back to the surface.
