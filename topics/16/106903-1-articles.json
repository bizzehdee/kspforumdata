I downloaded the demo from Steam and was trying to configure my display to higher resolution close to my max resolution. Unfortunately it will start (splash screen and main menu appears, background music running) but when I try go into settings or start the game, nothing is displayed. \n\nI\u0027ve tried deleting the game from my library and redownloaded it, but still the same behavior. Is there a config/settings file to delete or edit? I looked in the Steam folders but did not see anything of value to delete/edit.\n\nThanks for any advice!"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:10:07Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nThere is a settings.cfg file in the root of your KSP install (same folder as KSP.exe). Try deleting that and restarting.\n\nAlso, I moved this over to Gameplay Questions. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
