All went smoothly, until my two rovers hit the ground. I was using the \u0022RoveMax M1\u0022 wheel, and six of them, on a relatively small and light rover. The result was a rover with barely any traction. So, now, I managed to get some time and built a new rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a weird design. It started out to be an 8 wheeler and a rather large one too, but, on the way I accidentaly hit \u0022Launch\u0022 and saw that it was pretty decent as it is. So with a few improvements I believe it\u0027s mostly ready to be sent up to the Mun! I would like a \u0022review\u0022 of a sort because I don\u0027t want all this and more effort to be wasted when I reach the surface of the Mun.

I usually build rovers in multiple parts and join them together at the destination using docking ports. This way they pack nice on the rocket, but they can be as wide and long as I need for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also recommend building in a way to flip yourself back upright if you to roll over. Things can get pretty wobbly at higher speeds on the Mun, and I almost always end up on my roof at some point on long drives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T19:39:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MrUberGr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MrUberGr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would like a \u0022review\u0022 of a sort because I don\u0027t want all this and more effort to be wasted when I reach the surface of the Mun.

A single 2m square panel with 1 of the smallest wheels on each corner, a probe core, 2 RTGs, a headlight, and 2 lawn chairs is all you need for that. You can even build this in the VAB if you put the wheels on 1 at a time, and the probe core will be rightside up for driving. A rover this small is easy to fit between the legs of a lander, sandwiched between the lander and the main rocket stages. The only finishing touches would be in action groups. Make it so only the rear wheels go on the brake command and rig up another key to toggle steering on and off for the rear wheels. Cruise with steering only in front, do slow, precision positioning with all 4 wheels steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, though, Mun is not good rover country. It\u0027s just too jagged so you have to do a lot of detouring around craters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrUberGr","CreatedById":78026,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T23:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rover is meant to rove \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a space station orbiting Kerbin.
