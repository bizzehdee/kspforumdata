I found that sometimes a vessel would start rotating due to applied SAS force when SAS is actually \u003Cstrong\u003EOFF\u003C/strong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 and without any input on my side. It would also deplete electric charge. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E Time acceleration and/or reloading the vessel does not fix the \u0027phantom\u0027 SAS control. I could not replicate the circumstances, it appears that it happens randomly to a vessel. I took a screenshot of one of these occurrences. On it you can see, SAS is off, electric charge is being depleted, and there is a slight pitch control being applied by SAS. Your location doesn\u0027t seem to be a culprit either, I had this happen on a launch pad, when flying, and when landed on the Mun. Also, I couldn\u0027t connect the possible bug to any of the mods, this happened in vanilla KSP too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help or explanations are very appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I think there\u0027s a good chance that im simply missing on something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jiXiSpr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jiXiSpr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T11:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have heard of a similar case before.
