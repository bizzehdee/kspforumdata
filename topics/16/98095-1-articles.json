I\u0027m doing Career mode, I got a contract to \u0022Perform Temperature Scans of Kerbin\u0022. It marked out the spot \u0022Measure Temperature in flight below 18,000 meters near Site C4-L\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built a plane, flew it there. It even said \u0022Entering Site C4-L\u0022, I right clicked the thermometer and hit \u0022Log Temperature\u0022 and.... \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E. I tried turning the display on and doing it again, nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried the other spots, also nothing. Nothing happens when I log temperature even though it tells me I\u0027m entering the zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen this happen quite a lot of times actually. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing wrong or if this is a common bug, but I haven\u0027t found anyone else having this problem when I\u0027m googling it. So, what do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using Interstellar and Deadly Reentry.

Make sure your altitude is right. The zones are mapped in 2D, not 3D. You could be in \u0027zone\u0027 but above or below the altitude required for the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do you get the standard Science screen that pops up when you log temperature? You know, the one that has a short narrative of the science and two green and blue bars for recovery and transmission? If you\u0027re clicking \u0022Log Temperature\u0022 and you don\u0027t get the Science screen, that\u0027s a separate issue (and probably a bug). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you get the Science screen but no \u0022Collecting temperature data for zone XXXX\u0022 pop-up message in white text, make sure your altitude is right (#1). If your altitude is right and you\u0027re in the zone and you get a science message but no contract completion, then it\u0027s probably a bug.
