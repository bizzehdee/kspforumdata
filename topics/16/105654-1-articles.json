How do you ensure that docking ports will be at the same height? Does anyone know whether the future will include flexible hoses? If that\u0027s the case, perhaps I need not try to standardise."},{"CreatedByName":"Wintersdark","CreatedById":128573,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:18:22Z","Content":"KAS covers this, but stock?
