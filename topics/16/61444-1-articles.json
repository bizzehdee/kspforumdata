The rocket is simple a capsule with parachute a decoupler some fuel tanks and an engine. I\u0027ve made sure the capsule bottom is oriented so that the heat shield is facing reentry direction and parachute is on top but it doesn\u0027t matter. The staging for the chute is set at 0. Any ideas? (I tried a search for this problem but didn\u0027t find anything). A lot of fun anyway even though Jeb keeps being atomized.

Depending on the mass of what you are bringing down, you might need drogue chutes to slow you down for deployment if you don\u0027t want this to happen. You also want to make sure you do not deploy with physical time warp running, because this is a near guaranteed failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, and I might do a bit of self promotion here, but you might want to try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57988\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERealChute\u003C/a\u003E.
