So how bad is it. How much will it effect the game and will it make it almost unplayable? or are the increased memory demands more modest than I imagine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T17:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI honestly do not think that RT will add that much memory overhead.

New tech doesn\u0027t really obsolete old tech, so if your KSO\u0027s are still functional, you just leave them in place. If I decide I need to upgrade a component, usually a direct replacement in orbit with a bigger/better dish and more power sources, I\u0027ll usually try to identify some other need. So for example, when I decided to replace my first-gen KSO\u0027s with a couple much larger beasts, the first-gens were still functional. They wound up moving out to the Mun to provide full coverage there, not because I was likely to send any more probes there, but just because it pleased me to provide \u0022dark side\u0022 communications for my lonely Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
