Does anyone knows or can offer a pointer as to how mathematically calculate this? I know this will depend on the shape of the rocket, whereas in pre-1.0 pretty much all parts had a drag coefficient of 0.2. But in any case, is there a method that would give as a ball-park figure? \n\nI tried launching multiple times by hand but I got very different values, even with the same rocket... because my skills are lacking I guess. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:27:35Z","Content":"At some point, I think you jsut have to plan for the worst, or use mechjeb.\n\nIt\u0027s not just shape of the rocket, it\u0027s your speed, relative to terminal velocity (which changes with altitude), and angle of attack: which are impossible to flawlessly reproduce.\n\nin reality, 90% of your design and skill are going to save you up to 500 m/s.

Even in the old model with fixed 0.2 drag, optimal delta v speeds could only be calculated in closed form for vertical ascent, and I\u0027m not sure if the amount needed could be computed algebraically.\n\nSpitballing some ideas, you could start by using energy to calculate a minimum, and then try to add in Gravity, drag, and steering losses, but, as I said, you\u0027d likely be using numerical methods to find the latter three."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyeRangerDelta","CreatedById":143259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:26:02Z","Content":"If you are looking to calculate delta-V, you can install the mod Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER) and I know its 1.0.2.

Just note your dV on launch and in orbit (and your TWR at launch, and also how your TWR changes during launch), and you can expect roughly the same for vessels with similar dV and TWR."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

It depends a lot on the size and shape of your rocket (and on the heat tolerance of your parts), even assuming that you fly the perfect gravity turn.\n\nOrbital maneuvers in vacuum can be calculated, atmospheric maneuvers not so much."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:28:07Z","Content":"I would think that the DV would depend more on engine selection than on drag.

But your DV needed will vary by a large amount depending on what engines you use at the various altitudes of your launch because of the changes to engine ISP and thrust."},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:50:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would think that the DV would depend more on engine selection than on drag.

Drag force is proportional to the surface area that goes into the windstream. The acceleration due to drag (i.e. delta-v losses) is drag force divided by mass. For example, a 1.25m ship will have twice as much drag losses as a 2.5m ship that has the same shape but scaled up."}]}
