You can get mods that adds communication functionality to the game. As for probes and satellites I tend to send them to other planets to check out the planets dynamics and such, things like scouting for a good landing spot, or setting how an atmosphere will affect flight. Yes, the tracking station tells you, but you can\u0027t really get a feel for it until you flown through it before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
