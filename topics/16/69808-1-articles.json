Duna, and the outer planets - No problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just finding Moho is an absolute pain in the backside to get to without using an extraordinary amount of delta v, So I\u0027d just like some tips on the most efficient way to get there... Generally I try to aim for 2-3 burns to get there, which is easy with Duna for example, not sure if it\u0027s feasible with the inner most planet. Of course i could just run a similar orbit for years until I got a close encounter, but this isn\u0027t very realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Should I leave Kerbins influence/orbit before burning doing my first pereapsis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Should I aim for my first burn to put my pereapsis exactly on mohos orbit line?

Sometimes the best option is to sort your inclination out to start with from the ejection burn, getting directly on course for a Moho intercept. Maccollo mentions this is the case in the best Moho windows. In a good Moho window you can get from equatorial LKO to low Moho orbit for a bit over 4000 m/s delta-V, while in a bad window it might take over 5000. (Still much less than if it\u0027s completely out of window, in that case you\u0027re looking at ten, twenty, even thirty thousand m/s.)\u003Cp\u003EOther times you\u0027ll want to make a mid-course correction, but that may not always be cheapest at the AN, so experiment with manouevre nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E* In General, do you find it takes many orbits (so hundreds of days) to get a reasonable encounter with Moho?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIf you wait for a good window, go directly to Moho, and sort things out properly, you\u0027ll only need to make one half-orbit transfer.

You don\u0027t need to do that horrible inclination burn at all if you don\u0027t want to. You just have to get an intercept at the exact point Moho passes the inclination marker on the orbit. So you do one burn to get that intercept and once you get to Moho, it\u0027s just one burn to obtain orbit. As long as you pack plenty of fuel and have enough TWR you should be able to slow down fast enough before you leave the Moho SOI. To get this kind of intercept, you have to wait for the planets to align and be lucky. Moho will orbit much faster so you won\u0027t need to wait long to get an intercept like this, it just takes some tweaking to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T07:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m finding getting an encounter with Moho quite easy now after having tried it quite a few times.
