What kind of numbers do you need to get an arbitrarily large plane off the runway at 80 meters per second. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I\u0027m really struggling to make decent looking wings. Any tips (lift from procedural wings is inadequate, and in any case I\u0027m aiming for stock-only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T15:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI quite like the look of the high lift straight wings attached end to end. Sorry, forgotten the name, but the picture below should make it obvious which ones I mean. To get a \u0022straight edge\u0022 you will need to rotate the wing two small clicks when attaching it to the end of the wing inside it. This setup produces really enormous amounts of lift, the pictured aircraft gets those two orange tanks into orbit (pretty much full).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther designs using the large delta wings rely on also using the rectangular structural wings for the inner sections. The structural wings don\u0027t provide nearly as much lift. Also, per unit area the wings pictured below produce more lift than a delta. You can fit three of them in the space taken up by a large delta. This can be important because you only have a limited amount of fuselage space to attach wings to!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your question on thrust per ton, I generally just build by the seat of my pants.
