It also looks like you only have 2 parachutes for that monster. and remember Eve has a higher gravity than Kerbin, so your Vessel mass is going to balloon. I would seriously consider replacing those landing legs with I-beams and strutting the crap out of that part of your craft (cause if that fails the whole thing will fail) I have zero experience coming back from Eve so take my advice with a grain of salt, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to make it down before you make it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T17:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see any lateral struts.
