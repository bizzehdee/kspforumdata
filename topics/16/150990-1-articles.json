In fact, based on having four of them I\u0027m willing to bet that you have them placed along the trailing edge of your main wings. If those wings are close to the middle of the plane\u0027s center of mass then you probably aren\u0027t getting as much control authority out of them as you may think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, make sure that you don\u0027t have pitch, roll and yaw assigned to the same control surfaces. Their movements will interfere with each other. Ones on the tips of wings should just be for roll; ones far at the back of the plane should be for pitch; and ones on rear vertical stabilizers should be only for yaw (until you get the feel for more advanced designs.) Be sure to disable the torque on any cockpits or reaction wheels as well, since these can sometimes twist your plane into angles of attack that are not aerodynamically stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it would be helpful if you could post a picture of your craft to imgur.com and link it here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222826855\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150990\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477618570\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntried thrusting out of it,but my engines tore off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may also be possible that your plane is so heavy that there is a lot of flexing between parts.

Odd things happen with shock fronts (specifically, if I\u0027ve understood this correctly, the oblique shock wave from the front section of the shuttle creates higher drag forces lower down the craft... but I\u0027m not an expert about that sort of thing...), and I expect that that makes a big difference to what sort of shapes are stable. Since KSP models drag per part (afaik), this and other real-life design issues like canard close-coupling aren\u0027t modelled, so there\u0027s bound to be a slight difference between KSP-stable and RL-stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CraftyDwarf","CreatedById":165987,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T16:06:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, so I am working on a lenticular arrangement, and one of the other adjustments I am tryng is to move the engines out.
