Also, lifting surfaces (wings and control surfaces) work pretty well on the water. So if you put a part or two low on the vessel, that will help it skim the water. That skimming mostly helps for takeoff, but can also provide some stability for landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at the stock Mallard, there are a couple small swept wing pieces near the back of the plane. It also has some speed brakes in the same area. The wing pieces help it maintain balance, and the air brakes add drag in the water (which can help with either steering or stopping the plane).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-02T21:10:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I\u0027ll have to try that Osprey!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-02T21:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t try water landing with planes, I do it with VTOLs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dire","CreatedById":12239,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T04:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always cheat and add a pair of radial chutes to all my planes.
