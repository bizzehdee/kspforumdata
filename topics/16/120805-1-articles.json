Essentially, this is a force that pushes against the nose of the plane. It also pushes against wings and tail fins. If the force is pushing too hard against the nose compared with the tail fins (or possibly delta wing), the craft will tumble off course. High tail drag, e.g. using AIRBRAKES, is the most straightforward way to combat this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second factor is the position of the CoM. A CoM nearer the nose will increase the amount of nose-drag needed to pull the craft off course.

Reaction wheels also don\u0027t produce nearly as much mechanical torque as atmospheric drag can.
