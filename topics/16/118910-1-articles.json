The theory being the less time between you starting your insertion and landing the less time gravity has to act on you. The practical way to optimize this is to burn as absolutely late as possible, so you velocity hits zero at the same time as your altitude hits zero. Like earlier posters explained, this is where higher TWR ratios help. the difference between 1.1- and 2 is huge, likely a few hundred m/s of DV on Mun, while the benefits drop off as it gets higher.

If you\u0027re using the \u0022stop \u0027n\u0027 drop\u0022 method, it\u0027ll cost 578 m/sec to arrest your lateral velocity and then another 181 m/sec to arrest your freefall velocity at the surface for a total of 759 m/sec. Using an intermediate method will yield somewhere in between, but even this is preferable to bombing in from a 2 million meter apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s where it gets weird: Raising the t/w very quickly yields diminishing returns, and soon adds no measurable benefit. Running a lower t/w will generate higher DV losses from gravity, *but* these losses may be offset by the reduced mass, structure, and fuel consumption attendant with carrying less engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach engine has an ideal t/w for a given body fir high mass efficiency, and it\u0027s usually in the range of 1.2-1.6 for launches and *less than* 1 for landing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mQcUYjE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mQcUYjE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe devoted way more time and energy to studying this than is probably healthy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T13:43:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 01:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
