A small rocket is used on the tail to counter rotation, previously you used the trottle to ballance out the spin. If your useing rockets on the blades to induce the spin mucking with the throttle will adjust both at the same time. you might have a hard time adjusting the turn rate of the roters while balancing the counterspin on the tail. It will probably require some realtime adjustment of the tail rockets tweekable throttle.
