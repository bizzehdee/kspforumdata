In fact, other than the Pioneer 10/11 and Voyager probes using slingshots for their \u0027grand tour\u0027 trajectories, the slingshot technique wasn\\\u0027t really used until the 1980s, when limited delta-V combined with ambitious missions meant that Galileo and Cassini had to use multiple inner-planet slingshots to reach Jupiter and Saturn. (New Horizons is a simple probe along the lines of Pioneer and Voyager, and with the use of an Atlas V Heavy, we had more than enough delta-V to get it there on a simple transfer--in fact, it was a direct ascent, with it being the fastest thing humans have ever put into flight, passing lunar orbital radius a mere *18 hours* after launch!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lunniy Korabl","CreatedById":10897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T13:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat?
