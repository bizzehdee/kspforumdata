This will cause torque, which causes the docked ship to twist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThink of holding a car battery right in front of your chest. Doable, right? Now stretch your arms horizontally in front of you and try to hold the same car battery. If you can, impressive, but likely, you cannot. And yet, it\u0027s the same battery! The \u0022turning force\u0022 is called torque and is proportional to the distance of the pivot point. If you push or pull directly in line with the center of mass there will be no torque, and no twisting. Offset the force (or the mass) and things will start to twist and turns.
