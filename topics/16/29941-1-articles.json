The comparable aerospike rocket with TWR = 1 has a little less vacuum delta-V, but is only 18 tons. That\u0027s where my thought process started, but you can play around with the planetary surface gravity, maybe put in a payload mass and see how that changes things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell the real trick is determining at what mass using LV-Ns becomes feasible, because for lower mass payloads and engines, you can actually get more dv AND more twr just by going lighter... but with a heavy enough lander, the engine weight is less important than thrust and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: not sure how accurate that spreadsheet is.
