The first step to getting to the other celestial bodies is getting to orbit. And getting to orbit is quite tricky, too -- but at least if you can do that much, you should understand what prograde, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E are, and you don\u0027t need maneuver nodes to get to orbit. But basically it comes down to: Wait for a launch window. Get to orbit. Place a maneuver node in the right place on your orbit. Pull on the prograde handle of the maneuver node until your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E reaches your destination planet. Turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to lock your ship in the prograde direction. And go to full throttle when the maneuver node tells you to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T10:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA question first: Can you get to a consistent orbit around Kerbin? By that I mean, every time you launch, you are able to have the same apoapsis, periapsis and inclination within a small or smallish tolerance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext: Can you get to Mun and Minmus just fine again with consistent encounters in terms of periapsis over the moons as well as travel time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not on the 2nd question, practice that and make a good note of where Mun/Minmus are\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Erelative\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0to where you make the transit burn and equally important, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhere they\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eare going to be\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0when you encounter them. For Mun, it should be in the neighbourhood of 100-135\u00A0degrees\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eahead\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0of where you make the burn and it will travel about 45-90 degrees give or take by the time you encounter it. Play around with these angles and see how it affects travel time and delta v requirements. For Minmus it should be in the same neighbourhood but here you also have the 6 degrees inclination to consider. One thing you will notice is, you will encounter the planet roughly at the opposite side of the planet/the sun\u00A0from where you made the burn. This will be true for all planets, and moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting to another planet is really nothing different other than you will be orbiting the sun and not Kerbin when you make the transit burn. The mechanics are exactly the same for getting to the outer planets but the angle will be different for each case within some margin. For the inner planets, the target needs to be lagging behind your burn node. (Yeah you could perhaps do a single burn directly from Kerbin orbit but that takes a great deal of practice. Getting out of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and into an orbit around the sun before making the transit burn makes life easier imo).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the node, there are 6 terms you should familiarize yourself with:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrograde: The direction of travel at any given moment and place in your trajectory/orbit. Add velocity prograde will increase your orbital speed and raise the orbital altitude at the opposite side of the body you are orbiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRetrograde: The exact opposite direction of prograde. Add speed retrograde will slow down your orbital speed and lower the orbital altitude at the opposite side of the body you are orbiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrograde and retrograde have yellow markers on the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadially In/Out. The direction perpendicular to the point in orbit you are at that moment,\u00A0 outwards or inwards. Use these to raise and lower the orbit any other place than the opposite side of the body you are orbiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadials have blue markers on the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormal/Anti normal: These are perpendicular to your orbit but parallell to the surface of the body you are orbiting. If your orbit is equatorial, then they should point towards the north and south pole of the body you are orbiting. If your orbit is polar, then they will point east/west. These, in combination with prograde and retrograde, are used to change your inclination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormal/Antinormal have purple markers on the maneuver node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a stable orbit around Kerbin, play around with all 6 of these without making the actual burn, just to familiarize yourself with how adding or subtracting speed for all 6 will affect your orbit\u0027s apoapsis, periapsis and inclination. If you are familiar with vector addition then it should become clear why adding or subtracton\u00A0 speedfor one might require some change of one of the others. This is particularly important for inclination changes where you don\u0027t want to change the apoapsis and or periapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you might know or you might not know but after you have set a maneuver node, you can right click on it and it will change. Instead of 6 arrows, you get a big fat X for deleting the node as well as 2 blue icons for delaying the burn in terms of full orbits to complete before the burn. Do play with these blue icons when setting up for an encounter with Mun/Minmus and understand why that changes the time of the burn and therefor your arrival time and place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have this down well, set up for a journey outside Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. Target either Duna or Eve (because they are relatively speaking close and with little inclination, as well as massive enough for an easier encounter than say, Dres). Set up a node not too far ahead and again, play with the 6 arrows on the node and make notes of how that affects the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eprojected\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0trajectory. If you can not get an encounter when matching the apoapsis for Duna or Periapsis for Eve, move the node around your orbit, minding that it will most likely change your projected apoapsis and periapsis so make any correction for that. If you can not find an encounter after trying the entire orbit, click the blue round ball that says \u002B to add 1 orbit and try again. Keep doing this and you should find an encounter at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-30T10:27:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2017 10:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by LN400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RX2000","CreatedById":164186,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T14:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I were you I\u0027d upgrade to 1.3.1 \u0026amp; then start playing through the career mode, taking missions as they are offered.
