Mechjeb is too tempting to my mind, however he is a valuable learning tool, you really can learn to pull off some manouevers by watching him execute them, and for the advanced players theres a certain tedium removal once you are launching the 19th refueler to your station. I would actively encourage new players to try other mods however, any of the realism bits, stuff that adds depth or near-future tech, cosmetic stuff, outright utilities (navball especially).

Especially with Eve, my initial de-orbit burn from Kerbin never intersects due to the different inclinations. So plop a 2nd Maneuver node at the future A/D Node and add a correction burn. Now you can go back to the 1st Maneuver Node and fine tune your burn for an optimal intersection.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. I love the new course tracking options to the left of the NavBall, especially RetroGrade for landing. Once I get my lander pointed tail-down, I click on RetroGrade.
