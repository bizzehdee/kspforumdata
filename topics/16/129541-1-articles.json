It\u0027s caused by subassemblies not respecting/saving the orientation, the center-of-gizmo (as I like to call it), and sometimes even the correct\u00A0attachment node of the one part that was connected when you \u0027plucked\u0027 it to make the subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo trying to place it back exactly as it was before, especially when it was a radially attached part, sometimes becomes impossible, because the transforms (rotate/offset) you need to get the exact same placement do not leverage around the same points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I do nowadays when I want to make a subassembly, I never pluck the actual set of parts from the craft... I mod-click it to take a copy only and leave the original in place. Then save as subassembly, then test how it saved and whether it works as I need it to. Sometimes it plain refuses to save in a workable state and I have to rethink how to attach those parts in a different way so when I \u0027pluck\u0027 the set it will save in a usable state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, avoid making subassemblies starting with a part that is radially attached or rotated in a non-cardinal angle (0,90,180,270). That is practically a guarantee your subassembly will not radially attach the same way, ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
