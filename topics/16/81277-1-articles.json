So I guess the Mun always comes first, then Minmus, Duna and Ike?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd secondly, what \u0027Explore\u0027 contracts come after Minmus, Duna and Ike? Which planets are next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, does it change which contracts are unlocked depending on which planets have been explored already? So if I explore Duna in a previous contract and received an \u0027Explore\u0027 contract for Jool, would it have still concerned Jool even if I had only explored Ike instead?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for helping guys, any info appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T01:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe order of \u0022Explore\u0022 contracts does appear to be hard-wired as you describe. Which is something of a bummer because several transfer windows to the outer planets and Moho come up before Duna\u0027s in any new game. However, going to the outer planets takes a long time, and there is to my knowledge no requirement that the ship completing part of an \u0022Explore\u0022 contract be launched AFTER the contract is accepted. So you can launch stuff for the Outer Darkness as windows come up and while those ships are en route, bang off the other, closer targets as they appear. If the stuff to the outer planets gets there before contracts regarding them become available, just park in orbit and wait until they do. Then accept the contracts as they become available and complete them with the pre-positioned ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T03:19:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just fired off a bunch of probes to Moho, Duna and Eve, all at the same time.
