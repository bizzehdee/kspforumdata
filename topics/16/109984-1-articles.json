Basically, I have tried every ship design I have seen, but they\u0027re all outdated and they\u0027re all for \u003C0.90.

Has anybody figured out a reasonable way to leave Eve? Or am I just doing something wrong? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T19:13:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:13:02Z","Content":"Definitely possible, maccollo has done it: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1900226\u0026viewfull=1#post1900226](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1900226\u0026viewfull=1#post1900226)"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:13:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Definitely possible, maccollo has done it: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1900226\u0026viewfull=1#post1900226](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29533-What-did-you-do-in-KSP-today?p=1900226\u0026viewfull=1#post1900226)\n\nOh, sweet!
