They are placed on the beams next to the wheels. Center of gravity is more or less in the middle of the 4 chutes. When I deploy them in the athmosphere everything looks OK. However, as soon as they fully deploy the rover flips up side down and i\u0027m unable to rotate it the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m baffled as to how this is possible. Looking at my descent can you see a reason why this would flip when the chutes fully deploy?

Since parachutes work by generating drag and by pulling things they\u0027re pulling the lower part of your rover up thus flipping it.
