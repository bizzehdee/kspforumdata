Basically, I had a rocket with 7 T-30 engines, with a T-800 body and 6 T-400s as the asparagus stages. The problem I had was with fuel transfer. The T-400s were each connected to the T-800 individually and to each other in a counterclockwise fashion. The actual problem was that the T-800 ran out very fast while the T-400s worked very well. Can you help, pwetty pwease? ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T00:52:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crocket**"},{"CreatedByName":"jkool702","CreatedById":146465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:01:48Z","Content":"The fuel flows one way - from your initial attachment point to your final attachment point. It sounds like your fuel lines were attached reverse. If you zoom in close you can see little arrows indicating which direction fuel will flow in the fuel lines."},{"CreatedByName":"Crocket","CreatedById":146960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:08:05Z","Content":"I\u0027ll see if that solves it.

Have them go from 400 tank to 400 tank in order of staging. And then the last 400 tanks will go to the center tank."},{"CreatedByName":"Crocket","CreatedById":146960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:50:42Z","Content":"I think that solved it!
