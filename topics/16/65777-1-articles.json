I know jet engines work on Eve, so the added fuel efficiency might help get the ship past the thickest part of the atmosphere. There, conventional rockets could take over. Also, this plan might be aided by the new Rapier engines, but I don\u0027t know their thrust off hand. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T16:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJets don\u0027t work on Eve, only on Kerbin and Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T16:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJet engines actually don\u0027t work on Eve because it doesn\u0027t have an oxygen atmosphere.
