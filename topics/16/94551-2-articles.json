DVR has no effect on your efficiency chart, yet it obviously has an effect on the TWR curve, therefore it has an effect on the time spent on the ascent, therefore it has an effect on your chosen definition of efficiency. Consider two craft with the same TWR and I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, but different DVR. Say, each has a starting TWR of 1.5, but one has a DVR of 2, and another has a DVR of 5. I can\u0027t be assed to dredge up the correct numbers at this point, but let\u0027s assume it means the latter craft has twice as much fuel for its mass. It means that by the time the first craft reaches orbit, it will be dry - its TWR will be maximum - say, 6. Assuming the same dry mass/wet mass ratio between the two craft, the second craft will still be pushing half-full tanks, having an effective TWR of somewhere around 3.5-4. This changes the time spent on ascent, and changes the TWR curve, which should have an impact on efficiency the same way high ISP does.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy formula assumes nothing about the craft, except its TWR, TVR, and DVR. If you can get those values, then the model will predict results accurately. For the case you described above, where the only mass of the ship is fuel, then DVR = infinity since m_wet/m_dry = infinity since m_dry = 0. Thus, in order for my model to \u0022make\u0022 those assumptions, I will have to input DVR = infinity. Otherwise, it assumes realistic values for DVR. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAssumes nothing about the craft, yet \u0022realistic values for DVR\u0022? What does \u0022realistic values for DVR\u0022 even mean, in this context? DVR depends entirely on the design of the rocket, a dedicated lifter will have just enough dV to reach orbit, while a lifter-pusher stage will have extra dV for orbital maneuvers, and an SSTO will have enough to go up, maneuver, and get back down. That your formula produces results independent on DVR, especially per my response to the previous quote segment, would seem to point to an error in your formula somewhere.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-27T05:50:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2014 05:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sean Mirrsen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T21:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETVR is interesting and at first glance surprising (though the explanation makes sense).

I can\u0027t be assed to dredge up the correct numbers at this point, but let\u0027s assume it means the latter craft has twice as much fuel for its mass. It means that by the time the first craft reaches orbit, it will be dry - its TWR will be maximum - say, 6. Assuming the same dry mass/wet mass ratio between the two craft, the second craft will still be pushing half-full tanks, having an effective TWR of somewhere around 3.5-4. This changes the time spent on ascent, and changes the TWR curve, which should have an impact on efficiency the same way high ISP does.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherein lies the issue.

However, before the fuel is burnt, it is basically a payload (it doesnt matter that it is fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket equation states that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdeltaV_expended(t) = Isp * g0 *ln(m(t=0)/m(t))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo burn the same amount of deltaV, since Isp and g0 are constant, all that matters is the ratio between initial mass, m(t=0), and the mass at the end of the burn, m(t). The FMR does not effect deltaV. Thus, the TWR at the end of both burns (and, in fact, throughout the entire burn) will be the same, since the ratio of the initial and final masses will be the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf we add a third rocket, that instead of having extra DVR has extra I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, wouldn\u0027t the change in the efficiency due to the lower FMR for the same DVR of the more efficient engine effectively mean the same thing as I just described, per your formula?

With a low Isp engine (say 300), an FMR of about 0.5 will be needed to achieve this, and so, TWR will nearly double during the flight. Thus, even if one starts out with TWR = 1, by the end, TWR might be around 2, and so, average TWR will be between 1 and 2. Since increasing TWR results in increased efficiency, low Isp engines do not require as high initial TWR, since their TWR will naturally increase significantly over the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with a high isp engine (say 4200), for DVR = 1 on Tylo, a FMR of nearly 0.05 is needed. During the burn, only 5% of the mass will be lost, and so, TWR will icrease by the same factor.
