It seems that the A300 is capable of carrying some very large cargoes. Has anyone else tried something similar to this (using the A300 or a modified version to transport stuff like tanks or base modules)?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T07:08:00Z","Content":"It can carry my WIP shuttle high enough even with all that drag, A300 is a beast"}]}
