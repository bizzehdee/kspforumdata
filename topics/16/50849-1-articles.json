It has six of the smallest wheels, but with four of the micro landing legs for landing as it is unmanned and i don\u0027t want any broken wheels. I landed it with the landing legs deployed, and it worked. Only problem is, not i cant get them to go in again. If it changes anything they are somewhat clipping through the terrain, and are clipped with the wheels. I works okay with them down though, but not great. With them down it acts like it hits a bump every once in a while, and flips and rolls and dances \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. The wheels still work and are touching the ground since the landing legs are clipping through the terrain. I tested the legs with the rover flipped over, and they still didn\u0027t work. It worked fine on Kerbin? Any help on how to retract the legs would be appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T21:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the rover still have power? landing legs like everything else require power to deploy and retract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are the legs on an action group?
