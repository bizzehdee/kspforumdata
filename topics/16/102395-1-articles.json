It consists of a core with docking nodes and crew habitats, science labs etc. At the end I have docked it with my propulsion unit which consists of a laaaarge pack of fuel tanks and LV-N motors. This thing being quite large, I had decided to connect it to the front of the ship via the large Clamp-O-Tron Sr Docking port.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nNow I try to dock my landers to it which I have launched separately. Upon approaching the ship it looks as if the big Docking port gets attracted to my approaching lander due to the magnetism. It bends and tweaks the whole big assembly and it looks as if it is going to break apart. Wicked shimmy, making it impossible to dock.\n\nIs this a bug? Is it possible to deactivate this? Are there modes that correct this behaviour?\n\nWould this not happen had I used the smaller, normal docking nodes?\n\nBest regards\n\nChris"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T15:30:01Z","Content":"When you approach, can you quickly switch to the mothership?

The only time I\u0027ve seen behavior like what you\u0027re describing is when I have Smart A.S.S. pointing my mother ship toward its target and then switch to the target to do the docking. It\u0027s especially bad when you have both ships trying to point their docking ports toward each other. I\u0027ve had a couple of disasters doing that. A better approach would be to use the tool to orient the mother ship correctly, then turn it off and use SAS to lock it into that position, then do the same for the daughter craft when it gets close to the docking port."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T17:12:16Z","Content":"Be sure to disable SAS when the magnets engage, otherwise they will end up fighting each other, especially if one of your ships is coming in at an angle and relying on the magnetism to straighten out."},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T19:33:19Z","Content":"Ah hah, I\u0027ve never used MechJeb, so I have never really experienced what everyone is on about."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T19:34:23Z","Content":"I have found a workaround, although I don\u0027t know why it \u0022solved\u0022 the problem.\n\nTo explain I need to explain how I built my ship (see Image below). Since that big propulsion unit was not only big but HEAVY ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif), I just added lots of reaction wheels to the front and rears of each cylinder. It functions very well, it turns the whole thing on a dime like nothing. \n\nSo, after my problem here I decided to deactivate all of these reaction wheels and it worked. But I still don\u0027t know why the propulsion unit tried to crank itself towards my approaching lander... \n\n[![i6vd5siq.png](http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150321/i6vd5siq.png)](http://www.directupload.net)"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T20:29:28Z","Content":"I\u0027m thinking something else:\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that a ship, once it starts calculating its physics, can start wobbling, especially if an enabled onboard SAS is reacting to it. *\u0022Crap, nose pointing west, move towards east, crap overshoot, move west (repeat)\u0022*\n\nThis is especially true for orbital assemblies such as motherships consisting of multiple parts with the large ports connecting the pieces. A workaround if you\u0027re willing to use mods is KAS. It comes with a type of strut that can be attached by an EVAing kerbal, and is invaluable for large orbital assemblies (The struts themself is enough of a reason on its own to install KAS. It\u0027s a great mod, you\u0027ll love it, i promise you)\n\nSounds to me like the wobble starts once you get within physics range, and then gradually increases to something unmanageable when you get near. Have you tried disabling all reaction wheels on board the mothership to see if it settles?\n\nRelated: Just when the ports are about to dock, disable SAS on the docking vessel. Then the ports won\u0027t fight each others inclination difference as much, and that should in theory reduce the amount of pull the ports do on each other.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nKAS can be found [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Would this not happen had I used the smaller, normal docking nodes?\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s imaginary or not, but i do get the impression that the large docking ports are more wobbly than the medium ones.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T20:27:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T21:20:06Z","Content":"That\u0027s imaginary. They impart the same amount of torque and attraction as any other docking port.\n\nThe answer is to not come in at an angle. If you\u0027re perfectly straight then you don\u0027t run the risk of wobbling. There\u0027s two kinds of attractive force that comes into play BTW. And they are both configurable in the part with default values of 2.

If the docking ports are at too great an angle to connect, turn off SAS on one vehicle. When the magnetism starts to pull them into alignment, turn SAS back on to brake the rotation and prevent overshooting.
