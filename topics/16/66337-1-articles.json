They drove the transfer stage down to a small 8km x 8km orbit at Moho. Took the lander down ... which was the scariest part. My tiny lander \u002B kethane rig needed more fuel. It was basically a suicide burn at the extreme. Not fun. But we did it. When I go back (which I will), I\u0027ll redesign my lander. I kept cutting weight, cutting weight, cutting weight to ensure I had enough delta-V to complete the mission, that I think I cut too much. I could have easily used a much larger lander, which I will in future missions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Then, Jeb and Bill refuelled the lander and headed back to the waiting transfer stage. Pushed the whole thing out to a 1000km x 1000km orbit in order to wait for a return window, and to give us enough distance so that the long transfer burn could be done in a single orbit. At the low orbit, the period was only about 30 minutes, and my estimated burn was close to 20. It would have required multiple passes to get anywhere, so making a larger parking orbit ensured I could do the long burn in one shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanded back at the KSC (or close enough).
