If you can land a 1 ton craft on Mun using some engine, you can land 16 tons using 16 engines and 16 times as much fuel. There is no limit to the number of engines you can put on your rocket, so just keep adding more until it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, use a bigger engine. A single Swivel provides more than enough thrust to land the entire outpost on Mun along with some extra fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re have trouble steering such a big craft on the way down to Mun, I would personally recommend adding more reaction wheels, although some people prefer to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grogs","CreatedById":195516,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-05T17:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the important questions are: 1. What are the exact contract requirements? 2. What\u0027s your tech level? and 3. What are your plans for the base after completing the contract?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor question 1, sounds like you need a base that supports 17 kerbals, has an antenna, can generate power, and has wheels. First, 17 kerbals is a pretty big base, especially if you\u0027re early-mid tech tree. The antenna and power requirements are pretty easy, but I don\u0027t know how a wheels requirement usually works. If it\u0027s just that you need a ship that has wheels, you could add a couple of the smallest wheels to a regular lander, land to complete the contract, and maybe even jettison the wheels afterwards if you don\u0027t want/need a giant rolling base on the Mun. If I\u0027m not sure exactly what equipment I need to complete the contract, I\u0027ll often just put it on the launchpad to make sure all the boxes are checked (except being on the Mun of course) to make sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor question 2, the tech level determines the parts available. Building a big base and landing it is much easier when you\u0027ve reached the end of the tech tree and have access to bigger parts / better engines. Late game, I would probably build something with Mk3 parts: Mk3 cockpit, passenger module, CRG-50\u002Bscience module, a couple of Mk3 fuel tanks, and then an engine like a Wolfhound. That\u0027s actually a lot like the ship I use to transport tourists / new kerbonauts around the Kerbin-Mun-Minmus system late in the game, so this contract might be a good way for me to get paid for building that ship!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor question 3, do you actually want a base / giant rover on the Mun? If so, then that\u0027s what I would design. Personally, I don\u0027t find such a base very useful, so I would probably build it like a standard lander that comes down tail first on a single engine. Assuming that just having a couple of wheels somewhere on the craft would fulfill the contract, I\u0027d land to complete it, then jettison the wheels using decouplers and take off again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these questions feed into how do you land the base. If you just want to complete the contract and not make a rover base, then just build it like a regular lander / rocket to land vertically with an engine and landing gear at the bottom. If you do want to use this as a proper horizontal base/rover, then you have a couple of options. Option 1 is to land it vertically as described above, then retract the landing gear and pitch it down using reaction wheels/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is super easy to do on Minmus, but somewhat harder on the Mun (but should still be doable). The biggest problem with this method is it\u0027s hard to ever get the base off the ground again. Maybe you can jump off a crater rim or something, but it\u0027s not going to be something you\u0027ll want to have to do very often. The 2nd option is to land it horizontally using 2-3 pairs of radial engines. In my experience, this is a lot harder to control and takes a lot of attention to where the center of mass is when the craft is full and where it shifts to when empty. The good news is that if you can pull it off, it\u0027s usually pretty easy to take off again if you want to move the base or put it back into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want more specific advice than that, I suggest you post some pictures of your design.
