I think I do this because any movement following a camera movement will make the Kerbal correct on his/her own, so it\u0027s easier to force it consciously and predictably rather than wait and be surprised \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy far the worst thing though is when you\u0027re just at the edge or orbital/suborbotal flight. In orbital flight, the head faces north and the feet south. In suborbital it\u0027s head radial-out and feet radial-in. When trying to catch a diving spaceship before it hits the atmosphere or ground, this can be a nightmare as you just have to let go of the controls until the orientation sorts itself and you can see where you\u0027re going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marcushouse","CreatedById":134845,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T13:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I have another thread about this on reddit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching view\u00A0using the V key works as you say the first time.
