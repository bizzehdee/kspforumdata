However, I have been having some issues with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: properly lining up CoM/CoT. This has so far been a huge issue for me. Because I\u0027m trying to build in a cargo bay, I\u0027m trying to keep the CoM around the middle of that, so I don\u0027t get screwed over when using different cargos. However, getting the centre of thrust properly lined up is hard. Furthermore: It\u0027s even harder to get a good line through the CoM and CoT so that the external fuel tank\u0027s CoM lines up with these two. I think this is an issue of getting the CoM far enough backwards. Maybe I should not have any liquid fuel on the shuttle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Having decent aerodynamic properties on the shuttle. My tests so far have shown these to be horrible. Even after dumping all liquid fuel, it has huge difficulties getting the nose up. Could this be an issue of having the CoM too far ahead of the CoL?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T15:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Yup, any time you build something highly asymmetric, you\u0027re going to run into all sorts of CoM/CoL/CoT issues. This is the big challenge of doing lopsided shuttles in KSP, especially because there\u0027s not really any good way to adjust the rig of the thing between and during flights like could be done with the real things. There are several ways of dealing with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA. Acquire infinite patience and just keep redesigning and tweaking until you get something that works.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EB. Give up and instead build the shuttle as symmetrically as possible, like by putting the glider part on top of the boosters instead of on the side (which is what many folks do).\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EC. Get one of the various shuttle mod packs where the creator has already done all this hard work, so that if you put his parts together per the directions, everything will work fine at least if you stay within the design parameters.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The real Space Shuttle had the aerodynamic properties of a brick but at least it was a controllable brick. So if you\u0027re not able to pull the nose up, it\u0027s probably due to something like you said, CoM too far ahead of CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn issue with shuttles is that if you put enough wing on them so that they fly/glide more like airplanes than bricks, then you\u0027ll have a lot of trouble launching them vertically. Big wings means big lift at high speeds and this will all be pulling to 1 side during ascent. This can easily pull the shuttle off the booster or, if you strut it enough to prevent that, make the whole assembly tumble uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of both this problem and all the asymmetrical force problems noted above, it\u0027s often a lot easier (though still far from trivial) in KSP to just make a big spaceplane than it is to make a functional shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Itoum","CreatedById":110885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T18:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont know if it will help but look at mine its flying like a boss and gliding like a champ loll !!! Look at the end i took pictures of my CoM/CoL with and without the external fuel tank, I\u0027m using fuel tank on the shuttle as well. For the cargo ive realize that when in the cargo bay its better to place it at the back so ur CoM go back at liftup. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/hesKL#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/hesKL#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a Shuttle Challeenge too u migth want to look at it for idea \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79273-Kerbal-Shuttle-Challenge\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79273-Kerbal-Shuttle-Challenge\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T18:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can look at the link in my sig if you want to see my shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that tweaking the thrust of your engines is wayyy more reliable than trying to rotate them.
