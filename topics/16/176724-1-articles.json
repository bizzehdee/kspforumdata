There\u0027s an additional \u0022advanced\u0022 trick you can do to make the imgur image frame go away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the answer to your question is almost certainly that you either put too many or too few engines into your Shutdown Engine action. There are two liquid fuel engines to put in (a terrier and swivel, I thinik?), and you must not put in any SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-14T22:16:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2018 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
