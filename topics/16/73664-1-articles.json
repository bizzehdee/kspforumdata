Here\u0027s hoping the usual AMD vs. Intel war doesn\u0027t start here, but here are the facts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD\u0027s chips have grossly inferior single threaded performance to Intel\u0027s, even when running at much higher clock speeds. This is because AMD long ago decided to throw more cores at the problem, while Intel focused on efficiency within the cores. This results in Intel chips having a much better IPC (Instructions Per Cycle). On top of that, the A10 chip is one of AMD\u0027s budget chips, intended to go in mid range laptops and budget gaming desktops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this in mind, I\u0027d never, ever recommend somebody get an AMD based system if KSP is the game they\u0027re most interested in playing (I really only recommend it for people looking for a low cost entry to PC gaming when they can\u0027t afford the better Intel chips). Really, you shouldn\u0027t be using a laptop to game unless you have no other option. Desktops are cheaper, more powerful and have longer lifespans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should look for something with a recent generation Intel CPU. Don\u0027t worry about core count if KSP is your primary concern, because it\u0027s not going to use more than one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T22:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the graphics side, I\u0027d be minded to go with nVidia. On Windows KSP is a 32 bit application so limited to 4GB of RAM. That\u0027s not a problem for the stock game but can limit you if you want a lot of mods. On Linux, though, there\u0027s a 64 bit version of KSP, so you can run more of the big RAM-hungry mods if you want to. nVidia\u0027s Linux drivers are better and less hassle than ATI/AMD\u0027s ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0Kev","CreatedById":69511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T13:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople seem quick to mention KSP only can address 4GB of RAM by itself whenever there are questions about system specs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) This will not likely be the case forever. The game is so far away from release-ready at version 0.23.x. I fully expect that by 1.0 it will be a full-fledged 64-bit application, yes this includes counting on Unity to step up as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your system will always need more than just what the game itself can address. My dinosaur home PC has 4GB of memory (it\u0027s original motherboard died, replacements that didn\u0027t require new CPU and RAM only had 2 ram slots), and it runs terribly. KSP takes several minutes to load, there are lengthy load times between any scene, even just going to map view and back. Sometimes there are loads just during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy wife\u0027s Macbook has 10GB RAM at the moment, and it runs circles around my home PC in KSP, even though it only has integrated intel 4000 graphics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the above items in mind, I suggest 8GB as an absolute minimum for a new computer, and 16GB to think forward for a future of KSP 1.0\u002B and a giant pile of high-res mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the other things mentioned: for KSP and games in general, Intel is far superior at this time to AMD in the CPU realm. For Graphics, nVidia currently seems to be reported as a bit better than AMD offerings for folks who play older games or indie games like KSP, this is largely due to driver support being more robust and complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ac30fspad35","CreatedById":102694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T22:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat about this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egraphics: nvidia 740m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eproesscor: intel 17\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8gb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eect ect\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
