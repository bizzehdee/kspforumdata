Even playing at hard mode, allow for quicksave. The game can and WILL turn against you even if you do everything right and you might end up loosing countless hours of gameplay.

Particularly when a recent contract is completed and always BEFORE saving game. When you notice some bug has ocurred in game, whatever type of bug, go to contracts and see if they are still all there before saving. There\u0027s a bug, in career mode, where all contracts are wiped out and a row of new ones appear. If you already spent your resources building ships for contracts that evaporate...

If you do not allow for quicksave in mid game this bug WILL get you and WILL kill you, sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In the beginning, balancing the budget is top priority. Limit you designs to \u0022crude and workable\u0022 forget \u0022fancyfulness\u0022 factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You will be following certain tech tree choices. Before accepting any contract make sure that you have or are in the verge of having the required techs, otherwise you might get into a dead end... Ignore risky contracts, later on you\u0027ll have the chance to take them all if you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Try to complete several contracts with a single launch, but you already said that, this apllies to all stages in career mode, even when you got endless tech and huge resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. If you are unsure with your designs you can always try them in sandbox, consider that simulating, NASA trained astronauts in simulators time and time again before declaring them \u0022mission-ready\u0022 and, nowdays, all spacecraft and aircraft are simulated before manufacture. But if you want to do it the really hard way avoid using kerbals in testing the vehicles, use parachutes to recover as most as you can from the vehicles and use a tested kerbal recovery system before you send a kerbal in it. Make sure you trigger the rescue sequence with the abort button and not through the staging sequence. Take time to see if there\u0027s something wrong with the design before launch, use the CoM, CoL and CoT tools frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. For aircraft use this method (used in real life): First check stability, apply throttle, let it gain some speed, then thr off, brakes apply, see if it runs smoothly on runway. Next see if it has a good CoL, TWR and landing gear placement. Full throttle, see if it accelerates fast. It should be reach rotate speed before 1/2 runway, so pull up gently on stick until nose comes up, if it does so before 1/2 runway is ok, thr off, brakes aplly. Next take it off ground... From now on there is no option but a smooth landing or loosing the vehicle. Do a circuit around the runway only. Test for optimal TWR, if nose is not too far up (high AoA) in order to achieve level flight. From there on, just do longer flights, aerobatics and or SSTO if it is the case. Remember to have an ejectable control module, with parachutes if you take a kerbal. if landing gear is ok, emergency landing almost anywhere on kerbin is feasible, if landing gear is lost (usually meaning plane suffered strutural failure) but, somehow, it is still controllable, ditching is better than crash landing in ground, unlike real world.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T11:10:27Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jaeleth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T18:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso get the stage recovery mod.

The relatively low funds you get from contracts in hard mode really punish failure; instead, I found that hard mode pushed me to be more conservative in my rocket designs, to make sure each launch was successful and completed the contract(s) it was designed for. A slightly too large, more expensive rocket is much cheaper than a slightly too small rocket that has to be launched twice because it didn\u0027t work the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what would be better. In terms of stock KSP, maybe a normal or moderate difficulty career with quicksave turned off would do it. (And I generally play stock, so I don\u0027t have any mods to suggest.) That would mean you have to put up with the random failures that come from game or game engine bugs, though. It is possible to rationalize them as the sort of random failures that occur in real life, but they can be very frustrating.

I can\u0027t stress this enough. You\u0027d be surprised how much money you can save doing this, which is crucial in hard mode, playing around with several different build types. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, in 1.0 I\u0027ve found Asparagus/Onion staging is almost always more expensive than using a 2 stage core with SRB\u0027s. I didn\u0027t realize this till I started pre-building lifters for this version, in 0.90 that wasn\u0027t the case and asparagus was the way to go. So far I\u0027ve built lifters from 5 to 75 tons and not a single one of them has a fuel line on it because liquid fuel stages are so expensive (especially those with low atmosphere engines like the LV-T, the Mainsail, the Twin Boar, and the Mammoth).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother tip for hard mode cost cutting on lifters, I\u0027ve recently discovered, thanks to a thread in General, the Thud is a wonderful augmenting engine. It costs less than radial decouplers \u002B SRBs in some cases so It\u0027s often better to use Thuds and some extra fuel for more TWR than SRBs. Of course it\u0027s thrust is a little lower so the Thumper still has it\u0027s uses, but even 4 Thuds \u002B Fuel can often be a better choice than 2 thumpers \u002B radial decouplers and nose cones sometimes.
