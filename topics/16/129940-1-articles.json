Once i hit the ocean floor it acted as though\u00A0i had landed on land. I have tried with each mod removed from the game data folder individually, with the same results. When i remove both i can again splash down. Any ideas on why these new mods made my water disappear on Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T02:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethose\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E mods.\u00A0 I did run into a bug exactly like this shortly after 1.0.5 arrived, which turned out to be a problem with Kopernicus (that\u0027s the mod that all the planet packs use).\u00A0 Kopernicus had some code in it that the new 1.0.5 was incompatible with, which caused the ocean to behave like you describe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey fixed it pretty quick and came out with a new Kopernicus version that works with 1.0.5 without farbling the oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, one thing to check might be:\u00A0 do you have Kopernicus installed, and if so, is it an old version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing \u0022no\u0022, but it might be worth asking in the forum threads for Kerbal Plus and/or Waypoint Manager whether these are known issues.\u00A0 If it\u0027s not, you might point them at Kopernicus, since it ran into the same issue and the author fixed the bug there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-15T02:49:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2016 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CuRider","CreatedById":157007,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-15T04:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt definitely has something to do with Kopernicus.
