My laythe lander is a 16T rocket based SSTO which should be able to do the round trip. 2 basic jet engines and a LV30. I\u0027ve added some small chutes to help reducing speed (I\u0027ll still need a boost to avoir crashing). I\u0027ve tested it on Kerbin.\n\nAs my initial option was to place the station at 70km. But I\u0027ve decided to set up at 500km. I think I\u0027ll use one of my tugs to truck the lander to a lower orbit, then try to land\n\nMy question : how do I manage to avoid falling into the water (my SSTO is not a plane) ? Is it better to start at low circular orbit and horizontal aerobrake or should I start on an eliptic orbit and drop form high altitude ?\n\nFor now I don\u0027t car too much where I land on Kerbin and where I went to Duna, there was no problem either.\n\nAny insight ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T22:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T13:39:29Z","Content":"You\u0027re probably better off starting in a low orbit.

The atmosphere should be thick enough to slow you down, especially with chutes.\n\nI\u0027d also advise you against using the simple jets, as 2 turbojets would easily have enough thrust to take off and would provide superior performance in getting to orbit.

Kerbins atmosphere starts a bit higher, but isnt quite as thick, so overall a craft follows a similar trajectory on both bodies. I tend to deorbit about 100-110 degrees before my desired touchdown, the exact angle depends on the drag of the design and the starting altitude, but practice on Kerbin as mentioned. If you can deorbit and have things parachute onto KSC then you ought to be able to hit a Laythe landmass.\n\nBombing in from an elliptical orbit makes hitting the spot even simpler, but means more of a suicide burn to kill the velocity you pick up in freefall. Since you have chutes and jet engines for the softland, I wouldnt think the extra dV would be particularly high."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:44:15Z","Content":"Dropping straight down is still tricky because the moon still rotates.

However, the surface gravity is also less on Laythe, so if chutes work on Kerbin, they probably will work ok on Laythe also.\n\nEven though your lander is not a plane, your jets may be able to help steer you towards land if your trajectory takes you close to land.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI generally take SSTOs with wings to Laythe, but here\u0027s a strategy which worked before I started doing that:\n\nFirst, this requires a lander which will float upright in water. You don\u0027t need wings, but need to be able to launch vertically from water. You\u0027ll need an engineer on board also.\n\nEnter the atmosphere in a way that you think will get you to land on land. I\u0027m not too good at that, and usually end up in the water, but *close* to land. Usually you can get within a few hundred km at least.\n\nUse parachutes and jet engines if needed to land softly in the water.\n\nRepack your chutes. Make sure you have a way for a kerbal to get back aboard the ship if he falls into the water. Or make sure he doesn\u0027t fall off..\n\nAssess which direction the nearest land is. Launch, using your jet engines, and head that way. This time, when you pass over your intended landing zone, you are going slower, and at a lower altitude, much easier to hit your target.\n\nThat\u0027s worked pretty well for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T07:10:35Z","Content":"OK, thx for the advices.

I\u0027ve only to fine tune the speed to than 7m/s.\n\nI think that this low speed is because the landing struts have no effects and non suspension. So the impact speed is dealt to each parts. The water should act as a natural suspension.\n\nOn Tylo, I hit the ground at 30m/s (no more fuel) with the medium landing trust and it did well (not even bouncing)."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T09:47:26Z","Content":"I succeeded, but the ship tilted into the water.
