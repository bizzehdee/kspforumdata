So not only would you need two stations to cover these two cases in a perfectly static model environment, but you also get screwed over because the solar system isn\u0027t static. Kerbin follows its own circular orbit, but the orbit of your station doesn\u0027t turn along with it. The result is that the apopasis turns away from the planet\u0027s orbit vector in a hurry and spends most of its time not pointing anywhere useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you said \u0022okay, so I can get away with one station and I will have two launch windows per Kerbin year, one where the station points prograde and one where it points retrograde\u0022, it doesn\u0027t work - except by pure chance. You need your destination planet in the proper position relative to Kerbin too, after all, and because the orbital periods of the other planets are different from Kerbin\u0027s, they likely will not do you the favor of being right where you want them by the time your once-per-year window comes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just to clarify, you could still eject Kerbin in any direction you want from any position of the refueling station.

Because you\u0027re falling in from such a high apoapsis, your speed near the planet will be far higher than if you were in a circular orbit. Thus, even if you\u0027re a little further away from the planet, you\u0027re still getting a lot of help from mister Oberth.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the wrong part of mhoram\u0027s point was latched onto.

Sure, you can lower this down by burning retrograde at PE to adjust the orbital period for the next pass, but then you\u0027re basically reducing the benefit of making such a huge orbit to begin with. And you\u0027ll need to put your craft into orbit well in advance to join up, refuel, and readjust the orbital period for a timing pass. So you\u0027d typically require two orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probably the bigger problem is, as stated above, more often than not your elliptical orbit won\u0027t be pointing in a convenient ejection angle.

(That\u0027s all assuming you don\u0027t have to make any corrections on the elliptical orbit.), However, the ejection angle problem just about goes away, and with the roughly 1.5 Earth day orbital period, you get window visits more often without having to play with orbital periods as much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-08T21:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2014 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rus-Evo","CreatedById":107004,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T22:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the time it would take you to set that up you could easily rendezvous and dock an extra fuel tank on to the front or rear of your ship and explore half the solar system (if all you care about is assisting your exploring).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if this is simply an exercise in its own right could you just stick a circular orbit a little beyond the Mun and sacrifice Oberth for flexibility? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Otherwise sounds like spending 30,000DV to save 30DV \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T22:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay I\u0027d like to once more weigh in favor of eccentric orbits as I really have very good experience with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe matter is what are your playing priorities.
