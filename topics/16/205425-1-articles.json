Playing around with Spring and Damper settings (available by turning on Advanced Tweakables) helps a little bit, but even with ideal settings, the landing gear is nowhere near to what it was before the that Unity update ruined it. And the devs don\u0027t seem to care to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the gear used to work before that update, it means it should be possible to somehow restore it to the old behavior in the current version of KSP. Is there any mod, any cfg tweak, literally ANYTHING that restores the landing gear to what it was before? Because the game is literally unplayable if you want to do aircraft stuff. There have been dozens of posts about this, and we need a goddamn solution to make the landing gear like it was before. Please tell me there is one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRant over \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"splashboom","CreatedById":213457,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-07T02:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do find it funny how after crash the landing gear debris gets a mind of its own and bounces as if nothing absorbs energy, or it is possessed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-07T10:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re few years too late.

And while it looked like they were easier to control, they weren\u0027t accurate at all. So the whole system was wiped out and basic Unity wheel module was installed, and tweaked. If you\u0027re bouncing so much, maybe try to change settings or your landing approach, I have no problems with it. You may even send a link to your craft to see if anything can be done to help with unplayable bounciness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
