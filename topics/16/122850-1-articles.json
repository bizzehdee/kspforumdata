The spot is indicated with a marker in the orbital map, but there is no marker indicating where this actually is when flying. I can click the marker to \u0027activate navigation\u0027, which will put a temperature icon on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spot to hit is quite small, probably ~1km in diameter. You can make a perfect landing right on the point of the orbital map maker and still not be inside. So then you need to know in what direction to move. Except your reasonably built ship is sitting on its ass pointing skywards, so you can\u0027t actually see the temperature icon on the navball. So what I usually do is make a quicksave, launch the ship straight up, and flop it around till I find the icon and can get a heading. Then load the quicksave. So then I set off in the direction of the icon, without having any notion of the distance I\u0027ll need to fly. If I want to check my direction I\u0027ll have to suicidally point my ship prograde. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes me raving mad. I cannot for the life of me understand why the zone cannot be indicated with a marker that can be set as target, so you get target prograde and retrograde icons, and have a visual indicator showing position and distance when flying. From what I can tell, nothing else in the game uses this \u0027activate navigation\u0027, for everything else you set targets. But since I expect this feature to have been playtested, I am sure that there is some method where the navball temperature marker is a useful indicator. So what is that method? How am I intended to do this in a reasonable fashion, that does not include flying blind and flopping the ship around?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-14T07:43:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2015 07:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by aktivb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPost answered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T10:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t adverse to mods you could try installing waypoint manager that will render the waypoint in space so you can visulally see where it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-1-0-4-Waypoint-Manager-v2-4-2-2015-07-31\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-1-0-4-Waypoint-Manager-v2-4-2-2015-07-31\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T14:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYah, that does seem like a UI hole, the game really ought to have some sort of targetable marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome ways to deal with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Most of my KSP play is about self-set goals, e.g. \u0022do such-and-such exploration, possibly while arbitrarily imposing such-and-such rules on myself\u0022, so for me the contracts are just paying the rent on my space program and I\u0027m looking for contracts that give maximum funds per minute of play time. In those terms, the \u0022visit 4 different places\u0022 contracts are awful (though not as bad as \u0022take N tourists to their destinations\u0022)-- lots of time to do, not so much cash.
