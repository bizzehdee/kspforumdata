Does atmospheric analysis just not work with Jool in 1.0.4 or does it need other conditions? I was barely skimming it, down to 197.7km, and traveling upwards of 8.5km/s. Do I need to be going slower?

The problem is surviving entry. I had a relatively small probe and I slapped a 3.75m heat shield on it. Even with that big oversized heat shield, the probe barely survived; it had only a few kg of ablator remaining when it finally settled into a gingerly descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(edit) FYI, I just looked up my Jool probe and I see that it\u0027s total mass was 5055 kg.

Also note that my descent was started from a low Jool orbit, so the entry velocity was as low as possible. I would have never survived had I attempted an entry direct from a hyperbolic approach. I think the periapsis of my descent orbit was 195 km, but I don\u0027t recall what my apoapsis was (probably not more than 500 km).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-19T16:43:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2015 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
