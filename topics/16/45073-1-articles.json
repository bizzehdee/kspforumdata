I can handle precision landing and everything but my one problem is docking while on the surface. For me it is necessary to dock once on the surface of the Mun but I\u0027m worried that even if I line up docking ports while on Kerbin that the slope of the Mun will make them not line up and not dock. Are there any solutions that will guarantee that the docking ports will line up?
