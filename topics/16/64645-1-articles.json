So there\u0027s no best launch location to constantly point at an L4/5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V to slingshot past Minmus back to Kerbin will depend on a variety of things how low you want to slingshot. If your goal is to hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, you can calculate all that out (as there would be an optimal Mun altitude) but this one is probably easier to just try out and see. My guess is that it would be in the neighborhood of 150 m/s. But the reality is that it will probably take a lot more than that because KSP doesn\u0027t really support Lagrange points. You can sort of simulate L4/5 by being there, but you\u0027re not actually in a Lagrange point from a physics standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo since Minmus has an orbital velocity of about 274 m/s, you would need twice that to reverse your orbit for a retrograde slingshot back to Kerbin. Then whatever dV to correct the slingshot velocity.

Returning from Minmus with minimum dV is around 56 hours. You can knock it down quite a bit, but I don\u0027t know how that lines up with coming back from L4. I haven\u0027t calculated where the Kerbin-Minmus L5 is, but if you\u0027re 60 deg ahead in the arc, you would need a little over a day to get from L4 to Minmus, then roughly two days to get from Minmus back to Kerbin for a burn. I think the bigger problem is waiting for Minmus\u0027 orbit to line up so that it\u0027s on the right trajectory for an interplanetary transfer.

I had been wanting to try having a station or something like this, but I had (in my head) already settled on leaving whatever it was in Munar orbit. Instead of Munar orbit, I aimed for L4. (I chose the Mun because I didn\u0027t feel like dealing with Minmus\u0027 inclination and it\u0027s easier to deal with transfer timing.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set myself up in front of the Mun, just outside of it\u0027s SOI (2.4Mkm). I ended up about 2.6Mkm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started playing with the maneuver node, thinking as if I was trying to slide out of L4 (which KSP doesn\u0027t really simulate). I figured this was probably inefficient and I verified my thought above. If I really wanted to slide out of L4 it was going to be too much dV. It was cheaper to just burn and drop straight back onto Kerbin. You might be able to just slide out the back if you can get the station just in front of the SOI, but that\u0027s tough in addition to getting a perfect orbit. So I sought a better way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of thinking like Lagrange points, I thought about it like I was trying to rendezvous with the Mun. Instead of sliding out the back of L4, I misaligned the orbit slightly so that my craft swung outside the Mun\u0027s orbit. (It actually took about a 45deg burn to slow and go wide.) I spent about 30 dV and ended up in what would have been an elliptical orbit, except the Mun was there to catch me. This caused the craft to enter the Mun\u0027s SOI slightly outside the Mun\u0027s orbit and pass in front. This actually set up for a bit of a retro slingshot inbound with a prograde slingshot outbound to ~30Mkm (think like an elliptical horseshoe). So this ended up behaving as if I had simply slid out the back of L4. It took a little while though, something like 1/3 to 1/2 of a Mun orbital period, which could be sped up with more dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, it was a burn much like leaving Munar orbit for Kerbin. Roughly 150ish dV for a 13 hr return flight in prep for a slingshot, which could be reduced by spending more dV. (So inline with my Lagrange guess in the above post.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while the physics isn\u0027t perfect, it is reasonably possible to simulate. There are still some hurdles to overcome, such as getting the craft orbit perfect so it doesn\u0027t decay into or away from the Mun/Minmus (especially when time warping). I think the Mun is a bit easier to manage, but is probably less economical for Kethane. If you mine it from Minmus, you could potentially tug it to the Mun station when the orbits align.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying don\u0027t do Minmus. I think it would be a bit more challenging if you\u0027re looking for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, while the above dV numbers aren\u0027t for Minmus, you could probably get a rough guess. I suppose after having flown it, I think I understand what you\u0027re after a little bit better. Given KSP\u0027s physics, you might be better off in L5 where you can drop inside the Mun/Minmus\u0027 orbit to catch up. This would cause you to \u0022horseshoe\u0022 retro-slingshot around the Mun/Minmus back toward Kerbin and potentially reduce the dV requirement further.
