I don\u0027t know what to do! if anyone needs to know what launch stage I am using, it is the spacier launch stage that HOCgaming uses. iif you know how to fix it or if you have any helpful suggestions that may stop it from happening, then can you please tell me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T18:41:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 06:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by THE META\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T13:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...I\u0027ve occasionally run into issues with my payload disassembling on me or telescoping into the stack.
