I promised a rescue mission, but what is the best way to go about this?\n\n1.) I hate EVA\u0027s, I generally loose complete control\n\n2.) there is no docking port\n\nMy plan was to rendezvous and use the grabbing thing to connect, then get in an orbit that will bring both to verbal, detach and land both craft.\n\nQuestion is: will this work? \n\nAnd probably too: I can do hohmann manoeuvres in circular orbits, but am unsure about elliptic ones. I guess I have one shot when I time the rendezvous precise.\n\nAny tips?\n\nRegards\n\nChris"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T13:40:49Z","Content":"Tip 1: get better at EVAs, no time like the present. The Key to a successful EVA is to only make small adjustments, tap, don\u0027t hold. If you think you\u0027re moving you are, if you know you\u0027re moving you\u0027re going way too fast.\n\nTip 2: you\u0027re plan would work perfectly, the thing with Rendezvous is it\u0027s not like the movies where you just burn towards your target and you\u0027re there, you will have a close approach, make sure this is as close as possible (2.5km is good enough 0.0 is perfect) at this point plop a maneuver node there, but don\u0027t actually do anything with it (It\u0027s a countdown clock) at that point point to target retrograde (you may have to switch the navball by clicking the speed indicator) and watch the map until you get close to your close approach, Zero your velocity and use RCS to grab with the claw. Don\u0027t worry about undocking them when you hit the atmosphere, assuming they both have parachutes you will be fine."},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T14:01:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Tip 1: get better at EVAs, no time like the present...\n\nThis...

Depends what your orbit is though. If your 80km x 300km or even 100 x 250 it should be possible I think before you run out of fuel in the jetpack. Just don\u0027t run him down to 0, you still need to get back into the capsule."},{"CreatedByName":"thadisjones","CreatedById":134649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T18:34:49Z","Content":"If you\u0027re deploying a rescue using the grappling arm, keep in mind that as long as your inclination between the orbits is the same, you are not restricted to any particular point of interception. Obviously the most dV-efficient solution is to intercept at the periapsis of ellipse, but that requires a specific, narrow launch window. If you can make it into orbit with enough dV available to the rescue craft, you can drag the navigation node along your orbit to easily find intercept solutions at any point in time. \n\nThen once you intercept within a few kilometers it\u0027s simple to gradually kill relative velocity until you\u0027re in matched orbits and a few meters apart. But remember, when doing intercepts, the more dV you pack, the less specific you have to be about points in time and space."},{"CreatedByName":"MacLuky","CreatedById":138597,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T09:25:43Z","Content":"Just realised I never replied to this, thanks for all tips.

As [@Taki117](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/89975-taki117/) points out, the key to EVA is *\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t try to hurry\u003C/u\u003E*.  Slow slow slow.  Tiny little taps on the keys, as brief as possible.  You want to be drifting at centimeters per second.\n- If you did, in fact, latch on with the Klaw, bear in mind that you don\u0027t have to actually bring both craft back to Kerbin.  Once the Klaw is engaged, the two craft act like they\u0027re docked, and you can transfer kerbals back and forth without going EVA at all.  So one way to recover from a situation like this without any EVA is to send a rescue ship with empty seats and a grabber."},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T01:47:56Z","Content":"- \u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you did, in fact, latch on with the Klaw, bear in mind that you don\u0027t have to actually bring both craft back to Kerbin.

Grabbing something with the klaw makes it part of your ship, so you can transfer fuel and kerbals to between your original ship and whatever you grabbed.\n\nAlso, EVA is fun when you get the hang of it.  I\u0027m getting no end of enjoyment building up stations using KIS and KAS.  Like in real life, the key is to take it really slow at first."}]}
