Warp until you encounter the mun (this will happen eventually). Wait until periapsis then burn until you achieve a land-able trajectory. Land. Coming home is much easier, all you have to do is escape mun (go into orbit and burn on the side facing away from kerbin so that your escape trajectory brings you inside of the mun\u0027s orbit, if you don\u0027t it can be a pain because the mun will keep recapturing you) and you\u0027ll automatically be in kerbin\u0027s hill sphere, so then you just need to burn to a sub-orbital trajectory and deploy your parachute when you get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use mechjeb, go into orbit, click \u0022orbital operations\u0022, click \u0022trans\u0022, click \u0022transfer to mun\u0022. Once you arrive, make sure your periapsis is positive (if not, use orbital operations to bring it up) and basically do the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy lander design in this game is a 16 ton vehicle on a 173 ton rocket, and is easily capable of going to the mun and back. My interplanetary vehicle that I just managed to land on duna is, obviously, also capable of that, but that\u0027s a 35 ton vehicle on a 370 ton rocket, which would be a tad overkill. Of course, you can make lighter ones, just an idea of my current design that I have to hand that I know can do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-25T07:52:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2012 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Person012345\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"god42","CreatedById":51676,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T06:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks i made it too the mun but failed the land \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E i use the kerbal x rocket in the load feature and all i done is tweaked it a bit wich seems to work for me\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolus10","CreatedById":17876,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T10:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore you land (when you still on mun orbit) make Quicksave by pressing [F5] key, so you can reload game after crash by holding [F9] button.
