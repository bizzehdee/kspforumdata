The cost-efficient way is to just wait one or more orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just don\u0027t start with nearly similar orbits to begin with.

Kerbins atmosphere ends just below 70km up, so you won\u0027t have any problem with encountering the atmosphere. That way A can catch up to B reasonably quickly. When you estimate you have less than one orbit left to catch up to B, create a maneuver node, move it around your orbit a bit while pulling the prograde and retrograde markers back and forth a bit (its really a bit of a feel you gotta get for this - usually just pull it prograde untill your orbit goes slightly above the item you\u0027re trying to RV with) untill you get an intercept of under 5 km. Preform your maneuver, then wait untill you get to your closest approach. Then cancel out all target-relative velocity, burn towars your target a bit. Then burn retro to stop when you\u0027re within about 100 metres, and dock with RCS from there on. Beware that when you burn retro with main engines, your thrust can push your target around, so avoid using your main engines when you are very close to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T17:04:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how I\u0027d handle that situation: assuming A is the source/control craft and B is the target craft. First, I\u0027m assuming the nodes are zeroed out - that\u0027s very important. If the ascending/descending node is not zero, a burn needs to take place to make it that way. Assuming both craft are on a course where east (090) is prograde, a northward burn at the descending node or a southward burn at the ascending node will do the trick. Zero is where you want it; if you can manage to get it to say \u0022NaN\u0022, you\u0027re right on the money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d then push A\u0027s apoapsis on up to 110k (i.e. roughly the same altitude as B\u0027s orbit). You should then get the intercept chevrons. Plan at the apoapsis next to push the periapsis down closer to Kerbin and watch what that does to the intercept point. If it shortens it, great - just make sure you haven\u0027t pushed your periapsis below 70k (the edge of the atmosphere). If it lengthens it, then go the other direction (I\u0027ll tell you right now that that shouldn\u0027t happen). Do the same thing at periapsis - adjust the apoapsis. At some point while you\u0027re doing all this you\u0027ll get close and find a \u0022break even point\u0022, where it won\u0027t decrease any more; that\u0027s where you plan to burn. Expect to muck it up - H/N on RCS does wonders for fixing that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf after a while you find planning nodes at neither the apoapsis or periapsis helps, try one somewhere in between.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uboats","CreatedById":77596,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T17:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question is that if the two orbits do not have intersection nodes.
