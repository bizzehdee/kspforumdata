Is there a way to choose how to get captured? I already have an orbiting craft with a near-0 inclination that I want to dock with without having to completely reverse my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-30T22:52:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2013 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt.

You just have to lower your periapsis through the planet and out the other side. If you do it early enough it costs very very little delta-v. If you\u0027re having trouble seeing whether your encounter will be prograde or retrograde, you can try changing the value of CONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE in your settings.cfg file. It defaults to 3 (the loopy, end to end version of orbits you normally see, that shows your actual path around the parent body. I can\u0027t recall which it is (1?) but one of them draws the orbits with respect to the object being orbited. That is, it would put the Minmus encounter at Minmus and you\u0027d be able to see whether you were pro- or retrograde right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrTaxman","CreatedById":70450,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T23:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also change both crafts\u0027 orbits to polar.
