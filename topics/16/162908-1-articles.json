The green tinted Monoliths however do grant a random tech tree upgrade(it will pick a node at random). So, early in the tech tree you might get a free 45science upgrade, whoop-di-doo!. But if you can keep out until only your last nodes are open, you will get 1000sci upgrades...maybe more with tech tree mods, it seems to pick anything. Also be aware, there are 1(or 2 ?) unassigned nodes in the stock tree, which can still be chosen by the green monoliths, but these nodes have no parts attached to them(\u0022experimental motors\u0022 is one of them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-05T08:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, anomalies such as the Munar arches only give funds through World\u0027s First awards (no science or rep).

It is a text file, containing probably all the information to put KSP in the same state as your career save, like:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Every part of every ship(including debris)\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Orbital parameters(velocity, position) of each of these\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Tech upgrades, contract selection weights\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Every completed, taken and available contract\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Every notification message\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou want to check the last one of that list. It is a big file, so first i would suggest trying out the old hazard-ish menu by pressing alt\u002BF12, going to the tab containing contract settings. From there you should have some control to complete/cancel/remove contracts and maybe find some of these notifications\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
