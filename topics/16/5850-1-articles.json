Also, it\\\u0027s fun getting weird looks from nearby people on the street as you describe your new rocket plans to a friend...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\\\u0027ve successfully gotten to orbit, I\\\u0027ve gotten to the Mun, and most recently, I managed to not just get to the Mun but have landed on it and gotten back in one piece! I figured my next step was to emulate some of you fine people and put stuff in orbit, and since I\\\u0027d been wanting to make a Spaceplane anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\\\u0027ve been having some problems with it. It gets to orbit no problem, and in fact it\\\u0027s quite handy in the atmosphere. (Handles like a brick wall in space, but happily there\\\u0027s lots of time for maneuvers there.) This is a heavy design, with lots of fuel, wings and engines, so I was expecting it to be hard to fly, but no, actually it\\\u0027s quite nice... so long as its nose is pointing up. As soon as it hits 90 degrees, it is *impossible* to get above that. Not even RCS pointing straight down can help. As a result, I can never shed enough speed on reentry to make a safe landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI attached my .craft file, so you can look at my design if you like. (It\\\u0027s called the Avalanche- slow to start, but try stopping it...)

The usual problems with spaceplane designs are as follows: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Centre of gravity too far front / back\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Centre of lift too far front / back from centre of gravity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Asymmetrical thrust\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Unbalanced thrust (too many engines at the wrong place will destabilise the plane)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Insufficient / unbalanced lift\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Insufficient / overpowered control surface authority\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost anything will launch fine pointed straight up, but without subsonic low altitude flight testing I won\\\u0027t bother trying to recover anything. Work the bugs out stage by stage before you try a complete orbital launch and recovery for easier troubleshooting. For an unpowered gliding ship, you also need to do glide tests to make sure its recoverable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s very hard to diagnose the issue without at least a picture but for a quick fix - you may want to try getting a single engine space \\\u0027fighter\\\u0027 type plane up and down again first. Try using RCS and ASAS to hold re-entry attitude and transition to fixed wing flight at about 20km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the aircraft flies decently well at low altitude then just add more thrust without upsetting the balance of the design. It\\\u0027s easy to reach orbital altitude now anyway because C7\\\u0027s \\\u0027jet\\\u0027 engines do not lose power as they go higher. (more realistic service ceilings are being looked at in the future)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leeksoup","CreatedById":14748,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-22T04:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your checklist, Pandora! I\\\u0027ll definitely go through that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the very least, I took some pictures of the Avalanche.

That\\\u0027s considered a very light fighter by some standards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the Avalanche currently has 4 2 meter fuselages and two huge LF engines with fuel tanks. Definitely need a much bigger wing area to fly it. You may also have the heavy liquid fuel engines at the back weighing down the back of the ship too much making it fall to the ground tail-first regardless of how much lift you have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for this kind of mass, the ship is way too short to fly like an aircraft. Length in terms of KSP C7\\\u0027s spaceplanes like a car\\\u0027s wheelbase - the longer it is the higher the stability you have and the more horsepower you can cram into the hood without upsetting the handling. Currently the craft has something like a turbo Hayabusa engine in a Smart car. It probably just spins round and round the moment you up the power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks stable for vertical launch as you have described, because vertically it is well balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransforming it into a multi-plane would probably work to keep the sleek and well put together profile but... it\\\u0027s much easier to stick a pair of mega wings (the huge ones) to the side if you want to keep the LF engines... or if you get rid of the LF stacks you could transform it into a delta winged spaceplane easy enough!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at this point Avalanche II would either have to be: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Tri-rocket delta wing light spaceplane (using C7 engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Huge liquid fuelled cargo lifter (retain liquid fuel rocket engines)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
