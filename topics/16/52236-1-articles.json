The number crops up in all sorts of scientific formulae. So, to avoid having to worry about how many significant figures of e\u0027s endless string to use, the early boffins who discovered e developed the natural logarithm system. By setting e as the base instead of the usual 10, they avoided this problem, which was more of a big deal back in the day before computers. It\u0027s the same strategy as using radians instead of degrees to measure angles, so you don\u0027t have to mess with all of pi\u0027s digits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing that the universe itself and everyday things like circles are based on irrational numbers can lead to depressing and scary theological conclusions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T15:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ee^x = sum_{n=0}^\u0026lt;infinity\u0026gt; (x^n)/n!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso e = 1/0! \u002B 1/1! \u002B 1/2! \u002B 1/3! \u002B 1/4!... = 1 \u002B 1 \u002B 1/2 \u002B 1/6 \u002B 1/24... = 2.71828\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything more than a 4-function calculator will have this function (and the natural logarithm) built in.
