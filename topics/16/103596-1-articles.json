What I basically want is to face my Kerbal towards the direction I need him to fly and use W instead of shift or control, for example.\n\nThe problem is - nothing happens, the Kerbal still faces the wrong direction. What am I doing wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T09:59:18Z","Content":"Well, Kerbals on EVA can be hard to control, first of all you might want to try switching camera angles. \n\nI don\u0027t know why that won\u0027t work, maybe what is meant is that space reorients your kerbal to the upright position relative to your camera angle\n\nYour best bet for going somewhere other than straight ahead is to combine the different translational controls eg. oyu want to go up and left? Use L-SHIFT to go up and the a key to go left. It is also possible to freely orient a Kerbal using the middle mouse button when on EVA (assuming enabled jetpack and zero-g enviroment) but I personally find this fiddly and not helpful most of the time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T10:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T10:19:25Z","Content":"No, I have learnt to navigate Kerbals from all possible angles, it\u0027s just I\u0027m wondering why pressing space does not work as expected?"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T11:28:14Z","Content":"The vertical axis doesn\u0027t change.
