A KSP restart did nothing for it, the bug still persisted. This seemed to only happen recently, since all craft I have made that use decouplers before today work fine. If it means anything; when I initially put the rockets on the decouplers, they went on the outside of one decoupler, and on the opposite side of the same decoupler, with none on the other decoupler. Even though I didn\u0027t change from 2X symmetry I used to place the decouplers themselves. A quick reload of the craft made them properly symmetrical, but this is when the bug started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I would post screenshots, but it says down the bottom I don\u0027t have adequate permission)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-08T01:18:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2014 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zaddy23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T00:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have KerbQuake or Kerbal Joint Reinforcement installed?
