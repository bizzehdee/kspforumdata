Your craft may not be an extremely tall with an extremely heavy payload, but that is why it happens. As you tip the lever force pulls it around. Solutions can involve more torque, which works in small tipping cases. Or you may have to redesign your rocket to be shorter and wider rather than thin and tall. Other option is to somehow cleverly get most of the heavy weight near the centre of mass so the top part is not the heaviest section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel if u understand why it happens u be able to come up with a solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nuclearping","CreatedById":92457,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T21:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also struggling with this problem.
