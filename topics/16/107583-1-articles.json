Either one will fire left or right or forward or backward.\n\nThey are on the side of my vessel. One every 90 degrees radially. They are all pointing downward.\n\nI just cant seem to make them fire together. Is there a way to control them together?\n\nThanks guys.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T08:40:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Solar71**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:16:20Z","Content":"if you\u0027re using the IJKL control scheme for RCS, H fires \u0027forwards\u0027 (same direction that the main engines would fire if you\u0027ve placed your engine and control point normally), and N fires \u0027backwards\u0027.\n\nUse H to kill your vertical velocity, and use IJKL to kill any remaining horizontal velocity right before you land.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T04:20:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T05:02:39Z","Content":"How light is the lander?
