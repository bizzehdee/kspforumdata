My Duna mission has become a failure. Mostly due to lack of fuel.\n\nThe nuclear-powered mission used up all it\u0027s liquid fuel. Then all the liquid fuel from the auxiliary fuel tank. The LFO mission\u0027s interplanetary stage suffered a catastrophe; an adapter exploded \u0027due to overheating\u0027 when I quicksaved. The lander got down and back up fine, but there\u0027s not enough fuel to get back to Kerbin.\n\nThus, I need to get more fuel out there. Ideally liquid fuel, rather than LFO. The problem, however, is getting that much fuel up off Kerbin. Or rather, the tanks to contain it.\n\nLFO is easy. Just use a big tank. But liquid fuel ONLY comes from aeroplane tankage, which tends to produce lift. That\u0027s not something you want when climbing vertically on the top of a rocket.\n\nHow do I pack/stack fuselages to cancel out lift? Or, failing that, how do I pack together mk1 fuselages so I get a nice clean fairing-able shape for the lifting?\n\n(Yes, I know fairings aren\u0027t weight-efficient, but they\u0027re CLEANER than something with a lot of draggy parts. Easier to control.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T14:27:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Skorpychan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T12:56:38Z","Content":"I would use Mk 3 LF fuselages.
