The ultimate goal is to have something that can take some payload, whatever can fit in the 6m long S2 cargo bay from B9, to other planets. Speaking of, using B9 and FAR.

Among other things you\u0027d learn that way is that placing the landing gear all the way at the back like that causes it to act like a fulcrum, with the length of the plane acting as a lever to hold the nose down. That\u0027s a problem, because the game\u0027s current aerodynamic system is as placeholder, so KSP wing parts generate zero lift at zero angle of attack. Which I suspect is why you\u0027re finding that this plane acts like it\u0027s glued to the runway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Check out some of the plane-building tutorial threads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cruzan","CreatedById":79256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T06:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Nightwraith,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on first glance, it looks like your front nose gear is mounted higher up than your rear landing gears. This will make your plane be pitched nose down on the runway, making it extremely difficult to liftoff! You can try mounting the front gear lower, if possible to fit the aesthetics, or mount the rear landing gears a little higher. Just be careful of the ground clearance for the tail of your plane if you mount those rear gears higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option, would be to give the wings a slight angle to begin with. You can try mounting the wings by using the Shift \u002B WASD keys to pitch the wings upward slightly (1 to 2 clicks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might also help to place canards toward the front of your plane, again if it will fit into your design aesthetics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
