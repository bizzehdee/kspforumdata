I once played around BTSM, and liked some things very much. Some of its features weren\u0027t to my liking, tho, so I decided making some .cfgs of my own, inspired by said nice mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I liked in principle, but not implementation, were probe reports:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way it is, if I send a probe and later a Kerbal, the Kerbal will still have have an entire experiment\u0027s worth of SCIENCE! when it does its own report; the way I envision, a probe report is the same experiment as a Kerbal\u0027s \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Es\u003C/span\u003Ecrew\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eup\u003C/span\u003E report, but limited to, say, 30% it\u0027s SCIENCE! value (still 100% transmittable!), and if a Kerbal \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Escrews up\u003C/span\u003E makes a report on the same location, there\u0027s only 70% of it left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible?
