When I get close enough to the object it unfreezes, rolls down the hillside and explodes, preventing me from fullfilling the contract.

The newer versions of KSP do a better job of spawning objects so they don\u0027t fall much. Obviously you have a lot of mods, but upgrading your version is one possible answer to your problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possible solution is to change your Terrain Detail level in your settings. Doing that changes the slopes and altitudes of all the hillsides. So your object may not fall so far, and the hill may not be as steep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, yeah, you are probably out of luck on that contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T14:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have KSP 1.7 (signature out of date).
