I don\u0027t find docking hard, so that isn\u0027t an issue for me. The hardest thing with a Jool 5 is making sure you bring enough fuel, otherwise it\u0027s just 5 landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d say Eve was harder, but not by much.

Docking ten times really isn\u0027t harder than docking once - once you\u0027ve got docking down the worse more docking can ever really become is \u0022a bit dull\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first ever Jool-5 (indeed, barring an ill fated mission taken out by a kraken stampede, my first ever visit to the Joolian system) is linked in my sig.

It\u0027s challenging, but it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E challenge when you come down to it. Landing is easy with chutes, the two transfers are relatively easy as Eve\u0027s pretty close to Kerbin in dV terms, and the whole thing can be done without docking/rendezvous at all. Each attempt takes much less time, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool-5 is a whole other thing. You need to design: A Tylo lander, a Laythe lander, another lander for the others, a mothership with a bunch of dV, possibly a tug as well. The transfer is costlier and more challenging to do efficiently. Landing on Tylo is one of the toughest piloting challenges in the game, IMO. Laythe landing is tough due to there being so little dry land. Several transfers are required in the Jool system, some with tricky inclination changes. Several docking/rendezvous maneuvers are necessary, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure some have found Eve return harder, but Jool-5 is definitely harder for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T16:22:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T16:06:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI selected Jool-5 in the poll, because it\u0027s a complex engineering problem, in that it needs to account for multiple landing locations, lots of transfers, and budget the fuel accordingly.
