You can delete strategies you already have and pick different ones, but IIRC you can only do this a few times in the course of a single game (I forget the exact number but it\u0027s not big).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere does not seem to be a way to adjust the commitment level of a strategy you already have, which I think is a shortcoming of the system. The only way to increase or decrease commitment once you\u0027ve selected a strategy seems to be to delete it and then reselect it with the new commitment level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matteeeo","CreatedById":89209,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T21:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
