I need to rescue this one Kerbal out of it\u0027s orbit around Kerbin. I have an idea on how to get close to him but I\u0027m not really sure how to switch to him and control him via EVA. I heared it should be possible via the brackets \u0022[\u0022 and \u0022]\u0022 but since I\u0027m playing with a german keyboard, this doesn\u0027t work.
