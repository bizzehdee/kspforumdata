I\u0027m calling it a \u0022brute force\u0022 rendezvous because it\u0027s a series of small burns to get you close, not a single exact burn. That\u0027s not to suggest that I\u0027m claiming to have discovered this though...I\u0027m sure it\u0027s probably nothing new for the more seasoned folks.\n\nIf you\u0027re like me, you might want to practice in sandbox mode with fuel cheats enabled, put aside all the fancy details (like getting it perfect on the first maneuver) until later, and just do a plain, basic rendezvous to acquire some general familiarity with the whole process. Then move on to dealing the more complicated details like precise maneuvers, fuel efficiency/consumption concerns, etc.\n\nTo start with, this rendezvous guide is fantastic and you should already be familiar with the maneuver node intersect indicators he talks about:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1v1ZLXLBMQo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHis initial burn gets him within 4.7k of the station, but with a real heavy load (or due to certain noob factors on my part), after my initial launch maneuver I usually end up ~50\u002Bk away from the station instead. Clearly my launch maneuver was not very exact, but what to do? Revert to the launchpad and try the whole thing again? No!\n\nAssuming you have Target selected in the navball\u0027s velocity indicator (not Surface or Orbit) as you should:\n\n1. Turn to face the yellow 3-prong petrograde marker and wait/warp until you are no longer closing the distance to the target. Then burn until velocity shows as close to zero as you can get it.\n\n2. With relative velocity at (or near) zero, turn to face the magenta target prograde marker and burn toward the target. Choose a reasonable speed based on how far away you are.\n\n3. Repeat step 1.\n\nThat\u0027s it! It will use up a bit more fuel, so you\u0027re going to want to get better at reducing the number of burns, but following these steps over and over will eventually get you close to the station. The trick is: do not burn toward the target unless your relative velocity with it is zero, otherwise you might as well be trying to swim in a whirlpool.\n\nSome extra info:\n\n- As suggested in the video, it\u0027s easiest to sit on the launch pad and warp until the target station is directly overhead (\u002B/- 20 degrees or so). Then launch. Otherwise you\u0027ll want your orbit to be above or below the target so you or it can catch up.\n\n- If you can\u0027t seem to get the intersect indicators to move closer together by dragging the maneuver node\u0027s prograde vector, then try moving the maneuver node itself to a slightly different location in your orbit. That almost always does the trick for me.\n\n- The further away you are from the station, the more affect a non-zero relative velocity will have prior to burning prograde toward the target. In other words, you burn directly toward the target, but by the time you get there you\u0027re way off. So take the time to chase the petrograde marker around and get your relative velocity as close to zero as possible prior to burning toward the target, as it will reduce the total number of burns you\u0027ll have to do.\n\n- This should go without saying, but the target\u0027s orbit inclination should be 0 degrees to make it easiest. Take the time to get your station into a good, workable orbit before trying to rendezvous with it.\n\nAnyway, I hope this is helpful for anyone else who has tried to follow some rendezvous tutorials and ended up in situations that weren\u0027t exactly like the \u0022perfect world\u0022 situations depicted in them.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t let me pick How To\u0022 as a thread prefix, so I had to pick [Answered]."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:26:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.

For people who are not, stuff like that doesn\u0027t really make sense yet. It just serves to overcomplicate the whole thing and makes it that much harder to learn the basics. When I was trying to learn, it frustrated me that all the tutorials I found have obfuscated the simplicity of the whole process by adding extra tricks and shortcuts like that. It\u0027s like trying to learn simple addition/subtraction by sifting through lessons on polynomials.\n\nWhat I found easier to digest in the beginning was this simple, 2-step algorithm. That helped me get familiar with the navball markers, the RCS strafe controls, and to know instinctively at any given time what direction I need to burn. Before I had all that straight in my head it was totally pointless for me to try and optimize my approach with advanced techniques and fancy shortcuts. So I posted it for people like me who haven\u0027t had that \u0022eureka moment\u0022 yet. Take a complex problem and separate it into smaller, more manageable parts. Divide and conquer.\n\nI thought I was clear that this is not the most fuel-efficient way to rendezvous. Just the simplest for beginners, at least in my mind."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T16:23:43Z","Content":"Once you\u0027re familiar with the navball it\u0027s much easier, yes. Here\u0027s the basics of adjusting your course.\n\nClick your velocity so that it shows target speed. This will also change your prograde and retrograde markers to be relative to your target\u0027s speed.\n\nFind the locations of the prograde and target markers. \n\nDraw an imaginary line from the prograde marker going through the target marker.\n\nFigure out roughly 90 degrees from the prograde marker on that imaginary line. It can be less, but this will also increase your approach speed, not really a bad thing. Just don\u0027t be more than 90 off. \n\nApply thrust. If you can see the markers, you\u0027ll see the prograde marker approach the target marker.\n\nOnce lined up, cut thrust and coast.\n\nRepeat.\n\nUsing reaction wheels only helps not waste fuel because you can turn to check the markers and thrust a bit at a time if you can\u0027t see them. But you should at least be able to see the target marker."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:46:08Z","Content":"I am going to have to disagree pushing or pulling your markers does not work well when you are 50km away from the target. I would say zeroing your velocity and checking the map for a proper orbital rendezvous is better. If your behind slow down, ahead speed up. Try to get the encounter around the AN/DN or fix the AN/DN on the way to the intersection."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:49:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I first started doing what you do instead of starting over, but soon discovered what Harry suggested as a much more fuel efficient way of doing it.

By altering the Apoapsis or Periapsis (depends on situation which one is more efficient) and moving the node around to achieve encounter after few orbits around celestial body."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:53:54Z","Content":"Bleh! That far away, I am still progressing based on orbital period.\n\nThough KAC doe make it trivial to adjust course. Just accelerate along prograde until the closest encounter distance stops shrinking. Then correct inclination and wait a quarter orbit to intercept to fine tune further. I can always get and encounter within 10 m of my target this way.\n\nKAC also makes multiple orbit phase changes more accurate to."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T18:25:06Z","Content":"50km is pushing it, but 20 or even 30km depending on how agile your ship is, you can just shoot for it."}]}
