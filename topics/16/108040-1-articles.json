I did all the tutorials and started a career mode game.\n\nMy first \u0022milestone\u0022 was going to a stable orbit, for which I spent 3 evenings.\n\nI couldn\u0027t build/control a rocket which can go high enough AND reach enough lateral velocity.\n\nI tried lots of designs and spent all my science in rocketry, because I thought I need bigger engines.\n\nI got better after each try, but I was still unable to get into orbit.\n\nHowever, yesterday I noticed I can upgrade my launch pad so I can go for bigger rockets (140t instead of 18t). \n\nYeah, that was my problem. With 140t rockets unlocked, my task was easy.\n\nI just added a bunch of engines to my craft (solid boosters). I missed orbit again, added another bunch of boosters and, finally, got to orbit.\n\nHowever, somehow this feels like cheating. After I unlocked the 140t, it was merely a question of how many engines i added.\n\nBefore, with the 18t limit, I had to think of every detail of my rocket. Now, I can just add MORE ENGINES. Feels weird.\n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n- What is the smallest rocket for reaching a stable orbit? Is it possible with 18t?\n\n- Is this the way KSP is played? Just add engines? Funds have been no problem. Now, with the 140t unlocked, i feel like I can reach everything...\n\nSomehow I have the feeling I have to improve my pilot skills, because at some point \u0022more engines\u0022 will stop working...\n\nThat\u0027s it folks :-)\n\nGreetings"},{"CreatedByName":"EricT43","CreatedById":142226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T13:54:24Z","Content":"Welcome!\n\nI am a relatively new player myself, but I can say that getting into orbit is definitely doable without upgrading the launch pad. More than likely your ascension profile is inefficient. If you go straight up, and then vector sideways when you get into space, which is how I tried to do it when I first started, it requires a lot of fuel. There are a lot of tutorials on this website and on YouTube for getting into orbit, I would suggest checking those out. Make sure you find tutorials for version 1.0 or later, as there were changes to the game that makes some of the older tutorials obsolete. I\u0027d highly recommend the new Career Mode tutorial series from Scott Manley on YouTube - he is an expert at the game and I think he covers getting into orbit in the first or second video."},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:00:30Z","Content":"I have also just started the career mode and i got to orbit with not that big craft and the key to that was getting basic SAS module and better control fins so that I could get in better trajectory."},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:07:38Z","Content":"Try these historical missions from the wiki to get a feeling for flying in orbit:\n\nhttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Sputnik_1\n\nSputnik\n\n[Vostok](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Vostok_1)\n\n[Gemini](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Gemini_6A_and_7)\n\nThe designs there should be able to fly in 1.0 with a few changes like fins at the button (for stability) and heat-shields for re-entry.\n\nIt\u0027s very likely that you just need a tweak in your launch profile.

Adding an extra tank to each stage will probably do it, the engine has enough thrust. And just look at the engineer\u0027s report window, how much part count and mass and size tolerance there is left! You can easily get away with using twice the number of the smallest tanks if you don\u0027t have these bigger ones unlocked yet. If you have radial decouplers on hand you can also strap a pair of Hammer boosters to the bottom sides and use those as a first stage, only igniting the Reliant engine when they burn out.

It doesn\u0027t drop very much at all.\n\nThe reason you\u0027re in freefall in orbit is not because gravity disappears. The word \u0022freefall\u0022 actually describes pretty well what\u0027s happening: you are falling. Gravity is constantly pulling you down, hard, and you\u0027re fully affected. However... as Douglas Adams once wrote in \u0022The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy\u0022, the trick to flying is simply missing the ground when you fall. And that\u0027s why you\u0027re going sideways when you\u0027re in orbit. You\u0027re going sideways so damn fast that even though you\u0027re constantly falling, you *keep missing the entire planet*. That\u0027s a pretty neat mental image, isn\u0027t it? ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSo yes: upwards speed gets you into space, but sideways speed makes you stay in space. And you need only a little bit of upwards speed but a lot of sideways speed, because a planet is a pretty big target to try and miss. The gravity turn maneuver is the most effective way to get your sideways speed up as quickly as possible while maintaining juuuust enough upward speed to make it above the atmosphere.\n\nWhy the LV-909 is so good: Thrust isn\u0027t everything to a rocket engine. Fuel efficiency is also very important. Two factors govern how fuel efficient an engine is:\n\n1.) Engine weight. The engine is not fuel, so its weight is dead weight. The less of it it has, the better. The LV-909 happens to weigh very little.\n\n2.) Specific impulse. This figure, appreviated Isp, is roughly comparable to a fuel consumption indicator. The higher this number, the more you get out of the same amount of fuel. The LV-909 happens to have a pretty good Isp in the vacuum of space, so it makes a great upper stage engine. But note: because it\u0027s optimized for space, it runs poorly inside the atmosphere - that\u0027s what the \u0022ASL\u0022 entry for Isp signifies. It stands for \u0022atmospheric/sea level\u0022. So try not to rely on it too much below 15km of height. The higher you go, the better it runs. Above 30km, it should be more or less maxed out. (This applies to any engine; you can see Isp increase as the rocket climbs if you rightclick a running engine during flight.)\n\nAlso, upper stages tend to be small. You can easily get away with a low thrust engine because you\u0027re only moving small masses."},{"CreatedByName":"Ulzgoroth","CreatedById":142295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:46:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - I used SRBs for gaining lots of speed in a short time (maybe too much speed?!).

I wonder how it works, but it works :-)\n\nGoing much above 300 m/s at low altitudes isn\u0027t worthwhile. You don\u0027t want to hit the sound barrier while the air is dense enough to matter, because transsonic drag is a lot worse than subsonic drag.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So, why is it this important to get horizontal speed this early?\n\u003E In my opinion, I have to gain altitude as fast as possible.

Short: I didn\u0027t do a gravity turn.\n\u003E \n\u003E Whats the mistake with my thoughts?\n\nGravity doesn\u0027t decrease significantly between sea level and Low Kerbin Orbit. When you\u0027re in orbit, look at your trajectory on the map, zoomed out far enough that you can see it all the way around the planet. It\u0027s only a tiny bit above the ground, relatively speaking.\n\nThe thing that does drop off with altitude enough to matter is air resistance. But that drops off fast, by 30 km you are not going to experience very much decceleration due to drag.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And, why is the LF-909 this good?\n\u003E It reads poor. Nearly no trust...\n\nThe 909 isn\u0027t good for thrust, but it is relatively light and has high ISP.\n\nBeing relatively light helps make your top stage have a good fuel fraction. (For thinking with rockets, you should basically ignore how much fuel you have in absolute terms: what matters is what fraction of the initial mass of the rocket is fuel.)\n\nHigh ISP means that for a given fuel fraction, it can do more.\n\nThe low thrust doesn\u0027t matter so much when used for an upper stage because first of all the stage doesn\u0027t mass much, and secondly the stage is mainly accelerating horizontally, not fighting against gravity. Using 909s for a first stage would be a bad idea. (It\u0027s an even worse idea than the low thrust alone indicates, because the 909 also has bad ISP and thrust in dense air. It only gets its good performance in near vacuum. Near vacuum includes Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere once you\u0027re a bit past 10 km up, though.)"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T21:48:02Z","Content":"It can be done with the pad and VAB limits.
