You can always transmit the first batch of data for a portion of the science gain (100% for crew and eva reports), and store the next wave in the crew cab. Afterwards, there\u0027s usually not a huge amount of science to gather, but you can, as mentioned above, keep the science equipment attached. You want to keep the experiments in for re-entry anyway, since they\u0027re kind of expensive."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:07:25Z","Content":"Also be aware that you\u0027re not throwing away as much as you think. The amount of science reported when you run an experiment indicates how much you will get assuming that you turned in the results right now, before you turn in a different but otherwise identical experiment. The total science you can get from a given experiment at a particular biome and altitude is capped, usually in the range of 100% to 130% of the science you\u0027d get from a single return.\n\nWhat this means is that if you return two goo experiments from the same location, worth 100 science each, while the first one would get you 100 science, the second would get you considerably less, not even the 30 science that would get you to the cap. Unless it\u0027s changed from the last time I looked, you\u0027d get 100\\*30/130 or slightly more than 23 points. The third one would get you 100\\*7/130, or about 5.4 science.\n\nBecause of this, I don\u0027t worry about hitting the science cap and I don\u0027t intentionally do multiple identical experiments on the same mission."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:03:17Z","Content":"Yeah, I know about the diminishing returns, which is why I wanted to do several at a time to get all the science data. \n\nI\u0027m not really doing it for the extra few points of science it gives me, but for the completion. Having to land on the same Mun\u0027s biome 4 times to completely finish goo or materials experiment is really annoying. \n\nI could do bigger heavier craft with the intention of returning all the science equipment back, but was hoping it were possible to do it otherwise."},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T05:11:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you make two or more experiments in one biome, the game only lets you store one of them in the capsule, and the other ones have to be thrown away..\n\nEach science store can only contain one copy of a each unique science experiment, but unlimited combos that differ.\n\nPossible science stores are: The instrument that generated them, Kerbals, and man-able Pods.\n\nOne solution: Strap a spare science container to your lander.\n\nMy favorite one is Bill, in a command chair in a service bay. Science store that is lightweight, and doubles as an emergency repair toolkit if needed.\n\nOr maybe use Bob, and have him clean out the instruments after use, allowing multiple goo reading from one cannister.\n\nBetter yet, bring both! for a total mass penalty of only 260kg.

But considering after third research the profits are zilch, the mass of the lab and its fragility (plus the fact you need to land it on Kerbin), bringing three MK1 pods on a tricoupler will be much easier.\n\nOf course the lab can produce lots and lots of useful science from any research you put in it, but then you can remove it and move to a more easily landed craft."},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:43:09Z","Content":"\u003E My favorite one is Bill, in a command chair in a service bay.\n\nThis is brilliant!
