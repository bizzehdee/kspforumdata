Not much to add to those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to 1.: Planet packs are a dime a dozen since Kopernicus got off the ground, but if you\u0027re looking for particularly high quality, you have to main options. One, Outer Planets Mod adds a large number of solar system analogues beyond the orbit of Jool (and moves Eeloo to be a moon on one ofthe new bodies). Two, New Horizons takes all the stock bodies plus a bunch of custom new ones, and arranges them in a completely different way. If you like the solar system analogue idea, go with OPM; if you want a completely different progression straight from the first launch, go with New Horizons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to 5.: Number of mods doesn\u0027t make bases lag more. Part count alone does that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to RemoteTech: in addition to the communications network stuff, you also get a \u0022flight computer\u0022 for probe cores, with which you can preprogram maneuvers that are then executed autonomously. That becomes important at large distances to Kerbin, since communications delay is a thing - and steering can become hard if every key press takes 5-10 seconds to travel to your vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Kerbal controlled vessels have neither flight computer nor comms delay. You can also use crewed crafts/stations as local control stations that drastically shorten the delay because you\u0027re not transmitting all the way from Kerbin.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally: there\u0027s an add-on subforum you can use for more detailed questions about mods.

Planets - if you intend to focus on base building, you\u0027re probably going to focus on just one or two worlds. Have a look at either Outer Planets or New Horizons, and pick the one with the planet you like best. The orbit doesn\u0027t matter as much. Thinking of engines in point (4), rescales such as K2 (double size) or 64K (6.4x bigger) let you play with more powerful launchers without taking all the difficulty out. There are Module Manager patches for rescaled OPM and perhaps for New Horizons too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Bases - yes, Kolonization and SCANSat. Optional extras: Nertea\u0027s Stockalike Station Parts fit in well with the Near Future range, of course, and\u00A0 Nils277\u0027s Kerbal Planetary Base Systems makes bases that look like bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Tech tree - I\u0027d recommend Community Tech Tree (CTT) if you\u0027re finding stock too quick and easy, because it has good support for a wide range of mods. Engineering Tech Tree (ETT) and SETI seem, to me, to be more if you\u0027re finding the stock tree\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Eillogical and wrong rather than over-too-soon. I don\u0027t know Interstellar all that well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Engines - KWRocketry or SpaceY for heavy launch vehicles, especially if you use a rescaled solar system.

KJR - you might be ok without it, if you decide not to go for a rescaled solar system. Infernal Robotics is worth a look for base assembly too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. KER - of course.
