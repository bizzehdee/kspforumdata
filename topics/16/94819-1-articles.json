It\u0027s been there pretty much since maneuver nodes were added so it\u0027s a safe bet Squad know about it. Switching ships or going back to the space center then back to the ship fixes it, but I don\u0027t know how you would overcome it in the tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T00:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re lucky you can find a random spot on the orbit that will let you place the node and then you can drag it around to where you need it.

Highly elliptical or hyperbolic orbits sometimes make it hard to place a maneuver node but I think that\u0027s a separate problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
