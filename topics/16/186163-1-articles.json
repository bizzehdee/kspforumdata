I have a lander that just docked at my space station from a trip up from the Mun. The station has a\u00A0Mobile Processing Lab MPL-LG-2 and i\u0027m thinking, OK I\u0027m good to go. I send my scientist out on EVA to collect the goo and reset the experiment.\u00A0I get back inside the lander and find I cant do anything with it. S#%^ now what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo out go\u0027s my guy go\u0027s once more and to the MPL. he can\u0027t get in, its full. So i transfer one of the Kerbals in side to the lander and in he go\u0027s. In side and still can\u0027t do anything with the \u0026amp;^*%)\u0026amp;^% goo. I send the\u00A0scientist from the MPL\u00A0who is now in my lander out to try it and Nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSO WHAT DO I DO???? Throw it away??? Hand carry the by now stinking goo all the way back to Kerbal??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should not be this hard\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvice needed please, tuvm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JustAToy","CreatedById":177981,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-07T23:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to understand what the problem your having is when you say you can\u0027t do anything with the Goo.\u00A0 What are you attempting to do with it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA scientist can Eva and collect the data which I presume you got from the Mun and reset the Goo container.\u00A0 \u00A0At this point the Goo Container can be\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nused again.\u00A0 \u00A0The data from the landing can then be either stored in presumably the command capsule or other container that can hold science data.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the data is reviewed it can either be Tossed, Saved, Sent to the Lab for more processing or sent by radio home to Kerbin.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0IF this is\u00A0the first goo\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou collected from that biome on the mun you should be able to process it.\u00A0 If it not the first goo data then the lab doesn\u0027t want it cause it already has it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand if you have have a connection to the Space Center you can radio it home.\u00A0 \u00A0Other then that you can take it with you when you go back to Kerbin.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way the two guys in the MPL must be Scientists and you must review the stored data in order to send it to the lab.\u00A0 \u00A0Once the Lab has data you\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmust click on the lab and tell it to start processing the data it has.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-07T23:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you \u0022review data\u0022 on a ship with a lab you should get a 4th option in addition to the normal 3.
