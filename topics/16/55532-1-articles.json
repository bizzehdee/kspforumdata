I had assumed that this is where the ourer or high boundary is. However, having been to Eve today with a double experiment planned i found that during aerobraking (in atmosphere obviously) i could not conduct any of my planned high atmosphere experiments as it thought i was in near space (at around 60km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then, what altitudes define which biomes on which body?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERBS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
