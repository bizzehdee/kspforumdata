one is to send a probe-controlled rocket, though that may not be feasible depending on your communications settings.\u00A0 Another is to build a rocket with one seat more than the stranded crew and send a pilot to pick them up.\u00A0 Be sure that the other seats are empty; I\u0027ve seen many people quit in frustration after sending a four-seat rocket to pick up three stranded crew, only to find that all four seats were occupied and they forgot to empty the extra three before launch\u00A0 Perhaps that behaviour has changed;

you can include powerful reaction wheels or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, if you like, but my preference in these situations is to design a rocket that is less prone to tipping in the first place.\u00A0 Most of my Mun landers are very short, and most incorporate three widely-spaced landing legs.\u00A0 Tripods don\u0027t wobble!\u00A0 I normally include three FL-T100 or FL-T200 fuel tanks on radial decouplers, and put the landing legs on the extra tanks; this gives the rocket such a wide footprint that it usually can handle any slope up to the point that it begins to slide along the ground--but it won\u0027t tip.\u00A0 The centre may be a Spark engine on another FL-T200 (or maybe an FL-T-400) tank with the science experiments and pod.\u00A0 If you\u0027re making a rescue, you may want to use a crew capsule rather than a science package; if you can land on the Mun with an intact (if not upright) rocket, then I will assume that you understand how to design a return-capable rocket.\u00A0 Flying a squat lander to orbit can be tricky, but if you have access to the 2.5-metre parts, then you can reduce the amount that the lander ruins the aerodynamic profile of the lifter.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAny way that you choose to address the tipped lander, good luck, and if you have any further problems, please don\u0027t hesitate to ask.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-29T18:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s probably worth trying a rocking motion after you line up.\u00A0 Retract the gear, if you can pivot up - great!\u00A0 If not, if you can pivot even somewhat towards up, do so, extend legs, pivot DOWN and retract legs, and pivot UP again when the rocket stops.\u00A0 If you can clear 30 degrees up and have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E over 2, full throttle and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, then plan your next moves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-29T18:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2019 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Kryxal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jognt","CreatedById":176871,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-29T20:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223606974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184830\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559138442\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195534\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HansAcker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, HansAcker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t this also affect all other crafts in the universe or is the effect constrained to the local physics bubble?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it would affect all other craft in the save file.
