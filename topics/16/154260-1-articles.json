I\u0027ve tried looking around to find out how to make a plane, but mine simply does not work. I\u00A0only have the first plane branch researched, so i only have the basic pieces. This plane makes it of the runway (I take it all the way down because the tail hits the runway if i pull up earlier) and then it climbs to about 200-300 meters before it just starts falling. I\u0027ve tried adding more engines or removing some of the fuel, to no avail.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone please explain to me what I\u0027m doing wrong, or if this is even a good idea?

I understand that this is your first one, so you are throwing the kitchen sink at it -- and then I assume that you intend to have the fun of doing engineering refinements on it once it flies a little.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, first -- your front engines appear to be directly in front of your rear engines. KSP does model this problem in most cases, and cancels the thrust of any engine that has something directly behind it. So your front engines are probably doing nothing at all except using fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the jet engines are really very efficient. You won\u0027t want to fly more than maybe 1000 km roundtrips with your first plane, so you\u0027ve got waaaaay too much fuel. And the fuel is heavy, and probably makes your plane hard to fly. So yeah, you are going to want to remove almost all the fuel in your center fuselage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my basic suggestion is: dump the front engines. Take the rear pair of engines and move them backwards to where your rear stabilizers are now. Attach the rear stabilizers to the outside of your engine nacelles. As said above, you want the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E a lot closer to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, and doing what I\u0027m suggesting will probably accomplish that.
