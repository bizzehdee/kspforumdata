I\u0027ve moved and approached numerous times. The alignment couldn\u0027t be any more perfect. On a perfectly flat surface. Is there an issue with clamping when on a body\u0027s surface that I\u0027m unaware of? I\u0027ve been at this for hours. The two ports just keep passing through each other. Every now and then, the port on the top side of the photo \u0022magnetizes\u0022 and looks like it\u0027s sticking to something, but never the other clamp - it looks like it\u0027s sticking to the structural fuselage.\n\nAnd to answer the obvious questions... yes, they\u0027re facing the right direction, they\u0027re both the same type, etc. The exact same connection exists on the other side of the base, but it was assembled in space and brought down. This side of the base is being added on the surface (which is completely flat - Engineer reports no slope for either craft).\n\n![V8TflzG.png](http://i.imgur.com/V8TflzG.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T13:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lexan**\n  \nchange to \u0022answered\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T19:06:18Z","Content":"They won\u0027t connect if you disconnected before and not moved 5m away.

In space, the magnetic pull helps bring them together at the right angle because both craft can easily move a bit. On the ground, gravity and friction prevents the craft from moving to accommodate, so you have to get it perfect. \n\nHave you tried using the [Docking Port Alignment](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901-1-0-x-Docking-Port-Alignment-Indicator-%28Version-6-2-Updated-05-04-2015%29) mod?

Everything appeared to be \u0022ready\u0022, so I don\u0027t know if that was entirely the issue. \n\nI spent another good while trying to get the ports to connect. Even went as far as to use KAS/KIS to remove the port on one of the vessels and adjust it\u0027s height a few times to perfect the alignment and still couldn\u0027t get the two to clamp to each other. My last resort before piping (would just rather have them clamped for my own OCD vanity purposes) was to use KAS/KIS to replace both ports with two new ones, relocating them a few times to make ideal alignment, and still was not able to get the two jerks to clamp on to each other. In the end, just left the two as close as possible and ran a pipe.\n\nI understand all of the physics behind this in the sense of \u0022in space the crafts can adjust slightly to clamp - on the surface they can\u0027t\u0022, but my point is more that with as close as they were to each other and as good alignment as I was able to achieve, it really should just clamp. Needing more than what I was giving it was just ridiculous. And as a side note - I\u0027ve since attached more pieces to the base via clamps and achieved a connection with far less perfect alignment than the ones I photo\u0027d for this thread. So, at least I know it\u0027s not totally borked in my save or on Minmus or something like that.\n\nThanks again for all of the input, everyone! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T14:18:50Z","Content":"I use the Klaw to transfer ressources, thats the way it goes on surface.
