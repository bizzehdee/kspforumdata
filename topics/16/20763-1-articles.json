That is to say, directly on top of the blue half. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are landing on the moon, before you slow down on descent, you will be moving down at several hundred meters per second. Your retrograde marker should be very near the top of the blue. However, you also, inevitably have some horizontal speed. Lets say your moving west at 2m/s and down 250m/s. Your trajectory is going to be pretty straight down. Right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when you slow, and you kill that 250, you are still moving 2m/s west, and since your not moving as quickly down, your trajectory changes. To the point where if you aren\u0027t moving down at all, all your velocity is west! So your marker is going to be on the 270 line, and your other on the 90 line. That\u0027s why as you slow down, your retrograde goes let or right or whatever, even though your not burning that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO: On your descent, cancel out downward velocity periodically, and correct your trajectory. Depending on your lander size, linear rcs helps with this. Also, the wider your lander, the more fudge factor there is. If you have a skinny lander, you will have to be much more precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-29T16:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso hit caps lock to make your corrections smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandman232","CreatedById":12630,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T06:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027ve done it!

Hell, last night I managed to land on Minmus for the first time ever. *Twice.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secret is, keep the retrograde marker in the middle of the navball. This means that you are thrusting in precisely the right direction to cancel out both your vertical and horizontal velocity. As your velocity decreases, you\u0027ll see this move towards the middle, which means that you\u0027re going straight down. Your goal is for your velocity to be as close to zero as you can manage just as you touch the ground, but a good lander design and the heavy duty lander legs can absorb quite a lot --- you just have to be careful not to bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you apply too much thrust and start going up, the retrograde marker will go nuts and vanish. This just means that it\u0027s flipped to the other side of the navball because you\u0027re moving in the other direction. Don\u0027t follow it, just point the vehicle straight up, reduce thrust, and once you start going down again it\u0027ll come back. Note that this means that aborting landings is easy! If you start to topple over after landing, throttle up, get off the ground, get the nose pointed straight up and just try again. Also, quicksave is your friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a flight stick, use it; it\u0027s much, much easier that way than using the keyboard.
