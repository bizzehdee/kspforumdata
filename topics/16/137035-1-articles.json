The mass of an SRB is basically \u0022free\u0022 mass: the SRB provides thrust and then all of its mass is dropped. This is not true for the fuel for vacuum engines unless you put that extra fuel into a drop-tank (and calculate exactly how much fuel should go into that drop-tank to get your vacuum engine up to a decent ISP). The trouble is that with the terrible thrust of vacuum engines, a vacuum engine is barely capable of lifting itself, let alone lifting its own fuel with a TWR equal to the TWR of the rest of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, to know whether an engine should be lit, or dumped, you need to know its effective TWR compared to the ship\u0027s TWR. That\u0027s easy for an SRB: its TWR on its own is always going to be higher than the ship it\u0027s attached to. It\u0027s trickier for a liquid fuel engine since the mass of the engine, fuel and fuel tankage are part of the ship itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it is not too difficult to guesstimate: if you have an 18t ship with an atmospheric TWR of 1.5, and you have an unlit Terrier on that ship, and assuming it\u0027ll take you 40s to get to 10km (which is 2/3 of the time it would take if TWR remained constant). If you lit the Terrier, it would burn 141.6 units of LFOx in 40s, so let\u0027s round that down to an FL-T100\u002BOscar\u002Braidal decoupler\u002Bfuel line, or 0.8625 tonnes = 8.46kN weight. Sea-level thrust is 14.78kN, giving a \u0022contributed\u0022 TWR of 1.7 for a lit v unlit Terrier for the 40s following launch, using an additional drop-tank.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there you have it: as long as the Terrier was going to be there anyway, and you drop the tanks containing the fuel that it uses, then it (just barely) makes sense to light it on the launchpad under those conditions. Since the ship weighs 18t, it must have a total thrust of 264.9kN off the launchpad. Lighting that Terrier added 14.78kN, but added weight (for 8.46kN), so it contributed a total of 2.3% to thrust, with a net contribution (difference between 1.7 and 1.5 TWR) of 1.8kN or 0.7%...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you don\u0027t have a separate drop-tank, you either have to take the total ISP of the ship into account to see what dV losses you made, or compare fuel\u002Btank masses before and after that first 10km ascent. To get 265kN off the launchpad and up to 10km you need a trio of Hammers (45% thrust-limited) with an ISP of 170. Actually we don\u0027t care about their ISP since we\u0027ll ditch them shortly after 10km (they\u0027ll burn out at about 50s... so shortly after 10km). Three Hammers weigh 10.7t, so rest-of-ship must be 7.3t. That leaves second stage a bit heavy but manageable for a single Terrier. Assuming 1.5t payload and 0.5t engine leaves 5.3t fuel tanks, or FL-T800\u002BT100\u002BOscar, which is neat since we used the last two getting up to 10km with the Terrier lit. Teh rocket equation tells us that we have a difference of about 794 m/s delta-v depending on whether the T100\u002BOscar are full or empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have liked to do the calculation for the amount of dv gained by having the Terrier lit up to there, but it\u0027s getting late and I\u0027d hazard a guess that a contribution of 0.6% (net) to 2.3% (gross) to thust over 40s is not going to amount to much. A rough calculation seems to suggest something like 200m/s if very generous. So if we fire the Terrier without changing the rocket by adding drop-tanks, we lose about 600 m/s from what was originally going to be about 4.5k dv (again, a ballpark figure).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the precise maths to relate TWR to dv to LKO: I think it would be horrendously complicated. Basically, for each increment of time, you need to determine the orbit from your radius (i.e altitude \u002B600km), angle and speed, then add thrust and subtract drag and resample to get your new orbit, angle, speed, then recalculate remaining fuel, mass, ISP and therefore thrust, then add that thrust and subtract drag to get your new orbit and you\u0027re back to resampling again... And you\u0027d have to use a reasonably short resampling period to get a decent result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo while I\u0027m sure that there is a possible function that would take all that into account, I\u0027m pretty sure that the only feasible solution would be to sim it, which boils down to playing KSP...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CSE","CreatedById":145588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T20:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145678-nich/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022145678\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145678-nich/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nich\u003C/a\u003E If you \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E love your spreadsheets, it\u0027s just about feasible to include the gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know your upward velocity and so you can predict your time to apoapsis.
