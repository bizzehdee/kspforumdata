This is my 2nd ship launched to test.\n\nI\u0027m left-clicking on the command pod of the ship closer to the VAB, getting the control menu rather than the ability to set as target.\n\nI have no purple targeting diamond when I hover over this ship either, that I could double click to set as target as well.\n\nFrom what I can tell it has to do something with using [ and ] to switch between targets?"}]}
