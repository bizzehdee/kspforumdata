Other than aesthetics, does it matter if I block an RCS exhaust port with another part? Will I get reduced performance if say, on side were blocked by a landing leg, light, or fuel tank? I realize that some parts don\u0027t have physics like other parts (ladders for instance have no aerodynamic properties) but I also understand that if an LF engine were blocked by a fuel tank (because I didn\u0027t put a de-coupler between them) the engine will fire but produce no dV. I\u0027ve tested, but I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ve just seen poor translation due to an unbalanced vessel or because it\u0027s been blocked by a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Col_Jessep","CreatedById":4071,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T12:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS thrusters work even if other parts block them, no worries. I can hgily recommend this useful mod to balance them (to avoid rotation during translation): \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is also super useful for building planes and VTOLs because it shows your center of mass for dry weight. Basically: Get the red ball inside of the yellow one and your plane will be well balanced during the entire flight - unless you have a very unusual design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
