Anyways I\u0027m not able to build a plane yet, I think it\u0027s needed at least \u0022Aviation\u0022 research and I can\u0027t afford it. Still, most of available contracts are about reporting activity above specific kerbal sites which, I guess, are meant to be done with airplanes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point there are two options. Either I find/wait for some contracts that would allow me to gain enough research point to get \u0022aviation\u0022 (very few and hard) or I try to gain search point differently from contracts (how?) or there\u0027s a way I don\u0027t know to perform those contracts with a simple rocket.

You can do them with rockets, but it\u0027s very hard -- I do not recommend it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe what you need to know is that there is a huge amount of science points laying around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E campus. Many buildings, if you touch them and do a science experiment, will give you science points. You can go out in the ocean and get lots of science points. You can go out even further, and get even more science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr you can launch rockets up really high and do experiments there. That will get you a lot of science points too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, if you want to do survey contracts then I\u0027d say just wander around and gather enough science points to get \u0022Aviation\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut many players don\u0027t like building airplanes, and they go straight into space with rockets.
