In other words, until you get within 2.5km, there is no actual Kerbal to activate, just a marker in the tracking station.

There\u0027s also no reason why anybody would look for keybinds for a feature that in their experience simply doesn\u0027t exist. I\u0027ve looked up keybinds for all sorts of things in KSP, and changed a few, but even I never noticed there was a keybind for switching crafts/Kerbs.
