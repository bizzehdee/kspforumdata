They tell us when a Milestone is reached. The next Milestone for 0.22 would be the QA testing. The internal testing phase behind the door of Squad sort of speak. It obviously depends on how many bugs and problems they encounter, but mostly that phase shouldn\u0027t take more then two or three weeks. After that Milestone they put out another Milestone. Experiment testing (External). Testing with a larger group of selected players/testers all around the world. Again; depending on how many bugs, problems etc they find it usually takes another two or three weeks. Knowing all this; you will have in a way a release date. (Loosely).
