I\u0027m was just wondering if anyone knew how to convert the Kethane coordinates into mechjeb ones. I thought maybe if I just plugged in the numbers from Kethane into the first slots it would work but it just doesn\u0027t look right to me. Maybe I\u0027m just being too paranoid XD anyways thanks for your help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FictionXVI","CreatedById":14271,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T21:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops sorry I think I figured it nevermind (I had it set to South and West so I was confusing myself haha)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conarr","CreatedById":60613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T21:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/convert_lat_long/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/convert_lat_long/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T21:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Conarr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Conarr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI use this:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/convert_lat_long/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/convert_lat_long/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood one!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T22:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a quick-and-dirty way to convert between decimal and degree-minute-second coordinates with a simple home calculator:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom decimal to DMS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
