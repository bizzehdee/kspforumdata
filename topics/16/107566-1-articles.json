You\u0027ll want to get up to about 20 kilometers as quickly as you can, then level out and begin your acceleration run. At about Mach 4 (somewhere between 1,200 and 1,300 m/s) and at least 30k, switch on your rockets and keep the jets going for as long as you can run them. Spaceplanes with the new soup behave similarly to the way they did in FAR prior to 1.0, so they\u0027ll take some getting used to. Expect a new plane design to want to fly backwards the first few times you try it out, and then try to move the Center of Mass towards the nose. Try to balance the plane\u0027s fuel load so the CoM\u0027s position doesn\u0027t shift a whole lot. \n\n1 Turbojet and 100kN of rocket per 10 tonnes, .01 intake per jet, 40 units of both Liquid Fuel **and** Oxidizer per tonne of plane. When you get RAPIERs, its the same except it\u0027s one RAPIER per nine tonnes of plane. Wing-wise, you want enough that your takeoff speed is not much *slower* than 100 m/s; if you can take off earlier, you\u0027ll have too much drag ongoing when you get up to switchover altitude. 125 is optimal, IMHO. I generally base the wing I need off of the mass of the plane and the length of the fuselage; that\u0027s a fairly complex set of formulas though. Plan for roughly a 15% payload fraction, the payload being pretty much anything you stick in the fuselage itself.\n\nSSTO rockets...those can be done pretty much repeatably by the time you\u0027ve got ahold of the LV-T45 engine; they\u0027re possible (though tricky) with the LV-T30. Start a pitchover around 5k such that you\u0027re at 45 degrees at 15k, and then pitch down to 20 degrees when you\u0027re at least 35 seconds to Apoapsis. Hold it there until you\u0027re 45 to Apoapsis, then drop to 10 degrees. With 55 seconds to Apoapsis, you want to be burning along the horizon. You\u0027ll need somewhere between 3500-4000 m/s of delta-V to make orbit this way, depending on how well you fly it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T09:25:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T09:35:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...You\u0027ll want to get up to about 20 kilometers as quickly as you can, then level out and begin your acceleration run.

Best flight plan involves taking advantage of the raw power of turbojets at low-mid altitudes and essentially take a run up around 10-12km and fling yourself into a ballistic trajectory. It takes a few tries to gauge the right altitudes and speeds for any particular design, but ultimately you want to be passing 19km at about 1km/s on a 20-30 degree ascent. Depending on your TWR, you may have to level off a little around 10-12km and build up speed first, or you may just be able to go for it right off the runway.\n\nIt\u0027s not too hard to get your turbos to launch you up to 45km with an aggressive ascent, which is a good place for your LV-45Ts to be taking over ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![CfnOB2u.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CfnOB2u.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T13:05:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Apologies, capi, but turbojets won\u0027t make 20km *or* 1200m/s anymore, they\u0027ll likely fizzle around 18-19km at 1000m/s and you definitely can\u0027t make 30km before they die.

Certainly most rapier craft need to fly level to get the speed going, unless they\u0027re conspicuously overpowered later in the flight.\n\nTurbojets really deliver a lot of oomph at mach 0.95 though and as yet I\u0027ve never had problems getting them up to speed ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Even 1 additional turbojet supporting 4 rapiers on a 50 ton plane (see spoiler above) is enough to make a build go from useless to a powerful beast that nearly tears itself apart in a rush to get out of the atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T14:02:58Z","Content":"My definition of SSTO is merely that it take a single stage to get into orbit.
