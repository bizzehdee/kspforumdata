Properly speaking people should say \u0022Kerbin-relative TWR\u0022.\n\nThere is always gravity, even in space. It does reduce with distance from the celestial body, though, so some calculating mods like KER list both current TWR and surface TWR. Some prefer to use TMW, or Thrust-to-Mass Ratio, for figuring out orbital stuff as it doesn\u0027t change (it leaves out the gravity term in the calculation)."},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T22:29:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wasn\u0027t planning on doing this but i got sucked in - I want to calculate some of the math myself.\n\u003E BUT\n\u003E \n\u003E Starting with TWR - if is is (Force in KN) divided by ( (Mass) Times (Local gravity) \n\u003E \n\u003E The mass on the chart\\* is listed in Tons, is it not???

I want to make sure I have more than .05 m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 for all translations while full for easier docking.
