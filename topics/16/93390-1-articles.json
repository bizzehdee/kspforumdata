This bonus stacks with the 15% bonus you get with a Mobile Lab, so a 1st level scientist on a lab would let you transmit 60% of the experiment\u0027s value instead of the default 40%. IOW, with transmissions of experiments that have transmission caps, the value of the experiment itself doesn\u0027t change, you\u0027re just able to transmit more of the base value. So, if you have a 5th level scientist in a Mobile Lab, you can transmit 100% of the value of all experiments and never have to return anything. There doesn\u0027t appear to be any effect at all on transmissions of crew and EVA reports, which don\u0027t have transmission caps. As with the Mobile Lab, transmitting such reports with a scientist doesn\u0027t appear to increase the value of the report. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor returned experiments, having a scientist aboard increases the actual value of the experiment by 5%/level. IOW, if an experiment was worth 100 points returned, having a 1st level scientist in the ship will give you 105 points. This isn\u0027t a big difference so you\u0027re unlikely to notice this happening. I mean, your mission has to return 20 experiments to get 100 extra points from a 1st-level scientist, and by the time you\u0027re capable of running such missions, 100 extra points is chump change anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe that having multiple scientists on the same ship will stack. I think only the most proficient one will count.

If an experimet is worth 100 points returned and has a transmission cap, then normally you can only get 40 points for transmitting it (even if you have to transmit it more than once, it still adds up to 40 points). If you have a 1st-level scientist aboard, you can transmit 45 points in total over 1 or multipe transmissions. Same general thing as having a Mobile Lab, which (without any scientists) would allow you to transmit up to 55 points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jBar","CreatedById":63035,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T01:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies. That makes much more sense. However, I feel like this only applies in theory. I\u0027ve seen similar questions on different threads and I haven\u0027t seen anyone notice any difference in science return or transmission value. I\u0027m starting to think it is a bug unless someone can give a personal experience with the numbers to show that scientists do indeed give a bonus. I\u0027ve done many tests with scientists and non-scientists and science is always the same for transmitting, recovering, etc. no matter what I do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"furrykef","CreatedById":142422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T21:24:41Z","Content":"\nI just checked and scientists still have no effect on recovering parts or vessels as of 1.0.5.
