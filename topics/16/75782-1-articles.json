Let me go over how I build my shuttles, so hopefully you can get this one going right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst: Build in the SPH, NOT the VAB. you can easily move your craft files over, or rotate the whole craft to face up in the sph. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: Build EMPTY.

ADJUST NOW!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about taking off, since that isn\u0027t your problem. Build with your return in mind. Once you have it looking balanced while empty, then you can go ahead and fill it all up and build your launch vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re having problems pitching up? LOOSE the fuel in the front. All that weight up there will keep your nose down. Use TAC fuel balancer to dump it, or if you did what I said about the two LFO tanks, shift the weight around. Seeing as we haven\u0027t seen your craft horizontal, how about some pics of the CoL and CoM with the craft near empty, or what you would expect it to have during return. This will hep us all better tell you where to move things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, keep in mind to build for your return, and not your ascent.
