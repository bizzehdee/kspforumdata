When I selected one, it would go to the point but instead of staying dead-on it would kind of slowly slide off point. The stability assist worked ok, but nothing else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had this problem before, so I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s a craft design issue. The two probes both had the small inline reaction wheels. One had an OKTO2 pod, and the other had the HECS pod. One had no RCS thrusters; the other had six place-anywhere thrusters, with two pointing \u0022up\u0022 and the other four pointing out, so they were really only for minute translation, rather than roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/Koloblicin/Astronomy/6fa9459f-d0a8-4d4c-9c60-37188680e4da_zpsmyxysy5t.png\u0022 alt=\u00226fa9459f-d0a8-4d4c-9c60-37188680e4da_zpsmyxysy5t.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(First one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/Koloblicin/Astronomy/2af94c2e-edcf-4dc0-83eb-4f3667b39915_zpsheuwxsuc.png\u0022 alt=\u00222af94c2e-edcf-4dc0-83eb-4f3667b39915_zpsheuwxsuc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Second one - the small reaction wheel is surrounded by the first toroidal fuel tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/Koloblicin/Astronomy/50101f4d-930d-4dd9-8f37-7622458bed92_zps9ccstcfb.png\u0022 alt=\u002250101f4d-930d-4dd9-8f37-7622458bed92_zps9ccstcfb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Bottom view of second; has a 48-7S engine, with an Oscar-B tank hiding under the two toroidal tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-27T22:57:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2015 10:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sidereus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T09:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had issues with direction hold when the craft is asymmetrically weighted, but its an inconsistent effect and doesn\u0027t show up all the time :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sidereus","CreatedById":135263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T10:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve had issues with direction hold when the craft is asymmetrically weighted, but its an inconsistent effect and doesn\u0027t show up all the time :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had that as well, but usually when that happens my craft will roll consistently towards the over-weighted side.
