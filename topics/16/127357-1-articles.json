One thing I\u0027m noticing is a kill a lot of Jebs on reentry. Before the aero overhaul I just burned retrograde until PE was down below the surface of Kerbin for return and I\u0027d just ride out re-entry. Now I am having to balance descent angle with how much time I spend at a given altitude for heating vs. deceleration. Unfortunately I have not yet found a comfortable return trajectory envelope.

Are you blowing up lone pods, or do you have difficulties returning stacks of science jr\u0027s? Without knowing details, we can only give you general advice, and things like what agent 902 is saying above may not work for all of your use cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral advice:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Don\u0027t fly straight up and down. People often experience reentry issues on their first suborbital hops because their capsules don\u0027t slow down in time. Even when not going into orbit, you should have at least a modicum of horizontal velocity so you pass through more air that can slow you down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Don\u0027t reenter too carefully. For a lot of people, the first response to burning up is trying an even shallower reentry from an even lower apoapsis, because they equate burning up with being too aggressive. This is not always the case. You can also burn up from being not aggressive enough, particularly when your vertical speed is too low at the beginning. Coming in from a higher apoapsis improves your initial vertical speed, while setting your periapsis around 25km will reduce your vertical speed by the time you get into the lower reaches (your vertical speed would usually zero out and reverse when passing periapsis, if you were not inside the atmosphere).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Mount a heatshield. You said you\u0027ve been away for a while, which means I have to ask: are you aware that heatshields are a thing now? If you try to reenter without a heatshield, you will frequently burn up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Use body lift. If you angle your capsule forwards during reentry, air will deflect downwards and push you up. Similarly, you can angle backwards and gain some extra downforce. That way you can control your vertical speed to some extent (though you need a certain amount of air resistance for this to work).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Make sure your vehicle has enough area versus mass. A long, thin rod of heavy modules will just not slow down in time. The heavier your reentry vehicle is, the more area you want to expose to the airstream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hupf","CreatedById":152424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T09:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- to focus on\u00A0one point already mentioned above: the lower the initial apoapsis, the less problems you will have.

I stated the \u003Cem\u003Eopposite\u003C/em\u003E of that. A lower apopasis does not reduce atmospheric heating. It reduces your vertical speed in the upper atmosphere, increasing the time you spend there and thus the amount of heat you soak up without actually slowing down in any measurable way. Then your vertical speed increases as you fall into the lower reaches, instead of decreasing, so the amount of shock heating spikes up faster than your forward velocity is reduced and you die a fiery death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour horizontal (prograde) speed is almost entirely irrelevant when reentering from below 1000km apopasis altitude. Your vertical speed (your rate of falling towards the planet) in various atmospheric regimes is everything.
