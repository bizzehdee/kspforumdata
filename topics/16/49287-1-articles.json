The LV-T30 already has an ISP of 370 in a vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you are willing to eject the previous engine (treat it as a stage) or the ship is very heavy you probably wouldn\u0027t get any improvement from fitting the LV-909 (390 ISP) since the weight of carrying both engines will reduce the efficency. Generally you would drop the LV-T engine and fuel tanks as a booster and use an LV-909 or the Poodle as an orbital engine. If your SSTO is intended to land without discarding parts it probably doesn\u0027t make sense to add another engine just for orbital changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nurph","CreatedById":59509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T21:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou would most definatly not save fuel. More engines means more mass and both the LV-1R and 24-77 have lower ISP, which means you\u0027ll need even more fuel to accelerate the same amount. You\u0027re much better off sticking with your main engine or RCS if you have it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaying you want better fuel efficency but are accepting dv losses is kind of an oxymoron, especially when your talking orbital mechanics where your velocity (speed and direction) is what defines the shape of your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T21:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going to be doing a lot of orbital manuevers why bring your orbital engine with you every time? Leave it up there. Send a good vacuum engine like an LV-N (with a docking port) up to orbit. Whenever your SSTO makes orbit, dock with the orbital engine package and use that while up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
