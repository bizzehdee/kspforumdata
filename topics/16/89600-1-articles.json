I am actually less interested in that since I already run it on a Mac under Yosemite. I was mostly wondering whether the new iMac could support a decent frame rate at super-high resolution (4k or 5k), and for specific experiences with how it was affected as the part count got higher. But I appreciate everyone\u0027s thoughts on Yosemite etc. as well. Does anyone have KSP gameplay experience running at 4k\u002B resolution on the new iMac?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
