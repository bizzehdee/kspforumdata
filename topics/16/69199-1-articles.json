I\u0027ll try to catch it next time it\u0027s happening but if I could produce it reliably, I\u0027d have probably figured out the problem. I thought this probably would be common as I\u0027m not using many mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you explain some of the buggy-ness? Or is it is what it is? And it\u0027s not that they don\u0027t give what I expect, it just gives different than the preview. I honestly don\u0027t know WHAT to expect, as I\u0027ve been able to create flying machines just by manipulating the vectors (regardless of construction quality). Or are you saying that even the vectors shown in the SPH after placing a part could be off too when put into motion?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
