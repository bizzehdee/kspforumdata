This is because Kerbin doesn\\\u0027t rotate and, assuming you do not change your orbital plane, your orbit will always intersect your liftoff point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut... it is possible to change your orbital plane! This is definitely more of an advanced maneuver and was very hard to do before the orbital map view was added. The trick is to do a burn \u0027sideways\u0027, at a specific point during your orbit. You always aim towards the horizon and towards the middle point between the two yellow markers, pointing to the direction you want to rotate the orbit around the planet. Think it like this; You are flying on orbit towards east and you burn towards north - inevitably your path will curve towards north from the point where you did a burn and... the orbital plane shifts. As you have to do the burns pretty exactly at the spot where you cross your initial orbit and the new target orbit and, after 2-3 orbits, two burns per orbit, you\\\u0027ll get where you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this demonstration, I\\\u0027ve started with the easy-to-explain base case where you lift off and park on orbit around the equator or Kerbin. You pass between light and dark side of the planet every orbit and pass over KSC every time. But what if... we could orbit over the poles following the terminator between dark and light sides? Such an orbit would never pass over KSC. All you need is some knowledge and fuel. LOTS of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging inclination by 90 degrees takes a lot of deltaV. I used my basic Mun Rocket design (stock parts) but for this purpose I merged the two upper stages into one three-tank\u002B2 RCS tank upper stage. This design gets into 100km\u002B circular orbit with about one third of the middle stage left and transitioning to polar orbit over the terminator took the remainder of stage 2 and over 2 tanks out of stage 3. That is a LOT of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is to burn when you are crossing your new orbital plane - in this case, the terminator between dark and light. Initial burn pointed straight north and during the first pass over the correct spot in the orbit I got about 25% of the needed change. I was still burning with the middle stage so the rocket was heavier. Important bit is to stop the burn soon after you pass the intended spot and then wait half an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter first burn the middle stage was spent so half an orbit later another burn - pointing south and bit towards the dark side (90 degrees from the new orbit) got us to 45 degree inclination. Half way there. Another half an orbit and pushing the last bits and... success. Orbital plane changed from equatorial to one that goes over the poles following the line between dark and light side. All that was left was to circularize it.
