Enter the map mode [M] and left click on the marker that corresponds with the survey location name, then get the navigation marker. Fly and follow the navigation marker until you get a message saying you\u0027re at the survey site. That\u0027s the general part, but the survey contracts will require you to do different things such as taking a crew report, a surface sample or an EVA report at certain altitudes (or in the case of a surface sample on the surface of course). If you do that while you\u0027re at the survey site you will successfully complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T14:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope the new contracts randomization won\u0027t ask EVA reports on planets with atmosphere, like some old contracts asked to test TT-18As outside Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberpawn","CreatedById":126699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T14:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for sharing info.. xD haha i think i need more practice.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
