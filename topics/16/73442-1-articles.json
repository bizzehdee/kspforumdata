I have no real problems getting my ships into orbit, but I always feel I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m doing it terribly inefficiently because I always seem to waste so much fuel and oxidizer on the insertion burn. I really think the biggest area for improvement is the height at which the air breathing engines give out: I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to get anything meaningful above 20km. This also means I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m limited to getting around 1000m/s horizontal velocity on air breathing engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was wondering: what can you do to raise that height? I know about the whole stacking a ton of intakes on top of each other, but that feels like cheating to me. Have you guys come up with other methods of making space planes more efficient? Be it a clever way of designing to add more intakes without stacking them, a really good ascent profile, clever use of nuclear engines or anything else: what do you guys do to make your space planes/SSTO\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s as efficient as possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECirocco\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T12:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off: if you engines flame out at 20km, you\u0027ve probably got only one intake per engine. You should at least consider the 1-to-4 adapters on wing-mounted engines, that will last you until 25-26km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes work so well because jets are really efficient: the same fuel will give you about 3x as much thrust when you burn it in a jet rather than a rocket motor. Jets being comparatively overpowered and needing no oxidizer also helps, of course, but it\u0027s the 1200-ish Isp that really makes your day. Jets would still offer a good deal if they were three times as heavy as they currently are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 1: Any speed gained from jets is cheap speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 2: The higher you go, the faster you can get. The atmosphere gets thinner quickly past 20km, and ever more quickly the higher you get. Consider this graph (man, how do I thumbnail these things?):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/ksp_terminal_velocity.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_terminal_velocity.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may use \u0022terminal velocity\u0022 as a proxy for \u0022relative drag at altitude\u0022. If a given amount of thrust will get you to a certain airspeed at 20km, the same amount of thrust will make you go about twice as fast at 25km, and three times as fast at 30km. If you have a large, many-jet vessel, you may notice that you can still gain speed \u0026amp; climbrate even after switching off the first jets. That\u0027s because the reduced drag at high altitudes more than offsets a 10% loss in thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m trying to get at: no matter how high your jets take you, there\u0027s always a tremendous benefit to operating them just a little longer. Unfortunately, the ability to do so depends solely on the number of intakes you manage to attach to your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T13:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 01:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efull rewrite\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thescientist","CreatedById":69046,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T12:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t like intake spamming, you might use your jet as well as possible. As usual, experience helps you, but there are some way to squeeze all the power your engines can give. Here there are some:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Throttle down as you get higher (and faster). Your engines should work for some extra km without flaming out, because reducing the throttle also reduce the required fuel/air to keep them going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Steep ascent are good only for takeoff. Keeping your vertical speed low as well as your AoA should let you go faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Keep the intake straight. If they aren\u0027t, the intake air will fall resulting in flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Use a smart design. Remember that a big plane needs more fuel and engines that a small one. Big spaceplanes might be very inefficient at getting high speed without falling apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

I\u0027d just add that you have to make sure you\u0027re climbing slowly, if at all, once in the area your engines start to run out of air. The important thing is to build horizontal, not vertical, speed. The faster you go the more air you get and the higher you can go, slowly. As a rule I aim to start levelling-out at 15km, building horizontal speed to 1km/s at 20km and 100m/s faster every km above that (1,100m/s at 21km, 1,200m/s at 22km, etc.) The big trick that got me into orbit with planes was learning to throttle-back, as thescientist mentions. Once the engines get near to flameout you can keep them alive and still thrusting that way - even with reduced thrust they will still accelerate your aircraft for a while. Repeat as required until you\u0027re not accelerating any more, then switch to rockets. With 1 intake per engine it\u0027s hard but 2 should not look like spamming and will take you to ~1,800m/s and 28km. As orbital speed is ~2,200m/s that leaves you 400m/s to make-up with rockets. More intakes per engine makes it easier to reach higher speeds, up to about 4 can be done in an aesthetic way; I usually use tri- or quad-couplers. You also have to consider their drag though - if it is ahead of the CoM it can make the plane impossible to control at high altitude/speed either on launch or re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T13:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would add that, when you throttle down your turbo/s at some point(common TWR is half throttle for NERVA or about quarter for T-series) engage your rocket engine and continue to throttle down to make use of all of the air available. Once the jets finally choke or you stop gaining surface speed, cut your turbos and power back up for for sub-orbital hop which should be very close(within 50m/s) to orbital speed at your apogee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a plane in my catalogue called the Crossbow which is only two radial intakes and a tiny rocket but, has enough dV to land safely on Mun for a splash and dash back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaytheAerospace","CreatedById":108355,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T16:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIncrease your intake:engine ratio. 2:1 or 3:1 will give you a better cruise ceiling.

Make a custom window that has your max intake air with all intakes open, current intake air and intake air needed max. When Your max intake air is greater than your current intake air, it means you have too many intakes for the altitude you are currently at. If they are the same, it means you have exactly as many intakes as needed for your current altitude. When they drop below intake air needed max, you no longer have enough intakes. You want to keep these three numbers as close to each other as possible, which will be the highest point your intakes can take you before throttling kicks in.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LaytheAerospace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LaytheAerospace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EClimb as fast as possible to your cruise ceiling, then level out and build speed as long as you can stand.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree. In my experience (which is limited to rather heavy craft, so ymmv) it is wholly sufficient to gradually ease the climb rate, crossing the last 2000m at about 15-20m/s (i.e. in about two minutes). Long speed-building at/near the ideal cruising altitude doesn\u0027t lead to me having any more oxidizer left by the time I am in a circular orbit. Many vessels can climb through the ideal zone even a little faster without wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T17:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with your disagreement; 1 or 2 km altitude makes practically no difference whatsoever, 100 or 200m/s does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T08:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAllright, thanks for the answers guys.
