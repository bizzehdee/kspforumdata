It can be very hard to fit probes into cargobays though, even with small ones, so unless it\u0027s outside your playstyle I\u0027d recommend \u0027running simulations\u0027 by cheating your rescue craft into rendezvous using alt\u002BF12 and doublechecking it fits first- then revert back to the space center to run the mission for real. It\u0027s smart to make an alt\u002BF5 named save before doing this sort of thing so you can always revert even if your game quits. Since your payload won\u0027t be balanced, bring a bit more maneuverability than you would normally think to, and besides that there\u0027s nothing too unexpected about the process so long as there\u0027s no loose kerbals in the bay.
