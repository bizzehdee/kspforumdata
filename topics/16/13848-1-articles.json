I\\\u0027m happy with it\\\u0027s flight, it\\\u0027s maneuverable, stable, easy to land, and can carry it\\\u0027s own weight by quite a margin. But as a space-plane, it\\\u0027s no good. Once it gets into a certain region of thinner atmosphere the plane starts doing backflips like a frantic gymnast. ??? I attached pictures of the plane, I\\\u0027m hoping to retain the same flight characteristics in atmospheric flight as it does in space flight. Is this even possible? Can I have my cake and eat it too?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I haven\\\u0027t made a space-plane before either, let alone make one that is multi-functional.

Canards and other atmospheric control surfaces do nothing in space (nothing to push against!) so you will be much less maneurverable. However, in space you dont really want to turn all that much, you just set up and orbit and that is it, so it is alright. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs per not being able to breach atmosphere, jet and turbojet engines are air breathers, so they cease to function at around 8000 and 15000m respectively. You will need rocket engines to break this barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T14:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s doing backflips in thin atmosphere because the centre of thrust is below the centre of mass, causing the nose to come up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting engines inline with the wings would balance that out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T15:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022colmo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022colmo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s doing backflips in thin atmosphere because the centre of thrust is below the centre of mass, causing the nose to come up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting engines inline with the wings would balance that out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, alternatively, apply more thrust vertically mirrored from under the ship to even it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nomer","CreatedById":30789,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-08T21:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EADD MORE BOOSTERS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
