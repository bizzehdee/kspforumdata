After finding a couple of the easier to get to anomalies, including a fairly interesting one that probably has an Easter egg, or at least a way to make use of it (I have seen someone using it in a youtube video), this one I sort of gave up on. I did look for it under ground, and didn\u0027t see anything interesting. I found another anomaly that way that looked pretty cool, but I didn\u0027t really find any science of note, or any other game advantage... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, I blew up a half dozen rovers working my way through the mountains trying to find that thing. I\u0027m guessing it is on top, but you are leading me to believe that perhaps it is more inaccessible than that. I did get a name for it, by flying in low over the suspected location. That is one of the reasons I gave up on it. when I tried to see it from below, I didn\u0027t see anything. So it you find it you should pm me and tell me how you did it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other anomalies I\u0027ve been able to find by getting sort of close, then using my camera angle to zoom out from the rover over the spot to find it. or to zoom the camera into a hill to get an inside view of the terrain. I look inside of things all the time... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when you get close to an anomaly, such as when you pass low over it when you try to drop in with a rover, your BTDT scanner will usually give it a name. But interestingly the most technically compelling anomaly I found still has no name that showed up on the scanner. At first I thought it was an old abandoned object, until I realized it was still functional. I just don\u0027t know how to use it. I guess I could go try to find a game cheat discussion, but it is more fun to figure out things on your own. I\u0027ve only got a couple anomalies left to visit, but I\u0027m thinking of saving the time to spend on off-world anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, so you drag all your science gear out to a really interesting find, and your bucket of goo tells you that it is bored... Who has more brains, you or your bucket of goo?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
