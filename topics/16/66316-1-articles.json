What I have is my first three satellites in orbit for my relay net v.1.0. When I put up my third satellite, I targeted one and then the other noting the distance to each satellite. I then found the difference and divided in half. I then took that number and added it to the distance to the satellite that had the shortest distance. My thought is, this should give close to the equal distance between each satellite. But, this is real caveman math and there is an equation to figure out the length one side of a equilateral triangle inside a circle. But, I can\u0027t seem to find it when I Google for it. It\u0027s been too long sense I last took geometry.

The inner angle at the \u0022halfway point\u0022 is 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, our right angle. The other angles are 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (at the satellite) and 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at the center of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we know that the line halfway to next satellite is cos(30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) and we know 1 = 1600km. So the distance between 2 satellites should be 2 * cos(30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) * 1600km = 2771 km.

You\u0027ve got three satellites that you want equidistant from one another, each at an average orbital distance of 1003.5 kilometers (splitting the difference between 1001 and 1006). Kahlzun is correct in pointing out the 600 kilometer figure, but incorrect about its usage - if you \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echeck the wiki\u003C/a\u003E, the equatorial radius is 600 km. That figure is the \u003Cstrong\u003Eradius\u003C/strong\u003E, not the \u003Cstrong\u003Ediameter\u003C/strong\u003E, and so you have to add 600 km to the figures, not 300.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay. So you know that the distance from the center of the circle (the orbit) to the edge (where your sats are) is 1600 km. Each one is sixty degrees from the other. What you can do is draw the triangle from one satellite to another, and then draw a line from each satellite to the center of the circle. You can go ahead and then extend the lines headed through the center to the opposite side of the triangle. What does this do? It sets you up with a hell of a lot of 30-60-90 triangles is what it does, and the hypoteneuse of each (the one corresponding to the 90 degree angle) is your 1600 km figure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we look up wikipedia: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30-60-90_triangle#30.E2.80.9360.E2.80.9390_triangle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30-60-90_triangle#30.E2.80.9360.E2.80.9390_triangle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd discover that the length of the sides are in a proportion of 1:2:sqrt3, with 2 corresponding to the hypoteneuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - we half the 1600 figure and then multiply it by the square root of 3; half the distance from one satellite to the another should be 1385.641 km (you can verify that figure with the law of sines, incidentally).
