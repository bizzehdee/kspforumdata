However, beware, they may not all be right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Isp stands for Specific Impulse. This is how it is measured: You have your engine, let\u0027s say the LVT-45: Since its Isp is 370 Seconds in a vacuum, if it were to output 1 Foot-Pound of thrust, and had one pound of fuel to draw from, it would burn for 370 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Since 450 is higher than 300, the two engines with 450 seconds of Isp are by FAR better. They will generate more thrust per pound of fuel than the single engine with 300 seconds of Isp. Even though the single engine may drain fuel more slowly. If you have multiple engines on a stage, I believe you average their Isp\u0027s depending on their relative thrusts. (i.e. one engine with 400 thrust and 400 Isp, and two engines with 100 thrust and Isp each will average to 600 thrust and I believe an Isp of either 266 or 300. (I may be wrong, I just did this now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Thrust is literally the thrust output of the engine in question in Kilonewtons. They add just like a normal number. For example, the two engines with 300 KN of thrust have more total thrust than the single engine with 500 KN of thrust. However, more thrust is not always better, you also have to weigh in Isp to make sure that your rocket is fuel-efficient, but still has enough thrust to lift off the ground. In orbit though, you can give efficiency a greater role in your design because you are not trying to fight gravity all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.
