I had a craft literally ripped apart when I opened parachutes of a deorbiting vehicle clawed to the craft while going at 4x phys warp - the connection between MK1 fuselages gave in while the claw kept holding. So I think it\u0027s more likely the claw will break off at its node than at the claws."},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T07:42:10Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure the claw makes a rigid connection, or at least I\u0027ve never managed to break it.

So by extension, since other parts experience this force and are all fine, the claw should be fine too."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T16:54:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 900 kN at a single point may be an issue though.

That angle still allows 90% thrust efficiency. I can\u0027t find hard data for E class radius though.\n\nThe reason I\u0027m even limiting myself to 900 kN is that I prefer the aesthetics of the 16 nuke array. Pushing that to 24 would require the use of the top and bottom of the Mk3 body and push part count of this design to dangerous levels. Plus, I\u0027m as of yet unsure if just 2 small thermal control systems will be enough to manage the heat for 16 nukes attached to low thermal mass parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T17:01:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:06:54Z","Content":"I can tell ya this, I tested a new rescue ship out last night, and when I saw I had to claw a big Mk-III 4-seat cockpit, I was a little worried about it.
