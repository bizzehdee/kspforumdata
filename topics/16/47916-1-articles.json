That\u0027s their function. They simply burn some of the payload\u0027s rocket fuel to correct the rocket\u0027s course when it veers off in an unwanted direction. I jettison them once I am in orbit. Also note that I am using one of the \u0022control authority\u0022 rocket tips as well. Oh and also, look at the small rocket engines on the sides of the middle section of this rocket. Those are ALSO solely for steering the rocket, and they are ALSO toggled on and off with 6 through 9. Their benefit is that fuel burned in them is not wasted- it still goes towards accelerating the rocket into space, whereas 90 degree rocket engines, while much more effective at steering the rocket (BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE NEAR ONE END OF THE ROCKET), do not contribute to putting the payload into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)Abuse of reaction wheels. On big rockets, I may use upwards of 20 or 30 reaction wheels.

As long as the rocket holds together structurally, you can use 3) to put just about any damn thing into orbit that you want. Unfortunately, 3) can be quite tedious for huge rockets that take 45 minutes to launch (due to the game lagging down under the physics load).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T22:08:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T04:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my full rocket design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2AMGPMu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222AMGPMu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T04:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah - the center of mass is definitely too high (or rather it starts out okay, but moves past the point of no return as your fuel tanks drain).
