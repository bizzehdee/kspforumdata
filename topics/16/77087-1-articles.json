You can calculate the delta-v from the rocket equation. You generally want the mass of all remaining stages to be about twice the empty mass of that stage. For example, if your stage weighs 10 times as much full as empty (it has a fuel mass fraction of 0.9), and you\u0027re using engines with an Isp of 360s, then it should have a delta-v of less than 4900 m/s.

(Though obviously the latter requires more raw fuel). eg: In a stock game, you\u0027ll need a craft with a mass ratio of ~3.2 - 4.5 to reach LKO. Alternatively, one can talk about what percentage of a stage is fuel/oxidizer, though I find that less useful. The achievable range of mass ratios in a given stage tends to depend on your fuel tanks and desired TWR. Typical stock tanks have mass ratios of 9 (FL-T, Rockomax) or 8.2 (Kerbodyne), though practical stages will likely be between 2 and 7 (due to the mass of engines, payloads, and miscellaneous bits). In real life, hydrolox designs run ~8-9, and kerolox ones ~12-14, though exceptions exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DucharmeHD","CreatedById":112967,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T19:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIf your pack includes it, I\u0027d be tempted to go for an NK-33, RD-170, or RD-180.
