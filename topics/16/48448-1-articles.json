But the rotation of the Moon/Mun is so slow that the amount is very marginal. The reason why Apollo went for a retrograde orbit mission profile is so that in case service module engine failed to fire behind the moon to place them in lunar orbit, the moon will slingshot them back to Earth. Even small burns using the lunar module engine will place the craft back onto the re-entry corridor if they are not already on free return trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you try to insert around Mun/Moon in prograde orbit and your service module engine fail to fire, then the spacecraft will get a prograde slingshot and be thrown into a solar orbit. For the Apollo spacecraft that will be fatal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klingon Admiral","CreatedById":69090,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T11:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t the later Apollo missions use a cislunar free-return trajectory by going past the moons orbit and encountering it past Apogee? A cismunar trajectory would result in a prograde orbit after being captured. A circumlunar trajectory (the one shaped like an eight) results in a retrograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T15:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe a cislunar free-return trajectory has ever been used. On later Apollo missions, I think the S-IVB placed the spacecraft on a \u0022free return\u0022 was actually just a highly elliptical Earth orbit that didn\u0027t quite reach the Moon at all, and then returned to perigee within the Earth\u0027s atmosphere. Once the crew knew they had had a good LM and was ready to commit to orbiting the Moon, the CSM\u0027s SPS motor shifted the spacecraft into a trajectory that reached the moon but was no longer a free return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was considered acceptable from a safety standpoint. If the SPS didn\u0027t work, they\u0027d still be on a free return and if the SPS did work to get them off the free return, they had two engines (the SPS and the LM\u0027s descent motor) capable of getting them back onto a free return. Independent failures of both would be extremely unlikely, and a single catastrophic failure that damaged both would almost certainly be unsurvivable by the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for it was to facilitate higher inclinations for the lunar orbit, as a pure free-return must be equatorial. This let the crew visit landing sites further north or south of the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not certain if the later missions captured into a prograde or retrograde orbit, though. I did a quick search for trajectory variations by mission and didn\u0027t see anything promising.
