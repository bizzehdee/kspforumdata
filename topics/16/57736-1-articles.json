Sweetspot is as close as you can get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally once you pass about 15-16km you can floor it with most sane designs. Certainly by mid to upper atmosphere the terminal velocity is increasing far faster than anything you can build, its really only an issue below 20km. If you have a really high TWR though you may shake the rocket to bits if you accelerate too violently. Mainsails in particular are destructive buggers at 100% and high TWR\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T03:43:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESolid rockets have a rather high thrust by default.

Even if you manage to engage SAS fast, it may be too late, it\u0027ll act like a lever from the top of your tall rocking, cracking it in weakest spot. Consider making your rocket a bit shorter and a bit wider using larger diameter fuel tanks and adapters. Also avoid sticking parts of different diameters in places where they act as structural elements. I.e. don\u0027t stick 1,25 m engine to 2,5 m tank, and then 1,25 m decoupler below them. Most likely connection between engine and tank will fail on wobble. Also avoid upper parts being wider that lower. And don\u0027t forget about center of mass for each stage, it\u0027s not that important as for planes, but may still cause lots of pain. Position your SAS close to CoM, this may also help. First stage, when heavy, could use its own SAS, because initial CoM will be low and payload SAS will be inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ahmed","CreatedById":34549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T14:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1st add more space tape\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd add more space tape\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd add more space tape!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works everytime.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
