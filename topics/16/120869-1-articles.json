Aerodynamic forces will rip off any operational antenna other than the Reflectron DP-10, which has a maximum range of 500km. Therefore you need to provide a dense satellite relay network so that there is always an uplink satellite within 500km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be a big undertaking, so I\u0027d appreciate someone checking my math before I start building. Sorry for the lack of diagrams, I\u0027ll try and update with some later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWalker Star Constellation.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the short ranges involved, Kerbin Stationary Orbits are out, as are Molinya orbits. Walker Deltas are a little beyond my understanding (though I\u0027d be very interested if someone could design one!), so I\u0027m going with a Walker Star arrangement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWalker Stars generally consist of a number of polar orbital planes, each of which contains a circle of relay probes. These orbital planes co-rotate, such that all the probes on one side are descending N-S, whilst those on the other side ascend S-N. There is a join between the two where the planes contra-rotate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach orbital plane provides coverage to a \u0027street\u0027, a parallel band which encircles the planet. The probes within each band are carefully phased with those in the next so as to maximise the width of each street, and to minimise the chance of collision over the poles. The orbital planes are evenly spaced except for the gap between the contra-rotating ones, which provides less consistent coverage because the relays cannot be placed in complementary phases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESatellite Antennas\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a choice to be made here: How do the probes talk to each other? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf equipped only with Reflectron DP10s, they need to stay within 500km of each other. This requires a large number of satellites per orbital phase, but as they are closer together they can tolerate a ground receiver more offset from the orbital plane, widening the streets and reducing the number of orbital planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf equipped with Communotron 16s then they only need to stay within line of sight of each other and within 500km of the surface point midway between. However as they are operating more at the extremity of the ground receiver\u0027s range they can tolerate less offset, requiring more orbitals. But they can also operate at higher altitudes, leaving the busy 70-100km zones clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReflectron DP10\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking a guess at sats per orbital n=9 gives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital angle between sats T= 40deg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax in-plane angle between sat-ground SOG = T/2 =20deg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin\u0027s Radius R = 600km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDP 10 max range r = 500km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital altitude (guess) a = 75km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESat separation s = 2(R\u002Ba)sin(T/2) = 462km (in range!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude of Line of Sight L = (R\u002Ba)cos(T/2)-R = 34km (Tight, but I think I can be this precise)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround Station max in-plane range g = SQRT((s^2)/4 - L^2) = 233km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese parameters all look good so far, albeit a little tricky.

In this case the equatorial sats in neighbouring planes will be out of contact with each other, but the signal can be passed north or south until the planes converge again.

However, that can be mitigated somewhat by landing them on mountaintops (or wherever elevation is high). RemoteTech\u0027s LOS calculations assume that each planet is a perfect sphere at elevation zero, and LOS is interrupted only if the path intersects that elevation zero. In other words, mountains, plateaus, etc. don\u0027t interrupt LOS.

So, let\u0027s say you want to go to Site X. First, lob a ground station on suborbital trajectory to land it somewhere reasonably close to X, ideally somewhere at high elevation. It has a long-range omni antenna that connects it to a ring of 3-4 high altitude satellites for communications back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen to fly your probe there, you take off from KSC, get headed in the right direction, set your bearing and throttle, and let it just cruise on autopilot until it gets close enough to the destination to regain control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENecessary?
