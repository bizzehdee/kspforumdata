Well...it\u0027s difficult to say with the UI missing from most of the shots, but it looks like you don\u0027t have much issues with alignment. So I\u0027m going to go with your glide-slope is too steep. Lemme ask: what\u0027s the craft\u0027s take off speed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what you want to do - if you\u0027re not using a landing assistance mod like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/222735-navutilities\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENavUtilities\u003C/a\u003E, you can set a flag or a powered probe core right off the two ends of the runway (right where the terrain color changes to that darker shade of green). Line them up as best you can with the center of the runway. Once those two are in place, set another one exactly one kilometer to the one on the west side. You wind up with a primitive ILS that way. The three markers should help with alignment. For glide slope, you want to be looking occasionally at your distance to the one at the end of the runway you\u0027re approaching from (if you\u0027re landing on 09, you want the marker on the west end of the runway; you want the one on the east side if you\u0027re landing on 27). Take that distance and multiply it by 100, plus 100; the end result is what you want your altimeter to read, give or take. If your reading is higher, you\u0027re too high and need to increase your rate of descent. If your reading is lower, you\u0027re too low and need to decrease your rate of ascent. Your friend here is the rate of descent meter to the right side of your altimeter. Obviously you don\u0027t want to be flying full blast when you\u0027re touching down; throttle back as you make your final approach - real airplanes barely have any throttle at this point in their flight as it is. Once you\u0027re within about two kilometers or so, you don\u0027t want to be descending much faster than five meters per second or so. When you get over the runway, kill your throttle, bring your nose up (to no more than five degrees over the horizon - and watch this, because it\u0027d be really easy to start ascending again if you overdo it) and hopefully you\u0027ll touch down gently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHorizontal speed? 60-80 is a good rule at touchdown, but by no means absolutely necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-17T20:47:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2014 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T20:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, I\u0027m assuming the question is one of \u0022how do I land this thing\u0022.

These should slow you down considerably, but you don\u0027t want them to ever fully deploy.

I know I usually line up for my landings about 10-20km out from the runway. Also you may want to add an airbrake or spoiler of some type on the craft to get it to slow down.

Airbrakes steepen your glide slope, and your glide slope is one of your big issues right now. You want flaps, and put them close to your pitch axis so they don\u0027t force the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the question of slowing down - you can do it. There are \u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E of ways to slow down with FAR. The #1 thing to remember is to cut your throttle completely, and then tap Shift just enough that you have the tiniest sliver active for thrust vectoring. Then, remember, nosing down will (generally) speed you up, while nosing up will (generally) slow you down. At that point it\u0027s a tradeoff between altitude and speed, which can be difficult because you want to be going low \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E slow to land. Come in too low too early, and you\u0027re going too fast. Come in too high too late, and you\u0027ll hit stall speed, dive, and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a very rough rule of thumb, I\u0027ve found you need to be going less than 125 m/s when you break below 1000m on your final approach, but it very much depends on the airframe. What doesn\u0027t depend on the airframe is paying attention to your glide slope: Generally, when you\u0027re going to touch down, if your prograde marker is more than 5 degrees below the horizon, you\u0027re going to die. Check your Vertical Speed Indicator (the circular dial next to your altimeter at the top of the screen) and if it\u0027s about 10m/s you\u0027re going to die. (And if it\u0027s close, you\u0027re going to have a very rough time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve already been given some advice on how to slow down. S turns (or full circles) work, as do flaps and spoilers. Or you can dive and rise, dive and rise, if you\u0027re more comfortable with that. In any case, start your approach far out - about halfway to the mountains, or almost in line with the island runway. It takes a longtime to slow down in FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if, in the final analysis, your plane truly can\u0027t slow down in the sense that its stall speed is higher than 125m/s, then go back to the SPH and change things, because you haven\u0027t built a plane, you\u0027ve built a flying execution device.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T09:59:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody wants to see my new thred with my creations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MegaFlop10","CreatedById":114575,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T10:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you send a .craft file?
