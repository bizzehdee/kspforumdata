SAS and ASAS only serve as stabilization systems (SAS kills rotation, ASAS tries to lock your attitude or heading) and RCS improves handling or makes it impossible (you have to place the ports evenly on both sides of the center of mass, and you also only need it for ships with lots of mass). Thrust vectoring allows you to steer by redirecting your acceleration, rotating the ship about its CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjpateys","CreatedById":58933,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T20:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the prompt replies everyone.
