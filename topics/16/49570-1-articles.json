Presently a Kerbal can carry one EVA report and one sample (at least in the explorations I\u0027ve done), so having them carry items across pods seems reasonable. The only challenge is making a new interface to select which items to retrieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alternative is a dedicated sample tray and/or mission hard drive part but that\u0027s a lot more work.

Good question, not that sure myself, other than it is a different way of doing things. And - I think this is a big plus - you get to see a nice big number at the end, all transmitted science is just added to your total, bringing the ship back at last for a small amount of science is somewhat unsatisfying.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-24T10:48:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2013 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"volapong","CreatedById":114281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T11:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys I finally found the way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
