I have designed the following spaceplane:\n\n![2015_06_06_00001.jpg](http://s13.postimg.org/ra38lwzw7/2015_06_06_00001.jpg)\n\nThe spaceplane is carrying a Mun lander on the top. The spaceplane is supposed to fly out of the atmosphere, disconnect from the Mun lander, and re-enter atmosphere while the Mun lander burns to enter orbit. The problem is, the spaceplane takes its rocket fuel from the tanks on the Mun lander before using its own rocket fuel. This is despite the fact that the Mun Lander is connected only by a radial decoupler and a pair of struts.\n\nHow do I stop my spaceplane from siphoning fuel from the Mun lander?\n\nThanks for the help."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:50:23Z","Content":"Right click the tanks then click the green arrow at the end of the fuel bars.

Air breathing engines behave differently to non air breathing engines.\n\nPersonally I don\u0027t see it as much of a big deal. It\u0027s really quick and easy to just turn off tanks on payload, then turn them back on again before deployment; or do a fuel transfer into the payload before deployment. Sure, it\u0027s one more thing to do, but not difficult to do and not difficult to remember to do it (once you get used to it).\n\nWas the change needed? Don\u0027t know.\n\nWas it a good idea?

Pretty much every single \u0022how to fix it\u0022 suggestion will almost certainly have an equivalent downside for some other use case. This is almost certainly one of those situations where it\u0027s actually impossible to get it perfect for everyone. Getting it to work for 80% of normal people, with normal simple use cases, is probably about as good as it gets. In that regard, the current implementation really isn\u0027t so bad. It works just fine for simple/normal cases, and there\u0027s reasonable tricks/workarounds for complex/unusual cases. The current setup does seem to me like it\u0027s probably an improvement over jet engines draining forward tanks first in classic style planes."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:37:52Z","Content":"Haven\u0027t checked it out myself, but would you be able to do it with fuel lines feeding in?\n\nPersonally I do the \u0022click the \u0027do not use this resource\u0027 button\u0022 method, but I\u0027m curious now. It\u0027s an easy one to forget. As has been mentioned, you can also manually transfer fuel back into it before separating, but if your lifter is suborbital then you may not have a lot of time to do that. Remember, if you want to maintain that fuel balance as well (ie transfer from symmetrical side tanks on your plane back to one on your lander), you can select multiple \u0027feeder\u0027 tanks as well as the target, then just hit \u0022in\u0022 on the lander tank, it\u0027ll draw from the other tanks equally.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI understand the change.. not only for fuel balance but for the odd way fuel did actually flow some times.. trying to work out why a particular engine couldn\u0027t get fuel from a particular tank could get a bit complicated on spaceplanes where the tanks weren\u0027t all strapped together in a nice neat column and having to run fuel lines all over the place to get it moving the way you wanted...\n\nBut yeah, it does make payloads a little awkward.\n\nIt\u0027d be nice to have an option on separators to prevent that jet crossfeed though."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T20:08:43Z","Content":"LF and Ox do default to STACK\\_PRIORITY\\_SEARCH (which respects crossfeed breaks), but as Murph says engines can override flow mode now, and jets do."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T21:11:47Z","Content":"It appears the RAPIER uses STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW even in closed cycle mode:\n\n![screenshot6%20%282%29.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61004449/KSP/1.0/screenshot6%20%282%29.png)\n\nRoot part is the pod, if it was using STACK\\_PRIORITY\\_SEARCH the decoupler\u0027s lack of crossfeed would prevent drawing from the upper tank."}]}
