Everything it has lifted has been symmetrically designed so as to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edistribute weight evenly. Have never had an issue with control before this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to get this \u0022lander/forklift\u0022 to the Mun to move base parts around, and here is where my troubles begin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt tracks just fine on launch (either with mecjeb on and ascent autopilot on, or mecjeb off and Sas turned on. However, as soon as the 1st stage sheds, it begins a turn towards the side the upper tank is on...as if\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe weight of that fuel tank is enough to pull it off line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I swap the upper tank 180 on the lander (did this just to see how it would fly) it tracks just fine, no turning etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve checked all my fuel feeds, and such, and everything is connected and draining evenly. If you look, my center of gravity is pretty well dead center, and you can\u0027t see it, but the center of thrust is centered as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone see something I\u0027m missing? Can the weight of the upper tank be heavy enough to overcome the control of my fins? If this is the case, why does it track just fine if I put the upper tank 180 from its planned location. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t the lifter still start to turn towards that extra weight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any input.
