Hence it advised to use time acceleration during burns. I would like nothing more, but when I try I\u0027m told it\u0027s not allowed during acceleration (yesterday I had to wait for a 30 min burn). Is there around this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T13:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022alt-timewarp\u0022 does physics warp, which should work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt generally isn\u0027t advisable because it can do nasty things to large craft. It should be ok with an ion-powered probe but be sure to make a savegame before you start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso your movement keys will cause huge changes under physics warp, so if you need to change course slightly I\u0027d recommend coming out of physics warp first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrDress","CreatedById":156575,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T13:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou gave me the gift of time.

I\u0027ve usually been able to keep the G forces to reasonable levels just by adjusting the number of parachutes used.\u00A0 You basically just want the least possible amount of chutes you can get away with while still slowing you down to a survivable speed(and you\u0027ll probably want to use the least possible amount of chutes anyway to save on weight.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
