You could use it to have an engineer (like Bill) go on a spacewalk to attach a chute or two to the original capsule. Of course, if you\u0027re in a career game, you\u0027d still have to unlock the necessary techs, but most of the basic tools are pretty low down on the tech tree. Further up you get cool stuff like winches and magnets.\n\nBy \u0022low down\u0022 on the tech tree, I mean below the level of the AGU/Claw. 45 to 90 range."},{"CreatedByName":"beabop","CreatedById":128715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:25:14Z","Content":"If you\u0027re stock, he\u0027ll happily hang out in that tin can for years until you advance down the tech tree to the claw. That lucky tourist gets tons of bonus time in orbit!\n\nOr, you could build a craft with tons of chutes and a low tech cage - four girders sticking out that fit snugly around the tourist craft (kind of like the tugs in this video:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KX7ZJUAopc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n). Dock very carefully until it\u0027s inside said cage. Then close the cage by deploying specially placed landing legs. I have no idea if it\u0027ll survive the reentry Kraken with all the bouncing around, but it sounds fun!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T13:28:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by beabop**"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T13:30:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E four girders sticking out that fit snugly around the tourist craft (...) deploying specially placed landing legs.\n\nThat sounds like the most kerbal solution to me.
