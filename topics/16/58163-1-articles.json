You can trigger the parachute early (in orbit), and it won\u0027t deploy until there\u0027s some atmospheric pressure. So, you can do the de-orbit burn, drop any remaining stages, trigger the parachute, and go do something else while it lands. Don\u0027t use physics warp with that technique, and it only applies if you don\u0027t really care exactly where it lands, and the re-entry vehicle can land on parachutes alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T20:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can squeeze 5 minutes into 1 minute if you use time warp wisely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake deorbit burn, then time warp to atmosphere, then physics time warp through reentry and till your speed is below 300 m/s.
