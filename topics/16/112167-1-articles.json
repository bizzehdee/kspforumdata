I posted about a similar problem \u0026 fix there, repeated below:\n\nFinally, a different class of problems comes when hauling things with their own lift to orbit. Here I am lifting my standard nuclear tug. I like this configuration with 2 wide nukes, because they are stackable (need more TWR, just add more tugs), \\*limited by wobble. However, the wide arrangement doesn\u0027t fit in a fairing, so I had to overcome the lift generated by the radiators fins. Here I used 4 delta wings generated enough lift below the CoM to offset the lift in the upper stage. The launcher is my medium 3 mainsail rcoket SSTO. \n\n![mQuRvIN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mQuRvIN.jpg)\n\nTL;DR = Use lift surfaces at the bottom to move the center of lift far below the center of mass, even when the upper tanks empty the CoL needs to stay below the CoM\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T13:56:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T13:56:35Z","Content":"NASA Shuttle-style can work quite successfully. Beyond that, you just have to make sure that your nose is never too far from prograde below about 25,000m, and that you have sufficient control authority (control surfaces, thrust vectoring, and reaction wheels). Launching with it on the top of the rocket, as shown in the pictures, is probably the more difficult option, and will likely need significant tail fins (i.e. probably actually wing sections used as tail fins, of equal or greater surface area than the wings of the plane). Launching Shuttle style, the issue of wings at the top mostly goes away, and you just need to consider centre of thrust vs. centre of mass (which doesn\u0027t have to be perfect, just not so far apart that it\u0027s creating a huge turning force).\n\nThe other issue you could be facing, is not aerodynamic force from the wings inside the fairing, but aerodynamic force from the fairing itself. Fairings do not get rid of drag, they just smooth the flow and minimise it for the size. A HUGE fairing still has large drag. The issue could be that the fairing is creating so much drag at the top of the rocket, that it\u0027s actually the fairing pulling the nose over. A big fairing has a big surface area; big surface area presented to moving air results in big force."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:04:24Z","Content":"That\u0027s where the buttons in the lower left come into play.. Centre of Mass, of Lift and Thrust (can\u0027t remember the order). With a plane on top of a rocket, you\u0027re generating lift (and drag) up there, with all the weight at the bottom. That\u0027s a sure-fire recipe for disaster. You need to get your centre of lift back behind your centre of gravity(/mass) and keep it there.. don\u0027t forget that without intervention, fuel burns from the furthest source first. That usually means the top, and it means your centre of mass shifts backward as you burn.\n\nConsidering the weight of the engines, it can be rather difficult to keep your mass anywhere but at the bottom, so you need your centre of lift to be back there too. A fairing to cover it is still going to be causing a lot of drag and trying to flip you over.\n\nBasically, you need wings at the back, and they need to be creating more (significantly more) lift than those at the front.\n\nBut...\n\nThere\u0027s an alternative solution here.\n\nYour payload (the plane) need not be mounted on top.\n\nMaybe you could radially attach it lower down.. though you\u0027ll need to compensate for asymmetry then. You could also stage radially off it.. it\u0027s less effective with the new aero, but the old \u0027asparagus staging\u0027 can inspire a winner here, letting you mount stages on belly and dorsal surfaces (symmetric there) as well as wingtips. More drag than a single candle, sure.. but it helps keep things in check.\n\nBasically, think a bit more \u0027space shuttle\u0027. That\u0027s a damn tricky design to recreate in itself, but take it as inspiration.\n\nAlso Foxter... is that thing going to Laythe or something? Awful lot of dV you have there for not a whole lot of payload."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:08:12Z","Content":"\u003E Also Foxter... is that thing going to Laythe or something?
