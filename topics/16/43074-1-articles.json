Landed on and returned from the Mun for the first time today - challenging and great fun. So much to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve run into my first real spot of trouble. Rather than start with a small rover for the Mun as I should have, I went and built a mobile drilling platform. I was building horizontally for the first time, and while it was fun, things didn\u0027t go very smoothly. Parts wouldn\u0027t click together, and the symmetry feature seemed bugged. It became very noticeable once I started the lifting stage when I tried to attach 6 decouplers - they flowered out in a weird pattern rather than radially around the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea what\u0027s up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to the authors for making such a bloody fantastic game for those hours I don\u0027t feel like being terribly productive \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoencino\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i39.tinypic.com/153tok8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022153tok8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i40.tinypic.com/2w2mxat.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222w2mxat.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T21:34:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Moencino\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T06:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that symmetry is based on the orientation of the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo either build the launcher on the end of your rover then move the whole thing to the bottom. or use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/38285-0-20-x-Subassembly-Manager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESubassembly manager\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moencino","CreatedById":79498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T07:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhhhh, brilliant, thanks Rhomphaia!

Your \u0027root\u0027 part, the first part you placed, was most likely the rovers probe core. Since you oriented that horizontally, as you would when building a spaceplane, the symmetry will think of your entire rocket as being placed horizontally, like the centre \u0027stack\u0027 of your rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is going to be very tricky to solve, and im afraid you\u0027re going to have to memorize the build of your rover, take it apart, remove the rover core , then add a core to your stack and rebuild the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that you\u0027re going to have to make the core on your stack the first part. Only, when you take combined parts off of your main body, i believe it will only have a single attachment point, being the one by which your perviously attached it to the main body. If you were to take the main body off of your rover, remove the rover core and put it into the stack, the only attachment point your rover will remember is the nose-oriented one where your probe core used to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i\u0027m afraid you\u0027re going to have to rebuild the rover. Unless you use the subassembly mod, or are brave enough to start using huge spaceplanes already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: remember that in this build, your rover wheels are pointing downwards. You\u0027ll want to make sure you install a way of getting the rover off your central stack when you\u0027ve landed, or a way to land the rover when you\u0027ve seperated from the central stack (a skycrane).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T07:16:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Spyritdragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T14:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Take the bits off your probe core.

My favourite toys as a kid were my Erector set and Lego, plus like many here I\u0027m guessing, I\u0027ve been pretty passionate about all things relating to manned space exploration my whole life. One of my favourite parts about the game is finally understanding some of the technical elements of all those Nasa events I\u0027ve followed over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ esinohio: Thanks! Oh, I don\u0027t think my crew will be doing any thrill riding in the rover (catchy acronym coming for it soon); she\u0027s a top-heavy workhorse that wise Kerbals will drive conservatively. Knowing there are no wise Kerbals, I\u0027ve installed a set of RCS thrusters at the top of the drilling rig which, while untested, I\u0027m hoping will right it on the numerous occasions it\u0027ll be lying on its side with a terrified crew strapped into the elevated command chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ spy and cap: Thanks for the advice guys. I was lucky to find the solution was simply to delete the booster stage I\u0027d started, then flip the rover vertically. Any time I had to add radial components I\u0027d just flip it, add them, then flip it back if I needed to. The whole flipping lesson turned out to be useful on a number of occasions where parts wouldn\u0027t click together in one orientation, but when flipped they would. Again, thanks for the detailed guidance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intentionally didn\u0027t do any research on rover delivery methods in order to enjoy just seeing where my imagination took me. Well, I did see someone\u0027s built a Mars sky-crane, which blows my mind - I\u0027ve a lot to learn from you guys. I didn\u0027t see any parts with cables and winches in my inventory, so I\u0027m guessing those are addons. I\u0027ll investigate those eventually, I\u0027m sure. After about 50 crashes while testing and tweaking the courier stage (inspired by Scaled Composites\u0027 White Knight idea of a piggy back solution), I think I\u0027ll be able to land it and safely detach the rover. My challenge now is the lifting stage, which was gyrating like a drunken hula dancer in my initial efforts. My solution isn\u0027t pretty, but I\u0027ll save the details until you can all facepalm over the horror show I\u0027ve built. The experienced builders use something I think you call asparagus staging? All very efficient and well-planned. I call mine fire drill staging, with each booster trampling over the other in a mad dash to get the hell away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore tomfoolery to share soon...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moencino","CreatedById":79498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T19:40:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurns out this thing is exactly as aerodynamic as it looks.
