I am currently stuck on training how to dock, unfortunately, there is a roadblock that I keep\u00A0encountering. That is, my controls keep locking where I can do basically nothing and be dead in space like the stranded ship I am saving, however, I can change camera and goto map view. Can anyone explain to me if this is a bug or a game mechanic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am becoming quite petulant with the tutorial and without mastering it, then it will probably bother me later in the campaign.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-02T16:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that you are probably running out of electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that -- the last tutorials are meant for more advanced players, not beginners.

I only believed these tutorials were the stepping stone to prepare for the bigger missions out there since all these tutorials were near proximity of the home planet\u0027s orbit. Honestly, your guess is most probably correct, and if that is, then holy crap - the time frame to dock before power runs out. I at least tried to do it around 30 different times where I found more efficient ways to complete it, however, I did not place electricity into the variable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-02T20:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour craft has solar panels -- it can recharge itself if you are in sunlight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-02T23:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs this might come up in some searches, there is also the slight possibility your input controls are becoming locked.\u00A0\u00A0 Hit Alt-f12, find the input locks tab, and hit \u0022clear input locks\u0022.\u00A0\u00A0 If you are playing a stock game, this will very rarely, if ever, happen;\u00A0 it usually requires mods to occur.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as newer player, Bewing is probably right, you\u0027re outa juice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rammit","CreatedById":190165,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-03T08:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nALright, thanks for the information.
