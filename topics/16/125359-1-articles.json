I designed the LAM in the VAB first then saved the file. Next I designed the command module to my liking. I put a decouple at the bottom of the command module then merged the command module with the LAM I designed earlier, but I cant get it to attach. I want it to sit under the decoupler at the bottom of the command module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Lam has an attachment node at the top and the command module has an attachment node under the decoupler. So whats wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even tried going back to the LAM design and putting a decoupler at the top then save it. Go back to the command module and it still wont attach that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfos31","CreatedById":61724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T01:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be honest and say I\u0027ve almost never used the merge function.

The game won\u0027t save it as a subassembly since both nodes are blocked and you can\u0027t attach for the same reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can provide a prebuilt Saturn V replica I can give you so you can see how to make a proper Saturn V, just let me know and I\u0027ll link it to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, speaking from experience, just use the docking port AS a decoupler since otherwise you end up having a persistant decoupler between the CM and the LM, or worse, it\u0027ll stick to the LM or CM and completely make docking impossible. Also, disable the engine fairing as you do it or else it\u0027ll end up being docked with and block your view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I\u0027ve heard LEM, but LAM is a first... LEM stands for Lunar Excursion Module which was the early name for the Lunar Module before it got dropped since (as they put it) \u0022it sounded like [the mission] was going on a feild trip\u0022. LM stands for Lunar Module and that\u0027s the craft which actually landed on the moon. But LAM? What does that stand for?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"halbert5150","CreatedById":77092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T02:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot it to work but it was a bit of a hack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a docking port on the top of my lander can and I thought that might be the problem so I re-saved it without the port.
