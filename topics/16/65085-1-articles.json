You need to set your periapsis down around... iDunno, 10, maybe 11 kilometers?

This means I cant give you a height at which it will go BANG...because I dont let it happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favorite ways of going about this is to take a less exact transfer trajectory. Lets say you didnt have DRE installed, you would shoot for a Duna periapsis as low as possible without hitting the deck before you even enter Duna space, then burn retro at periaps to help the aerocapture. Now this isnt ideal in DRE since you are hitting the atmosphere at transfer velocities as you realised. So my preferred method is to enter Duna SoI with a periaps considerably higher, certainly well outside the atmosphere, lets say...500km. Once you are into the SoI then you begin a retrograde braking burn (try something like 5-10 mins before periaps), this has the combined effect of both reducing your incoming speed as well as lowering the periaps. So make this burn until your 500km becomes 10 or so. You will notice as you perform this burn that as the periaps drops to your aerobraking level the ejection angle also comes sweeping round due to the decreased speed, you should aerocapture nicely once you do hit the clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is even more vital for your return leg as Kerbins atmosphere is pretty unforgiving (try Eve sometime...). Transferring from outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI directly into any kind of aerobraking with DRE and no shields is asking for fireworks. Again I come in with a really high periaps and burn it down as I enter the area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese manouevers take a bit more fuel of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inflatable heatshield is certainly awesome, and can protect pretty large ships, but your design doesnt always lend itself to the addition of shields. The good news is that you really dont need the shield to land on Duna, its atmosphere is just too wussy, its only the initial aerobrake that is an issue. By contrast you will need a shield to land back on Kerbin, as even re-entering from 70x70 involves some serious warming unless you go for a full-on powered landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnsure you are pointing perfectly retrograde as you pass through the 40km mark, engines are in all likelihood the toughest part of your ship when it comes to heat tolerance, and if you are aligned properly then DRE will reflect some of the incoming heat. (5% by default I think for being aligned on the retro or prograde markers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs people above me have pointed out, Duna is the least threatening re-entry, it has a really poor atmosphere until down around 9-10km, and even then its like 35km over Kerbin, you shouldnt have major issues, but its best to learn to handle this now before you start hitting the big boys.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-07T10:49:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2014 10:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T10:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been struggling hard on landing on RSS Duna (Mars), I hit air at about 6km/s and after braking terminal velocity at ground level seems to be ~1km/s.
