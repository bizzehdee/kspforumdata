Bought the game on Saturday on on Steam so is clean install, and I\u0027ve never used any mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I watched several tutorial videos and can follow them through and even successfully have my ships pulled together from the magnetism in the clamps, the problem is that nothing happens after that - its as though the ports haven\u0027t fastened or something. Both ships act individually, so I have to toggle between them to do anything. If I right click on the clamps it gives me the normal options of control from here or set target, not undock, and refueling doesn\u0027t work either. I can reverse a smaller ship out of a larger one if I have enough RCS thrust to overcome the magnets. Also ships will drift apart if I focus elsewhere for a while then come back to then when left like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas what I\u0027m doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T22:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might have your docking clamps the wrong way round.
