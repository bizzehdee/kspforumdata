In order to know whether I would be able to get it safely back to Kerbin, I needed to know how much delta velocity the ship had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I like finding out how to calculate things myself, rather than just trying out or using an existing formula, I started doing some research on how I should calculate everything required to find out delta velocity. This included properties of a variety of rocket parts, and what specific impulse is. Everything went well, until the formula I made for calculating how long I could burn with the amount of fuel gave an invalid, unrealisic answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could not figure out where the issue was, and started doing some tests on the launchpad, while observing different factors I used in the formulae. One of these, was the different mass of the spaceship relative to the amount of fuel inside. For the calculation of fuel mass, I used the information the KSP wiki gave me, including the density of liquid fuel and oxidiser (both of which appeared to be\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u00C2=5 kg*L^-1\u003C/strong\u003E). However, the fuel mass I found did \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E match those of the tests I performed. I googled some more, and other than the wiki, the actual density was nowhere to be found on the web.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my question: Am I just overseeing something, and just being an idiot? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is the density stated on the wiki actually wrong? If so, can someone give me the correct density or a different way to find the wet mass and dry mass of a fuel tank (other than using addons e.g. mechjeb)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your answers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
