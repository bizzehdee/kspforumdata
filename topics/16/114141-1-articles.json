It needed to be manned, but not necessarily by a scientist. I won\u0027t repeat that under oath, though.\n\nWhat I am sure of: increasing the number of scientists on the \\*vessel\\* did boost science throughput. By putting all my three-star scientists in a single vessel I managed to fill a lab in 20 days. I\u0027m nowhere near my savegame so I can\u0027t look up the precise number, but most have been somewhere around six or eight scientists."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T17:43:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E AFAIK It never worked like that.
