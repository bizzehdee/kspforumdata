After a couple of orbits it will be close enough that you can make a maneuver node to intercept its orbit with a close separation distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T14:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u2019re in the same/similar orbit as your target but on the wrong side of the planet? A phasing orbit is your best bet: set up a burn so that your apoapsis is higher and your orbital period longer than the target but with the orbits still crossing at some point, then add a second node after the first and move it forwards a few orbits until you find a close-ish approach. Tiny tweaks to the first node will shift the encounter so that you arrive at your target after a few orbits without using much fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe greater the difference between your orbits, the greater the fuel use; conversely a very similar orbit will take a lot longer for one craft to catch up to the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
