The point at which you plane got jacked up is when the center of mass moved behind the center of lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out my quickie plane for survey \u0026amp; temp missions. Note how far back my lift is at the launch. Also note that I have only one fuel tank, centrally located. The other two are structural fuselages. This way, when the fuel drains, there is less of it far forward, meaning the center of mass wont change as much. Its a clean, classic design. This thing flys like a dream. Also people, remember to offset those landing gear bays up into the wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dGj64HM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dGj64HM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try offsetting those upper wings lower, and tilt them back a bit as well. This will kick your lift angle back, away from the center of mass. You could lose the 3rd engine, 2 is plenty; one is almost enough with a plane that small. My plane will easily get over 1km/sec way up high with just one engine. Fuel lasts forever too, and don\u0027t forget about drop tanks to extend your range. I can put some on that thing, and get big distance. They get used first and off they go. An easy start would be to remove half the fuel from the rear fuel tanks, and see what that does for you. If thats not enough, try replacing them with empty structural fuselages and see where that puts the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also fly it until it freaks out again and note your fuel levels in each tank when it happens. Then you can go back to the hangar and make the fuel levels the same, and observe your center of mass and lift positions at the point at which stability is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T06:35:52Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by klesh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T06:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, look at this sorcery.
