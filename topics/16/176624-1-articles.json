The plan is to fly to a space station orbiting Duna and back, depositing some fuel.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe ship has 43\u0027560 Liquid Fuel loaded.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt has roughly 3500 Total DeltaV.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m leaving Minmus/Kerbin Orbit, when Duna Phase Angle is close to 44.3\u00B0.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen creating the maneauver node the problem starts. It takes me 15 minutes to fiddle around the controls until I get an\u00A0enounter with Duna with a low Periapsis (around 6\u0027000km), usually I can\u0027t get any closer, because even carefully pulling one of the levers, it is sooo sensitive, it will throw it my plotting so far off course, I have to begin again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

Question: I believe this is because I am overshooting when reaching Duna, but I\u0027m not sure how I can plot my course, so I have to slow down only a little. Is there a way, that I don\u0027t need almost as much DeltaV to slow down, as I do when I speed up?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Question (somewhat unrelated): Sometimes I reach Duna and I\u0027m able to slow down to get an orbit, but instead of having a counter-clockwise orbit, I have a clockwise orbit.

For example, the math usually assumes that you\u0027re doing your whole burn in a single instant, or you may be starting your burn at a sub-optimal point in departing orbit. Rather than try to get it ideally perfect, I usually get reasonably close, wait until the mid-point of the transit, and then do a correction burn. Because the effect is magnified over such a long arc, even gentle taps on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E can be enough to move the periapsis dozens of kilometers.

Nobody can\u00A0match it precisely anyway. Burn when you are at the right spot. Get your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E close.

Your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E should be just as high as Duna\u0027s orbit to get there with good fuel efficiency.
