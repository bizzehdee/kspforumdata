Stacking 4 of those large tanks on top of each other, without creating a large space between them, is almost a surefire way to cause a separating stage to crash into another part. I never stack more than 2 of those tanks vertically when they are laterally mounted, and only use 3 at most for a center stage. If you are just going to the Mun or Minmus, your lander is overly large, by a lot, which is requiring you to build a fantastically large ascent stage. Best advice, try to to make your rockets look like rockets. Wider at the bottom, and getting narrower as you get up towards the top. Having all the same size lateral stages is difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T02:01:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had a problem after I upgraded to a better large seperation ring (that won\u0027t crumple like a tin can during liftoff) where my ejected radial components liked to clip things on the way down, causing a few incidents, so I ended up ordering some mega explosive bolts and upped the ejection force on the large radial decoulplers to nearly double the vanilla standard, which gives them enough bang to not hit things on the way down.

That gives your lander a delta-v of 2300m/s. Enough to do a full landing and return to Kerbin. Start with that first. That saves you a ton of weight. The injection stage only requires 900m/s (less if you time it right) for a transfer to the Mun. So if you build an injection stage with a fuel efficient engine with say, 1500 delta-v, you can use some of that fuel for the start of your landing, thus saving more fuel in the landing stage, just in case. I threw this together just to show you what it might look like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the lander with the injection stage attached. The lander has 2300m/s delta-v, enough to do a full landing/return to kerbin, and the injection stage has about 1600m/s of delta-v. Enough to transfer to the Mun and even do most of the landing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Now it just needs an ascent stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gArIf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gArIf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to your original rocket. I would try to space the tanks farther apart so they don\u0027t hit when they drop off. It\u0027s really tough when they are that tall though. I basically try to get up to 9-12km with 1 stage, and eject it there, and then have the rest of my ascent stage last until I am at 30-40km, where I eject that too. Then I coast up to 75km and have an orbit insertion stage to burn me into orbit and just before the periapsis hits 30km I drop that stage as well. Then I use my TMI stage to finish the job. It\u0027s a little bit more complicated but it is efficient and saves me from having to drop stages while in that critical gravity turn where things like to bang together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobraA1","CreatedById":18757,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T21:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHumm, just uploaded Apollen 4, my latest attempt.
