It had this issue shortly after 1.02 was released but I believe it was corrected.\n\n[Mechjeb Thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124336-PART-1-0-2-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-5-1) - Check out the dev versions too\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T16:40:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 04:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T17:22:47Z","Content":"Don\u0027t forget that most engines have been severely nerfed at low altitudes.

You might have a fuel line clipping through a stage separator or fairing that is interrupted even if apparently connected. It happens sometimes when you reload your craft and struts and lines are \u0022reconstructed\u0022. You can fix it in this craft manually editing the persistence file. I would advice you to move the suspicious line a little far away from the clipping part before your next launch or simply rebuild them. It fixed the issue for me.\n\nOr you just had a separation issue and the lines are interrupted due to the accident.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T19:52:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**"}]}
