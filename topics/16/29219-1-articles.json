In a single trip, I deposited and retrieved 2 landers from both the mun and minmus, then returned to kerbin LKO with close to 3400 delta-v to spare. After refueling and re-outfitting the station with a newer, heavier lander, I want to make my next mission to visit Vall, Bop and Pol all in one go. I\u0027m fairly confident I have the delta-v to get there if I play my cards right, although if I need to send a refueling tanker to make the return trip, that\u0027s acceptable too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my question: how should I go about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost, I want to visit all three moons, set down with landers, return those landers to the station, and move on to the next, using the minimum amount of delta-v... I guess it\u0027s kinda a traveling space salesman issue, however there\u0027s a few other mission objectives I\u0027d like to meet: I also want to visit points of interest on Vall and Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would presume that the most efficient path probably involves aerobraking at Jool or Laythe into Vall\u0027s orbit, aiming to hit a polar inclination, then burn to capture and use my heavy lander to fine-tune the approach, land, return to the station, then try and find a transfer window that lets me escape the polar orbit as flat as possible into Vall\u0027s prograde to hit Bop, possibly via Tylo gravity assist, determine a minimum orbital inclination that will allow me to reach the point of interest, capture on it, wait for a window to land at the desired location, land, return, find a transfer window to Pol, eject as flat as possible and perform a Hohmann transfer, aim for a 0 inclination capture, send down the lander, return, and then just hope my pol ejection and kerbin transfer windows overlap....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my questions... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Can I shave off any reasonable amount of delta v by using a munar assist on my kerbin ejection?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) is it more efficient to reach vall via jool aerobraking, laythe aerobraking, or a combination of both? what is the second most efficient method in case the conditions to using the first turn out non-favorable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) how much delta-v will I need to land on vall from a low vall orbit, and return to orbit again? assume a single stage, fully re-usable lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) how difficult will it be to escape a polar orbit on vall via vall prograde into the correct orbital plane to hit Bop? how much extra delta v should I assume this maneuver will require versus a flat transfer from an equatorial orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) what are the actual coordinates of the point of interest on vall, and what orbital inclination do they lie on? (please use spoiler tags for the coordinates. I can\u0027t get ISA mapsat to work on 0.20 or I would find out myself.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Is a tylo gravity assist to reach bop from vall feasible? Is it recommended for correcting my inclination?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) what are the coordinates of the kraken on bop, and what\u0027s the minimum orbital inclination I can hit to reach them? (again, please use spoiler tags)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) should I try and eject from pol directly into my kerbin transfer window, or should I eject early and try to make the transfer from an outer orbit of jool?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) how much delta v do you think this all might take? is it all a pipe dream? am I doing this all wrong and should I approach it differently? please post comments below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record, my station has about 5300 delta v not including the weight of the heavy landers, in its current configuration. I estimate around 4800dv with the landers docked and fully loaded. I can improve it somewhat by leaving behind unneeded hitchhiker containers and/or replacing them with fuel tanks, but I want to make this mission with the minimum amount of modifications, so I\u0027d rather send a fuel tanker to meet me at pol for the return trip, than retrofit the station before leaving. Just looking at transfer burn requirements I calculate I can do it in approximately 4160 delta v round trip, taking into account about a 15% wiggle room on maneuvering fuel, but NOT counting capture burns and major changes in inclination, so I really don\u0027t know how much more those things will set me back. I figure for bop and pol it will be minimal, but for Vall it could be a mission breaker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-26T04:19:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2013 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Colonel_Panic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cesrate","CreatedById":57343,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T04:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo many questions... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry that I have less experience on Jool system, I\u0027ll answer Q1.

Therefore, the slower you are going (the higher the orbit), the less delta-v you requre to do the burn. If I had to do this, I would engineer extra delta-v into my lander so that it can make the plane change maneuver to reach the sourth pole, and keep the interplanetary craft in a very high equatorial orbit. (I\u0027m assuming that the highest orbit that you can reasonably orbit at is 2 000 km, which translates to an orbital velocity of ~300 m/s, therefore your plane change delta-v is 425 m/s).

But the ship had plenty of fuel to spare, and was mildly lightweight under a dozen or so tanks of fuel for the Eve ascent attempt to begin with, so it didn\u0027t take a huge burn to do the descent for Moho after a few transfers and dumping of empty canisters into the transfer engines, and I managed to avoid blowing up during the final burn...
