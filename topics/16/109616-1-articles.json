Is your savegame a new 1.0\u002B game?\n\nThe second option is that you might be able to work around it by putting all your tourists inside a pod, launch, and recover to see if the contract check is fixed this time."},{"CreatedByName":"Anrui","CreatedById":144249,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T05:09:54Z","Content":"The same thing is happening to me.
