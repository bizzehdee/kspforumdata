Ok so I\u0027ve just managed to put my lander on Duna yesterday so now my head is asking questions. Having watched many videos all about KSP, my knowledge base is growing (its still very small though lol). Heres my question.....\n\nMy lander on Duna has no fuel left to get me into orbit, never mind get back home. So, if I was to repeat this mission, and send 2 parts of a rocket into orbit around Kerbin, dock them and get ready to return to Duna, is it possible for me to control the 2 parts of my rocket as 1? Can I stage the 2 of them just from the Space Bar or do I need to control each of them separately from an individual command pod?\n\nI hope this question makes sense ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T06:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 06:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maceemiller**"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T18:04:10Z","Content":"yes, you can stage with 2 rockets docket, just some notes\n\n1: docking ports are wobly.

With the wobbly note as mentioned above...\n\nFor \u0022Can I stage the 2 of them just from the Space Bar,\u0022 yes you can. But something that should be noted is that when you dock two ships together, the staging orders get all jumbled together. So I highly recommend you go through the staging sequence after connecting the two ships, to make sure it\u0027s doing what you want.\n\nAlso, the Action Groups will become linked. So if you have things set up on both ships to respond to Action Group 1, everything will happen when you press 1.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T22:51:57Z","Content":"Old thread for me yes but just reading what Claw said....seems so obvious now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Just had a moment of \u0022uuuurgh......why did I ask so many stupid questions\u0022, yet re-learnt that at the time I could hit a Mun orbit and, well, stay there due to a lack of knowledge (and dV ).\n\nCommunity, forum, YouTube.......thats how we play, learn and unravel the mighty KSP ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"}]}
