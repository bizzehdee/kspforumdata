This happens regardless of mods, which ones are installed,\u00A0 and if i remember right, it also happened in unmodded KSP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-31T17:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand your question KSP is working ok. Only attachment nodes on the root part of the merged vessel are available. Here\u0027s how I merge:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoad vessel #1. Then load vessel #2 with \u0022merge\u0022, don\u0027t try to directly attach it, just left-click to drop it inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Then press 4 (or click the change root mode button), click on the part of #2 where I want to do the connection, and the open nodes on that part will appear. Finally, drag #2 to an attachment node of #1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-31T17:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
