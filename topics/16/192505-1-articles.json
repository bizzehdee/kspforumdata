I\u0027ve really enjoyed the vast variety of parts so far, and have tried to create craft that utilise all of the different engines, rockets, and utility parts as I unlock them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes, this looks like upgrading or improving current designs for ships, to help them do their jobs better. For example, I have a tourist vessel that was enhanced by replacing the Swivel engine with a Reliant engine, and using a stablility enhancer for attitude control on ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I just unlocked a couple of nodes that give me access to bigger radius parts, such as the Skipper and Poodle engine, which will involve completely redesigning some ships. It\u0027s a tantalising prospect, but I\u0027m wondering whether my planned missions warrant these new parts, of I should wait for more ambitious pursuits to interplanetary space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment, I\u0027ve made two succesfull landings and returns from the Mun to Kerbin; the first by delivering a science package to the surface, and then landing a Kerbal to retrieve the data and return. The second (to avoid having to launch two missions) was done \u0027apollo style\u0027, with a seperate lander and command module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also sent a science probe which is currently making a high pass of Minmus, and won\u0027t return for another week of in game time (I tend to do more local missions to pass the time, rather than time-warp entire weeks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to continue exploring the Mun, and make a polar landing. I think this can be achieved with my current 1.25m ship designs with some tweaking to account for a less efficient polar orbit... but would utilising some of these 2.5m new parts save me some valuable cash? I\u0027ve had a quick play around with building a ship that seemed to be more cost for the same delta-v result. But I\u0027ve not tested enough to make that conclusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr - when is a good time to transition from 1.25m parts to 2.5m parts? What sort of missions warrant these larger parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-19T06:33:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/202186-chequers/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022202186\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/202186-chequers/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Chequers\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to have a pretty good grip on the game, and congratulations on your progress so far. As far as when it\u0027s best to start using 2.5 meter parts, I think that the increasing diameter and weight of your payload are the primary factors which demand such larger sizes. And there are usually choices in every diameter which scale efficiently with the size of those diameter stacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou shouldn\u0027t confuse size with efficiency. The most efficient engines in the game are 1.25 meters in size if you consider the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u0022fuel efficiency\u0022 of an engine. What the smaller engines usually lack is maximum thrust, but even this isn\u0027t always true. The \u0022Vector\u0022 is 1.25 meters in diameter but has one of the highest thrust outputs of any single nozzle engine in the game. You pay for this compact powerhouse, literally, as it\u0027s very expensive. As you unlock more of the tech tree I think you\u0027ll find that there is usually an engine to fit your current stack size which will efficiently move your payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is never going to be a hard and fast rule as to which specific engine to use for your payload, but the goal is always to achieve the minimum required thrust to operate your vehicle while maximizing delta-v. Sometimes this means using a larger engine which provides a higher absolute thrust. Or sometimes it\u0027s better to cluster a few smaller, and potentially more efficient, engines for similar total output at higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E efficiency. You won\u0027t always get a performance increase just by attaching a larger engine. In some cases, a larger engine could reduce efficiency due to its extra mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the environment in which the engines will operate is crucially important. A lower stage booster demands high thrust, but efficiency is secondary since it will usually be discarded before you leave the atmosphere. But an interplanetary transfer stage doesn\u0027t necessarily require high thrust because you have plenty of time to complete your maneuvers in orbit - maximizing delta-v is key. A surface lander however will depend on a high enough thrust-to-weight ratio to safely touch down, while also having an engine bell that isn\u0027t so long that the landing legs don\u0027t have clearance to touch the ground. But the game gives you several options to experiment with - there is no one right way to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in short, my advice would be this. A larger engine isn\u0027t necessarily an \u0022upgrade\u0022 if you already have an engine which fits the size of your rocket that is getting the job done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFactors such as the diameter and weight of your payload, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E or fuel efficiency of the engine, the environment the engine will be used in, the weight of the engine itself, if you need engine gimbal for thrust vectoring, and whether or not it\u0027s possible to achieve similar results with multiple smaller engines or one large engine... all add into the decision of what parts to choose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might seem a bit complicated - it is rocket science after all. But luckily this is a game which encourages experimentation and rewards novel approaches with the satisfaction of designing and flying your very own space craft in whatever way you personally like. Fine tuning your craft is certainly part of the fun, but there\u0027s not one right way to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chequers","CreatedById":202186,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-19T06:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your detailed response \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022146104\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/146104-hvp/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@HvP\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m glad that newer parts don\u2019t make older ones obsolete, but essentially enable more complexity and options for completing missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have learned that bigger doesn\u2019t mean better - and very much enjoy the challenge of creating the most elegant solution to a problem - for as optimised a budget as I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom your explanation, I see now the fallacy of trying to compare Skippers to Swivels.

If you\u0027re planning to send a crew of more than one at a time, you\u0027re going to need to start using larger parts and realistically you need to build a ship in orbit in order to make crewed trips to other planets which will require 2.5m and most likely 3.75m stages on your launch rockets. Probes/landers/rovers might get away with not using anything larger than 1.25m though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re a fan of smaller parts and probes, you could try using the RLA Reborn mod which has a multitude of half-sized (0.625m) parts including fuel tanks of varying sizes, engines and reaction wheels; it also gives you some souped-up versions of the stock probe cores OKTO, HECS and QBE with better stats. There are also some nice small parts in ReStock\u002B and there\u0027s also OctoSat which unlocks later on the tech tree but contains a lot of part options to create your own modular satellites, and fits on top of a 1.25m stack. I think KNES has a lot of different sized parts from 0.3125m to 1.25m in various increments, although the sheer number might be a bit overwhelming and since they\u0027re modelled on real rockets the stats might not be particularly good for some/many of them (I don\u0027t use it myself but have tried it out). And if you like doing probe missions, look up ProbesPlus which has replicas of many real missions including Voyager, Cassini-Huygens and Mariner probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding small rockets means you can only carry small payloads but there\u0027s something very satisfying about turning a QBE core into a science lander and parking it on Duna, or putting a relay satellite into orbit of the Mun using only 0.625m parts and for under 9000 funds (and that\u0027s something, considering I did it using JNSQ which makes the planets nearly 3 times bigger and roughly doubles the delta-V needed to get anywhere).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the original question...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding bigger inevitably runs into the problem of diminishing returns- to get more range you need more fuel, which adds weight, which means you need more thrust, so your engine needs more power, but that needs more fuel, which adds more weight, etc. etc. It\u0027s a bit like how long-haul flights use a third of their fuel just to carry the rest of the fuel, but considerably worse because rockets are inherently less efficient than air-breathing jets and need to carry their oxygen with them too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way around this is to use strap-on boosters, whether that\u0027s solid fuel boosters ore just more liquid-fuelled stacks stuck on the side; in the latter case use fuel ducts to funnel fuel from the boosters to the central rocket to drain the boosters first, leaving you with a full tank in the middle once the boosters empty. For SRBs, sticking some extra fuel tanks on the top and setting the decouplers to enable crossfeed also gives you additional range , and I always do that when using SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 1.25m stack with three or four solid boosters on the first stage should be able to get into orbit of Duna or possibly Eve in the stock solar system, if you\u00A0use the NERV engine on your top stage and are willing to try aerobraking to eke out your fuel when slowing down into orbit at the other end, but going further afield will probably require larger parts. 2.5m parts are recommended for interplanetary missions if you\u0027re not planning to come back, and 3.75m parts are required if you\u0027re launching 2.5m stuff into orbit e.g. to build a space station or Mun base. Crewed missions always require larger parts to be used due to their larger size and weight and the necessity to carry enough fuel to return to Kerbin at the end of it (hopefully you aren\u0027t abandoning your poor Kerbonauts\u00A0on other planets!). Launching something like a research lab into orbit will probably require a 3.75m first stage, possibly with extra boosters, followed by a 2.5m second stage and if necessary a third stage for docking the lab to a space station/ship under construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last piece of advice- put parachutes on your lower stages and boosters and use the Stage Recovery mod, it will return most of the dry cost of each launch which is especially effective when you\u0027re launching large rockets. Why would you not want to get money for the parts that would otherwise just fall into the ocean and be destroyed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chequers","CreatedById":202186,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-23T01:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199902\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@jimmymcgoochie\u003C/a\u003E for that detailed advice - really appreciate you taking the time to come up with a few suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis playthrough, as it\u0027s my first, I want to at least complete the tech tree before exploring mods; but I\u0027m making a list of ones that look interesting, and quite a few of those you\u0027ve listed look great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027ll take a while though; without quicksaves/reverts, and having cash-cost to unlock tech-nodes, I\u0027m still very much in the Kerbin system; haven\u0027t landed on Minmus yet, but currently have my first manned mission en-route to orbit it. It\u0027s within a day of arriving, which is exciting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI absolutely agree with the satisfaction of completing a mission for low cost; there\u0027s just something so rewarding about maxisming every Kerbal-buck. I think that\u0027s why I like missions with the smaller parts, and micro-sattelites and probes. Just feels right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy main challenge currently is refining my Mun landing missions. I\u0027ve completed 5 landings and returns so far, but have never gotten it quite right. With 1.25m parts, if taking a full science payload down to the surface with the Kerbal, I don\u0027t quite have enough fuel to get them home, and have had to make a couple of subsequent rescues from Mun orbit. Proabably perfect for Minmus though, from what you\u0027ve said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve gotten it pretty spot on by delivering a science payload to the surface of the Mun before hand, and then sending a very simple direct return lander with a Kerbal to retrieve the science data. But that\u0027s two launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut with 2.5m parts, it feels very inefficient. It costs almost double (~35-40k) with my \u0027Apollo-style\u0027 setup, and each stage feels like overkill - meaning I have too much power and fuel. I think I can refine things down, I\u0027ve just unlocked the Mainsail, which can comfortably lift the entire stack on its own. It\u0027s just very expensive to keep testing each stage to get the Delta-V calcs spot on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-23T09:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find the Skipper is a really useful first stage engine in the earlyish game, wither with an adaptor to connect to 1.25m upper stage, or with a faring as you\u0027ve done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Mun landings, I find drop tanks work really well in the early game.\u00A0 A capsule with a smallish fuel tank (FL-T200) and a Terrier has enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get from the surface of the Mun back to Kerbin, and enough thrust that it can carry 3 extra fuel tanks on radial decouplers to get to the Mun and land.\u00A0 you can also leave the science payload on the Mun to save fuel on the return journey,\u00A0 Sticking the landing gear on the radial tanks means it copes well with slopes too, but is a wide payload to launch so the wider first stage and a faring make sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
