What is less likely to kill me?\n\nI guess there\u0027s always the third option of retro gravity assist \u002B burn without the need of even touching both atmos.

Get an encounter with Jool.\n2. Match the orbital inclination of Jool and set your periapsis to about 21200 km (on the right side of Jool).\n3. Adjust your arrival time by tweaking prograde/retrograde and radial/anti-radial, until you get an encounter with Laythe."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:49:42Z","Content":"Thanks.

I have managed this once, but it is technically doable (but i believe a jool aerobrake is less fuel useage as you only need minor burns to stop aerobraking at the right height and to intercept laythe with the proper PE, ive managed to get away with under 100dV for total course changes after entering laythe\u0027s system. A direct laythe capture would be most efficient, but unless you time it exactly when relative velocity is lowest, you arent going to survive the reentry (or will just be unable to get stable orbit). \n\nAlso, trying to get a aerobrake when laythe is on the other side of jool (going towards you) is suicide as ive already tried this, 6km/s is fun but not exactly safe (and i ended up killing val on that one, had to revert a save)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:46:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While direct shots to laythe are possible, you need to time it exactly so that laythe is moving away from your incoming vector on approach.

With MechJeb or any other mod that allows you to adjust the prograde/radial/normal components of a maneuver node numerically, precise encounters become trivial. If your ship has RCS, you can often even set the aerobraking altitude before entering Jool\u0027s SoI."}]}
