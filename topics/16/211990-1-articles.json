You can use it to grab another craft which then becomes part of the same ship. Getting the thing down through heat damage on re-entry can be tricky, though.

Its an benefit to know the capsule type so you can get the height of the claw to come around center on the capsule, remember reaction wheels as you will be a bit unbalanced and you need to lift the nose for liftoff, some legs or robotic helps. You need enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to reach Mun orbit and preferable back to Kerbin, and reentry will be an challenge.
