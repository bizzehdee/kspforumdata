Here\u0027s the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 3 man command pod landed on Minmus. Did some EVA \u002B surface samples and went back to Kerbin. Then I realized that I forgot to mount parachutes, so I went creative. I pushed the command pod with the crew and the science samples into a circular orbit above Kerbin at 100 Km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a \u0022rescue pod\u0022 with on top (on the nose) a decoupler, two brackets on top of that, parachutes on the brackets and finally a docking port on the very top. I launched it to rendezvous with the Minmus pod in Kerbin orbit and docked with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there I cut the decoupler that is attached to the bracket with the chutes so the \u0022final situation\u0022 is: returned minmus lander with the docked brackets on top of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set in the landing, everything went fine until the chutes fully opened at 500 m. The drag force was to big (I was afraid that it was) hence the bracket is torn of the command pod. At this point I would expect the bracket to become debris, but it went the other way around. The command pod fell to the ground as if it were debris, but the bracket with the chutes and no control module whatsoever stayed in the focus of the camera; it even responded to WASD controls. The command pod crashed, the bracket landed nicely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that I was able to recover the flight (only the bracket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I mess up by doing this bracket transfer or is this a bug?

The focus moved with them after ejection, and the assembly was listed as a ship in the tracking center. I think it\u0027s the presence of a docking ring on the ejected part that causes the issue.
