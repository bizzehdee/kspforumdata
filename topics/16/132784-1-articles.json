If I pitch the vehicle down in an attempt to move forwards, it works for a few seconds before the nose starts being forced back up (and slightly to the right, roll only). The wings and tail fin were added as a response to this problem, but they don\u0027t seem to help too much. With SAS disengaged, the vehicle also seems to be very stable with respect to yaw and roll, but it begins pitching uncontrollably and wildly (going from pointing straight down to straight up and back, repeatedly) if left alone. It seems like a similar oscillation can be induced with roll by moving left or right for more than a few seconds before trying to come to a stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could cause a helicopter to act this way?
