For Kerbin, when I come in from Mun or Minmus, I try to make my periapsis around 30 KM. For coming in from outside Kerbin SOI, though, it takes some practice to get it right, and it depends on how much faster you are going than the 3000 m/s you usually get from Mun-return. If you aim too low, you\u0027ll burn up; if you aim too high, you won\u0027t slow down enough to capture.

I dont drop the return shield because its weight is fairly negligible when looking at parachutes. Its weight is significant however when looking at overall craft design, and I will often remove some of the ablator resource in the VAB prior to the mission to shave mass.
