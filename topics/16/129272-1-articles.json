If the base needs 4000 fuel or something like that, then maybe not. Otherwise, probably yes. A Minmus base that doesn\u0027t have extreme contractual conditions is generally mildly profitable and generally useful for your future career missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T03:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, it\u0027d be profitable, all right.
