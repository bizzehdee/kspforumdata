However, I\u0027ve been encountering the same issue again and again when I\u0027ve launched the space plane: when I get to around 10,000m, the whole craft pitches up suddenly and I cannot keep it stable, even with heavy use of RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor reference, this is what I\u0027m trying to send up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/O6TzL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s basically the White Dart created by Rune with some modifications to turn it into a rover/plane hybrid. I tested it out on Laythe using Hyperedit (as a kind of \u0022simulation\u0022), then reverted the flight back to the SPH so nothing was left on Laythe. When I launch, the SRB\u0027s fire and get me up high, doing most of the lifting, where I then drop them and switch to the liquid fuel engine (a modded part from the SpaceX pack). Then, when I reach around 10,000m, the entire craft pitches upwards and I can\u0027t control it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess for this is that the wings of the space plane are creating too much lift for the rocket\u0027s controls to handle, but I don\u0027t understand why they didn\u0027t do it when I lifted off. Does anyone have any suggestions, both for an explanation as to why it\u0027s only happening high up and how I can counteract it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance, fellow players!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

If I\u0027d docked a tug there, it\u0027d spin the ship around when burning, therefore I can\u0027t use it.
