I don\u0027t know if this is meant to be or just was not implemented? Any help would be much appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T06:59:16Z","Content":"Don\u0027t spin as in the craft won\u0027t move?

The only other alternative way of providing steerable gear to a large aircraft would be to use the old method: Put some small gear under an ugly block sticking out under the craft. \n\nBut anyway, is there something I could fiddle around with a part\u0027s file to make the wheels appear to spin or something?"},{"CreatedByName":"loliwut","CreatedById":146951,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T12:58:32Z","Content":"I have a similar problem but I don\u0027t think the wheels are even spinning as far as the physics engine is concerned.

It sounds like your wheels are misaligned, for them to function well they need to be perfectly vertical. Sometimes it can be caused by flex in the vessel, they look good in the editor but when the craft bends they go out of whack."}]}
