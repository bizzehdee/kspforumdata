Having said that, make sure you have plenty of chutes, in addition to some retro-rockets to slow down your decent."},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T00:12:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Assuming you use KER or MechJeb, why not just establish a standard deorbit burn?

So you mean as in to try a retrograde burn of some specified parameters and see where that gets? maybe we could then adjust the burn point on the orbit to suit our landing target? But then again, when you\u0027re transferring from Kerbin, you rarely end up in the same encounter orbit!

A powered descent will give you the most control, you can treat it as if it had no atmosphere for most purposes... of course it will increase the fuel requirement though. I generally use drag and chutes to slow me down until I have a periapse beneath the surface, and then use engines for more control.\n\nWhen I do rely on chutes, I use multiple chute stages for Duna. The first stage of chutes has \\*way\\* more drag than I need for landing, to help grab the thin upper atmosphere and slow my horizontal velocity. Once I have less horizontal velocity than vertical velocity, I cut the first stage chutes loose and deploy the second stage. The second stage provides less drag (to avoid ripping them off), but plenty to land safely. By timing when I activate each stage, I can usually put it down pretty close to where I\u0027m aiming. RCS or small engines can help adjust beyond that point if necessary."}]}
