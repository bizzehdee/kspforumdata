I\u0027m doing pretty much everything the same way he did but when it comes to the last burn, which completes the orbit, the maneuver node shows that I need around 900 m/s of delta V to make it. In the video Matt Lowne needs just 200 m/s which is considerably lower. The problem is that this shuttle uses two terrier engines which are not very powerful, yet they can still manage a 200m/s burn in a reasonable time. 900 m/s however is too much. I didn\u0027t change any part of his craft and went up to 100km for an orbit the same way he did.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a few modes installed but none of them are supposed to affect this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m completely confused as to why this is happening so please explain what the problem might be. I checked all the updates after the upload date of his video and there was no nerfing of the terrier engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Nevermind, I figured it out. I just had to tilt much more after decoupling SRBs so as to use more of the main fuel tank before decoupling it. Now I\u0027m not sure if I should delete this post or let it stay here in case other people might find it helpful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-04T17:59:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2019 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Yamiko Hikari\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-04T18:56:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201679-yamiko-hikari/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201679\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201679-yamiko-hikari/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Yamiko Hikari\u003C/a\u003E, and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m glad you got it figured out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223713348\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190167\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221575480168\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201679\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yamiko Hikari\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Yamiko Hikari said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m not sure if I should delete this post or let it stay here in case other people might find it helpful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t delete your own posts.\u00A0 But even if you could, it would be best to leave questions up as they can help other people in the future.\u00A0 Thank you for updating with the solution!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
