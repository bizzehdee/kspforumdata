Your orientation is currently directly towards the Mun which, while it\u0027ll probably get you there, will result in a high speed impact. Reorient your ship so it\u0027s pointing... from the image, I\u0027d say your best bet would probably to face West (270) on the horizon and then burn. It may take some adjustment to get a decent orbit from that. Once you have a stable orbit, you can fine-tune it using manoeuvre nodes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T07:52:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo raise your orbit so that it is not a collision with the moon, you could 1) accelerate straight ahead until your speed will carry you around rather than through it, but then you would need to shed that speed again before attempting to land or orbit. Or, 2) you could turn 90 degrees away from Mun in the plane of your current path and burn to raise your apoapsis without changing your speed as much. But the best method is to 3) change your approach to Mun before you get there, because the farther away you burn to make the adjustment, the less fuel you will use. Experiment with maneuver nodes to plan your route while you are still orbiting Kerbin, and see how the line of your projected path through Mun\u0027s sphere of influence changes as you play with the maneuver node. It is quite helpful to get into the game\u0027s settings file and change the line \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will display the line of your path near Mun more clearly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(vexx32 is giving you the same advice as my option #2, just in different terms. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T07:55:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T07:57:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most effective way to avoid collision with Mun in this situation is to burn in radial out direction.
