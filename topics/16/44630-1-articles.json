This is the concept of sub-assemblies, am I correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how does one saves something as a sub-assembly? I\u0027ve looked all over the place, I can find the \u0022Load Sub-assembly button\u0022 but not any option to save as a sub-assembly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a ton of lauchers, rovers and probes, plus some new projects that would be perfect for the part that I wanted to use that way.
