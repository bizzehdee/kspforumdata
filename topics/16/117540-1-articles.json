Yesterday, one of my orbital ships suddenly went all red as though it was over heated. Then, in the VAB, my engines all appeared red. Ok weird. So today, I shut the game down and restarted it and now I cannot even get out of the atmosphere without overheating. I\u0027ve never had this problem until today. Any ideas or reasons why this is happening.\n\nPs, all my ships have thermal control but none have ever had this problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:07:38Z","Content":"Reentry effects are now common (since 1.0.3) at higher altitudes (\u003E40 km) even when launching your rocket. They mostly are there just because of your speed and will most likely not harm your rocket.\n\nFor the VAB thing and the orbital ship overheating (not sure I understood correctly though), this seems like a good ol\u0027 bug; there have been quite a few bug with heat reported, so wait for an update, hoping it\u0027s not too game-breaking."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbochuck","CreatedById":149032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:34:46Z","Content":"I guess I\u0027ll just have to adjust my ascent trajectory. Its just annoying to have parts get pink inside a fairing haha.\n\nAny idea as to why I suddenly got overheating? I\u0027ve occasionally noticed reentry flames on ascent, but never before has it effected parts."}]}
