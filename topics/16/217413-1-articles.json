If it\u2019s attached via a radial decoupler then there\u2019s a good chance that that radial decoupler becomes the root part facing the wrong way; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E tries to point prograde but ends up facing the completely wrong way and it spins out of control.

Bigger fins or a longer rocket might solve it in that case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-30T17:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest putting pivoting fins on it in place of those, and although it\u0027s usually bad for a rocket to have fins at the front, I think they would help if you\u0027re launching that way. Some parts to make the rocket longer might help as well, since the fins would be exerting their force over a longer lever.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
