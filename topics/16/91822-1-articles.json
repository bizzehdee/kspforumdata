So 6 hours. Bring it up to that, then you got yourself a geostationary orbit. I believe that is somewhere about 2800km? Can\u0027t remember at the moment. Remember that if you go higher than that mark, then you would be slower than the rotation of kerbin, and move west, while if you go lower than that, you are moving faster than the rotation of kerbin, and you would go east (assuming that you launched eastward in the beginning). Fiddle with it till you get where you want relative to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, maybe you would prefer to make a set of closer relay satellites just so that the signal can travel all around kerbin first, before sending more stuff further away.

Because you\u0027ll never be 100% precise with this, you may have to perform stationkeeping every so often to keep your constellation in shape and position.

Just four geostationary sats using a single Communotron-32 each. The first one launched was the top one, which I pushed to sit just over the horizon with respect to KSC, in the direction of takeoff. It involved launching a steeper than usual ascent, a hasty circularization burn to push the periapsis out of the atmosphere, and then waiting for it to come around in its orbit so I could regain control. The higher you raise your orbit - especially above KSC, which can be assisted with radial burns - the longer you have control and the more easily you can keep raising the orbit further. It helps that if your orbit is highly elliptical and goes out all the way to geostationary, your satellite will be moving much slower than Kerbin at its apoapsis and therefore KSC \u0022catches up\u0022 with you. Because of this I think I only needed two orbits (three at most, but I think it was two) to get to geostationary altitude and circularize. And after that one was in place, the increased downrange communication distance made launching the other three a breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are of course other constellation shapes you can do; for example, some people prefer a triangle with dish antennas. But I only had OX-STAT panels at the time and wanted to minimize power usage, so I went with a solution that only uses a single antenna per craft. Even if the Communotron-32 isn\u0027t exactly frugal, it\u0027s still only a quarter as much as three dishes. And now that I have this geostationary network, I can just randomly throw future commsats into whatever orbit I wish, because any point in Kerbin orbit below (and a little above) geostationary is in range of a Communotron-32 at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T09:08:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 09:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T19:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0868.75 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor, in meters, 2,868,750m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen your AP and PE are both at this altitude, switch your navball over to Surface and it will read 0.0m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T06:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0868.75 km\u003Cp\u003Eor, in meters, 2,868,750m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen your AP and PE are both at this altitude, switch your navball over to Surface and it will read 0.0m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your orbit inclination is also exactly zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the smallest deviation causes a significant drift north-south, without in any way disqualifying your synchronous orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically...

A pair of Z-100 batteries mounted radially towards the bottom of the Stayputnik sphere provide plenty of reserve power for the dark period of the orbit. I put one inline reaction wheel, a T100 fuel tank and a LV-909 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround the top of the Stayputnik sphere I put three or four OX-STAT PV panels, tilted inward until they just barely touch at the top. That handles gathering power from the front. I also put 3-4 OX-STAT PV panels mounted on the LV-909 and angled to gather power from the rear. Another 2 or three OX-STAT PV panels can be put around the middle section to gather power from the sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower demands with just the Comm-16 and DTS-10 is only 0.14/s. Very lightweight power draw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put my first (4) up at 700km altitude orbits. The goal is to get them spread evenly around the planet. Orbital period for these should be 1h20m. If they are spread properly, one or two will always be within range of KSC and they can relay to the others in the 700km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload cost should be around 5000-6000 per satellite. Launch cost is around 12-14k (and you get 2-5k back with the Stage Recovery mod). Figure 45-70k in funds to get those 3-5 satellites up and running in the 700km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have funds to waste then I might put 2-3 in polar orbits, also on a 1h20m orbital period. That gives a bit of redundancy in case the orbits drift out of alignment over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep #2 - Geosync orbit (at 2868.75 km with a period of exactly 6h). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellites with the Comm-16 in the 700km orbit can reach Geosync orbit through about 30% of their orbit path. That means with 4 Comm-16 sats in 700km orbits that your KEO satellite over KSC will be controllable most of the time even if the DTS-M1 or KR-7 directionals are not yet connected or KSC is below the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first two KEO satellite only have (2) DTS-M1 or KR-7 directional links. One for connecting back to KSC and one for connecting to the \u0022active vessel\u0022. Because they can always see KSC once their orbits are stable, they do not need to link to each other via directionals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to park them in KEO at about 30 degrees ahead of KSC and 30 degrees behind KSC on the equatorial orbit plane. They should be about 2.2Mm away from each other in a straight line so that the Comm-16 links them (as a backup plan).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower requirements for the KEO sats is much higher. You need 1.78/s and the dark period of the orbit lasts for up to 20 minutes. That requires 2200 battery reserve power (which is a lot of Z-100 batteries). You will also need about 12-18 OX-STAT PV panels. Figure 1/4 of the panels facing forward, 1/4 facing towards the rear and the rest around the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to play with this tonight to fine down the numbers on the KEO angles. You want them far enough apart that it is extremely rare that both will be eclipsed by Kerbin for any probe out past 2800km altitude above Kerbin. Probes inside of the 2800km boundary can be handled by the LKO mesh network using Comm-16s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T08:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding funds to pay for satellite constellations, there\u0027s a trick you can do right now with the Fine Print addon... meaning come 0.90, which looks to be hitting before the Christmas holidays, this trick will be stock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you get contracts to put satellites into specific orbits.
