This instability is what gives you ease of control, a very stable craft will fly in a straight line more easily, while an unstable one will try to tip over as you thrust in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you put the centre of thrust too far above the centre of mass it because too stable because the effect of dragging the mass behind you makes it very hard to actually turn because it is too stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best analogy I can think of is imagine trying to push or pull a trailer. If you pull it, to steer you have to pull it to the side (similar to having a gimbal that could be as much as 90 degrees!). But if you push it and you start pushing only a few degrees to the side it starts guiding itself in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned by others it\u0027s best to ditch excess engines as your craft losses weight because then you avoid the situation where you\u0027re carrying twice as much thrust as you need and running them at 50% (this is more of an issue below 12km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need extra thrust the best option in my opinion is stick on some asparagus stages (with engines on). N.B. If you\u0027re talking about huge amounts of thrust you may need to make these stages using Rockomax engines (or a quad coupler with small engines on) to have a decent effect. If you need better stability position these so that the centre of thrust is closer to the centre of mass (but still below it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note: I am not saying don\u0027t build a ship with radially mounted engines near the top and that it won\u0027t work. I\u0027m just saying it is easier to put extra asparagus stages on which are ditched first. If you need extra fuel at low altitude it can be held by the asparagus stages with engines. If you need extra fuel but not extra thrust (as you shouldn\u0027t go much faster than 250m/s below 12km) then use asparagus with just fuel tanks and ditch them to save weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slavechild","CreatedById":91160,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T13:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWTF does that have to do with anything in this thread?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How can I place engines in front of the centre of mass of a rocket\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a rocket with the engines in front of the centre of mass that works..... but reviewing your other posts I can understand why you struggled with the concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a lighter note Kasuha has the right idea, standard asparagus staging is the best way to go but can be tricky with career mode limiting modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slavechild","CreatedById":91160,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T13:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022robsr3v3ng3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022robsr3v3ng3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, if you put the centre of thrust too far above the centre of mass it because too stable because the effect of dragging the mass behind you makes it very hard to actually turn because it is too stable.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find this to be an aid if you\u0027re not wanting to orbit Kerbin at all, all my probes are sent up and out of the Kerbin system using this but usually the payload will have a small asparagus rocket and then the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robsr3v3ng3","CreatedById":18051,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T11:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Slavechild\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Slavechild\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI find this to be an aid if you\u0027re not wanting to orbit Kerbin at all, all my probes are sent up and out of the Kerbin system using this but usually the payload will have a small asparagus rocket and then the probe.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough.
