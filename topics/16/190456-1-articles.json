I was launching a probe that would flyby duna so i could plan a landing. As i built the rocket and launched it i had several problems but was able to fix most of them. But one still bothers me. Its 1st stage is a 2.5 meter orange tank with a mainsail engine. Then it has 6 boosters they have 2 of the extened out to the sides decouplers. They consist of to fl-800 tanks with a nose cone and vector engines When i launch these boosters wobble along the frame and always make me crash. (they bounce up\u00A0and down and make it unstable.)\u00A0This is why i added the second decoupler but it still does not work. Any help apprecated Thanks in advance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-18T17:24:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2019 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Fenceingmadman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-18T18:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201226-fenceingmadman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022201226\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201226-fenceingmadman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Fenceingmadman\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need: \u003Cstrong\u003EMoar Struts!\u003C/strong\u003E (SCNR!)

One piece can only have one parent piece, in the case of a fuel tank, it\u0027s just ONE decoupler, and that one decoupler also has only one parent piece. You can however use struts, as many as you like, thy will make your craft wobbly-proof\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
