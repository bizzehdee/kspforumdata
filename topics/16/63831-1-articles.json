You have to put your mouse arrow on the decoupler, not just some portion of the booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, make sure your boosters aren\u0027t bumping into anything. That will prevent you from being able to place them, but doesn\u0027t usually look like the snap problem you\u0027re describing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
