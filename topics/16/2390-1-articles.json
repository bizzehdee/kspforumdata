So if you are traveling up at an angle of 20 degrees or so at 100 m/s, you might only be gaining 5 meters per second of altitude, so that would be your vertical velocity. This means that when you blast straight up at 1000 m/s and you need to get into orbit, you need to make your vertical velocity 0 (or close to it, on the dial next to the altitude) and your actual speed on the gauge match the orbital speed that matches your altitude on the chart they linked earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen on the Navigation ball, the yellow crosshairs shows what direction your ship is traveling.

The idea behind an orbit is to go to the side, not to go up. Ideally, you could orbit simply by going at a certain speed at ground level. Since air resistance will slow you down, this doesn\\\u0027t work out. It would in vacuum, though. For Kerbal, at ground level you\\\u0027d have to go about 2425m/s to be in an \u0027orbit\u0027. But, as stated, air drag disallows that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere stops at pretty much 68km height, as has been stated. It stops being a huge drag at about 35km height, where it REALLY slows you down if you\\\u0027re not flying with your rocket burning. Above 35km, as long as you have thrust air drag is getting less and less as you approach 68k height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reach an orbit, you have to balance two needs. First, to get out of that blasted atmosphere as quickly as you can, which is logically the case if you go vertical to its plane. I.e. straight up. Second, to build up horizontal speed to get an orbit going. In general, this is usually easiest achieved by these steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Go straight up to about 15-20k height, depending on how much vertical speed your rocket builds up during that time. You want to have as many boosters on your rocket as it can handle without subjecting your astronauts to like a bazillion G and without getting completely uncontrollable. You don\\\u0027t need THAT much control as long as you\\\u0027re boosted, all you have to be able to do is to keep your rocket pointing UP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At about 15-20k height, start banking towards the direction you wish to go. Or, in Kerbal terms, just look where the rocket wants to go and go with the flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Bank slowly. You shouldn\\\u0027t be banked past 30 degrees off vertical before you hit about 20-25k height. Watch your actual direction marker (the circle), it should be a hint below the way your rocket points, but ONLY a hint! Don\\\u0027t adjust your banking to match the circle, if it drops too fast, you\\\u0027re banking too fast or flying too slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. At about 40k height, your direction marker should point about 20 degree above the horizon and you should have about 1000-1500 m/s speed on your clock. You can start to level out by now if these parameters are met, else, keep the direction at about 30 degrees above horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Try to level out no later than 60k. Usually you have about 10-20k vertical distance to go simply by virtue of horizontal speed. Keep the thrust up to get the speed to about 2200m/s, then wait for your rocket to reach its apogee and match the speed to stay in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, you\\\u0027ve reached an orbit. It might not be circular, but as long as perigee is above 70k (hit M to check the apogee/perigee readings) you\\\u0027ll stay in space as long as you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith time, you\\\u0027ll get the hang of it and you\\\u0027ll be able to adjust your thrust and banking to hit the orbital heights you\\\u0027re aiming at fairly reliably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JupiterII","CreatedById":8029,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-17T19:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TwiztedMunky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TwiztedMunky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously need help making orbit, I seem to always fly off into space no matter how hard I try, Can anyone help me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new map I find it so much easier.

Once your boosters have burnt out, detach them, and put the pedal to the metal (100% throttle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maintain as much throttle until you reach about 30\\\u0027000m height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Take the foot off, especially if you are on your orbital stage already!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Start angling. Take off SAS, use Precision Controls (Caps lock by default). Take it sloooow. Trade vertical speed for horizontal speed slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you are on your orbital stage, and you like to overshoot your pitch and yaw and rotation, like me, switch on SAS again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once you reach apoapsis (check M key for the rough height above ground, watch altimeter and wait until it hits zero), and put the pedal to the metal again. You have to gain a lot of speed in little time (it pays to have the engine running at a minimal throttle during ascend to apoapsis if you are going high) to get into \u003Cem\u003Ean\u003C/em\u003E orbit.

If you can\\\u0027t become circular at your first go, don\\\u0027t worry: just wait until you are at Apoapsis again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDe-Orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rotate orbital unit retrograde (against the direction of flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- At Periapsis (the lowest point of your orbit), fire your engines. How much and how long depends on whether or not you want to break Kerbal neck, have Kerbal roast, or feel gracious: The flatter your entry, the fewer g forces and less heat you\\\u0027ll have to deal with (once this is implemented, anyway).

Let the atmosphere do the work of slowing you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile outdated, this video on getting to orbit is still helpful:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RvVjysJKB4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun, and be crispy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-23T09:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make it easier, here\\\u0027s a rocket that should get you into orbit fairly reliably. It\\\u0027s also rock solid stable, so you should not have to touch the controls during the first critical moments of ascend, the SAS and the fins can steer it just fine. Just remember to jettison the boosters as they burn out and let the rocket climb, try to keep the speed at about 200m/s while you\\\u0027re in the denser areas of the atmosphere, then increase gradually to about 350m/s. At about 35,000 meters, start banking towards the direction you want to take your orbit. Take your time, you have plenty thereof. Now you can also start increasing your speed since a good deal thereof will go horizontally and we\\\u0027ll need about 2300m/s in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAround 45-50k altitude, you will probably have reached an upwards momentum that should take you to an apogee of about 80,000m (check the map if you\\\u0027re unsure). Turn off your engine and wait until you\\\u0027re almost at the apogee, then fire your rockets prograde (i.e. in the direction of the green direction marker), pedal to the metal, until you are fast enough for an orbit (said 2300m/s). You\\\u0027ll fall a little, don\\\u0027t worry, that\\\u0027s to be expected, and it also allows a much easier, almost circular orbit. You might be at the second liquid stage by now, which is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELKO is easily possible with this rocket, circular orbits up to about 500k should be doable. I also used it for the elliptical challenge (i.e. elliptical orbits with perigee of 70k and apogee of ... well, whatever the escape velocity ALMOST is) are very possible with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\\\u0027ll notice that it has no liquid engine in its last stage. This is because the RCS is very capable of getting you back onto Kerbal. The easiest way to accomplish this is to fire your RCS retrograde at apogee until your perigee dips to about 40k. From then on, the atmosphere is doing the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
