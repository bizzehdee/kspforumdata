But one thing that bugs me is trying to see the effects of adjusting a maneuver node where the proposed trajectory intersects a distant SOI. As an example, I was 4 days out from intersection Kerbin\u0027s SOI on a Duna return trajectory and about all that could be seen was that things were changing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I had to fine-tune my entry trajectory by tweaking the maneuver node while mousing back over the Kerbin periapsis marker to figure out if at was getting smaller or larger\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and then when I found the minimum in one axis (say, pro/retrograde) I\u0027d have to repeat the searching in a different axis (up/down or radial).

Tricks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp until now I\u0027ve often used the inefficient method of multiple maneuvers (boost to orbit ==\u0026gt; eject to edge of SOI ==\u0026gt; adjust inclination ==\u0026gt; transfer to Hohmann transfer orbit, etc.).

Among other things it lets you adjust the maneuver using the keyboard so you can keep the mouse where you want it. It can also optionally show the ejection angle (there is an O button for options that lets you hide/show various features). Finally it has a conic mode feature to let you change how projections are shown. I don\u0027t know what I changed it to but I like it more then what it was before (I now have it showing interception paths in the same frame of reference as the body they are intercepting, so for example a Mun encounter isn\u0027t a line that bends bit as it encounters the Mun and then goes back, it sharply twists around to show the half orbit, then breaks off to continue elseswhere)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T19:29:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.23.5, you can center the map view on any planet (either by cycling through them with tab, or by left-clicking the planet and selecting \u0022focus\u0022) and all trajectories, including maneuver node trajectories, will be redrawn relative to that planet.
