I finally managed to buy a Tier 3 R\u0026amp;D building and get my drills and ISRU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I take a nice rover to Minmus with a Surface Scanner, and put a Survey Scanner in orbit. I forgot that I hadn\u0027t done the orbital survey yet, and clicked the \u0022Run Analysis\u0022 button on the Survey Scanner first. When it didn\u0027t give me a readout, I remembered to go do the orbital survey. Came back to my rover, and now instead of giving me an ore percentage readout, it says \u0022Unknown\u0022 -- and I can\u0027t seem to reset it so it starts working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I missing something obvious?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T12:09:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you in an area with zero ore concentration?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T13:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyea, I think thats what you get when there is 0% ore\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T13:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it happens, this topic\u0027s fresh in my mind, because just in the last few days I was updating a mod to work with the scanner.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137806-113-indicatorlights-v011-small-convenient-informative/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;embedComment=2681927\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I can confirm that yes, it says \u0022unknown\u0022 if the ore concentration is zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Not sure why it says that instead of just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esaying\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E zero, which would be less confusing IMHO.\u00A0 But that\u0027s what it is.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T17:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.
