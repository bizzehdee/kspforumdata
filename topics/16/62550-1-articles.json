Then I jumped back to the ship with the shortest time left (a couple hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set the camera for a pretty perspective with Kerbin in the background, then went downstairs to cook and eat.

No, I was not under 100km to the planet - I was 1 hour out from a Mun intercept, about 9-10 million km above Kerbin.

I also find it curious that no other spacecraft of mine, many of which flew nearly identical routes, ever exhibited this.

If you come out of non-physics time warp and don\u0027t touch the controls does the same thing happen in the same period of time?
