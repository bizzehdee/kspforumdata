It\u0027s basically three modules docked together in space - a main thruster module, a supply module (the one that carries most of the gas; more that one of these gets me further), and a lander. The first design was a nice, light design; used only a single docking port, so it wobbled like crazy and I couldn\u0027t steer it. Second design was beefier - too beefy as it turned out; my computer couldn\u0027t crunch all the parts without serious lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this time around I\u0027m going back to my first design but replacing the docking ports with the heavy 4 Clamp-o-tron docking port design I\u0027ve seen floating around here on occasion. This has given me a new problem: I am having problems attaching my existing booster to the redesigned modules. Particularly the service module - it\u0027s got these docking ports on both ends. Has anybody worked with that design and successfully got a booster attached to one of those ports, or can anyone help me design a booster that will get the whole load up into space? It has to be able to lift at least 45 tonnes to a 100k orbit and has to be able to de-orbit itself afterwards. Brownie points if you can get it attached reliably attached to the ports in such a way that it\u0027ll come off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried adding small stack decouplers to the ports and adding a corresponding docking port to the booster part; in the first case the booster wouldn\u0027t attach and in the second the docking ports refused to undock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T21:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea, I utilize a similar design, exceipt that I prefer having the engines attached to the fuel module: that way the ship doesn\u0027t flex as much.
