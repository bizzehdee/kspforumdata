Gotten the hang of the basics for the most part. Now I\u0027m moving into more advance stuff and I\u0027m not understanding what the info mechjeb is telling me when I use vessel info. What does the max thrust in KN mean? I\u0027m not understanding why when I make a rocket that\u0027s only 100 ton or whatever the measure is and my max thrust is over 5000 why it\u0027s so slow lifting off. What does the TWR mean? When it says 1.45 what does that really mean??? Any advice would really help. Please try and keep the answers in simple terms. Not that good at the math part of rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T16:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETWR is your thrust-to-weight ratio.

In total vacuum this is (from my own observations at least) not so important, but as a rule you pretty much won\u0027t move / lift if you have less than 1.0 TWR. That is, a rocket on the launchpad with more weight than what the thrust can move isn\u0027t going to get lifted. So you need at least 1.0 TWR from launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure someone can give a far better explanation of this than I can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for thrust and kN (which I understand to be kilo-newtons, and newton being a measurement of thrust), there is an equation that can be done to \u0022manually\u0022 determine your TWR. Of course you would also need to know your rockets weight as well but I don\u0027t know tha formula. Again there are more well informed / well spoken people that can give you a better grasp than my simplistic layman\u0027s terms I just used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T16:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E10KN can lift 1 ton on kerbin. divide that my the relitive gravity of the planet/moon to find TWR.
