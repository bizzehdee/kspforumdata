When you want to slow down, in stock, yes you can use reaction wheels to force your plane to a 90 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E. Outside of stock, you use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to accomplish exactly the same thing. If that slows you down too much, then you need to know some aerodynamic details about your plane -- what\u0027s the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E that gives you the most lift overall, and what\u0027s the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E that gives you the best lift/drag coefficient?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general, it\u0027s a good idea to come in with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E somewhere between max. lift/drag and max. lift. This keeps you from falling out of the sky way too short. Then you hit your first landmark, and you say, \u0022Too fast/slow? Too high/low?\u0022 And you start making adjustments. If you are too fast and low, you start maximizing lift. If you\u0027re way too fast, you go to 90 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E and cross your fingers. If you are too high/slow, you drop your nose to prograde and trade some altitude for some speed. if you are too low and slow, then you reentered way too soon and you need to either call this a mere computer simulation and hit Alt-F9 to try again, or light your engines a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you start looking for the next landmark.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor landing, I like coming in really high and fast in the high atmosphere.

Even with the stock aerodynamics, a good spaceplane (one which needs wings to fly, not one with enough power to do it without wings) can glide about 1/4 of the way around Kerbin further than the ballistic prediction would indicate (and that\u0027s the simple suborbital prediction, not even the ballistic-with-drag prediction of a poorly configured Trajectories).

When landing spaceplanes you need to aim to undershoot by A LOT because the plane is going to glide around the world - that is\u00A0assuming you are pitching up a bit to slow descent and ease heating. Trajectories mod is so useful for modeling this but it\u0027s vital to tell it you\u0027ll be gaining lift (and nice thing is, you can adjust the angle of attack you want it to use for its prediction and see the projected trajectory change in response).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve never seen it I super highly recommend this video about how the Apollo capsule used lift to narrow down, though mainly just for inspiration, the main take-home is that it\u0027s damn hard, you descend too fast and burn up/get destroyed, or you overshoot by half a world (and it\u0027s computer stuff, not \u0022seat of the pants\u0022 stuff):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOiVKUI07G0?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
