It makes\u00A0the plane so hard to\u00A0pitch up, and cant even level fly, surely cant be used, as shown in the following pictures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can move the fuel tank to the back, so that the CoM and CoL can stay close to each other,\u00A0but this dosent solve the problem, because\u00A0the CoM will move to the front during flight, while the fuel is burning up, the plane wont feel good about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i am really confuse about this. The stock wings work fine though, their CoL wont be too far back, if with the same configuration as the above procedural wing one. So i am wondering what i need to do if i want this aircraft flyable?
