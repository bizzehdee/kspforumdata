Currently I\u0027ve been training a lot to get the basic maneuvers right, and it goes very well lately. Always within the Kerbin boundaries though, but currently I\u0027m thinking about making a fleet to get my first steps to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever since 0.21 I\u0027m aware that in a future release, you will get to build rockets within financial limits. Until now I just grabbed everything off the shelf whatever I needed, overkill or not. Lately I\u0027ve been looking at all the rockets I\u0027ve built. All of them did the job decent to very nicely. However I\u0027ve noticed that I haven\u0027t built my rockets very efficient from an economic standpoint. I can also see that in the following situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Returning from a mission to Kerbin atmosphere with a tonload of fuel left, something you dragged along all that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Having to ditch a pretty big ship on the Kerbin surface. Only the command module with the Kerbals in them needed to be saved with parachutes. The rest will be unrecoverable as it crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have some more information how to build or rebuild rockets to make them do \u0022the same with less\u0022?

Do you take into consideration if you want to recover as much as possible for example and how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is not a technical question that can be answered with a single answer.
