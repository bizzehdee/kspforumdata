In general my advice is always to attempt EVA on the pad before flying a mission with a new design so that you don\u0027t find out the hatch is obstructed right when you want to place a flag. If you have nothing mounted to the cockpit and it is still obstructed post a screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"palioxis1248","CreatedById":100635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T04:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwice as large?? Hot Damn. Seems like I have a bunch of struts and RCS quads to rip out. But even with the doors closed it\u0027s really alright, the ship in question is just a to-orbit shuttle, doesn\u0027t need EVA capability. Just have to make sure I don\u0027t need a reason to bail out. Ever. But thanks a bunch for the advice!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
