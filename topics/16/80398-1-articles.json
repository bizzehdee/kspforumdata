A high thrust ship will have the same dV as a low thrust ship if the wet/dry masses and Isp are the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe math to calculate the OP\u0027s requirement is non-trivial. Basically, the rocket needs to add enough energy to account for the potential energy of the higher altitude, the kinetic energy of the speed, and the energy lost to fighting gravity and atmospheric drag. Might be easier to just build a rocket and make your trajectory more horizontal in the altitude range you want to get the speed requirement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T14:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes of course, not sure what I was thinking there.
