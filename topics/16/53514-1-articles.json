Accept a much larger close-approach distance than you would in Kerbin orbit. I used maneuver nodes on the rendezvous and ultimately decided that 50,000 km was a close enough approach that I could fly the navball to perform refining corrections to shrink three to four days before arrival.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You can switch to target-relative velocity at any time that you have a spacecraft targeted. Just click the navball. If you wait for the game to do it automatically, the game won\u0027t do it until you\u0027re within about 60 kilometers of the target, which is /ridiculously/ hard to do in solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The game\u0027s in-game closest approach numbers are inaccurate. It\u0027s usually not that bad in LKO rendezvouses, but in the solar orbit rendezvous I did, they wound up being tens of thousands of kilometers off in some cases. Judging from the screenshots I wound up taking, the game tended to overestimate closest-approach distance by a factor of five or so. Any mod that gives more-accurate numbers on your closest approaches will be helpful in that situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Especially if you\u0027re rendezvousing with moderate-efficiency engines, you really need to understand how to maneuver the relative-velocity indicator onto the target-direction indicator /while/ you\u0027re killing relative velocity. Kill relative velocity - Burn towards Target - Repeat is conceptually easy to understand, and works, but it\u0027s going to cost you more delta-V than slightly tilting off the relative-velocity marker to push it onto the target marker. Remember that, on the typically-built spacecraft, burning the engine /pulls/ the pro-velocity markers across the navball towards the direction your spacecraft\u0027s nose is pointing, and /pushes/ the retro-velocity markers away from the direction your spacecraft\u0027s nose is pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In the final phase, time acceleration is not your friend. I generally found that, when I finally did get within those last 2.3 kilometers of distance, /any/ time accelleration, physwarp or not, resulted in the target changing relative position by several hundred meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-18T11:03:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2013 11:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by maltesh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T11:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maltesh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maltesh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4.

So you can use physical time warp to traverse certain distance but do not trust what the game tells you about the position of the target during that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn-rails time warp is worse because it will move the target to some different place and it will not return. But according to my experience, it only happens once and subsequent time warp changes were way less drastical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rule of thumb is: until you\u0027re up close, keep your relative velocity at or below 1% of your distance. So if it\u0027s 20 km, you should not go much more than 200 m/s. If it\u0027s 10 km, you should be on 100 m/s already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T12:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emaltesh\u003C/strong\u003E pretty much spelled it all out for you.
