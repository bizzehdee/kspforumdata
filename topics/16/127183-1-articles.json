Though I wonder if it will really be necessary to set the periapsis and apoapsis values to the nearest meter per second. I see the contract gives it to that accuracy, but that\u0027s less than one part in 100 billion and I do not see how you can ever set those values that accurately. If you manage to get your periapsis to 108,006,024,920 meters then you would have to go 3322.77184373 m/s to have an apoapsis of 111,782,138,716 meters. If you go, for instance,\u00A0 3322.77184372 m/s your apoapsis will be 111,782,138,715 meters.\u00A0 Maybe if you use one little RCS thruster on a thousand-ton ship?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, here\u0027s how to ballpark the numbers. Pardon me while I do some mental calisthenics. Let\u0027s work backwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRa= apoapsis radius, the furthest distance from the sun of the desired orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRp=periapsis radius, the closest distance from the sun of the desired orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\na=the semimajor axis of the desired orbit= (Ra\u002BRp)/2, in this case 109,894,081,817 m.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe further from the sun you are the slower you go, so we will do the do the big plane change and periapsis change at the apoapsis of the orbit.\u00A0 How fast do we need to go there?\u003Cbr\u003E\nu=the gravitational constant of Kerbol, from the KSP wiki that is 1.1723328E\u002B18 m^3/s^2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor all points in an elliptical orbit the speed, v, = sqrt(u*((2/r)-(1/a))). I\u0027ll call this \u0022Formula 1\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the v of your target orbit at r=Ra is 3210.525247 m/s.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet\u0027s round to the nearest meter per second from here on, though you can see you might need to go to the nearest nanometer per second in the end...\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow we need to find the transfer orbit from Kerbin to an apoapsis of 111782138716 m,= Ra. Kerbin\u0027s orbit is a circle of semimajor axis 13,599,840,256 meters, so we will use this as our transfer orbit Rp. The semimajor axis for this is (Ra\u002BRp)/2=62,690,989,488m. Using the Formula 1 from above we find that the v at Rp is 12398 m/s, and the v at Ra is 1508 m/s. So when we reach the target apoapsis from the sun we need to increase the speed from 1508m/s to 3211m/s and change the direction by 62.9 degrees. (Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane is inclined 0 degrees, and the Hohmann orbit we will transfer from Kerbin in will also be inclined 0 degrees, so the plane change will equal the inclination of the desired final orbit.) It is much more efficient to make both changes at once, so now we have a problem in trigonometry. Draw a triangle with on leg 1508 units long, and a second leg 3211 units long\u00A0 that is at an angle of 62.9 degrees to the first leg. We need to figure out the length and direction of the third leg, since that leg is the burn we need to do. From the law of cosines we find the mystery burn will be 2859m/s.\u00A0 Pythagoras can tell you what the prograde and normal components of that burn will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 Now the final problem is the departure from Low Kerbin Orbit. Kerbin\u0027s orbital speed around the sun is 9284.5m/s, so you need to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI at 12398-9284=3114 m/s. If we can find the semimajor axis of the hyperbolic departure orbit from Kerbin we can find the velocity at any distance from Kerbin of that orbit. We\u0027ll need another formula:\u003Cbr\u003E\na=(r*u)/(2*u-r*v^2)\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 in this case r is the radius of Kerbin\u0027s Sphere Of Influence, which from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe wiki\u003C/a\u003E we find to be 84,159,286 meters. u is Kerbin\u0027s gravitational parameter, from the wiki it is 3.5316E\u002B12.\u00A0 v is the 3114 m/s of speed we need to have at that SOI. The a therefore = -367,375 meters. I don\u0027t know if you have used these formulas before, if not don\u0027t worry about the negative value, that is how the semimajor axis for hyperbolas are given. In any case we can now use this value for a in Formula 1 and the value of \u0027r\u0027 will be whatever orbit you like to start from. I usually leave Kerbin from a 75x75km altitude orbit, but you must remember that Formula 1 needs the distance from the center of the planet, not the altitude above it\u0027s surface! Therefore I would use 675000 meters for \u0027r\u0027 in Formula 1. I then find my v in the 75x75km orbit needs to be 4481m/s, since the circular speed at that altitude is 2287m/s I will need a 2193 m/s burn to get to the plane-change burn point.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn summary, starting from a 75x75km orbit around Kerbin, you will need to make two burns- a 2193m/s burn that gets you out to 111,782,138,716 meters above Kerbol, and then a burn at that point of 2859m/s that puts you right into the desired final orbit. Total = 5052m/s. In practice I\u0027d allow for a few hundred m/s of correction burns, because there is no way you will be able to do those burns precisely enough! Note that that second burn must be made at the exact Longitude of Ascending Node of 63.7 degrees. How do you find this? Well, in our Hohmann transfer orbit from Kerbin to the plane change we will travel exactly 180 degrees around the sun. This means you must\u00A0 leave Kerbin when it is at 243.7 degrees. To figure out when this is we note from the wiki that Kerbin starts at\u00A0 a Mean Anomoly of 3.14 radians at 0 UT. 3.14 radians= 179.9 degrees. Kerbin\u0027s orbit is a perfect circle, so it always moves at the same speed. It makes one orbit of Kerbol (=360 degrees)\u00A0 in 9,203,545 seconds, so we can see it will move 243.7-179.9= 63.8 degrees in (63.8/360)*9203545= 1631072 seconds. So leave Kerbin at 1,631,072 seconds after the game starts, or every 9,203,545 seconds after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Note that you could use a flyby of Jool to throw you into the right plane and out to the target apoapsis. This would save you about 100m/s on the leaving-Kerbin burn and about 2km/s on the 2nd burn. But that would be much more complicated to set up. You would need to flyby Jool when Jool is at 63.7 degrees, but determining what energy you need to arrive at it with is tricky. Considering that I think it\u0027s impossible to get into that one-part-in-100-billion orbit I wouldn\u0027t spend the time on it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DomiKamu","CreatedById":154367,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T02:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222311288\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127183\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449443919\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152727\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LiquidAir\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/12/2015 00:18:39, LiquidAir said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbital velocity at the apoapsis of a Holmann transfer from Kerbin\u00A0(if I got my math right) is about 1600m/s.
