a tradeoff.\u00A0 Getting more of one thing means getting less of something else.\u00A0 So a general philosophy is \u0022don\u0027t provide something unless it\u0027s actually needed\u0022, because otherwise it\u0027s costing you more than it\u0027s worth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\u00A0 TWR is important for getting off the launchpad, because you have to go \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eup\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and you\u0027re fighting directly against gravity.\u00A0 Therefore, TWR is one of the most important considerations for getting off the launchpad, and (to a lesser degree) is often a relevant consideration for your 2nd stage as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut by the time you\u0027ve climbed high enough that you\u0027re going mostly horizontally... well, TWR isn\u0027t so important then.\u00A0 If you\u0027re going mostly horizontal, you\u0027re not fighting gravity, so TWR simply doesn\u0027t matter, as long as it\u0027s not \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E low that you catch up to your Ap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the important point there is that in such a situation, having a high TWR is not only not-helping, it is actively \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehurting\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E you.\u00A0 That\u0027s because the really high-TWR engines tend to be heavy and not very fuel-efficient.\u00A0 Heavy = dead weight = bad.\u00A0 Low fuel efficiency = wasting fuel = lower dV = bad.\u00A0 So when you are in a place where you no longer need the TWR so much, what you really want is an engine that is as light and fuel-efficient (i.e. high vacuum Isp) as possible.\u00A0 Those engines tend to be low-TWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt means that those engines would be a lousy choice on the launchpad, but they\u0027re great for circularizing your orbit-- a much better choice, in fact, than a heavy/inefficient high-TWR engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T17:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI generally like my liftoff TWR to be between 1.3 and

into consideration when selecting the TWR for an upper stage is the length of the burn.\u00A0 If your burn is too long,\u00A0inefficiencies are introduced because you are sweeping through a large portion of your orbit while burning.\u00A0 The rule of thumb is that you don\u0027t want to pass through more than about 60 degrees of an orbit while burning.\u00A0 For Kerbin orbit, this works out to about 5 minutes.\u00A0 Therefore, I like to have a TWR large enough that I don\u0027t need more than a 5-minute\u00A0 burn.\u00A0 In general, if you plan to perform an ejection burn of 2000 m/s, then you need a TWR at ignition of about 0.5 to limit the burn to 5 minutes.\u00A0 For smaller burns you can get by with a lower TWR, and for larger burns you may want a higher
