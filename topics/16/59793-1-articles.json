I inadvertently stranded a kerbal on my first Mun landing and figured I would try a rescue mission while waiting for Minmus to be in a good spot in its orbit for me to travel there. The lander I built uses the mechjeb pod with a Mk 1 Lander can below it so I can board with my kerbal and head back to earth. The problem comes in when I try to extend the landing struts the pod extends it\u0027s landing struts and separates from the rest of the lander. I have tried figuring out how to disable the landing struts from the Action Groups but it still seems to detach. Anyone know how I can fix this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pigletx2","CreatedById":78322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T22:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse action groups to activate/dis-activate your normal landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"relin","CreatedById":89684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T22:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the landing struts attached to the Landing Can or the Mechjeb Pod?

The Problem is the MechJeb pod has its own landing struts and they were pushing the pod up... Now it seems the struts are not activating on the Pod but it is still coming loose. I am going to try strutting it and see if that helps but not sure why it is separating.
