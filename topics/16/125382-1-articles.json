I\u0027m curious on how to disable Milestones from KSP 1.0.5. I\u0027m trying to play with FlowerChild\u0027s BTSM mod and that\u0027s a huge wrench thrower in the mod.

In GameData\\Squad\\Contracts\\Contracts.cfg head down to the \u0022Progression\u0022 section. Setting \u0022PassiveBaseRatio\u0022 to zero should disable passive progress rewards.
