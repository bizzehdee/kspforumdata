However the answer Is yes. If you Land at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E you recover 100% of the parts value. Nevertheless with the default settings, if you pick the right contracts you do not really Need It. There is the \u0022transponder\u0022 strategy that could be applied too to increase the recovered parts value if they Land far from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E but It Is not really your best shot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-22T23:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt makes a difference if you adapt to it.

Or on the Island Runway itself. If you miss any of those targets, even by a little, then it gives you a partial refund, by measuring the distance to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E end of the Crawlerway. Obviously, it\u0027s smartest to land everything on the runway because it\u0027s the biggest target. This is really useful for planes, because you can always taxi them back onto the runway, no matter where at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E you land them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also makes a difference for rockets, if you build them knowing that you will try to land them on the runway. Many players stage away all the expensive parts before reentry, and reenter with a bare capsule (and maybe a heatshield). This is a waste of money. It is very challenging and interesting to try to reenter a complete rocket, and then land it as close to the runway as you can -- to try to get that refund.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-22T23:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice that around 20-30% income it is a \u0022make or break\u0022 for any contract.
