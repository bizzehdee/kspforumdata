I just got the game 3 days ago and i am EXTREMELY hooked, to the point of inviting my friends over so we can play space command in my living room. Along with that is the fact that i spent some time here reading and i have been very impressed with not only the quality and quantity of content put out by the community but the attitude as well, so bravo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said i was trying in a suicidal way to end up making the game more realistic (read harder) and have found some addons/mods that i wish to install. However many prolific posters on this forum have suggested making a backup install/back up saved games before attempting to add mods onto my game. So i guess there are a few questions here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere is the steam game kept?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do i do a backup install?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do i do a backup of my saved game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any difference for installing mods on a steam install vs a normal one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas the .20 update really messed up mod installations so much that i should just wait(very very anxiously) while everyone updates their mods before i start my first mod experience to save myself the hassle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kolt","CreatedById":67456,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T01:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) To backup your files all you got to do is copy the entire KSP folder to a secondary location. If anything goes bad with the mods you can just replace the whole folder. It\u0027s faster that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The saved games are inside the KSP folder(C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/Steamapps/Common/KerbalSpaceProgram/Saves) Simply copy the files to a secondary location. If you backed up the whole KSP folder already, you don\u0027t really need to do this tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Installation is exactly the same. Just make sure you follow the installation instructions of each mod. In 0.20 they added a new folder so that you can more easily install mods, but you can get a lot of .19 mods to work on there by installing them the old way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If you had mods installed before, you should backup your saved files and then delete the KSP folder and download the game again so that you have a fresh folder (no mods.) I had to do this because I had so many conflicting files of mods that didn\u0027t work. But don\u0027t worry too much about it, a lot of mods are being updated already and some of .19 ones work still on this new version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tinweasele","CreatedById":67627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T05:43:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your quick reply!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
