But probably not if you\\\u0027re coming from a simple trans-munar elliptical transfer from Earth, because if anything you are going too slowly at Kerbin\\\u0027s apoapsis when the Mun comes by flying by you at ~540 m/s (all relative to Kerbin). For that speed to be less than the Munar escape speed you\\\u0027d have to be less than 44000m above its surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo pull this off, you\\\u0027ll need to enter the Mun\\\u0027s SOI at a radius of 2430km (see the Wiki) with as little kinetic energy as possible in the Mun-spacecraft reference frame, and yet still having just enough angular momentum to make it around the Mun and not crash into it. At that distance you would need to be moving at less than 230 m/s relative to the Mun, and ideally at 90 degrees to the spacecraft-Mun line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way might be to orbit Kerbin in a slightly smaller circular orbit than the Mun\\\u0027s, and use this to catch up to it, gradually.

I just looked back at the original question, and although you could arrange to have negative energy on entering the Mun\\\u0027s SoI, you would still have to modify the orbit just a wee bit (at periapsis, ideally) to lower your apoapsis and thus prevent yourself from leaving it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that 3-body gravitation was complicated, but one still has to think carefully about KSP\\\u0027s simplified 2-body model as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-10T07:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a wise man once taught me, math shows anything is possible. But what is true on paper, nature will always throw you a curve ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that out of the way, Closette\\\u0027s idea is possible. I\\\u0027ve seen a shot where someone actually expanded a Kerbin orbit to be closely parallel to the Mun\\\u0027s, where the Mun would be bound to capture you at a lesser speed than just a typical TMI. However, such a maneuver would require more time and delta-vee than an ordinary TMI, so it would defeat the purpose of trying to avoid a burn to establish Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought would be keeping Periapsis inside the Kerbin atmosphere, and have Apoapsis positioned over the orbital path of the Mun further along to where you make a return trip to Kerbin, lose velocity skipping through the atmosphere, and then on the outward leg to the Mun, you achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I type this, it sounds wonderful, but I have to think you would lose too much velocity to re-attain the Mun\\\u0027s orbit. And yet there is a part of my brain that likes this. I\\\u0027m reminded of the science in the story 2010 where the Leonov used Jupiter\\\u0027s upper atmosphere to slow down to attain orbit of Io.

Then, whenever you leave mun\\\u0027s SOI, you are slowed down a little by Kerbin before re-entering mun\\\u0027s SOI.
