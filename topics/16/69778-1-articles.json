Once that\u0027s done, use the most throttle you can while retaining precision. I tend to go full-throttle to start with, but really wind it down for the final corrections. If I want real precision, such as if I\u0027m making corrections for planetary gravity assists, I\u0027ll bring the thrust limiter down too. You can be half a solar orbit away and get your periapsis right to within a hundred, even ten, metres that way. (Of course, don\u0027t timewarp through the SOI change or the orbit shift will undo your work.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T22:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe delta-v you will get for a given amount of fuel is the same regardless of how quickly you thrust (unless you do it inside the atmosphere of Laythe or Jool where the ISP will be lowered).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever \u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E you thrust will have a big impact on how far you\u0027ll actually go, which means there are strong advantages to thrusting as quickly as possible so that your delta-v is being used at the most optimum time. As a simple example if you want to expand your orbit then burning at the AP and PE will provide a lot more benefit then anywhere else. You should really figure out how to use maneuver nodes, you can use them to figure out when to burn if you want to line up an encounter with one of Jool\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brun","CreatedById":68293,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T00:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs others have said, doing a big burn as fast as possible is preferable.
