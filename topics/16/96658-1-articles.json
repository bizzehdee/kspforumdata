Mostly my piloting. It\u0027s still nothing to write home about, and it feels like clawing my way up into space. And if I were an actually good pilot, I could probably manage far more speed out of it than 1900 m/s at 34 km before kicking in the rockets. This could have easily been improved by having working action groups, gone up into space with open intakes. For some reason, my intake action groups did not work. I also need to figure something out to prevent overheating of my rapiers. Those things pack far more punch than the 80% max thrust I can run them at. That thrust would be appreciated in the early bit directly after the transitioning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that I added some batteries to right in front of the RAPIERS (in the hopes of solving that overheating problem, but alas, didn\u0027t work), and each engine now has AT LEAST 4 shock cones servicing it. It\u0027s still not as smooth as I like it, but yeah. A little tweaking goes a long way. Better piloting shaved 10 degrees off the max AoA. Still quite a lot at 25 degrees, but less jarring than 35. It feels a bit airhoggy though with four shock-cones per engine. But I probably shouldn\u0027t whine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still having some minor yaw-issues when climbing just after takeoff though. Anyone know how to solve that?

DocMoriarty recommends anywhere from 1 to 2.5 rudder parts per engine used; last I checked you\u0027ve got five rudders and no fewer than seven engines.

I\u0027m guessing Standard Canards, but I\u0027ve used AV-R8 winglets as rudders to good effect. Rudders can also help you in asymmetric thrust situations - I had one design where a engine completely flamed out but the craft held its course due to its rudders (though the fact that the remaining engine wasn\u0027t outputting a great deal of thrust at that point might\u0027ve had a lot to do with it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1900 m/s at 34k though is pretty darn good regardless of what kind of engine setup you\u0027ve got - personally, I wouldn\u0027t knock it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as your intake action group is concerned, you may have been hit by the old symmetry bug, especially if there was some kind of mishap during the application of the intakes.

In my experience 100-120m/s is a pretty decent takeoff speed, and you want to be able to reach it within the first 2/3rds of the runway, roughly. You can of course manage to do it at lower speeds, and in some cases that\u0027s desirable, but with a plane designed to carry payloads - especially heavy ones - to orbit you want the full plane with payload to be nearish to its performance limits - which means high take-off speed - because it\u0027ll be \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E lighter (and thus need far less lift) when you drop off the payload. Too much lift can make the plane a little hypersensitive to control input (even in fine mode) when it\u0027s time to land, which obviously makes life difficult \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merandix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Merandix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd if I were an actually good pilot, I could probably manage far more speed out of it than 1900 m/s at 34 km before kicking in the rockets.
