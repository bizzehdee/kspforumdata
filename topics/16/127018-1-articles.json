It\u0027s a dinky little thing, all it is carrying on it is some thermometers and 2 goo canisters. The probe\u0027s intent was just to farm the near 40,000 cash for intiating a flyby of the sun, and another near 40,000 for enter its orbit, as well as roleplaying a \u0022can we do this?\u0022 personal mission. The minimal science was placed as an afterthought. It has the ability to transmit, has the circular battery and solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with that said. It had more fuel left than I had expected, with an LV-909 as an engine, being the most efficient so far in this career. So I was tinkering with its orbit, and by pure chance got a node that, in 4 years and about 100some oddays, will send it to be captured by Jool (I have never sent anything, manned or otherwise, anywhere but Mun and Minmus, so this will be a first for me). It will be captured by Jool for a number of days before escaping. I plan on gathering science from Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI currently have only one open contract which has no expiration (explore Duna). So that is no concern. The only active vehicles I have right now besides STARHAMMER (the probe in question)\u00A0is a SATCOM (lol that\u0027s what I call it; it does nothing in actuality, it\u0027s for fun)\u00A0in stable equatorial Kerbin orbit, and another derelict failed probe orbiting the sun but relatively within the same sphere as Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe failed probe I don\u0027t care about. In fact I might as well go destroy it. Can I safely time warp 4 years (so max warp I would assume) without risk? I know the contracts not taken yet will expire and repopulate a few times, but that\u0027s no big deal. My concern is whether warping that much time is safe as far as the program\u0027s quirks are concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy projection shows my probe\u0027s periapsis to Jool will be at 1,118,113,458m, so that\u0027s...\u00A01,118,113.458 kilometers?!
