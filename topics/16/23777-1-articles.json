There isn\u0027t a terribly precise method. But the basic principle is easy enough. Higher orbits lag behind lower orbits. So if your satellite is more than 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of the following one, raise it to a higher orbit, wait until it\u0027s at the right angle, and lower it again. If it\u0027s too close, lower it, then raise it back. Just keep in mind that raising/lowering will take up an extra half-revolution between burns. So you want to make sure that the difference is small, and that means you might have to wait for quite a few turns in between. By the way, it might be easier to do inclination change first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Practice on Kerbin.
