Depending on your altitude, you pick up some or a lot of velocity as you fall. Then you have to kill all that downward velocity before you actually land. That\u0027s the inefficient part -- it\u0027s called \u0022gravity losses\u0022. You\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehave\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Eto kill your orbital velocity before you can land. So all that 500\u002B m/s of deltaV is gone no matter what you do. But the falling part is optional and wasteful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you want to be as low as possible when you do your retroburn. That\u0027s all it comes down to. For a very low cost, you can lower your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E down to a couple thousand meters above your landing site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurning slowly insteand of all-at-once means that your \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eaverage\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E altitude is fairly high. Which means you are still accumulating gravity losses. On the other hand, apparently there is a mathematical proof that a \u0022constant rate of descent\u0022 landing is equally efficient to any other method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n_________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you land directly without entering orbit first, that is called a \u0022suicide burn\u0022 and it is significantly more efficient. Why? Two\u00A0reasons.\u00A0The first\u00A0is that if you do it in two steps and\u00A0enter orbit first, then you have the problem of gravity losses during your final descent, as said above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second\u00A0is the Oberth effect. The faster you are going when you do your burn, the more efficient it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have completed your suicide burn, you are extremely low to the ground and there is very little time left for falling or gravity losses. There is a fairly clever way to use a maneuver node\u00A0to discover how long you will need to burn for your suicide burn, and how many seconds you have left before impact. If you leave yourself a few seconds to spare, you will generally be fairly safe. If you do a search on the forums for \u0022suicide burn\u0022, you will find many postings about the technique.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, the problem with this method is that you can\u0027t really pick your landing site, and it might be unsuitable when you get there. (If you\u0027re aiming for one of the flats on Minmus, this isn\u0027t a problem.) Aborting a landing, and then traversing terrain to find a better landing site is about the most fuel-wasteful thing that you can possibly do in a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-07T00:27:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2020 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T09:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding directly from a transfer is more efficient, but it\u0027s not called a suicide burn for nothing! A slight miscalculation and your rocket is a smear across the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding from orbit, it\u0027s best to bring your periapsis down as low as you can to minimise the distance you have to \u0027fall\u0027 and pick up speed via gravity that you then have to get rid of again, and also to maximise Oberth effect: the faster you\u0027re going, the more efficient a rocket burn becomes so coming in faster is better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re near your chosen landing site, burn retrograde in what is effectively a reverse gravity turn, scrubbing off as much horizontal velocity as you can while fighting against gravity as little as possible until you end up with only a little bit of velocity at a low altitude. Too much braking and you\u0027ll just have to land vertically which uses a bit more fuel; too little altitude and you\u0027ll crash into the ground at considerable speed. However, a longer burn with lower thrust can be better as you have a bigger safety margin to abort the landing if you have to and won\u0027t make much of a difference in terms of fuel use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also depends on how precise you want your landing site to be- if you just want it to be somewhere on Minmus\u0027 Greater Flats, you can focus more on being efficient, but if you want to land close to\u00A0something else on the surface (like when you\u0027re adding a new module to a surface base, for example)\u00A0then it\u0027s better to kill your horizontal velocity first even if you then have to drop a greater distance vertically and use more fuel, to make sure you land exactly where you want to.
