Is there any way in vanilla to know what vertical distance is left when a vessel is attempting to land?\u00A0The altitude is not reliable, as it is not at sea level where you want to land. I know with Kengineer we have that feature, but in vanilla?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T11:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIVA view of pods have a radar altimeter that works when you are within... I think 3km of the ground... but then ... yea, its IVA view... but you can look at when the iva view dial tells you its 2km from the ground, then quickly switch to the normal external view, and look at the altitude, then mentally subtract 2km from that to have your \u0022true\u0022 height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T19:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGround shadow/retrorocket smoke vector change? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SteveD80","CreatedById":160995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T00:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re landing at the runway, stick a rover at either end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juvilado","CreatedById":106978,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T06:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm talking about something like landing at Mun at night, or even at day.
