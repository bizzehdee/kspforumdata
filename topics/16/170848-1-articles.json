You can get around the fuel transfer problem in the game settings by a setting in the game\u0027s Difficulty Options. Under \u0022Advanced\u0022,\u00A0 uncheck \u0022Resource Transfer Obeys Crossfeed Rules\u0022. But I still do not think you will be able to transfer crew from the old section and the new sections. Of course you can just go EVA and walk over to the new section, and with a surface\u00A0base, EVAs is the whole idea anyway, so it is not a bad solution. If you think about it from a Kerbins point of view, it might be a pain to put on a space suit to walk over to the new science module, but that is their problem not yours. :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest solution is to put everything on wheels, which makes it easier to get all the\u00A0docking ports at the same level, and as Brikoleur mentions, reaction wheels can often get you close enough for the magnets to work and dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0magnets on the docking ports do not appear to need electricity, so I do not think either ship \u003Cem\u003Eneeds\u003C/em\u003E electricity.\u00A0\u00A0It would be hard, but I am thinking you could use a Kerbin in EVA using his jet pack to move a wheeled module into place to dock.
