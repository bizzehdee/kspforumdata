Unfortunately, once the rover is deployed, it\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u00A0begins to slide around. I can use the wheels to control it and reduce the speed for the most part with brakes, but I cannot bring the vehicle to a complete stop (about 0.3 m/s minimum), and when driving, the direction of orientation seems to make no difference: essentially, I Tokyo Drift around, regardless of which direction my wheels are pointed. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve driven smaller rovers on the moon without difficulty, and by replicating the problem at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E by hacking gravity down to .16, I\u0027ve determined it must be a gravity issue rather than anything specific to the moon itself. I also don\u0027t think it is related to Global Construction, as I cheated a fresh, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-built rover down to the lunar surface and had the same issue.\u00A0I also have done some brief experimentation with applying some downward thrust near the center of mass while braking to bring the rover into better contact with the ground, and although I haven\u0027t gone all out and experimented with huge engines, reasonably-sized ones haven\u0027t seemed to have helped; the rover still refuses to come to a complete stop.\u00A0Ultimately, I assume it\u0027s a question of distributing too little mass over too many wheels or something similar, but I wanted to see if this is a known problem with any solutions. I can provide a list of installed mods, craft file, etc., if this would help.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-26T03:45:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2019 03:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by GP_LeChuck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
