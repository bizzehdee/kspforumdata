I\\\u0027m Guekko and I\\\u0027m a fan of space and KSP. I\\\u0027ve been playing for 15 days now. After many requests, I made this little handbook to help beginners get started in KSP. I\\\u0027ll show you the different steps of a mission: takeoff; orbit; and landing. By following these simple steps, you will be playing like a pro in no time at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I begin, here are a few basic things to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! -RCS is activated by pressing R, but you have to have an RCS tank and radial RCS thrusters to use it. This helps stabilize your rocket, and can be enabled and disabled as you please. Personally, I use very little; preferring SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! -SAS is a stabilization system that does not need fuel and can be used indefinitely. It is activated by pressing the T key or by holding down F.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! HUD is the interface located at the bottom of the screen. There, you will find many essential elements for flight. The yellow icon, resembling a circle, represents the heading of your rocket and is projected onto the navball. The blue hemisphere on the navball represents the sky, and the brown part represents the land. If the yellow circle is pointing at the brown, it means you are heading down towards the ground. If it\\\u0027s blue, up, and if the circle is pointing at the white separation between the two hemispheres, it means you are heading sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! -There are three other icons on the navball: a yellow circle with an X in the centre, and two purple icons that look similar to the yellow ones. Contrary to the empty yellow circle representing the heading of your rocket, the yellow X icon symbolizes that you are heading retrograde, or backwards, from where you\\\u0027re heading. This is very useful because it gives you the necessary information to adjust your orbit by speeding up, or slowing down, or targeting a celestial body like the Mun, Kerbin, or Kerbol. Finally, there are the two purple icons: the more circular one points towards Kerbal Space Centre (KSC), which tells you where the space centre is if you want to return to it; the other purple icon points away from KSC. I really haven\\\u0027t found it useful, but please let me know if you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! -Some astronomy notes now! Orbiting means you are circling around a celestial body in space, and will never fall back into the atmosphere. In reality, the satellite/module that is in orbit will eventually fall because it slows down, and subsequently, re-enters the atmosphere. In KSP, this does not affect crafts above 65 kilometres, as that is the edge of the atmosphere. As soon as you have orbited once, it is certain that you will forever, because orbits do not decay. Orbits have two apses, or climaxes of altitude: the Apogee, and the Perigee. The Apogee is the point in your orbit where you are furthest away from the body you are orbiting. The Perigee is the opposite: it\\\u0027s the lowest point in your orbit. To change these apses, you have to point prograde to make them get higher, or retrograde to make them lower. This will be explained in more detail later in Explanations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaking the Rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! Here I am using the rocket I call Europa V. It is called \\\u0027V\\\u0027 because it had four previous versions (I, II, III, IV). I actually discovered and copied this rocket from a video I found; unfortunately, I don\\\u0027t remember the link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rocket allows you to send satellites into orbits of any size, and even send small modules onto the Mun, and bring them back. Look at the picture below for reference:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purposes of this tutorial, I will be using this rocket, but the steps will be the same for every rocket, only yours will look and work differently with the staging and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Takeoff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! This is probably the most delicate, random, and precise stage of the flight. Before taking off, make sure the staging of your engines is in order; it would be a pity to arrive at the Mun and not even be able to activate your descent engine! Once you\\\u0027ve done that, we must start the flight at the right time. Open map mode by pressing M to see a globe of Kerbin, and speed up time with \\\u0027.\\\u0027 (period) until the Mun is about 90\u00C2\u00B0 away from KSC (just over/under the horizon). Please see the photo below if you don\\\u0027t understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you go, you\\\u0027re all set!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivate the SAS and start the countdown. These are important steps to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! -With my rocket, you don\\\u0027t really need to do anything until orbit. On the contrary, your own model might need to be monitored, so that your rocket will be properly aligned with the vertical axis, and does not mess up its trajectory, which could jeopardize the entire mission. With the first stage of the Europa V, you can reach the edge of the atmosphere. Once the tanks empty, your altitude must be between 70 and 90 km. Eject the first stage with the space bar, but do not immediately activate the engines; your rocket will continue to climb thanks to inertia. At this point, we can move into the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E! Once the first stage is dropped, you have 20 seconds to deactivate the SAS and tilt the rocket horizontally. If you wait any longer, you may lose too much speed, and start to fall. In map mode (M), you can see that your orbit indicator (blue/green line) only covers half of Kerbin; this is normal. In this phase, you must be very accurate because if you tilt a few degrees to one side or the other, you may notice that your orbit is becoming very elliptical. Continue to tilt until you reach the white divider on the navball. It is imperative that the number on the navball that is closest to you is 90\u00C2\u00B0, or what it says on the monitor below the navball is at 90\u00C2\u00B0. This must be done very precisely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now, you should be somewhere between 100 and 120 kilometres in altitude. Press Space to start the next stage\\\u0027s liquid engines, and hold Shift until you\\\u0027re at full power, and reactivate the SAS. In map mode you can see that the apses expand very quickly. If all goes well, you will have two fairly equal apses, but if not, you are not in serious trouble, but you will need to use much more fuel to rectify them. Another note: accelerating or decelerating on one apsis affects the other, not itself. What this means is that if you accelerate at the Apoapsis your Periapsis will grow, and vice versa. If the two apses are above 65km (you can see this by mousing over the \\\u0027Ap\\\u0027 and \\\u0027Pe\\\u0027 icons in map mode), you can cut the engines. Congratulations, you\\\u0027re in orbit! You can now use the extra fuel to adjust your orbit to be perfect, or burn the rest of it retrograde in order to return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now that you know how to maneuver in space to anywhere you wish, it is time to head for the Mun. The difficult part is timing the TMI, or Trans-Munar Injection, which is basically an extremely elliptical orbit that brings you to the Mun. If you are orbiting at 90\u00C2\u00B0, you should burn prograde when the Mun rises, and if the other way (270\u00C2\u00B0), when it sets. Go into map mode and stop the burn when the Apogee reaches 11,000,000 km (the distance from Kerbin to the Mun). Now cut the SAS and accelerate the time, or watch the rocket for a very, very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E long time, until you finally reach the Mun. In either direction you choose, you will notice a sudden change - if you\\\u0027re in map mode, your orbit path will change and become a check-mark shape around the Mun, and if you\\\u0027re on the HUD, your altitude will suddenly start going down instead of up. All of these are signs that you have entered the Mun\\\u0027s SOI, or Sphere of Influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain this is a simplification of reality. In KSP, the rocket is only attracted by one celestial body at a time, when actually, you are almost always affected by two or more - it\\\u0027s even possible to sit at the exact line where two SOI\\\u0027s meet, called a Lagrange Point!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must now secure your orbit around the Mun. If you didn\\\u0027t hit it perfectly so that you\\\u0027re in one automatically, you will have to burn retrograde until you are. Do not orbit below 3km - you will smash into a mountain!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-30T21:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst page -- I uploaded a Word Document of the first half xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sporemodding.com/stuff/Basic%20Flight%20Manual%20For%20Landing%20on%20the%20Mun.docx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sporemodding.com/stuff/Basic%20Flight%20Manual%20For%20Landing%20on%20the%20Mun.docx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just did it that way because the formatting was rather similar to the PDF and I could keep track of where I was up to a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you\\\u0027ve done a slightly better job in some parts, and I\\\u0027ve done slightly better in others, by the looks of it.
