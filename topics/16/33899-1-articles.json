While I am not flying the mission at the absolute best possible time, Protractor is giving me an estimate of about 1.6 km/s, but placing my nodes in the correct place, I\u0027ve not managed to get an encounter with anything less than ~2 km/s (and my lander-carriers only have 2.25 km/s of delta-v, so there\u0027s really not a lot of margin for error).
