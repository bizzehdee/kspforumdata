Usually, loss of control over a probe is due to loss of power. My guess is that you didn\u0027t extend your solar panels? You can verify whether or not you have power on the resources menu on the upper right hand corner of the screen. You could also lose control if you\u0027re time warping and didn\u0027t realize it (control is disabled during time warp).

Most of the probe cores have a tiny little one built in -- it will indeed take a very long time to turn a big probe using just that (but it can be done). If you want your probes to turn faster, then add more/bigger reaction wheels when you build them. But your issue is not the same as the one that was posted above. You have a little bit of control, and they had none at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
