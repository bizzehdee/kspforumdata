When I try to apply forward movement on the wheels, it always wants to use torque and flip as well. Precision controls help a little bit, but eventually they don\u0027t become precise when you hold down a key for too long and the thing wants to flip again. I did try using docking mode for translation movement, but that\u0027s no different from staging mode. As far as I know there is nothing that can apply torque (2 command seats). This happened before with my other rover but this one is the same as another one I tried which did NOT flip at all. The only difference is that now I\u0027m using the treaded wheels rather than the tires.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"abihoooo","CreatedById":57415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T22:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsually I turn off the motors on the front wheels and lock the steering on the rear wheels on my rovers.
