In my experience, it takes something like 5000- 5300 m/s of delta V to de-orbit, land, and re-orbit. You\u0027ll probably want to give yourself a safety margin and have at least 5600 m/s delta V. Also, make sure that the TWR isn\u0027t too low. I think my initial starting TWR (on Kerbin) for my landers/rocket rovers was about 1.4, peaking at a TWR of like 6 or 7 or something ridiculous like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, an important thing to keep in mind is that you might want to completely leave off RCS. It\u0027s a lot of weight, and you don\u0027t even need it if your mothership/tug in orbit has RCS itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you want a Tylo lander with an actual lander cabin, you\u0027ll have to make it a lot bigger than if you just use the external chairs.

However, IIRC, it\u0027s possible to do all this without mods- you\u0027ll need to use high Isp, high TWR engines like the LV-T30 or LV-909, and you\u0027ll have less of a spare delta V cushion than if you used KW rocketry Vesta engines. And you\u0027ll probably almost certainly have to go without RCS on your lander, where with the KW Rocketry Vesta engine, you certainly can put a bit of RCS on your lander if you\u0027re willing to sacrifice some of your delta-V cushion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-27T19:19:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2013 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T20:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe interesting thing about Tylo is that it costs considerably more fuel to land there than it does to take off again, due to its high gravity and no atmosphere. You have to burn nearly all the way down to avoid splattering, and this is happening while your ship is still full of fuel so each unit of fuel burned produces less change in velocity. But assuming you survive the landing, getting up again is a cakewalk in comparison. Your ship is now much lighter (you probably burned about 2/3 of your fuel during the descent) so accelerates like a champ, and you can lean over and burn close to horizontally as soon as your legs leave the ground, so you have a more efficient flight path going up than you had coming down. And all you have to do is reach about 20km to be above all the mountains, after which it\u0027s just a matter of meeting up with a flying fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of this, it\u0027s actually possible to make relatively small Tylo landers and even use nuclear engines on them. You just have to start from an orbit high enough that the increasing TWR as you burn fuel has enough time to act, given that nukes have low thrust to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, this little 1-man lander (the part to the left of the docking port) can safely land starting from 200km and return to 40km, but starting any lower and it lithobrakes, and starting any higher and it burns too much fuel to reorbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o0r0hwd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o0r0hwd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T22:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TsvST7Z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TsvST7Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe descent stage probably has way to much delta V, but I don\u0027t use mechjeb for the landings and I\u0027m not a very good pilot, so I give myself loads of margin for error.

If you go higher, start lower, or have a mountain inconveniently close downrange, it costs more.
