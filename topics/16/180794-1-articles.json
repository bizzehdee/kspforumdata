Then flies to Minmus, lands on Minmus docked, returnns to orbit. Then flies back to the Mun, lander undocks, lands, redocks. Then it goes from Mun orbit by burning Mun retrograde using all the remaining fuel from lander, some fuel from orbiter, lowering the periapsis to 40.000m, aerobrakes, then lands on parachutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander itself has (when piloted correctly) enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to return from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and land on kerbin without parachutes and not burn on reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo can the expedition go to Duna and land on Ike then return to Kerbin? \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E shown ~9km/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E vac and ~7km/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E at Kerbin ASL.

So, you\u0027ll need about 3500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for Kerbin ascent, ~1000 (roughly) for Duna transfer, between 0 and 900 to circularize on Duna, between 0 and 900 to land on Duna, about 2000 to return to LDO, and around 500 to return to kerbin. Then you\u0027ll need between 0 and 1000 to circularize and between 0 and 500 to land on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, just for a Duna round trip, we\u0027re at 3500 \u002B 1000 \u002B 900\u002B900\u002B2000\u002B500\u002B1000 = 9800 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Obviously, it depends a lot on how you fly, how much you aerobrake, and how much you spend on docking maneuvers, but I did include a fair bit of margin for error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, Duna would be questionable. You probably would make it down to Duna, but you might get lost in space on the way home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIke on the other hand is another matter. Instead of 2900 for a down-and-up on Ike you need closer to about 600 or 800 I think. So if you skip Duna and just do flags and footprints on Ike you should have plenty of delta-V left over.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy advice is to try adding a top-most stage with a heat shield, and find out whether the heat shield (with half ablator) costs you at least 900 delta-V. If it does, don\u0027t bring it and do a powered circularization on your Kerbin return trip with only very slight aerobraking. If it doesn\u0027t cost at least 900 delta-V, you should bring a heat shield and use aerobraking to capture on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gapone","CreatedById":193365,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-23T05:40:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
