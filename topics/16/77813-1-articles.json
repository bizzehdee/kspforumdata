My intention is to use the parts that look like a block with a docking port on each side to facilitate this. My questions are as follows. 1. does each face of the block need to have a docking port added for it to work as such? 2. Can you mount this block to a rocket using a stack separator, then once it\u0027s at the rendevous point, dock the assembly tug to it, then blow the separator to release it from the rocket, and still have all 6 sides usable? 3. Also how strong would such an arrangement be without using the available mods to increase docking port connection strength (intended design will be a X shape with equal amts of engines at the center of the cross and at each of the arms of the cross and I\u0027m trying to find out if assembling such a ship pieces by piece would hold up under thrust/maneuvering)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-18T11:28:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2014 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruthgar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T11:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am assuming you mean the big station hub thing?
