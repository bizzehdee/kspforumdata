I figured it would be pretty useful for VTOL-maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kind of want this, so I don\u0027t have to focus on turning the camera with my mouse (or with the hat switch on my joystick), while concentrating on maneuvering in tight spaces, or do precision docking with stuff on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T15:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t that the \u0022chase\u0022 camera?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andruszkow","CreatedById":104911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T15:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the chase camera is, that it rolls as well.

With VTOL\u0027s, you sometimes fly backwards, or your velocity vector at least changes a lot, which makes the viewing angle jerky.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T15:50:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 03:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andruszkow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELousy reasoning :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
