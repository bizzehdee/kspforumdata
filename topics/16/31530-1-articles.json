At this point, you start to turn East(90 on your nav ball). Make the turn gradually, just \u0022tipping\u0022 your rocket to the 90 degree side. Let your prograde marker slowly slide down to the 45 degree mark(45 degrees pitch, not 45 degree heading. You still want to aim 90 degree East the while time, and slowly tip over until you are 45 degrees \u0022tipped over\u0022 to the horizon.). After your Apoapsis gets around 45-60km, let it drop the rest of the way to the horizon at keep firing at 90 until you establish the apoapsis you want(70km is the minimum to NOT hit the atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have the apoapsis you want, place a manuever node there, and drag it until it encircles the planet, and creates a Periapsis as close as possible to your current apoapsis(lets say 80km). Once you do that, a blue dot will show up on your nav ball, and to the bottom right of the nav ball, a timer will show up showing you how long you will have to burn for, and how far away it is. If you complete that burn, you will circularize your orbit. Congrats!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne note though, if the burn is, for example, 20 seconds, you want to start your burn 10 seconds early. (half the time) You do this because the manuever node assumes that you are adding all your speed(Delta v), INSTANTLY. Obviously, you cannot do this, so you must try to average out the speed you add; half before the node, and half after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as going too fast in the lower atmosphere, that is due to \u003Cem\u003Eterminal velocity\u003C/em\u003E, which is determined by the drag of your vessel and the density of the atmosphere. there are tables out there for terminal velocity of Kerbin, but I don\u0027t have them in hand(will look). As a rule of thump, you want a thrust to weight ratio of 1.7 on most of your rockets, that will usually keep you below terminal velocity.

You want to gather as much speed as you fly up to the point where the jet engines won\u0027t work anymore; take a nice, gradual climb. Then, shut off all your jets(set them to an action group), and burn rockets the rest of the way. Once you\u0027re in orbit, it helps to have a station to dock at and refuel, otherwise you\u0027ll usually only have enough gas to maybe head to the moon,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is getting the whole thing weighted and balanced properly. It has to be flyable, as well as meet the T/w ratio and d/V requirements. There are some good videos if you search youtube, but I recommend trial and error:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
