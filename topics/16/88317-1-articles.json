I am looking to expand into the cosmos for science! but I\u0027ve run into an issue with landing probes on far away planets. I can\u0027t figure out how to use the RT2 flight computer for landing, and MechJeb (My computer is terrible so the lag is nearly unplayable, it makes Mechjeb a necessity) does not seem to integrate well and does not execute commands at the correct time. So with that said can any fine Kerbonaughts give me some pointers on how not to have my expensive hardware slam into the surface of Moho at 100\u002B m/s. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T20:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech 2 and probe landings are kind of incompatible.
