The new drag model is much less soup than it used to be before. I\u0027m not sure whether I spared 6000 dV but there is definitely less challenge to it (although that might be fixed by engine nerfs). Don\u0027t take this experience as a 100% proof though, I\u0027ve never done the mission full vanilla (I use KW Rocketry).\n\nMechJeb or KER might help you to see the actual dV used - just check their respective info panels."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:30:27Z","Content":"Its still not a walk in the park. The dV requirement has dropped but that doesn\u0027t mean you can get any old craft into orbit that happens to have the minimum dV requirement. A large part of doing this successfully now is making sure you have a design streamlined for Eve\u0027s thick and deep atmosphere, along with a tailored ascent profile."},{"CreatedByName":"Anglave","CreatedById":62706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T17:50:39Z","Content":"Not to mention the selection of engines is still pretty limited. Eve ascent needs a fairly high thrust, and good atmospheric performance."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:05:11Z","Content":"The atmosphere is definitely less soupy. A probe that should have finished the descent at 3.3m/s did it at 10m/s.

In any case the drag may be less but the effect of Eve\u0027s atmosphere on the engines is brutal. At Eve sea level the Mammoth and the Aerospike lose a third of their thrust and efficiency at Eve sea level compared to vacuum, the Mainsail and the LFB have their performance halved, and other engines suffer even worse. Eve might now require less delta-V but the battle for TWR is worse than ever if you want to launch from sea level."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:05:20Z","Content":"It\u0027s easier in the sense that less delta-V is required, harder in the sense that you need to streamline the ascent vehicle and thrust is greatly reduced in the thick atmosphere. Plus it\u0027s harder to get down there in the first place now that reentry is more difficult with aero heating."}]}
