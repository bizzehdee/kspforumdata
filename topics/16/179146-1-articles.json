So by the time I reach 100m/s, I\u0027m pointed at 80\u00B0, and 70\u00B0@200m/s -- this approach yields usable results over a wide range of TWRs. Usually it leads to me crossing 30km@30\u00B0 - that breakpoint, too, seems to work well for many LVs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E you usually cannot do a full gravity turn all the way to orbit. At some point (often around 30km altitude) you stop following prograde and start doing whatever it takes in order to make orbit. More often than not, that means pitching up, or at least holding steady while the prograde marker moves downwards. Thor-Able is the notable exception: get her to 30\u00B0@30km, then point at the horizon. But most others need to keep their nose pretty high for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hydrothermalventclam","CreatedById":167200,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-23T08:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if you want, mechjeb has a launch autopilot that implements the Surveyor launch guidance algorithm.\u00A0 It pitches over to about 10 degrees shortly after launch, then holds there until prograde catches up, then follows prograde until the rocket is mostly out of the atmosphere.\u00A0 From there, the Surveyor algorithm takes over, and flies the rocket basically horizontally until it reaches orbit.\u00A0 I have had great success using this with RL-10 powered upper stages.\u00A0 When I flew a similar path manually I was also able to make orbit; however, it was not as accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think mechjeb does almost what is described on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E wiki, but with more math to hit the target orbit more accurately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
