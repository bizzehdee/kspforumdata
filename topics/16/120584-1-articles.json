I usually fly it initially at about 30 degrees, lowering it slightly to stay on the prograde vector as it climbs. Once I get to 10,000 drop to 10 degrees nose up, and stay there. Speed should reach 1300 - 1400 m/s by the time you get to 21,000m or so. You will hear the engines start to tail off, and the acceleration start to slow at this point, so use action group key 1 to change to closed cycle mode and just ride the acceleration until your apo hits 85 - 90k. No need to pitch up. The apo will drop slightly while you are coasting due to losses whilst still being in the atmosphere, but once you near apo, just make sure you are pointing prograde and burn to circularise.
