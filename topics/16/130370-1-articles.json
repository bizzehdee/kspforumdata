Apparently it\u0027s 43\u00B0 ahead, but I always use this to give me the best date: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - Then build a ship that has a bit more fuel than you\u0027d need for Minmus. Not a huge amount more. Simple way of doing it is just to take your latest Minmus craft and add a drop-tank or two, or just scale up the lifter section a bit. Again, not much...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - Then start plotting a burn as if you were going to Minmus, only target Duna. Add a burn of about 1050 m/s (assuming you\u0027ve waited for the right date). You\u0027ll find that the burn takes you far off to the right, and you\u0027ll see your orbit around Kerbol appear. Slide your maneuvre node around until the solar orbit goes through Kerbin. That basically means that your Pe around the sun is at Kerbin where you are now, and your Ap should be on the other side of the sun, where Duna will be when you get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - Fine tune your escape burn until you get an encounter. It shouldn\u0027t be far off the figure that the launch window planner gives you. You might need to correct your inclination to get a hit: simply zoom out when you\u0027ve got something close to the target, add a node about halfway around and correct. It should only be a few m/s unless your LKO is very far off the equator. If AN or DN is somewhere along the trajectory, drop the correction node there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 - Burn!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6 - Once you\u0027re outside Kerbin SOI, fine-tune that midway node. Select Duna, Focus to it, and rotate so that you can interact with the node you dropped earlier. Normal and anti-normal should be obvious to you by now. What is more interesting for interplanetary corrections is the combination of radial in or out, combined with prograde or retrograde. Basically, if you make changes in pairs you can not only change your arrival angle, but also the arrival date. That means you can intercept Ike on the way in to Duna at any time along its orbit, simply by making paired changes to prograde/radial in or retrograde/radial out (i.e. with raidal in, you intersect later along Duna\u0027s path, so Duna will have got further ahead of you, but with prograde you get there faster, so you catch up more). By getting a good encounter with Ike before you get to Duna, you can reduce your capture burn. You can also aerobrake at Duna if you want. I generally don\u0027t bother because the dv needed to capture with a good Ike encounter is not very high, and I get bored drifting through the atmosphere at 1x speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T02:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort answer: you need to leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI by a specific speed, at the specific angle at the specific time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time you need is the launch window - when Kerbin and the target planet is alligned so that you need the least dV to get there. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is an excellent tool\u003C/a\u003E to find your window.

Think of the start of a normal Mun mission, except with the sun where Kerbin normally is, Kerbin where your ship normally is, and Duna where the Mun normally is. Imagine that Kerbin is a huge ship, and you\u0027re piloting it.\u00A0If you wanted to burn to make Kerbin intercept Duna, you\u0027d need two things, the right time to do it, and the right amount to burn; these are the things the calculators give you.
