go\u00A0by the information in the bug report:\u00A0\u00A0it appears that you have three\u00A0choices for workarounds.\u00A0 First, you can eliminate the mass disparity between the vehicles, which might necessitate inert ballast on one of them.\u00A0 Second, you can redesign to eliminate robotic parts, since the problem appears to be isolated to designs with those parts.\u00A0 Third, you can redesign so that you can dock while your wheels are retracted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t like number one because it both complicates design and is tailored to exactly one situation in which you would use the rover, thus requiring a custom solution for every mass combination.\u00A0 That said, you could make it work by keeping\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E as a separate module and using\u00A0the rover to haul both ore and propellant.\u00A0 You\u0027d need to have a\u00A0balanced\u00A0transfer shuttle too, though, so it\u0027s a bit more complicated than just balancing the converter/power-plant against the mobile-drill/tanker, but provided that a drill rover with a full tank of ore masses\u00A0the same as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E plant, then the finished propellant will have the same mass as the ore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think you\u0027d like number two, since it puts you back in the position of needing to get\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the same height and orientation, as you put it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my part, I would choose number three and have the rover able to lower itself onto skids or a stationary cradle in preparation for docking.\u00A0\u00A0These can be incorporated into the rover\u0027s underbelly and made a part of the docking process.\u00A0 You may lose some utility as you\u0027re more likely to beach your rover when going over ridges and other rough terrain, so you\u0027ll need to consider it carefully, but you can justify it as having the rover assume a needful bracing position prior to a major mass transfer as would occur in offloading a tank full of ore or some such.\u00A0 If real cargo haulers need to \u0027block\u0027 their wheels,\u00A0as it were,\u00A0before moving mass around, then it\u0027s no loss for you to do the

However, *AT THE MOMENT* you undock, the interaction of forces between two vessels is *immediately* calculated and, given that wheels and landing gear have springs/dampers that store energy/force, Newton rather accurately predicted that your lighter \u0027m\u0027 will succumb to your accumulated \u0027F\u0027 with a significant \u0027a\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution is to prevent those forces from accumulating in the vertical plane (the plane through which gravity acts - and increases with load/mass) which is easily achieved with horizontally mounting docking ports.
