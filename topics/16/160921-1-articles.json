You see the probe/satellite as your one vehicle to complete this contract, but the game doesn\u0027t know that...it thinks that it is just some random attempt at a better comm network(even if it\u0027s on board parts completely satisfy the contract)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the second contract just came about in the same way it usually comes about: there was a craft with some fuel on board in orbit, and this contract wants an adjustment. If you complete the adjustment first, you will get the money for the adjustment contract. The \u0022place satellite\u0022 contract will remain, waiting to be finished.
