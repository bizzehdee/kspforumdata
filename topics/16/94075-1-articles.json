Launch on a trajectory that crosses the target orbit at its PE, but is rotated maybe 10 degrees relative to kerbin\u0027s axis. So I would wait for KSC to be 10 degrees past the orbit before launching and then shoot for a heading around 73 degrees from east (say to the northeast for the sake of my example). I would tweak the trajectory in map view during the launch so that my AN would line up with the target PE and circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. At the point where I cross the target orbit (AN), I would burn prograde until my orbit crosses the target orbit near its AP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now I should have an orbit that has its AN close to the target PE, and its DN near the target AP, but with an inclination difference of 10 degrees or so. At DN, my speed is very low, probably under 50 m/s or less, so I can make the 10 degree inclination change for very little DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make a couple final tweaks radially and pro/retro to match the orbit more closely and voila!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would only make sense only for highly eccentric or high altitude orbits. Point is that a 1 degree inclination change in a circular LKO takes more fuel than a 10 degree inclination change at the AP of a highly eccentric orbit, but it\u0027s easier to match the AN to the target PE with a slight inclination difference at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T06:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that the tiny weight of a minimal satellite makes \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV very cheap.
