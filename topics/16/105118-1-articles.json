If you go with propellant mass in total (LF\u002BO), only the Mk3 LF tanks have mass ratios as good as the LFO tanks currently. Having to tweak out oxidizer means poorer mass ratios, which to some degree negates the LV-Ns high Isp.\n\nI\u0027m really hoping we get at least one 2.5m LF tank at some point, that\u0027s the only size that seems neglected."},{"CreatedByName":"Rastaman","CreatedById":34602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T10:32:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How do you figure that Rastaman?

So you need more tank volume, and more tank structural mass. It\u0027s pretty cool actually, since LH2 density is only a 16th of that of LOX in real life (rho\\_LH2 = 71 kg/m^3 ; rho\\_LOX = 1141 kg/m^3, Source: Wikipedia).\n\nSo nuke tankage should be much larger, but not more massive. The mass ratio in normal fuel tanks should be 1/8, not 0.9/1.1.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T10:53:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rastaman**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T11:07:35Z","Content":"Oh well, if we have to remove Ox and still use LFO tanks that\u0027d be ridiculous.
