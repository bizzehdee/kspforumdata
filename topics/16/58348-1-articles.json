However, I\u0027m having some trouble making things to assemble the modules. I\u0027ve been unable to build a \u0022sled\u0022 type rover that its under my bases safely. Also they\u0027re rather wibbly-wobbly. I\u0027ve also tried 1 rover on each of the end docking ports. This isn\u0027t working either. While I can move the modules (with much fuss) I can\u0027t dock them with each other becasue I need both rovers on the end to do anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I\u0027m looking for some suggestions/examples for base assembly. With one caveat: the method of assembly should really be smaller than the base.

Just put a counterweight on the other end of the rover. This has two requirements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - the rover has to be significantly more heavy than every base module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - the base modules have to be light enough to \u0027hang\u0027 from one end without touching the ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you use mods (I think I see a KAS winch there) you can get a lot more creative. Some tips what you can do with KAS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - use hooks to anchor the carrier to the ground (so it doesn\u0027t tip over etc.) while un-/loading modules (maybe combine with robotics)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - use EVA struts to secure a loaded module\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T13:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETest it out at Kerbin 1st.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
