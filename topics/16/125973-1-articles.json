There is no \u0022story mode\u0022 as such. Career mode lets you play with missions to earn money and science, but there is no linear, overarching story going on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt may not look like it at the beginning, because your reach into space is limited, and you get very specific missions in small steps... but in truth, the largest part of contracts in KSP are procedurally generated based on your current gameplay progress. You do not get a contract to land on the Mun because it was a storyline, but rather because the game generates you one based on the simple fact that you have never landed there before. After you land there, the game then remembers this and no longer generates you contracts to land on the Mun for the first time (but it may still generate contracts to do stuff on the surface of the Mun, since it knows you are capable of getting there).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis also means that you can skip ahead - like, you can land on the Mun without having a contract for it. The game remembers that you can land there, and simply starts generating more advanced contracts instead. The same goes for sending a spacecraft out of Kerbin\u0026#39;s sphere of influence into solar orbit. Then the game will consider you an experienced player and generate you missions to do stuff in solar orbit instead. Which includes missions to visit other planets. In such a case you will never see a \u0022land on the Mun\u0022 contract at all. By going into solar orbit, you showed the game that you are interested in grander things. ;)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s perhaps not a 100% flawless system, since in rare cases a new player will accidentally fling themselves out into solar orbit by mistake... but then again, the game needs [I]some[/I] way of tracking your progress, and the ability to dynamically challenge even experienced players who want to choose their own path rather than grind through the same set of basic missions every new savegame.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T12:51:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T13:59:31Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Streetwind\u0027]This also means that you can skip ahead - like, you can land on the Mun without having a contract for it.

In fact, they\u0026#39;ve been greatly extended, which is great. However, 1.0.5 made a change so that they\u0026#39;re now automatic (which is good) and somewhat hidden (which IMHO is bad; for one thing, it leads people to not realize that they\u0026#39;re there or how cool they are).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt used to be that World Firsts were handled through the contracts UI, so they were fairly visible-- you could really see them and see \u0022what comes next.\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat Squad has done now is to move them out of the contracts window entirely. Instead, they are automatically granted to you every time you get a new achievement. And Squad has greatly extended the list of new World Firsts, so there\u0026#39;s actually a lot [I][U]more[/U][/I] of a \u0022story\u0022 than there was before. First time in Kerbin orbit? First time to dock two ships in orbit? First Mun flyby? First Mun landing? First return from the Mun? First Duna flyby? And so forth. Basically, for just about every new thing you can accomplish, there\u0026#39;s a corresponding World First achievement that rewards you with science, reputation, and (crucially, in the early game) cash.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s a great idea, and long overdue. I\u0026#39;m glad that Squad did this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, there are a couple of warts in the execution, which leads to some player confusion and (in your case) disappointment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first problem is that the achievements are rather hidden now. So well hidden, in fact, that often you don\u0026#39;t see that you\u0026#39;ve done it and aren\u0026#39;t aware that it\u0026#39;s happening, thus your confusion. It [I][U]is[/U][/I] possible to find, but it\u0026#39;s so inconspicuous that lots of people don\u0026#39;t even discover that it\u0026#39;s there. Go to the \u0022completed contracts messages\u0022 display that\u0026#39;s been in KSP since 0.24: that stack of green buttons up in the top right corner of the display. You know, the one that\u0026#39;s just useless clutter that you never bother to look at, unless you go and clear the messages out once in a while. It now has a new, bright-blue button at the bottom of the list, with a globe icon on it. (You may have to scroll down the list of green buttons for the blue one to become visible.) Click on that, and you get a pop-up dialog that lists all your accomplished World Firsts going back to the start of your career. [I][U]Be very careful not to delete it[/U][/I] (for example, the \u0022delete\u0022 button is right next to the \u0022dismiss from the screen\u0022 button), since if you delete it, there\u0026#39;s no way to get it back and the only way to look at your accomplished World Firsts after that is to go open up your save in a text editor.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAside from the fact that they\u0026#39;re too inconspicuous (and easy to inadvertently and permanently delete), the other problem is that they\u0026#39;re no longer browsable in advance. There\u0026#39;s no way for you to go and look at \u0022what [I][U]could[/U][/I] I do next\u0022 as a way of driving storyline. I think that\u0026#39;s the thing that\u0026#39;s bugging you here. That doesn\u0026#39;t actually bug me that much, personally, because Squad has done such a good job of adding achievements for practically everything that I just take it on faith that \u0022if I go somewhere new, I\u0026#39;ll get kudos and rewards for it\u0022. However, I can totally see that this could be a bigger deal for someone else.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe good news, I think, is that these problems with World Firsts represent [I][U]missing[/U][/I] features rather than actually [I]wrong[/I] ones. I think Squad is taking the game in a good direction, it\u0026#39;s just that the current implementation of World Firsts is basically just 1.0 of the new design and they need time to iterate on it. They have a pretty good track record in the past of coming back to features that are initially very sketchily implemented, and fleshing them out later. So give them some time and I expect they\u0026#39;ll improve it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally, the best idea I\u0026#39;ve heard here came up on a thread in the \u0022suggestions\u0022 forum. Someone suggested adding a World Firsts tab to the \u0022Archive\u0022 UI on the science R\u0026D facility. You can go there now to browse all the various places you\u0026#39;ve been, biomes, science you\u0026#39;ve gathered from various situations, etc. Put the World Firsts there. It\u0026#39;s a natural fit with the UI, and those are really more of a sciency thing than a contracty thing anyway. That could make them much easier to look at in useful ways, and if done right you could make the UI able to browse \u0022what haven\u0026#39;t I done yet?\u0022 types of contracts easily, to give you back your \u0022story mode.\u0022\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T16:18:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wreckreation","CreatedById":114933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T20:02:50Z","Content":"\nCheck out the Final Frontier mod.

There is a strict order per planet for which objectives are presented, but of course if you visit the planet, this order changes.
