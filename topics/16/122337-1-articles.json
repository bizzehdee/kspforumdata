Well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There are 2 kinds of drag in KSP; induced drag and parasitic drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Induced drag is a by-product of creating lift. Parasitic drag is the result of pushing a mass through the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It so happens in KSP that wings only produce induced drag while everything else produces parasitic drag. It also happens that induced drag is *much* lower than parasitic drag in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Using wings to create your lift instead of structural panels, body lift, or raw thrust means that you will create dramatically reduced drag during the launch. This means less DV wasted to drag and cosine losses, which means less DV required to achieve orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T02:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFlat wings create lift in principle, that\u0027s how paper airplanes fly IRL.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe means \u0022flat surfaces at 0 AoA produce no lift\u0022, I suspect.
