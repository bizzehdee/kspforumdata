But in stock, when you are doing a rendezvous, the ship you are rendezvousing with is either above and ahead of you, or it is below and behind you. If you just look at the orbits in map view, you can tell which quadrant to look in. And generally the orbits are coplanar, which means that it\u0027s quite a narrow stripe in that quadrant that you have to look in. Once you get that, it really narrows it down a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I figured that out, I admit that when I went on EVA and was trying to get to another ship, I\u0027d be looking around frantically for the little [ ] around the other ship.
