However, if I try to get science during the flyby, although I\u0027m in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the Mun, I get the science from Kerbin upper space, which doesn\u0027t fulfil the contract. I guess it\u0027s because I\u0027m, in fact, still orbiting Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, does anyone know if I need to get into an orbit around the Mun to get this contract fulfilled, although it says only flyby, not orbit? Or do I need to get closer to the Mun during the flyby, in which case, how close the flyby needs to be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMarconi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-25T21:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, something is wrong.
