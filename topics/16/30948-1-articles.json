I\u0027m just wondering how they work? I put them on a large rover nut turning mechanics with these wheels are kinda weird. Sometimes when I want to turn the whole vehicle just sort of rotates in the direction without the wheels actually turning, and sometimes they just don\u0027t work and I can only go straight. How do you use these properly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T17:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are a bit weird aren\u0027t they?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are supposed to operate like a tanks tracks, and one side should decelerate to allow you to turn, they don\u0027t actually steer like the other wheels do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can help to tap the brake key while trying to turn \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T21:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a warning I found out the hard way - this also means that when the wheels start going too fast you lose ALL ability to steer with this type of wheel. The reason is that at high speed you lose the ability to control the wheel speeds and you\u0027re just coasting, and when you\u0027re just coasting, the steering doesn\u0027t work because it\u0027s based on differential motoring, not on turning the wheels. With this type of wheel, if you ever overspeed that\u0027s it - you\u0027re dead and its unrecoverable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberick","CreatedById":65954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T15:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built a whole rover with those wheels and sent it to Duna. . . and the bloody thing got such bad traction that it couldn\u0027t turn hardly at \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E.
