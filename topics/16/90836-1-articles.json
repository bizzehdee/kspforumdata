One of the reasons I originally stopped playing is because I got bored of the sandbox mode -- I like a challenge list or progression to drive me forward. After some initial searching, it looks like there are two different ways to do this, the Campaign or the Career mode, with Career being the newest. Does Career make the Campaign obsolete or are these just two different ways of doing things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I was considering using some of the mods such as RSS and DR, but trying to do some of the early campaigns with those mods (and being a rookie as well) proved to be very difficult, so I uninstalled them and went back to stock, only adding mods that added new equipment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, will I run into the same problem with career mode and mods?

There are 2 modes of play though (other than sandbox), Career and Science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer has contracts you can take to earn money, parts cost money (when you go to launch), researching parts science and money as an initial buy in. In Science mode, once you finish the tech tree the game is basically Sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience mode, you only collect science for researching new parts, but after that everything is free. The reason science mode exists is so people could still play the way they had been in past versions (since science was implemented long before currency) but Career mode is a \u0022complete picture\u0022 sort of thing and contains both Science AND Currency. Yes, you could say that Career obsoletes Science mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can complete* a career in stock pretty easily, I suggest doing that before exploring mods so you get a feel for it (even FAR which I would never play without now). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*By complete, I mean finish off the entire tech tree, the game never actually ends and in Career mode you still have to keep earning money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T20:14:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T20:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe advantages of Career/science modes are i) that they initially only provide a very few parts, so there isn\u0027t any confusion about which engine, etc. to use, ii) you have to get science points to unlock new parts and, in career mode, fulfill contracts for money to pay for everything.
