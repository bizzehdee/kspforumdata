We have two computers (and I\\\u0027m on the second one), so I downloaded the ship again. I moved the engine to stage 4 and saved it. I launched it and then after no boom today (boom tomorrow, there is always a boom tomorrow), I went back to the VAB. The engine was still in stage 4 where I had put it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a similar problem with my Saturn I ship. The Munar Lander at the top has three radial decouplers on the Fuel Tank Landing Legs. (I wish I could find the youtube video where this lander design was built. But I spent too many hours that day wandering around KSP vids, that I can\\\u0027t find my way back.) The VAB techs keep wanting to put those three decouplers with the ML engine in stage 4 whenever I modify the ship. So whenever I go to the VAB to launch the Saturn I, I check the decoupler placement before I launch. I have the demo version, so I do not know if this was fixed in later versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s.
