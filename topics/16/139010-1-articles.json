From my limited experimentation, spring strength increases the height your wheels rest on the suspension the farther the bar is to the right. Damper stiffens the suspension traverse when you move it to the LEFT, with the unfortunate side-effect that the far-right setting seems to violently attempt to restore to the default height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T05:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nspringRatio increases the mass the wheel can support. damperRatio counters bounciness from spring decompressing.
