I can run at higher texture settings now, but large-part-count ships still slow my gameplay to a crawl. My RAM is well over the 32-bit limit, so that leaves one option: central processing must be the limiting factor for large-part-count ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the suggestions forum and 0.23 features posts I\u0027ve seen many players posting asking if multi-threading will be introduced/improved, but no hint at whether it will be. Most modern computers have multiple processors and many GPUs have physics calculation optimization, so I sincerely hope that multi-threading support is added/enhanced (I don\u0027t know exactly how the game handles things now but if it\u0027s there it\u0027s not doing enough). Hopefully things are improved in 0.23 because the game running slowly really takes away a lot of the fun...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"700NitroXpress","CreatedById":90322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T01:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe maximum part ship that I ever launched was around 2500 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.0ghz processor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32gb of RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVGA GTX 690 graphics card\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sibrit","CreatedById":79841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T01:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe CPU is handling all the physics calculations for the \u0022focused\u0022 vehicle, and I doubt the component models are complex enough to use up a tonne of memory, so processor speed is the biggest factor in determining gameplay rate.
