From what orbit? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe usual advice for a pod returning from low Kerbin orbit is to set a periapsis of about 30km. You need the velocity to drop to around 250-260m/s before it\u0026#39;s safe to pop the chutes. The early game is quite dangerous because it can be hard to get things to slow down. It\u0026#39;s been reported that a mk1 pod with a heatshield is too heavy and aerodynamic to slow down effectively unless you reduce the amount of ablator during ship design. My current design carries about 30 instead of 200.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdrevik","CreatedById":114231,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T23:19:03Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027hsnmck\u0027]Hello,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m new to KSP and still trying to learn it.

Dropping from Kerbin orbit is relatively slow, coming from Mun is faster, transferring from Jool or Moho is hella-fast. The faster you are, the harder it is.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst: get AIRBRAKES. Put four of them on your capsule.

And turn ON the airbrakes. Put lots of external things in equipment bays so they don\u0026#39;t explode, or on top of the capsule.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEngine systems make pretty good heat shields, too. Make sure you ship is pointing retrograde as you enter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0026#39;re coming in fast, dip down to between 40K and 50K, and if you get it right you\u0026#39;ll slow down enough to orbit ,and you can make multiple passes to eventually slow down to get captured for full re-entry.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut coming back from other planets, leave yourself plenty of delta-V to slow down before you hit Kerbin atmosphere. Otherwise- boom.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hsnmck","CreatedById":153907,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T23:50:02Z","Content":"\nThank you guys, your suggestions helped.

For Kerbin it seems to be around 30 km. Never put your periapsis lower than that if you are re-entering. If you are returning from orbit around Kerbin, you should stick to 30 km to 40 km. Exact safe altitude depends on your starting velocity upon re-entering. Getting back from interplanetary flight seems far more trickier and you should mostly find the value empirically. For most part it\u0026#39;s not worth it to put it higher than 50 km, but it\u0026#39;s too dangerous to put it at \u0026lt;40 km.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen re-entering, take a look at your craft and answer a question: \u0022Does my craft have any heat-sensitive equipment which may get into the air flow?\u0022. If so than re-enter pointing nose forward, otherwise try to induce as much drag as possible by exposing more of your craft. If you have a heat shield, you should _always_ make sure it gets in the flow the most. Heat shields are very heavy and you should shrug off some of ablator since you won\u0026#39;t need it anyway. Depending on your re-entering profile you might need up to 200 ablator for 3.5 m heat shield. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd you can open with right click parachute\u0026#39;s menu which will state if it\u0026#39;s safe to deploy it now. Unsafe will get your parachute destroyed immediately, risky might do that, safe will never lead to that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[QUOTE]First: get AIRBRAKES. Put four of them on your capsule.

about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E height are technically correct, but may not be overly helpful for a brand new player.\u00A0 Obviously, someone who doesn\u0027t even know how to reenter safely yet is NOT coming back from an interplanetary mission and it\u0027s entirely likely that haven\u0027t even reached a full orbit yet, so in that case they won\u0027t have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 If this is a suborbital flight that we are talking about here, then there are 3 important things to consider for reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 Keep the mass of your reentry stage as low as possible.\u00A0 The more massive it is, the harder it will be to slow down in time.\u00A0 Early on, you\u0027ll probably want to only bring back the command pod, parachutes, heat shield, and whatever science instruments you can(be careful with the science jr. if you\u0027re trying to return that.)\u00A0 You should definitely drop all your engines and fuel tanks before reentry.\u00A0 And make sure you have enough parachutes for whatever craft you are using.\u00A0 I normally find 2 radial mounted chutes will be much better than 1 regular mk16 and will probably be enough for most of my designs(more will be needed if I\u0027m using something like the 2.5m command pod).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0 Even if you\u0027re just going suborbital and don\u0027t have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E, it is still important to come in at a shallow angle.\u00A0 Don\u0027t just go straight up and try to come straight back down again.\u00A0 You should be trying to follow a similar ascent path to what you would use if you were going for a full orbital flight.\u00A0 Going more horizontal during the descent means more air to slow you down(also means more time for your ship to be exposed to reentry heating, so at SOME point this becomes a balancing act, but especially if you have a heatshield, this won\u0027t be an issue yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0 Make sure you keep the blunt end of your craft pointing forwards.\u00A0 Again, you need the air to slow you down as much as possible.\u00A0 If the top of your command pod is pointing forward, it won\u0027t slow down nearly enough.\u00A0 Also, keep this in mind when designing your reentry stage in the first place.\u00A0 Try to keep the center of mass of this stage as low as possible, close to the heat shield.\u00A0 This is where the science jr. can be a bit of a risk since having it in between the pod and shield might make things less stable.\u00A0 If your reentry stage is properly balanced, once you start reentry, you can usually turn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off altogether and just aerodynamics alone will keep it pointing the right way.\u00A0 Also, if you do lose control of your ship and can\u0027t keep it pointing retrograde, the next best option is usually to keep it spinning/tumbling as fast as possible(might not be much fun for the poor kerbals trapped inside, but better than blowing up).\u00A0 You lose the protection of the heatshield this way, but it will at least mean that it\u0027s constantly exposing different parts to the heat instead of keeping the same one there long enough to explode.\u00A0 Obviously if you\u0027re going fast enough, this won\u0027t help much though.\u00A0 Again, the one thing you usually DON\u0027T want is for your craft to end up pointing prograde and getting stuck there since even if you survive the reentry heat, you probably won\u0027t slow down quickly enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, the parachute turning red doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s broken or anything.\u00A0 It just means it\u0027s not safe to deploy it at that moment.\u00A0 Once you\u0027ve slowed down enough to safely use it, it will change back, so watch it closely.\u00A0 If you still can\u0027t slow down enough in time, that\u0027s when drogue chutes might be useful, but you probably won\u0027t need those for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-28T15:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

Keep the reentry vehicle simple (pod, partial heatshield and chutes). You should test them and rate them (in m/s at 30/35km). Only Moho is dangerous to return from and you should prepare for slowdown before reentry. Even though a full heat shield is never useful. Direct reentry is always an option except for complex ships like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT : stupid me, I didn\u0027t saw this was an outdated question, sorry.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-28T15:08:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2016 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdrevik","CreatedById":114231,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T15:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, re-entry is a lot more deadly. \u00A0 You pretty much have to enter an orbit and lower the orbit before trying to re-enter. \u00A0 I lost a lot of ships after the change by not having enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E left to orbit Kerbin, and they just go sailing past... although it\u0027s fun to try to quickly build / launch, and rendezvous \u00A0a refueling vehicle from Kerbin as they fly by Kerbin so they can have more fuel for the next pass. \u00A0 That\u0027s a rendezvous that MechJeb won\u0027t help you with very much, you really have to use a combination of math, eyeballing, and F9 to launch at the right time, match angles, and match speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Targetedmissle","CreatedById":204637,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-11T18:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone help me do this but from jool, i need help getting back to kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-11T22:49:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223801195\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126107\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591901441\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204637\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Targetedmissle\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Targetedmissle said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone help me do this but from jool, i need help getting back to kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have the large inflatable heat shield?
