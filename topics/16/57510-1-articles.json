(i.e your experiment) then right click the experiment and you should get an option that says Take Data. At this point your kerbal will take the data (Assuming you click the button) and carry it with him. You can then EVA him over to wherever you want to put said data (i.e your capsule or science lab) at which point you right click your destination and click store experiments like normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ethernet","CreatedById":88537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T20:27:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith EVA\u0027d Kerbals.
