But What about polar?\n\nI have a nice group of contracts right now for setting up a satellite in polar orbit, and a RT2 interplanetary relay. I think they will work good together.\n\nThe orbit I am asked to get is a roughly circular, roughly Mun sized orbit (12M by 7M), and is polar.\n\nI have two main questions:\n\n1) I am not sure how long a mun/minmus eclipse would last.\n\n2) Right now the orbit looks like it would never be eclipsed by Kebin. But I suppose relative to the sun the orbit will rotate around and eventually be getting eclipses? And these will be really long as I am quite far out. So the only solution is a highly eccentric orbit? Where I am high over one pole and very low over another? Do I just not even worry about battery power then, as it going to be out of position for most of the solar system then anyways?\n\nLowing my P in a high orbit should be easy, I am imagining, as I am already traveling slow relative to a smaller orbit, so less V to negate.\n\nIs it possible for an orbit to be so eccentric that while your P is above 73K, the sides of the orbit are actually closer to the planet? An orbit that is 12 million KM wide and less than 140K tall? I never thought of ever entering the atmosphere with both a P and A above it, but it should technicality be possible.\n\n![10662172_10153327356644242_8083032103714976404_o.jpg](https://scontent-lga1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/t31.0-8/10662172_10153327356644242_8083032103714976404_o.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T15:52:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:10:21Z","Content":"I don\u0027t believe the darkness time in a polar orbit would be any different from an equatorial one?

Due to KSP\u0027s patched conics approximation, your orbit will never get disturbed and your distance to Kerbin will remain quite constant.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T15:47:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarvinKitFox**"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:55:00Z","Content":"Great information."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T16:03:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is it possible for an orbit to be so eccentric that while your P is above 73K, the sides of the orbit are actually closer to the planet?

I never thought of ever entering the atmosphere with both a P and A above it, but it should technicality be possible.\n\nNo it is not possible, the center of the planet is always a focus of the elipse of your orbit, the periapsis is the point on the orbit closest to that focal point. Since in KSP the planets and the atmosphere are spherical, if your periapsiis is out of the amosphere so will be the rest of the orbit.\n\nIf your planet and atmosphere were oblate enough it could be possible with a polar orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T19:24:17Z","Content":"\u003E\u003E1) I am not sure how long a mun/minmus eclipse would last.\n\nScrew that. In theory such eclipse [shouldn\u0027t block all the solar energy](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122398-Mun-eclipse-ummm) due to their size, so I\u0027m happy with just spamming solar panels and prepare battery just for Kerbin night time for satellites around Kerbin. Note that this should apply to satellites around Mun/Minmus but you need your orbit to be high enough to make the eclipse from Kerbin non-continuous.\n\n\u003E\u003E2) Right now the orbit looks like it would never be eclipsed by Kebin. But I suppose relative to the sun the orbit will rotate around and eventually be getting eclipses? And these will be really long as I am quite far out. So the only solution is a highly eccentric orbit? Where I am high over one pole and very low over another? Do I just not even worry about battery power then, as it going to be out of position for most of the solar system then anyways?\n\nPretty much what #3 already said. The other solution is just to have 4 of them on the same polar orbit high enough, and *not* preparing for the night time - in this case, at least one pair of opposite satellites will work regardless of the night time and then you\u0027ll have full coverage for relay. Personally I\u0027m just having 2 at the moment and probably will shoot another 2 if I have time.\n\nOf course, since the game doesn\u0027t simulate Ec change when the ship is not on focus... But it\u0027s up to you whether you want to exploit that.\n\nAnd some other suggestion. You probably don\u0027t want your relay satellite to get too high, as the long range dish antenna has a really small cone angle. Say for connection to Duna when you use 88-88 (it already has the largest angle among those that can reach Kerbin), because of the closest distance between Kerbin and Duna, if you point your Duna satellite to target Kerbin (not a specific satellite), then you need your relay satellite\u0027s Ap to be [less than 6Mm](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125218-How-close-does-Duna-get-to-Kerbin?p=2014398\u0026viewfull=1#post2014398) in order for the relay satellite to accessible from the satellite orbiting Duna. I think RT is simulating that and you\u0027ll get broken connection in those cases. Better keep that in mind.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T19:26:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FancyMouse**"},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:09:19Z","Content":"@MarvinKitFox: Now that is an interesting idea.
