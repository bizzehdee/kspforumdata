I had a very successful design I used almost religiously called the \u0022Mirage\u0022, which had two turbojets for taking off and flying horizontally on Kerbin, a single LV-T45 for space travel, and three of the little Rockomax 48-7S (or whatever) engines for vertical landings on Minmus. The idea was to come down on the greater flats without killing my horizontal velocity, drop the wheels gently onto the surface with the vertical engines (plenty powerful for the extra-low gravity), and let the wheel brakes bring me to a stop. Of course, I had overlooked the fact that brakes only work because of friction between the wheels and the surface, and because of the aforementioned extra-low gravity, there was \u003Cstrong\u003Every little friction and thusly very little braking\u003C/strong\u003E... I had to resort to using RCS to thrust backwards to slow me down, and used up almost all of my monopropellant...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you\u0027re going to build an SSTO spaceplane with VTOL capabilities, and you\u0027re planning to land it like I did without killing horizontal velocity, make sure you add front-facing engines or lots of RCS for braking!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnyway, good luck with building your vessel Chano!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T11:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on the aircraft.
