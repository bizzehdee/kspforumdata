I would play it myself and see but I\u0027m waiting on my new computer to come in and want to be able to get a first View on it. But anyways does anyone know if the antenna will relay off each other, in other words say you have a ship on Dina, and the antenna won\u0027t reach kerbin, but you have a ship in orbit around duna and then a ship in a very high orbit around kerbin (past minmus) and the a ship in orbit around kerbin. Will all these ships, give or take a few, work together to \u0022bounce\u0022 the signal to ksc. Or do the antennas just have infinite range\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T17:41:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Exal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daman453","CreatedById":52109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T01:13:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am downloading now, it seems like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T01:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it has been confirmed that you can retract them now, much to the relief of realism-style rocket builders everywhere.
