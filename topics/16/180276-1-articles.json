I clicked right on it and didnt give it a second thought until I went to build it. Got to looking at things and I suddenly realize that this orbit (around the Sun) is nearly out to Neidon. Ive only just left the Kerbin system recently in this career. I am woefully ill prepared to take this mission on. Im going to have to launch some sort of communication system thats adequate to maintain a signal first. I dont think I have opened up enough tech for that yet not to mention that I got to get that sat out there too which I also havent opened up tech for. This is going to make those manned Duna trips look like a casual visit to the Mun. Dont think Im going to make any scratch on this contract or more likely Im going to lose a good bit. Right now my heads about to explode over the logistics of it all. Probably a good time to go watch some tv and think about it a bit. Im wide open to suggestions about what it takes to put a sat that far out. Any advanced tutorials or youtube vids out there that covers such a mission? Were probably beyond tutorials on this one come to think of it.

That will increase mission time probably but it\u0027s gonna be cheaper. Since it\u0027s near Neidon, I recommend Jool or Sarnus for gravity assist.
