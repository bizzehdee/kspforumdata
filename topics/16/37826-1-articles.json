I have built an SSTO to ferry kerbals to my space station. When I initially built it, I had TT38K Radial Decouplers between the fuel tanks to create some space between the tanks. This version worked great. In redesign, to get rid of unnecessary weight, I removed the decouplers, and all of a sudden, the craft wouldn\u0027t even get off the ground! In doing some research with MechJeb 2, I discovered that the radial decouplers were adding 472 m/s of delta V, and allowing the craft to accelerate from 80 m/s at the end of the runway (wouldn\u0027t take off) to 120 m/s (would take off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are pictures with MechJeb windows visible so you can see for yourself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO without TT38 Radial Decouplers between fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know whats going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are links to the craft files, with the MechJeb2 Units remove, ie, these are stock:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/g4h6geww2e6m1a1/SSTO_Mk_VIIa.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/g4h6geww2e6m1a1/SSTO_Mk_VIIa.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/uqf4k5otl249s5b/SSTO_Mk_VII.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/uqf4k5otl249s5b/SSTO_Mk_VII.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading, I am interested to hear if anyone else has experienced this, and is there a way to get my spaceplane airborne without the decouplers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T05:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecouplers you don\u0027t intend to use mess up the delta-V display, because it assumes you\u0027re going to shed weight/attached engines even though you won\u0027t actually do so.

However I noticed straight off you barely have any control surfaces and the plane is really heavy. The fuel lines aren\u0027t properly drawn and worst of all, you\u0027re using rocket fuel tanks for jet engines. Huge waste and huge mass addition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should swap those tailfins for winglets, or add control surfaces to them. Move the rear landing gear closer to the center of mass and reduce the overall weight by swapping out those rocket fuel tanks the jets are using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there\u0027s no point to have decouplers attaching the tanks unless you intend to drop them.
