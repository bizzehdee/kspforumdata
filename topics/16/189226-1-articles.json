How exactly you do that depends on the exact performance of your plane, but as a starting point, try a 30\u00B0 ascent off of the runway, full throttle. Your speed should be climbing at a reasonable rate. If it climbs very quickly, then go steeper. If it climbs very slowly, or not at all, go flatter. Once you hit 300m/s, feel free to flatten out a little, because the sound barrier is incredibly draggy and you want to spend as little time in it as possible. Once you hit 400m/s, return to your 30\u00B0 pitch. Your ramjets should be starting to seriously get going at this point, and effortlessly maintain that pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow your speed and altitude should both be climbing at a brisk and steady pace, up until a point around 1100m/s when you notice your ramjets slowly starting to run out of breath. At that point, check your altitude. Are you above 10km? If not, your ascent was way too shallow, and you should revert and try again with a different profile. Are you above 15km? You were going too steep, flatten out immediately, or revert and try again. What you should be doing right now is eke out the most speed possible from your wings and ramjets before they\u00A0call it quits, so from here on out, stay reasonably flat at around 15-16km and just accelerate.

But get that nose up, or you\u0027ll experience exactly what you described and not make orbit. The exact pitch you need depends again on your plane\u0027s performance, but 45\u00B0 should be a decent start. The goal is to find a pitch setting that will push your apoapsis just high enough that you\u0027ll be able to insert into orbit on rocket power before reaching it.
