You could release your craft, burn to desired AP and once it is above 25km, it will follow the physics rails. Before it is 25km away from the launching craft, you\u0027d need to switch back and land / recover before the spacecraft reaches AP. A bit brutal but do-able.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/78226-12-stagerecovery-recover-funds-from-dropped-stages-v165-102016/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever tried it, but it sounds pretty nice.

I found a happy medium: I get my plane to 60,000m, decouple the rocket and cruise it to 70 with an apo of 100 or so and a peri of 50. Then I can switch to the plane and land it in time to get the rocket before it hits the atmosphere, which isn\u0027t in itself completely necessary because if not active, I\u0027ve found that objects with an orbit below 70 don\u0027t de-orbit when not focussed in any case (judging by the amount of \u0022de-orbited\u0022 debris I have cluttering my 50,000m mark...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis seems to work just fine for my small air-to-orbit launcher.
