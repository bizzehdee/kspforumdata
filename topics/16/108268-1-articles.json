The 1.0 update introduced new behavior for SAS which automatically puts it in hold when your movement or the target is likely to change rapidly. The perfect example of this is when landing on the Mun or Minmus. You\u0027d have your SAS set to retrograde, but if you accidentally overshot by 0.1 m/s your rocket would flip over to point down, then back up again as gravity caught you. Same for when you land and aren\u0027t moving - weird things happen there.\n\nBecause your relative speed to your target is almost 0 it\u0027s flipping off, but you appear to be hugging the line between on and off. If you get it up to 0.3 or something I bet it\u0027ll stop. Honestly, I\u0027m surprised you even had the option - I didn\u0027t think it\u0027d give it to you at 0.1 m/s. Maybe because the ships are large?"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:27:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t gotten any pilots to where they\u0027re experienced enough to use target tracking, but could it be because your relative velocity is too low?

Relative velocity to your target describes the change in position relative to your target. So a rel. velocity of 0 means that you are not moving at all resulting in the exact opposit of \u0022flipping off\u0022. For prograde, retrograde as well as the maneuver marker that is true, for target and anti-target, however, it is not.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I thought about it a little more, and do you think its distance based ...\n\nI can also confirm that it is not distance related. As soon as you start moving faster than ~0.1 m/s the target marker becomes active, independent from the distance to your target.\n\nI assume it is just a bug since the deactivation of the target marker makes no sense at all. While it is reasonable to deactivate pro- and retrograde when the velocity is ~0 m/s since the vectors tend to \u0022flipp off\u0022, as amorymelzer already mentioned, the target as well as anti-target vectors are perfectly stable at low relative velocities.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T22:09:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lorunification**"}]}
