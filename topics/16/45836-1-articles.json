Then when .16 came around they found that that scale was too small for the character controller to work \u0027right\u0027 on kerbals, so they did two things: Add 2 meter size parts (Rockomax) and add a default rescaleFactor of 1.25 so that 1meter parts became 1.25 meter parts. Unless otherwise specified in the config, rescaleFactor is set by default at 1.25 If you are modeling a new part, you can model to the \u0022meter\u0022 scales and just let the game automatically rescale to be the \u0022real\u0022 size.
