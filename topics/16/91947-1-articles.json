I\u0027m making quite tall rockets and i tried some things but nothing helped. At first i tried to put the center of mass as close to the engines as possible, but no effect. I\u0027ve also tried to put it as higher as possible, LOTS of RCS and SAS, but still it spins out of control as soon as i start my gravity turn, no matter how slow i make it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T18:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess the first question I have is, what do you mean by \u0022Spin\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s spinning around the roll axis (spinning like a top), there are ways to deal with that by making sure struts are well placed, maybe adding fins, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you mean it\u0027s turning, or flipping end over end, you probably have a drag problem, or center of mass problem. It would be useful to see a screenshot with all of the \u0022centers\u0022 displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center of thrust vector should point through the center of mass, but the center of mass can be either in front of, or behind it. The center of drag must be \u003Cem\u003EBEHIND\u003C/em\u003E the center of mass, or else your rocket simply won\u0027t fly straight. You\u0027ll get away with it early in the flight, before trying to turn, but as soon as you try to steer, it will lose control. This is the most likely scenario based on your description. If you\u0027re seeing this, you probably have wings or fins ahead of the center of mass. You\u0027ll need to take those off, or add bigger fins behind the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso keep in mind that your center of mass moves as fuel is consumed. Usually the CoM moves backward, as the fuel is drained from the upper-most tanks in the stage first. This can result in something being stable at first, but if the CoM and CoD are close together, it can become unstable as you consume fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a screenshot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T18:27:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want the command module and reaction wheels as close to the COM as possible.

Click on it, and a yellow and black sphere will show up right where the center of mass is. As for your spinning problem, make sure your center of thrust is inline with the center of mass. To see the center of thrust, find the button below the center of mass button. Clicking on it will toggle a purple and black sphere, appearing where the center of thrust is. Now, this is where you\u0027ll have to eyeball it and see if the arrow is inline with the center of mass. If to the side noticeably, your rocket will flip out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would show pictures, but I\u0027m at school right now and the wifi here doesn\u0027t allow imgur.
