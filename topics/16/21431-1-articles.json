More speficly, I need the height i need to be at jool in a hyperbolic trajectory to get my AP down to 1 million killometers with aerobraking. I tried at 400 km, but ovibusally, that isnt the right height \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what is the aerobraking altitude on jool to slow you from hyperbolic toAP of 10 M killometers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T03:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, the MechJeb Landing Autopilot will calculate such things.

Used Mechjeb\u0027s landing autopilot dialog thirty minutes ago to find a good aerobrake altitude on Jool for capture, and am now in the Laythe SOI feeling around for the aerobraking altitude to put me into Laythe orbit. If you aren\u0027t going deep enough into the atmosphere to force a landing, Mechjeb\u0027s Landing Autopilot will tell you roughly what your new apoapsis and periapsis will be after aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T17:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt does?
