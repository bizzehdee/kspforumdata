It weights more than 9t but gives 240kN of thrust (still it has similar TWR to stock nuclear engine). I\u0027ve also have separate lander for kerbin, but it\u0027s really simple - 2.5 probe core, hitchhiker, ladder, legs and chutes. I\u0027ve put it in-line in my nuclear rocket using two decouplers.
