So I\u0027m in search of a decent/fast/efficient way to map for kethane. I have my probe set up at most places I want to mine,with a large kethane detector.I turn it on and start to probe but only get pretty straight lines. i try pointing my scanner in different places,but i\u0027m not sure if it is doing anything effective or im just wasting rcs and time.Should i be moving my inclination around?And if so whats a good \u0022cycle\u0022? Or is that a waste of fuel/rcs and time?Any other pointers would be kickass too.I just want to learn and get better! thanks for the help ~the dude abides!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if i missed a tutorial that explains this,could i get a link to or pointed in that direction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T02:13:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 02:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dudeman1420\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded more questionz!firezeecannnons!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"That guy who builds stuff","CreatedById":58456,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T02:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best I can tell the fastest way to scan is to place the probe in a circular polar orbit at the minimum altitude you can get without hitting the atmosphere or mountains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that it\u0027s all patience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T02:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would aim for highest altitude the scanner will work at in a polar orbit 85 degrees or higher inclination, hit x50 time acceleration and go have lunch.

If you have something that rotates very slowly, like Moho or most of the smaller moons, it will take hours to cover all longitudes. I addressed this by taking a polar orbit to covering an orbit or two at a given longitude, adjusting my inclination to move east slightly near the equator, then readjusting to a polar orbit. Of course, this requires fuel and some attention (I scanned Moho while watching a movie and bumping the orbit over every few minutes). The most efficient way to \u0027bump\u0027 the polar orbit east or west would probably be to make a normal burn at 45 degrees south, then make an antinormal burn at the 45 degrees north, assuming you\u0027re traveling north in that portion of your orbit. If you decline 4 degrees, the next polar orbit would be 1 degree east, right? Damn it, I just use the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suck at orbital mechanics, however. I never fully understood why a polar orbit can\u0027t naturally rotate in the same way a body spins; why is it relative to the ground? A planet\u0027s own rotation is relative to its parent body, right? I suppose as you orbit one thing, you are also in a child orbit of its parent. Can anyone explain this to me like I\u0027m 5?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T03:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnytime you are mapping things, you want to stick it in a an 80-90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 polar orbit.
