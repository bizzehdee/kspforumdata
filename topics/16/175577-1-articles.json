Having it remote piloted and transferring a crew from another craft, in some places when right-clicking the Module it states there is no crew on board. But in other places\u00A0there is crew inside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this because the Lab is double sided or is it just a glitch in the game version.
