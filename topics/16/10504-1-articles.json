Prevents me from using the triggers as roll which is what I prefer."},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T16:29:40Z","Content":"I had initially set up the controls for a rocket meaning pitch and yaw were on the same stick but after realizing that a space plane control scheme would have pitch and roll on the same stick I settled on the later. It was a compromise that I think will allow me to switch between a space plane and a rocket without swapping controls. It wasn\\\u0027t hard getting used to yaw being on the right and in fact it may be easier overall. Now I can input any degree of yaw and pitch simultaneously without risking one input impacting the other.\n\nHere\\\u0027s what I\\\u0027ve settled on so far:\n\nLB/RB: Throttle \u002B/-\n\nLStick L/R: Roll\n\nLStick U/D: Pitch\n\nRStick L/R: Yaw\n\nRStick U/D: No function\n\nDpad U/D/L/R: Translate U/D/L/R\n\nX: SAS\n\nY: Precision control toggle\n\nA: Throttle cut-off\n\nB: RCS\n\n\u0027Back\u0027: stage activation\n\n\u0027Start\u0027: Pause\n\nI\\\u0027ve been considering using the RStick U/D as the forward and back translate but I don\\\u0027t want to risk yawing my craft accidentally while translating. For now I just use the up and down arrows for that. Also, my first ride with this scheme was a roller coaster since I forgot to increase the dead zones and decrease the sensitivity. After playing around with them based on the suggestion from Excalibur I got it to a comfortable level... still tweaking but at least my kerbanauts wont lose their lunches anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"BarryCarlyon","CreatedById":18782,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T16:57:23Z","Content":"This on windows or mac?\n\nOn mac I can\\\u0027t get KSP to read the thumbsticks, tho not tried on 0.15"},{"CreatedByName":"Mattstopher","CreatedById":18105,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T19:00:14Z","Content":"Thanks for the controls guidelines there, Absolution, that really helped out and actually managed to LAND my spaceplane as well as manage a wobbly take-off ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI can\\\u0027t seem to get KSP to register my D-Pad and trigger buttons on my 360 controller but everything else works alright, which is a shame - I wanted to assign camera control to right stick and assign yaw control to the left and right bumpers.

Any ideas on why those buttons won\\\u0027t pick up for me?\n\nAre you trying to treat the D-Pad as four buttons? KSP sees the D-Pad as two axes, so if you want to use it you\\\u0027re limited to the axial assignments only.\n\nI\\\u0027ve changed my own setup somewhat and I think it\\\u0027s optimum for spaceplanes.

It allows you to get around the buggy \\\u0027chase\\\u0027 camera in the game with easy camera controls. Yaw is still easy to get at and logical.\n\nAs I\\\u0027ve said previously, I think the key to getting the most out of any joypad/joystick/peripheral is to get your sensitivities and dead zones set to your tastes. Everyone has different opinions on the exact numbers - but once you find the ideal ones for you flying will feel natural."},{"CreatedByName":"Speider","CreatedById":25920,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-21T06:12:24Z","Content":"It\\\u0027s not a problem getting all buttons to work, just download any version of \u0027Switchblade\u0027, a program designed to let people among other things, play wow easily with an xbox 360 controller.\n\nWith the program you can map the controller so your computer recognizes the left stick as the mouse, the right trigger as left click, left trigger as space, left bumper as a modifier for a complete set of 4 buttons on A/B/X/Y and so on.

I actually use Y to toggle Map view, so I can check my orbit info while climbing out on spaceplanes without having to remove my hands from the stick.\n\nI have a fancy Saitek for IL-2, but Unity has a bug that causes a 1 second lag between input and output on Saitek products, so I pulled out the 360 pad and found it to be excellent on KSP.
