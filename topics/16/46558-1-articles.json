This is to push the center of thrust through the center of mass. I built one working space shuttle on the side of a launcher rocket. It took 2 days, working 4 hours a day, to get it to work right, but I finally got it to work. It was a nightmare. And may the lords of Kerbin help you if you try and put cargo in the cargo bay. You have to recalculate everything and adjust the thrust on the shuttle accordingly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest looking at the design of the actual space shuttle and launcher, and then look at the Russian version and you will find some tricks you can use to make your own.
