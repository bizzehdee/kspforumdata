So, if anyone is up for it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a tug powered by two 800 ISP Nukes. This tug currently has a mass of 21,255 kg with 1462 units of liquid fuel out of a possible 3200. I\u0027m about to dock back with my LKO space station. The next mission for my tug is to take a new station into orbit around the mun. I\u0027m shooting for a 75 km orbit. Now, I don\u0027t want to take anymore fuel with me than I have to, other wise, I\u0027m just wasting fuel. So I figure, 2,000 delta-v worth of fuel is a safe amount to get to the mun, drop off the station, and come back to LKO. Now the space station that the tug will be hauling has a mass of 11.3 Tons. The question is, how much liquid fuel should my tug have to have to have (English, baby!) 2,000 delta-v when it docks with the new munar space station?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T07:03:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 07:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EliasDanger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T06:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you don\u0027t use any fuel docking with the new station you\u0027ll need 1463 units of fuel onboard for the combined stack to have 2000m/s so pretty much what you\u0027ve already got in there. Of course your delta-v will go up once you drop off the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA-For how to do it, you need to know the empty mass of your ship with each unit of fuel weighing 5kg, 1462 units weighs 7.31 tonnes so your empty mass is 13.945t. Add the weight of your station to that to get a combined mass of 25.245t. Rearranging the rocket equation ,2000=9.82x800xln(mass with fuel/empty mass) your mass ratio needs to be 1.29 so 32.56t / 25.245t which is 7.32 tonnes of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T06:33:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 06:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reactordrone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded some maths\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T06:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just throwing some links in here.

What you calculate with it is the \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E of fuel, which means you need to convert into units.

One has the mass of tug and station, and the other has solely the tug\u0027s mass.

You want to get that into orbit, and you want at least 4,000 delta-v VAC to do it. You\u0027re going to use 1 mainsail and 4 skippers.
