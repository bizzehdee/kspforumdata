Particularly the fact that it shows the distance between docking ports not just between the ships COM. So is MechJeb. You don\u0027t get any autopilots early in the tech tree but you do get basic Smart A.S.S. functions that help with docking and you can easily make custom windows that show you all sorts of details about your target. (closest approach distance and relative velocity, time to closest approach, ect.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I didn\u0027t like about the tech tree is that the docking ports are all spread out. One node gets you basic and sheilded ports. If you want small ports for probes that\u0027s another node to unlock and large or inline ports is a third node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OriontheHunter","CreatedById":102380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T23:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your helps guys.
