But you mentioned it explodes when you drop the capsule, so I\u0027m thinking the flex is happening at that point, not when physics drops it. Looks like you\u0027re using a radial decoupler for the capsule, and that the capsule might go sideways into the rear wheel pod, plus the separation force causes a sideways torque on the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid this, you can try adding some launch clamps. Put clamps on the rover itself and on the capsule. Connect the capsule to the rover with one of those blue stack separators instead of a radial decoupler. The reason for using the blue separator is that its forces in both directions are about equal and so largely cancel out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch process would then be as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEVA the Kerbal from the capsule to the seat\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFire the separator between the capsule and the rover\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERelease the clamps on the rover.
