As the addiction took hold I figured I\u0027d be here eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s my first question. I\u0027m using the Stock KSP Rover and Sky-Crane design as the basis for a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn mission. I\u0027ve added a small rocket to act as a remote-controlled orbiter and what is essentially a Delta IV to get the whole payload up into space. Like so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/jason-wilson-design/9633230886/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/9633230886_28e2c9a740_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229633230886_28e2c9a740_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/jason-wilson-design/9633230886/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERSD-Issue\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/people/jason-wilson-design/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESgiobair \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u2122g\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the trial flight everything was going well until I separated the orbiter package. Because the Probododyne OCTO was the first control pod on the build all of the guidance vectors were set to its orientation, in other words, the drive rocket on the payload was facing the wrong way. It was manageable for the simple orbital maneuvers I needed to accomplish but it was something I wanted to fix. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the variant you see here I flipped the whole payload upside down. My thought was that the rocket motor would now be pushing \u0022up\u0022 from the start. However the guidance was linked to the OCTO so now I started my mission with my guidance reversed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am trying to sort out then, is how do I get control to switch from the OCTO to the Remote Control System on the Orbiter. \u0022Control from Here\u0022 doesn\u0027t seem to do it. I can\u0027t remove the OCTO and make the RCS primary without having to re-create the rover and sky-crane.
