But, as stated by the 1st law of thermodynamic, the energy cannot by created nor destroyed, it can only be transferred. So, if my ship is gaining energy, it means that something else must lose energy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat is this other thing ? The planet that gives me the GA ? Do I slow it down each time I perform one ?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI noticed that, the higher the gravity is, the more energy I can gain from a GA.
