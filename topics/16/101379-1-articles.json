Exactly which part did you attach to the ship for SAS control? As @eddiew said, not all parts that give torque also include a control system. It\u0027s just like RCS: would you expect the ship to steer itself simply because you put RCS thrusters and monopropellant tanks on it?"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T14:03:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022This would be OK, except by the fact i attached a SAS to the ship, so everybody can drive it.\u0022\n\u003E Please read the ful post.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks Eddiew f for your help\n\nIn 0.90 Beta Career, Jeb can fly the ship but Bill and Bob cannot. That is why the error message appears when you press the T key. However, you can still fly the ship manually using the SAS for control response. It is just that only pilots can do so automatically."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T14:06:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022This would be OK, except by the fact i attached a SAS to the ship, so everybody can drive it.\u0022\n\u003E Please read the ful post.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks Eddiew f for your help\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Reaction wheels aren\u0027t SAS anymore, just sources of torque.\n\u003E You need either an SAS-capable probe core, or a pilot kerbal.
