If so, they are activated when you dump the remains of your craft to allow just the parts you want to recover to reenter and they\u0027ll show as grey on the staging side bar. They won\u0027t deploy straight away, but will wait until they sense the minimum pressure which, unless you\u0027ve tweaked it is something like 0.1. That means they will open way to high and fast and will be destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure the parachutes have their own stage command and for extra safty adjust the minimum deployment pressure to about 0.75 (although it will vary with your particular design). The other number you can tweak by right clicking the parachute is the height above local ground level that the parachute goes from reefed (partially closed) and fully deployed. I have recovered from deploying my parachutes too high by quickly changing the minimum pressure for opening whilst descending (although that\u0027s not really recommended!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T00:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
