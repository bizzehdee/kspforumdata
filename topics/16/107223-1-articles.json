But I can\u0027t seem to be able to make a craft able to land on duna and back. So here I am and asking for all your guys expertise any help would be appreciated.\n\nBtw this is a rescue craft so no need to spend weight on science, I also don\u0027t know if this post has to go int thigh post or craft exchange I\u0027m new here so excuse me."},{"CreatedByName":"Minato","CreatedById":55837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:15:45Z","Content":"I had the same problem but i gladly made it into in orbit around the sun.
