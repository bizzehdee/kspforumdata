In several ways it is superior. More physics has been turned on for wheels now than in prior versions. You need to experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor misbehaving landing gear, you have 4 options now to try to make them (mostly) behave:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can: tweak the friction, the springs, the damping, and/or the brakes. If you want to do as slashy does and edit the config file, you can also mess with the suspension travel and a few other things. There are no known rules for what direction to tweak each setting -- you just have to try it. You can also attach the gear to different points than they were before,\u00A0and then use the offset tool to move them where you want. Sometimes that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, my planes tend to be very lightweight canard designs\u00A0with a tricycle landing gear arrangement, and my main gear on the tips of my (rear) wings. To make my planes behave well enough to launch and land (with 100% reliability, just so long as I am careful), I tend to set the friction on the front wheel to .2 or .3, the friction on the rear wheels to .6 or so, and the spring and damper both to .5. I think that the reason most of these numbers need to be\u00A0so low is that my planes are so light. That is, I think that the settings are very much design-dependent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
