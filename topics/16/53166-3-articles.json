I always notice that optimal points for doing things tend to occur at specific points on the navball or along an orbit. For instance, you can align your orbit with another by burning north at the descending node or south at the ascending node; to put your orbit along the equator of the planet when absent a point of reference, point your ship directly north or south. Don\u0027t use the nav ball, but rather point it straight up or down visually while in orbital camera mode. Then wait until the heading on the navball aligns with the north or south pole on the navball--that is when you burn to straighten the orbit onto the equator.

If you aim your heading such that the green reticle is between the heading and pink reticle, then thrusting forward will move the green reticle onto the pink reticle and decrease your approach gap.
