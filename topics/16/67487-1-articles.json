However I had a very specific quest in mind! I remember I saw someone on a livestream ridering an asteroid down to the surface, and noticed that the rock would pretty much slow down to about 150 m/s loooong before hitting the surface. Now this might just be my ignorance talking but that didn\u0027t seem very realistic, but I thought the asteroid might just have come in at a shallow angle, giving it time to decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went in and found an asteroid that would pretty much hit the planet straight on, met up with it, and rode it down to see if it would be more... impactful (Word inventing!). To my disappointment no. The asteroid hit the atmosphere at 3.5k m/sec but at the altitude of 5k meters, it had pretty much decelerated to terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is it just me, or this a bit weird?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that though...
