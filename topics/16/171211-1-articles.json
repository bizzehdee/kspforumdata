I took a break to watch Netflix, came back an hour later to continue and found that my save couldn\u0027t be loaded. I don\u0027t remember if I exited to the main menu before closing KSP, or if the game was saving when I did so, not that it should matter if the game keeps a backup save while the save operation is finishing like it should be doing. At least I have Autoupload turned on and I only have to go back to yesterday morning\u0027s save. Still lost a lot of science and surface scans, not to mention all those hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m wondering is how the game loads save files. Is it loaded from the save named \u0022persistent\u0022 within each playthrough, or is it the save with the most recent timestamp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking if it\u0027s the former, a workaround could be to allow players to load something other than \u0022persistent\u0022 in the event that that save is corrupt, such as a quicksave or other manually named save file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the persistent save is the foundation and the other saves build on it, like a differential backup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flavio hc16","CreatedById":183153,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T09:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can upload the last persistent file, so you will lose at worst only\u00A0 15 minutes of gameplay, but if you upload it, and you have manually saved your game, you can the just upload it back and you are good to go from where you left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know how and where to get back your persistent file?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kevnuke","CreatedById":184963,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T10:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223301562\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171211\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519290100\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183153\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Flavio hc16\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Flavio hc16 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou can upload the last persistent file, so you will lose at worst only\u00A0 15 minutes of gameplay, but if you upload it, and you have manually saved your game, you can the just upload it back and you are good to go from where you left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know how and where to get back your persistent file?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t select the persistent file.
