The crappy part would overheat in the atmosphere during my gravity turn, and explode, exposing the probe core beneath. Afterwards, the launcher would continue blazing through the stratosphere, probe core serving as its heatshield, reach orbit, and continue on its merry way, completely undeterred by the missing nose cone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to expand it. Hyperedited an MK3 capsule on an aerocapture trajectory from Eloo, periapsis 20km, with three heatshields beneath, with intention to let them overheat and explode in sequence. Essentially treating heatshields whole as ablator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time it didn\u0027t work. The first heatshield would reach the critical temperature, explode - and all that would remain was a puff of smoke, all the rest of the craft gone. I tried putting strut segments between the heatshields, same effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes the nose cone go with a boom letting the part below continue as the head of the stack harmlessly, while the heatshield explodes? How can one stack multiple heatshields? How to prevent the explosion spread? In short, how to perform unassisted/unpowered aerocapture to Kerbin from Eloo in 1.1.3? (reentry speed in excess of 7500m/s, periapsis around 20km (change if you like, but it MUST be captured - if it exits the atmosphere with its trajectory still leading to system escape, it\u0027s lost. MK1 capsule, M16 parachute, add anything else you like but try to keep it minimal.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not asking this on Gameplay Questions, because I seriously doubt anyone has an answer ready to post.
