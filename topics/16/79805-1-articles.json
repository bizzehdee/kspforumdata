I built a rocket with 5 liquid engines for stage 1 with a bunch of fuel tanks. They run out around the point where I\u0027m supposed to cut engines and coast to the orbital burn point (~70k-100k). All is fine, I\u0027m at 80k, 1500m/s and I drop them and go for a state 2 burn. Except the engine provides zero thrust. My speed just keeps dropping slowly. I thought it was a staging thing, so I tried having the separation in one stage and the engine in another (so stage 1, all 5 ignite, stage 2 drops those 5, stage 3 engages the secondary engine) and both in the same stage (dropping the 5 also ignites the secondary engine). Zippo. If I go to stage 3, the capsule separates from the engine/tanks and it just drops away, with the engine at full power. It just drops off like I let go of a rock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat in the hell? Does this need to be a bug report, or am I just missing something painfully obvious?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T22:27:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by giddonah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_jack","CreatedById":94383,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T04:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s either staging or a bug some pictures would help though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindelle_Sunveam","CreatedById":70755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T04:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you give a picture ?
