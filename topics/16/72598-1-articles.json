But I don\u0027t know how to fit the upper end to the girder to get it back straight in line. Or to put it in other words: how to connect the girder to whatever comes atop of the interstage fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince it is a bit difficult to explain, please see the following picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hWBOD2C.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022hWBOD2C.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there best practises for that, is it a bad idea anyway or are there any mods who provide parts for that (I don\u0027t need a full cargo bay with doors etc, fairings would be enough)?
