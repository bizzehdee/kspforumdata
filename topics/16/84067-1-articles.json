Alternatively you can take a look at Kerbal Engineer and a dV map to figure it out. dV is dependent on the mass ratio of fuel to rocket. The more fuel you have (mass wise compared to your rocket) the more dV you have. The heavier your rocket (That\u0027s not fuel) the less dV you have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T20:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHate to say there\u0027s a mod for that, buuuuuuuut, there\u0027s a mod (actually a few) that do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb/KER/VOID....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T21:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot enough information given to calculate delta-V.
