The easiest way to build interplanetary ships is to build them in Orbit (As I did for my mission, kinda) if you are going to Duna, Eve, Jool, Laythe, or back to Kerbin, you can use a technique known as aero-braking/aero-caputre, where you dip down into the atmosphere of the body you are approaching and use atmospheric drag to slow you down enough without having to do a retrograde burn to slow down.

Since engines that are not used for liftoff aren\u0027t used at all for that stage they are not taken into account for that stage. both MechJeb and KER separate out your crafts dV by stages so that you can see how much dV each stage is giving you, they also provide a total dV for the craft that basically adds up all the stages dV to give you a total. dV is not the end all be all, there is also TWR (Thrust to Weight Ratio). IF you are trying to liftoff from a body and your TWR is \u0026lt;1 you will not go to space today, if you are in space and you have a low TWR your burn times will be horrendous (read: extremely very long). Hence why I have the booster stage on my Duna mission. IT has a TWR \u0026gt;1 where as the main drive stage has a TWR of about .5, but when I get to Duna that goes up to about .8, which isn\u0027t as bad. In deep space TWR isn\u0027t as important because a burn time of a half-hour isn\u0027t going to be affected by your position in orbit as much as it would around a planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E5, Is it feasible to have a space station where you can deposit fuel for a future long passage?
