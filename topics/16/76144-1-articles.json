Line it up with a small RCS-powered tug, attach it over the top of the faulty docking node (or detach the old one first and get rid of it, then attach it directly) with the claws (you may need to allow pivoting in order to attach all 4 claws), then detach your tug and you\u0027ve got a brand new docking ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may experience mild issues such as random explosions, unplanned spontaneous disassembly, or having your station caught in a time bubble....but if you keep some quicksaves every so often so you can revert when a glitch strikes, you should be able to use this method to give a quick fix if you don\u0027t want to replace the entire core module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T11:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could relaunch the core, bring it up to the station, undock all the components from the core and back them off a bit, then position the new core where the other was.
