Here is a problem that I ran into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Lunar car with lander that I sent to Laythe with the attached long range transporter, I missed it\u0027s \u0022align planes\u0022 orbit burn point. So, I decided to try and make the best of it. It had already had it\u0027s tranfer orbit burn done. So it was on it\u0027s way to Jool anyway. There was Jool encounter shown in its orbit path. So I knew it would at least get close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose is a loose term here though. Like WAY OUT THERE close. I had to use up most of the fuel just to get captured in Jools orbit or else it would have fallen back in and then the mission would have to be scrapped. After I used up all the fuel on the long range transporter that brought it to Jool and then just a bit of the mission fuel for the car lander. It was in a very ugly orbit around Jool. Has an apoapsis of 2.189 billion meters. Yep that\u0027s just about on the edge of the SOI for Jool. But at least the problem is now contained at Jool. Oh, and the orbit plane is off by no less than 60 degrees if the previous wasn\u0027t enough problem. And oh yea, the apoapsis was pointing downward so it was not going to be an easy cheap plane adjustment. Somebody was gonna have to spend some money on a fuel burn to fix this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I just left it hanging there until I could think of a solution to fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after I sent an airplane to Laythe, the long range transporter that it used still had most of it\u0027s fuel remaining. Yeah I used a better design for that one. Plus, the payload was much lighter. 5 tons vs 26 tons if I remember correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I figured I\u0027d send the transporter after the car/lifter and finish the job... but I got to thinking, maybe I could use the fuel on the lifter (what remains) to fix it\u0027s on orbit planes first. This would save tons of fuel on the transporter that would have to dock with it. Since it is already in a nice plane with the moons already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK long story getting shorter. Here is a couple of pictures I took of the solution...

Only gonna cost me 84.5 units of DV to make that happen... That should save me a ton of fuel to fix my problem. Since I\u0027d be close to the moons planes, I should be able to find a fixer to help get me to a destination. Preferably Tylo. The neat thing about it, is it doesn\u0027t use an atmospheric brake to slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComments are welcome. I\u0027m always up for learning something new. But don\u0027t recommend using any mods. I\u0027m adverse to using any sort of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T09:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith some knowledge and enough fiddling with maneuver nodes you can do things quite cheaply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast evening I returned an spaceplane from (low) Moho orbit. Did it in one main burn with some minor adjustments later. Only cost about 2800 m/s, since i didn\u0027t do a plane change and aerocaptured into Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
