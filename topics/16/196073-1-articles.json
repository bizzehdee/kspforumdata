But hey did you watch the Crew Demo return on this weekend ? They streamed 11 hours while they were constantly doing small corrections on multiple orbits. This is traveling in space. Luckily Kerbal space has some time warp to skip long coasts\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and a minor hint for your next ascent: 1400 m/s circulization burn indicates you did ascend mostly straight up. If you turn little more sideways early in ascent you burn more horizontal and need less time to circulize. Which makes it easier to time. But really only do very small corrections, you will see that drag and changed ascent curve change big even for small turns early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T16:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPosting a video is always a great way to get help \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this particular case, you are too close to the maneuver node by the time you start to throttle up. In other words, the maneuver node is too large for you to complete it at that moment in time. In yet other words, your engine does not have enough thrust. All of these are true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as CBase already pointed out, these are not the underlying cause. The actual cause is that your ascent is much too steep. You spend too much effort into going up, and not enough effort into going sideways. As a result, by the time your apoapsis reaches your desired altitude, you need to catch up to all this going sideways business. But there is so much to catch up to, you\u0027d have to bring a really big engine and accellerate really hard to make it in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go sideways more during ascent, then the maneuver node you have to make to insert into orbit will be smaller. Additionally, it will also take you longer to push the apoapsis up to your desired altitude, which means you spend more time going sideways more, which yet again reduces the size of the final maneuver required. With practice, you will be able to get your final insertion maneuver down to less than 100 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, how do you know how much sideways is enough sideways? Experience, mostly. But, here\u0027s a handy rule of the thumb: by the time your rocket has turned halfway over (45 degrees towards the horizon), you want to be somewhere between 10km and 12km in altitude. Don\u0027t sweat it if you don\u0027t hit it exactly; it is a rule of the thumb, not a law of physics. The exact \u0022perfect\u0022 trajectory varies from rocket to rocket anyway, based on its thrust-weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E). The rule of the thumb assumes a launchpad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of roughly 1.4 to 1.5, which is considerd a good practices value for many kinds of rocket. If your launch stage has more oomph than that, turn over harder, and pass that 45 degree angle at 10km or even below; if your rocket barely manages to struggle off the ground, turn less aggressively, and go to 15 km or maybe even more for your 45 degree milestone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-03T16:20:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2020 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T18:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223830895\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196073\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596468255\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022206557\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mrboogybambusiness@gmail.c\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\u0022 class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u0022f29f80909d9d958b90939f9087819b9c978181b2959f939b9edc91\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/a\u003E said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example of what i tried to do:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://streamable.com/ruxbhk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://streamable.com/ruxbhk\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManeuvers do not work very well if you go around a bend while doing them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, being in orbit means you\u0027re always going round the bend... but it\u0027s still a matter of degree, quite literally.

You do loose of course some efficiency when node marker and prograde are not aligned, but as a starter that is perfectly fine. His problem is really about starting 7s too late and following the node marker to fine tune orbit at wrong point in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T07:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223830908\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196073\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221596469699\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189476\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CBase\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, CBase said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n..reached an 80x58 km (sub-)orbit, which is actually pretty good \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E.

The exact \u0022perfect\u0022 trajectory varies from rocket to rocket anyway, based on its thrust-weight ratio (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E). The rule of the thumb assumes a launchpad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of roughly 1.4 to 1.5, which is considerd a good practices value for many kinds of rocket.
