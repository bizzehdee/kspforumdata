Keep burning and it will come out the other side eventually and you are now inbound on a reversed orbit! Don\u0027t forget when you circularize you burn in the opposite direction than usual. The markers for prograde and retrograde will still work in the same way, but they will be at opposite directions than a clockwise orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T01:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always keep forgetting that, once your periapsis touches the body itself, the periapsis will eventually come out of \u0022the other side\u0022--I always thought it meant I just had to pull it back up and keep doing \u002B and - nodes until I \u0022rotate\u0022 the maneuver right \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T02:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to your settings file and change \u0022patched conics draw mode\u0022 from 3 to 0.
