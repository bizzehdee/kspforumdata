This is the second time this has happened, it happened once and I reverted to an old savegame I had from before the missions to build the station arrived at Jool.

What\u0027s the point of building something or launching a complex mission if ships just suddenly disappear? I have learned to deal with the numerous bugs in the program (perpetually stuck docking ports, flapping intersects, kraken lurking everywhere, etc.) but this one doesn\u0027t seem possible to work around.

I have checked to see if it got marked as debris but it just isn\u0027t there. I have also checked the save file for any reference to this station and there is nothing other than a probe that was launched from it and the save file is several hundred kb less than the save file that contains the station. I loaded an old save file again and have rebuilt the station but I am deathly afraid it is going to disappear again. I assume it is something specific about this particular station as it has disappeared twice and I have never had any other stations/craft just disappear like that.

It\u0027s difficult to see when it disappears if I am not actively doing something at Laythe, in this last instance I was attempting a landing on Duna (which involved several different quicksaves) so by the time I noticed my current quicksave didn\u0027t have the station anymore. I have been trying to remember to do periodic named quicksaves but I don\u0027t end up making those as frequently as I should so I lose a lot of work when having to revert. If nobody else has seen this it might be something specific to Linux or specific to my install so I guess my only hope is that it might be fixed in some future version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T22:17:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a crew onboard?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CorruptDB","CreatedById":75308,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T23:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it just happened again, station is gone.

This time, there was an orbital anomaly in the station: the orbit mysteriously changed from 120x120 to 120x~960. I fixed the orbit and started some operations at Duna. I checked on the station several times and each time it was still there (until the last time obviously. I don\u0027t know what is doing it, but it seems like something is changing the orbit of the station when I am away from it.
