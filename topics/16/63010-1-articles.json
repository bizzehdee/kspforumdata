Torque doesn\u0027t impart a force like this at the center of rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you manage to do this right, the amount of twisting you have to do at the CoM is the same as the twisting you have to do at the base of the handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAPPLICATION\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we all know in KSP the spacecraft are rarely rigid. So when you apply all that torque to one end of the space station to flip it around, it will rotate around the CoM. However, the poor module at the end where the SAS modules are located will take all of the strain of bending that torque around the CoM. If you distribute the SAS units, or put them near the center, there isn\u0027t nearly as much shear force concentrating at any point on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try out the fuel tank experiment above by assembling a fuel \u0022tube\u0022 in the SPH and launching it. Then hack gravity and give it a try. The runway provides a visual backdrop to watch the center of rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/S4AhOwx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022S4AhOwx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thing is completely symmetric in weight from one end to the other. It flips around the CoM at the same speed whether I use the three SAS units at either end (one end at a time), or the three in the middle. It takes about 10 seconds to do a 360. The big difference is that using the ones on the end causes noticeable bending.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T23:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I came here because today I was puzzling over the exact same thing.

As Kasuha said, the torque is definitely applied at the point where the SAS modules are. However, the torque causes the whole ship to move around the CoM. All of that stress of moving around the CoM passes through whatever part the SAS units are attached to on the way to the CoM. Weak parts = bad results. If you spread out the torque or put it near the CoM, you will have less bending to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust be thankful that you don\u0027t have to contend with all the actual physics.
