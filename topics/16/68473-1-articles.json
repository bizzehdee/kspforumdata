If that\u0027s the case, it doesn\u0027t work so well in the editor. I think windows (or maybe the keyboard itself) treats holding SHIFT and pressing the numeric arrow keys as if you\u0027re using the regular arrow keys. So you\u0027re actually inputting arrow keys, instead of SHIFT-Numeric Keypad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, you can\u0027t remap the SHIFT-ROTATE function in KSP. At least not as far as I\u0027ve been able to find in the settings.cfg. (Maybe there\u0027s a plugin?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can do is remap rotation to the regular arrow keys (instead of the numeric keypad) and the roll rotation to HOME and PGUP. Then turn off your NUM LOCK and enjoy. (You might have to shuffle a few other key bindings depending on what else you did.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I forgot, you can also remap your numeric pad arrow keybindings with the NUM LOCK off instead of doing the arrow keys. That will make sure sure it\u0027s taking the correct keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, your VAB / SPH keybindings should look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitch Part Down: UpArrow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitch Part Up: DownArrow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYaw Part Left: LeftArrow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYaw Part Right: RightArrow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoll Part Left: Home\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoll Part Right: PageUp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to remove PageUp from \u0022Scroll View Up\u0022 in that same section.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-10T03:27:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2014 03:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Micco","CreatedById":38238,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T20:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERed,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try both of the Shift keys, but unfortunately still had the same problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Micco","CreatedById":38238,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T20:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKasuha,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re most likely right, as i am attempting to use the keypad for the VAB rotations.

After you remap the keys as I listed, turn OFF the NUMLOCK on your keyboard. Then you can use the numeric keypad for 90 degree rotations, and SHIFT \u002B numeric keypad for fine rotations. (You\u0027re actually remapping to the arrow keys, but when you turn off NUMLOCK, you\u0027re telling the keyboard to use the arrow key part of the numeric keypad, instead of the numbers.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any other parts of the UI mapped to the numeric keypad (such as docking or steering), you might want to remap those too.
