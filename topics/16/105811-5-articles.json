Or at least, way better and less game breaking than stacking multiple MPL on the same craft.\n\nEither way, the tech tree needs a serious rebalance (I will restart anyway with a proper install of RemoteTech, life support mod, etc and probably dial down my science multiplier) because even without MPL, a couple of decent Mun and Minmus trips can unlock near everything.\n\nDialling down science multiplier on a new game is the way forwards - though I would have liked to have been able to run my launches by using a science -\u003E funds strategy the penalty for in-the-field science is so high that I wouldn\u0027t even cover the cost of launching stuff to top up my data banks."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:07:47Z","Content":"I\u0027m still a bit confused about how this works.

I put one in orbit around Kerbin before I knew how it worked and managed to figure it out, but all this info is really helpful for optimizing things. I\u0027ve also been loving the gameplay element added by bringing a scientist in a probe flown vessel to do experiments and then trying to bring him back to the lab to manually offload data. I had a really fun \u0022mission\u0022 where I flew him around to various Kerbin biomes in a plane, then landed him at the runway and built a short range rover to bring him to the launchpad, where I loaded an empty ship that he manually climbed all the way up and took to orbit to dock with the station and offload science. \n\nOn that note, what is the best way to upgrade our scientists? Do they only gain levels only by being on manned missions to various places or can they level up by processing data and such in the lab? I haven\u0027t brought my researching scientists back from the lab and recovered them yet to see if this is the case."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos_F","CreatedById":143276,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T02:22:11Z","Content":"This thread is awesome.\n\nAllow me to contribute with some knowledge. This should be featured in the item description, but it is not: when you are processing data to store in the lab to convert into science later, the lab consumes 10 el.charge/second (when you press the yellow button). When the lab is converting data to science, it uses 5 el.charge/second.\n\nI am a huge fan of the new MPL, and I\u0027m using it extensively. However I have an issue with it.\n\nI wrote this in a post in the subreddit, but I honestly doubt I\u0027ll get any feedback there. Allow me to copy paste:\n\n**Trying to tweak an aspect of the processing lab. Could use help from someone familiar with modding. Also,** **there\u0027s a bug in the lab****.**\n\nThe processing lab is amazing. But it has a major flaw: it becomes a place you have to visit often, in a very *grindy* way. To give you an idea: I\u0027m doing a contract to place a satellite in sun orbit between Dres and Jool. Even before I reached the orbit\u0027s apoapsis I\u0027ve had to stop what I\u0027m doing and go to my research station in Minmus, to transmit the accumulated science points, which had reached maximum capacity, a total of six times. The station has 3 scientists in it, all level 2. This, plus all the other factors, make it so that, with the data storage topped off, I get about 500 science points every 100 days. On a side note, this is where I found the bug. The lab displays a science points per day value, and that value is wrong. I get a value of about 1.8 when the data storage is topped off, yet I\u0027m actually getting almost three times as much daily science.\n\nWhat i want to do is make it so it becomes unnecessary to visit the station so often, just to push the \u0022transmit\u0022 button and sit around waiting.\n\nI know that getting vessels to perform actions in the background is an extremely tricky thing to mod in this game (here\u0027s hoping the shift to the Unity 5 engine / multi-threading in the next update resolves that), so instead of trying to get the lab to transmit its science contents periodically, I dove into the science lab\u0027s .cfg file (largeCrewedLab.cfg) and tried to make the lab able to hold ten times more data, and ten times more science, so that I\u0027d be able to leave it running for much longer before needing to transmit. However, this is basically impossible to do without screwing up the lab\u0027s research rate. Turns out the amount of science produced per unit of time is calculated based on a complex exponential equation that takes into account, besides the factors like number and level of scientists, the amount of data stored vs maximum storage and the amount of science stored vs maximum storage.\n\nThis meant that when I tried implementing a maximum storage of 5000 for both categories, I got readings of science production rate of over 3.4/day (and given the bug, the true value was likely much higher). Basically it seems impossible to tweak the storage limits without screwing up things.\n\nMy question to the more mod-savvy among you is: is there any alternative? Could we, I don\u0027t know, implement and additional \u0022module\u0022 in the .cfg, and have this module serve simply as a secondary storage? I imagine we could have this storage be triggered by the amount of accumulated science hitting a preset value, like 490 (it never hit\u0027s 500, the rate drops to near zero when the lab is full of science), and that would cause it to take the accumulated science and store it, while dropping stored data points into the lab for further processing.\n\nI dunno, I might be going the long way around. There might *not be* a way around. But I really want to try to find it, because having to go through the process of switching vessels every 100 days, simply to empty out the lab, is absurdly grindy.\n\n---\n\nThe bug seems mostly minor and inconsequential besides an inability to predict outcomes.\n\nThe real problem is the grind. It takes science back to the constant clicking dynamic.\n\nCan\u0027t even imagine how bad it gets when you have two or three labs running in diferent locations.\n\nAny ideas on how to work around this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kendrick","CreatedById":131231,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T04:37:42Z","Content":"Rover is it intended to nerf the science by only allowing 1 science station to run at a time per vessle?

That operation might need special instruments/supplies (fancy containers, reactives) that not even a scientist in her EVA suit might be carrying.\n\n#2c Might make sense to transmit about a sample without sacrifying the sample. Current situation brings an interesting game decision (to transmit or not to transmit), but also brings awkward hacks (landers with duplicate/triplicate/quadruplicate experiments) or an extra pod just to store more copies of the experiments).\n\nI dont know if in 1.0 with the new tech nodes you can unlock everything with just the 2 moons (like Scott did with 2 launches) and the extra MPL tech output will be of any use. Anyway, as I swarm Mun and Minmus for science, the MPL output is negligible and I have better use for Bob and any other extra scientist i might get. So sorry I think MPL\u0027s have become a bit useless except for harder modes (need more science) or role playing.
