I think there were some parts missing because I don\u0027t have those mods, but I reviewed it anyway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour fuel distribution destabilizes the rocket, because some sides empty first than the others. And then, some engines in one side stopped functioning because their fuel tanks ran dry, and I crashed. I corrected the fuel lines, so all were pointing to the middle large tank, but then I hit another problem: the thrust of this middle stage isn\u0027t enough to lift the rest of the craft, so you simply wastes a lot of fuel there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage is too big, and you have chosen a very inefficient rocket engine for it (low specific impulse). Also, the tail fins only create drag, they are probably superfluous. Even then, it could propel me close to orbital speed. Using the last stage to make an low orbit to wait for the moon, and then shot for it, should work, even with your current design (with the fuel flow fixed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at wildkittyv1\u0027s tutorial: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16752-Operation-KISS-A-pictorial-guide-on-fuel-consumption-and-not-making-massive-rockets\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16752-Operation-KISS-A-pictorial-guide-on-fuel-consumption-and-not-making-massive-rockets\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have made a munar rocket too (the Falcon Heavy one): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16963-0-16-stock-Falcon-9-%28satelite-launcher%29-and-Falcon-Heavy-%28Minmus-Moon-trip%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/16963-0-16-stock-Falcon-9-%28satelite-launcher%29-and-Falcon-Heavy-%28Minmus-Moon-trip%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Good to see you here Scott!
