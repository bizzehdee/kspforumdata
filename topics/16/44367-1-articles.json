It takes just as much thrust, and therefore just as much time, to stop as it did to gain the speed in the first place.

All the EVA controls are relative to the direction the camera\u0027s facing (towards, away, left, right), just like they are when walking on the ground, so moving the camera also changes the direction the Kerbal will move when you press a key. The difference is that on the ground, the Kerbal will stop between key presses but in space he keeps going with the vector he had before you moved the camera. Thus, if you get the Kerbal moving then reposition the camera and give the Kerbal another movement command (even using the same key), you end up moving in 2 directions at once, the original one before you moved the camera and the new one you just entered. This can cause all kinds of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, think ahead. Before letting go of the ladder to start flying, line the camera up so you can see your destination and won\u0027t have to move the camera during flight.

KAS is a wonderful thing--I never go to space without it--but it\u0027s also full of traps for the unwary that can lead to all sorts of spectacular disasters, especially when using it during EVA \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, distance really isn\u0027t much of a constraint with EVA. You just get moving in the right direction and coast the whole way to the target, just like with a rocket. I mean, you can fly home on EVA from Minmus and even Gilly. So if you find yourself like 10km from your ship, don\u0027t panic and hold down thrust in that direction. Just get headed SLOWLY toward it and you\u0027ll get there eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good way to learn how to do EVA is to practice on Mun or Minmus. Mun is a bit safer because you\u0027re unlikely to achieve escape velocity even if you try, whereas on Minmus you can do it accidentally if you\u0027re not careful. On Mun, you have to keep blipping up every few seconds which limits your horizontal range to about 6-8km (so 1/2 that for a round trip back to thelander), or less if you fly up a tall mountainside. On Minmus, you don\u0027t need much up thrust to stay flying so can cover huge tracts of land (or, if you\u0027re feeling confident, use orbits and sub-orbits to go anywhere). But as mentioned, if you\u0027re not careful you\u0027ll find yourself on escape trajectory while still below the surrounding mountaintops \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, start out by getting a few feet off the ground, then moving in the desired direction, using blips of up as needed to maintain altitude without getting very high. Then pick an object some distance away and fly to it, stop there, circle all around it without touching the ground. Eventually, head back towards a point a short distance left or right of your lander (do NOT aim directly at the lander) and blip forward until you\u0027re going as fast as you dare. Then, try to stop even with your lander while holding yourself up as needed, then come down gently and try to stick the landing. The reason for not aiming directly at the lander is that if you screw up your flying, you might fly into the lander and tip it over, or hit the ground short, slide under it, and then tip it over when you stand back up. But if the capsule survives and you\u0027re on Minmus, you can at least go back inside, refuel your jetpack, and fly yourself back to Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesons","CreatedById":76697,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T19:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe trick is to just tap the keys really shortly - it\u0027s the same with docking.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had troubles with EVAs as well until I started trying to dock my ships together.
