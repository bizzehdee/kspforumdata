The booster stacks initially have an SRB then liquid boosters in an \u0022asparagus\u0022 cluster. The SRB\u0027s run out and are jettisoned in the first stage, and then the liquids are ignited, while the first section of the main rocket stack is still going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intended for the main rocket stack to transfer its fuel to the liquid boosters. However, one of those ducts fails to work for some unknown reason, leading to the liquid stack its attached to emptying first, before its asparagus partner on the other side. This causes an imbalance and the rocket flips out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know what I\u0027m doing wrong? I\u0027ve tried several different configurations, including: @ ducting to a drop pod or series of drop pods on the side and then into the booster stacks; @ changing from 6 to 4 around; and @ redoing the whole thing again. The problem remains that one fuel duct doesn\u0027t work. Clues? I\u0027m happy to provide a .craft file as soon as I can figure out somewhere to put it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-07T03:35:45Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2014 03:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SmarterThanMe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered...

Another possibility is that the fuel line isn\u0027t connecting to what you think it is, but is clipping a solar panel or something like that. I had that happen recently, and it was quite annoying.
