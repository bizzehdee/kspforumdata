Instead of some of them wanting to give more money or more science, they\u0027d all give the same rewards. Otherwise, I have no idea how to change values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have to ask: Why would you want to do this? At some point, you will want to start doing stuff just for your own personal enjoyment instead of grinding out science and being a wage slave to the corporations. You know, colonizing Laythe, seeing how many asteroids it takes to fill up a Mohole, etc. Such activities are obscenely expensive and aren\u0027t likely to get you any income, so you\u0027ll be needing extremely lucrative contracts to keep such things going and/or have a huge retirement nest egg in the bank already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyromartian","CreatedById":116018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecolonizing Laythe\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoh that\u0027s on my list!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBut I have to ask: Why would you want to do this?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like doing big projects but I think I want the game itself to give me barriers to overcome.
