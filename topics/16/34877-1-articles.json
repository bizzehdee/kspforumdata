I\u0027m requesting a design, or advice on creating a craft that\u0027s capable of going from my space station in 200 km orbit around Kerbin, to the mun, and land. At that point, a small Kethane rover I created would transfer Kethane supply\u0027s to the craft, and back away. The craft would then get into an orbit around the mun, and finally re-dock with my space station, transferring Kethane in exchange for fuel and R.C.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreferably should be able to transport 8000 Units of Kethane, be under 200/ 250 tons, and have a low part count, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssistance would be lovely, ladies and gentlemen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T08:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just park a couple of converters on the mun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeedesertfox","CreatedById":72405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T13:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I already have a the largest converter and tank available, attached to my space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T15:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zeedesertfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zeedesertfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs I already have a the largest converter and tank available, attached to my space station.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one of the stupidest reasons you can think of.
