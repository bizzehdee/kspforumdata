It makes me pretty excited to see all the discussions about what works, what doesn\u0027t, and people figuring things out.\n\nHowever, there\u0027s been a trend on the forum the last few days that seems to be leaning toward animosity. Aerodynamics in particular has always been a polarizing topic between the \u0022realism\u0022 crowd and the \u0022fun gameplay\u0022 crowd. For me personally, it has never been a question of which should win out: Realism or Gameplay. There is simply no possible way to achieve the perfect blend of realism and gameplay that satisfies every single player.\n\nI would sincerely like to point out that the beauty of this forum is that we all come together to understand difficult and complex concepts that have been boiled down to a relatively simplistic (and ideally understandable) representation in KSP. Accomplishing this is no small feat, and can be quite the challenge to balance while maintaining some level of realism *and* gameplay. To me, this community has always been incredible because of it\u0027s willingness to help each other.\n\nSo I thought perhaps, instead of having yet another thread that goes back and forth about how the game does or doesn\u0027t meet your expectations, I would try to explain a bit about how complex the new aerodynamic and thermodynamic system is, and just how big of an undertaking the system has been up to this point. Perhaps that will lend some insight as to why finding a good balance is quite difficult. This isn\u0027t meant to be a \u0022defense of the system\u0022 sort of post, but more of an attempt to explain how the system works, to the people who love (and hate-to-love) this game.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n**Basic Drag:**\n\n- The basic drag system for most parts is based off of a cube system. Every time KSP starts up, it looks into the PartDatabase.cfg file and checks for all the cubes. If a cube doesn\u0027t exist for a part, then KSP generates a drag cube for that part and stores it in the database.  \n\n- This has the advantage that you can (generally) look at the shape of the part to figure out what will be less draggy and what will be more draggy.  \n\n- However, this also causes issues with hollow parts (such as cargo bays) which have incorrectly built drag cubes.  \n\n- Parts can also have drag cube multipliers, to adjust the size of the drag cube if the model shape is insufficient to really define the drag.\n- Physics.cfg contains several curves in it. One set of curves (tip, surf, tail, mult) controls the level of drag that the cubes produce, by cube face. KSP uses these curves to build a profile curve that is used to calculate the weight of drag that each face contributes to that part. The cube face that points into the wind uses tip \\* multi, sides use surf \\* multi, and the back face uses tail \\* multi (in simplified terms).\n- The multiplier value is (in essence) a standard drag profile from subsonic through high hypersonic (in KSP\u0027s case, Mach 0.0 through Mach 25.0). This includes the supersonic drag rise in the transonic region, which for KSP is Mach 0.8 to 1.2 (270 - 410 m/s).\n- Part occlusion is accomplished only through node connections. Parts that are connected to other parts via nodes have the size of that cube\u0027s face reduced by the size of the parent/child part. So surface mounted parts are not occluded from drag. (This is why stuff built with lots of things hanging off suffers a lot of drag.)  \n\n- Because of how drag cubes are built, open ended model parts can cause problems. Not all of these parts were adjusted to account for this, which is why there is some imbalance.\n\n**Basic Thermo:**\n\n- Builds off the drag cube system to calculate how much of the part is exposed to the air. This basically sets up how much friction the part is going to experience.\n- Thermo also includes simulation of shock cone occlusion, which deflects heat based on the part that\u0027s out front. This is why the location of surface mounted parts matter. Put them too far forward, and they hit all that heat. Put them too far back, and the forward blunt body doesn\u0027t provide shock cone occlusion anymore.  \n\n- Balance for this is also tricky, so as to provide occlusion for parts when it makes sense, but not block all heating for the entire craft by mounting an antenna out front.\n\n**Basic Lift/Drag for Wings:**\n\n- Wings (more specifically, lifting surfaces and control surfaces) are handled separately from all the other parts in terms of drag.\n- Wing lift is based on two curves, a Maximum Coefficient of Lift based on Mach, and a Coefficient of Lift based on Angle of Attack.  \n\n- Wing lift is based on the V-Squared drag model, but is also scaled by the Cl-Mach curve to account for different levels of lift based on flight regime. Building a system this way has good and bad qualities. First, it simplifies things a bit in the KSP lego world of parts. However, it\u0027s not as complex as accounting for things like wing sweep and aspect ratio.  \n\n- Balancing this curve also causes weird problems like shuttles that can glide at unnaturally low speeds (because they have a lot of wing area).  \n\n- Wing lift from AoA right now is very forgiving in KSP. There is a stall Angle of Attack, but it is quite high. This is also part of why things can fly unnaturally slow and don\u0027t fall out of the sky even at extremely high AoA.\n- Wing drag is based on two curves, a Maximum Coefficient of Drag based on Mach, and a Coefficient of Drag based on Angle of Attack.  \n\n- The Cd-Mach curve for wings is higher than that for fuselage pieces. There\u0027s a variety of reasons for this, but the end result to the game player is that if you build a plane with a lot of wing area, you will have a hard time getting through the supersonic barrier. However, once you\u0027re past it, it\u0027s generally easier to keep accelerating...\n\nEDIT: By popular demand, [here is a more in-depth discussion of the wing lift/drag modeling](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107254-overhauls-for-10/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2165453).\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nSo, on top of all that, many parts have special cases. As noted above, parts that have open models (such as a cargo bay) can cause issues with part occlusion. Models with multiple cube types (such as parachutes) need to be built and adjusted properly. With all these special cases, I\u0027m sure some of them were missed getting updated. On top of that, with any change to the global modifiers, it throws all of the other parts out of balance. It\u0027s a difficult act to balance. So yes, feedback is more than welcome. But if you want your feedback heard, avoid clouding it with too much angst and frustration.\n\nSure, we can have a back and forth on the forum about why the model is built this way and whether or not everyone agrees with it. But really my point in all this is that *this is our new model* (like it or not) and perhaps understanding a bit about how it works will aid people in their design process.\n\n**As a final note, all of these parts were built to be completely controllable and configurable by the user. No, I\u0027m not saying \u0022If you don\u0027t like it, go install a mod.\u0022 I\u0027m say that if you find something out of balance, try playing with the numbers and posting your findings! It\u0027s the community, working together, that really makes this place awesome to me. Hopefully this all helps a bit to understand what those sliders and buttons do.**\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:38:12Z","Content":"**Post 2: Quick fixes to yield intended behavior.**\n\n- In physics.cfg change fullConvectionAreaMin = 0.2 to fullConvectionAreaMin = -0.2 (this is because of a sign flip in the code; it\u0027s clearly intended to be the minimum lerp value for full area for convection; instead (1-this) is the max.

Are there any special rules for bicouplers/tricouplers/quadcouplers?\n\nI believe it\u0027s the side that the node is on. So take for instance an FL-T800. If you attach a nose cone to the top node, then the blunt end of the FL-T800 is occluded from aero forces. But the sides and bottom end are still exposed.\n\nHow this relates to Tip, Surf, and Tail is a matter of the part\u0027s orientation in regard to the flight path. If the nose cone is out front, then it\u0027s the \u0022tip.\u0022 As such, the nose cone\u0027s drag is scaled by the Tip value, while the sides of the FL-T800 are scaled by \u0022surf\u0022 values. If that FL-T800 were to turn sideways, then the side of the tank uses the \u0022Tip\u0022 multiplier while the end with the nose cone would use the \u0022Surf\u0022 multiplier.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - What is \u0022shock cone occlusion\u0022, and how does it relate to thermo? Google has no results matching that phrase other than this page itself.\n\nIt\u0027s a loose term that I made up on the spot. It\u0027s really more like a shock wave, but also not. If you take a look in the spoiler, you\u0027ll see two test examples of shock waves. The game uses cones behind the front edge of things that look similar to a shock wave to figure out which parts are exposed to the full force of the airflow (and therefore how much heating). I would presume the cones are shaped by speed and bluntness of the objects, which will affect how parts behind this pseudo-shock are heated. It doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s exactly like the pictures, but maybe they give you some sort of idea what I mean.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![i-5-1.jpg](http://history.nasa.gov/SP-60/i-5-1.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gpn-2000-001938.jpg](https://launiusr.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/gpn-2000-001938.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E - I recall some pre-1.0 commentary that suggested that clipped-in wings and control surfaces (eg, hiding a bunch of elevons inside your fuselage) would no longer provide lift or control, but since occlusion only applies to things which are node connected, and since no wing surfaces or control surfaces are ever node connected, and further since it sounds like wings and control surfaces might not fall under that occlusion model anyway, it sounds like clipped wings/controls might still function. Is that correct?\n\nWings and control surfaces buried inside a fuselage will still generate lift. You can even put flat plates on the front edge of a wing and it\u0027ll fly fine. The comment that you are referring to might actually be in regard to the cargo bays. Just like how engines don\u0027t work inside cargo bays, wings and control surfaces hidden inside cargo bays do not generate lift while the bay doors are closed.

One was attached to the node and then rotated, while the other was radially attached and then oriented as best I could to even them up.

For example, if you hide a wing part behind a fuselage or a flat plate in FAR, that wing will not generate lift.\n\u003E The 1.0 model only occludes wings that are in cargo bays (and not behind something like a flat plate).

Stuff liek bal;ancing by sticking a small control surface inside the nose, yes it is technically unrelialistic, but those that seek realism arent forced to place a control surface inside the fuselage. i think we get the bets of both worlds this way, noones forcing anyone to use part clipping, but those that wish to are still allowed to and arent screwed over by this."},{"CreatedByName":"TampaPowers","CreatedById":66443,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T12:43:53Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t call this realistic at all.

Parts that are connected to other parts via nodes have the size of that cube\u0027s face reduced by the size of the parent/child part. So surface mounted parts are not occluded from drag.
