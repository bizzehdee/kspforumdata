Your plane is like the arrow shot from a bow. If you try to throw an arrow sideways, what happens? The drag from the fins naturally turns the arrow so that the fins are behind the CoM. Lift is a form of drag, so the CoL also naturally \u0022seeks\u0022 a position behind the CoM. The further back the CoL, the more aggressively the airflow tries to hold it behind the CoM. If a plane has the CoL way back, the plane can become very difficult to turn, meaning you must apply a lot of force with the control surfaces. If you move the CoL closer to the CoM, you don\u0027t need to apply as much force to make it turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s good to put the CoL right on top of the CoM. If you do that, the plane has neutral stability and has no preferred orientation in respect to the airflow. This makes it very hard to control because the nose will easily flip in any direction, even around backwards. Putting the CoL in front of the CoM would give negative stability, meaning the plane is always trying to turn around backwards and you will find it impossible to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other factor is that the further your surfaces are from the CoM, the more effective they are for that axis of control. Moving your elevators forward gave them less leverage, but the plane also became less positively stable because you moved the CoL forward closer to the CoM, making it require much less force to control pitch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the airflow applies leverage based on how far apart the CoL and CoM are, and the elevators apply leverage based on far apart they are from the CoM. Which one has greater effect depends on the design of the plane. In your particular design, the effect of moving the CoL forward helped you more than the effect of moving the elevators forward hurt you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-25T12:07:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2014 12:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetsim","CreatedById":116491,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T12:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for explanation, but another detail raised question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022The further back the CoL, the more aggressively the airflow tries to hold it behind the CoM\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EWhy doesnt CoL behind flip the plane from back to forward if it can flip plane backwards if CoL is in front of CoM?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T12:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jetsim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jetsim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for explanation, but another detail raised question.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022The further back the CoL, the more aggressively the airflow tries to hold it behind the CoM\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EWhy doesnt CoL behind flip the plane from back to forward if it can flip plane backwards if CoL is in front of CoM?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom above...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EYour plane is like the arrow shot from a bow.
