I personally have no idea how to deal with them either, and I complete satellite contracts just fine - even my first try ever worked flawlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think these numbers describe the detailed shape of the orbit, by the way. I mean, just try launching a spacecraft into a 90 degree polar orbit. Then go back to the space center, launch a second vessel also into a 90 degree polar orbit, with the exact same apoapsis and periapsis. You will notice that even though you launched both craft exactly the same way, they ended up in completely different orbits. That is because KSC rotated a ways around the planet during the time it took you to bring the first craft into orbit. I am guessing that this would be the longitude of ascending node - in other words, the point where the inclined orbit intersects the equator (ascending/descending node) is at a different point (a different longitude coordinate). Similarly, you can\u0027t just tell someone to launch into a 90km periapsis, 110km apoapsis orbit... after all, where exactly should that periapsis be? I am guessing that the argument of periapsis is an angle with respect to some sort of standardized reference point that describes where exactly the periapsis of the orbit sits (and thus at the same time also defines the apoapsis, which is always on the opposite side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried reading up on this stuff on wikipedia months ago and drew a complete blank, because it\u0027s full of math and special chararcters and devoid of examples. So I can only try and make up stuff like the above for myself and hope it\u0027s correct... at least to me, it makes sense \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor ingame purposes, you can fly completely by eye. The destination orbit the game draws for you already has all the information you need - it shows whether it\u0027s prograde or retrograde, how it is inclined, where the ascending and descending nodes are, and where the apoapsis and periapsis nodes are. All you need to do is match the orbit, and the contract will complete. Now, as to how to pull that off, you\u0027re going to have to draw on your experience on how the six velocity vectors affect your orbit. Prograde pushes the opposite side away from you, retrograde pulls it towards you (limited by the focus point of the orbit, i.e. the object you are orbiting). Radial-in twists the entire orbit to the left around your craft, limited by the focus point; radial-out does the same but to the right, again limited by the focus point. Normal tilts your orbit around an axis between your current position and the focus point, increasing the inclination angle; antinormal does the same, just decreasing the inclination angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt bears mentioning that since you are moving, your \u0027current position\u0027 constantly changes, so changing your inclination correctly can be a bit tricky - for any given inclination change that you need, there are only two points in the orbit where a normal/antinormal burn will tilt it exactly the way you want it. At all other points, you are just going to make it weird. Most commonly, these points will be located on the equatorial plane, because most commonly you are trying to change inclination with respect to the equator. Because they are so common and important, these points have special names: the ascending node (going upwards from south to north) and the descending node (going downwards from north to south). Because Kerbin conveniently has the Mun orbiting in a perfectly equatorial orbit, you can always display your current Kerbin-equatorial AN/DN for any spacecraft by setting the Mun as a target. For other bodies, you\u0027ll have to eyeball it or install a mod. For the satellite contract missions, the destination orbit helpfully shows AN/DN at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, I do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Launch a craft into low Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Burn prograde so that I raise my apoapsis 95% of the way towards the destination orbit\u0027s AN or DN (which one doesn\u0027t matter, either will do)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Burn normal/antinormal at apoapsis to match inclination, then burn prograde there to raise my periapsis just short of the other side of the destination orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Create a maneuver node\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use the radial-in and radial-out markers while dragging and dropping the node around the orbit to figure out how to twist apoapsis and periapsis into the correct spots\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Execute the maneuver node\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Perform final apoapsis/periapsis adjustments and inclination tweaks as necessary until the orbit matching part of the contract requirements shows green\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Turn off SAS, take my hands off the controls for 10 seconds and collect reward!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-05T11:44:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T09:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EI am guessing that the argument of periapsis is an angle with respect to some sort of standardized reference point that describes where exactly the periapsis of the orbit sits (and thus at the same time also defines the apoapsis, which is always on the opposite side).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EActually, the AoP is measured from the ascending node, along the orbital plane.

You will also need to make several burns if you need to make large changes in your LAN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo match those orbits, I find it\u0027s easiest to line up the ascending/descending node line, with the KSC and launch straight into the inclined orbit.

The vessels will be on different orbits, but they are both in polar orbits. The reason for this is that the Longitude (the lines that go North/South, from pole to pole) where the orbit crosses from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere, is different.

Are you using mods? It\u0027s rather impossible to get a satellite orbit correct unless you have a visual target orbit.
