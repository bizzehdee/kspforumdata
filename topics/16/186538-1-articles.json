But the problem is how do I transfer my saved progress in KSP to another PC. The computer i\u0027m using now uses windows 7 but the new computer will use windows 10.

The easiest way of all is just to store the KSP home directory and everything below it onto a USB stick, move the USB stick to the other computer, and copy the whole thing anywhere you like on the new computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no specific directory requirement. There is no specific DRM requirement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, it\u0027s best if you play KSP from a directory that is not the default Steam download directory. That way, the Steam directory is always a pure vanilla copy, if you ever need to fall back to a pure vanilla copy of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou current progress is stored in the persistent.sfs file in the KerbalSpaceProgram/saves/gamename directory. If you just copy that one file, you can move your current progress to any computer with a compatible version of KSP (including any necessary mods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
