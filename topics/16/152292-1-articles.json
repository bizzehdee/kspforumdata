It is currently using 2.5m parts, so nothing from Kerbodyne except the liquid booster ( it is in the same tech-node\u00A0as mainsail, and\u00A0is better than orange \u002B mainsail)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission profile: This is the second launch of the mission; an altair clone had been launched and is sitting at a 90k orbit, waiting for this ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this launch, the ship will go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E before rendezvous and dock with the altair clone.

I always need the extra monoprop (never managed a docking without one) But there are additional stuff hidden on the inside edge of the upper cabins and fuel tanks -- I will remove those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the \u0022combo\u0022, you are talking about the cargo in the fairing, right? TBH, I wonder what would have been contained within the trunk, if in a hyptherical situation, they use Dragon V2 instead of Orion. If they are going to carry stuff in there, I will have to put some mass in there for simulation purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I took your advice. While I kept my simulated trunk, I did managed to remove some prop tanks, and replace the 4 Thud with 12x Twitch. Managed to launch it to a 78k orbit with a lot of fuel to spare. Unable to recover the first stage due to it missing from tracking (maybe I need a mod?), but otherwise it works in theory. I may try to get that mod and gone with a smaller first stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-20T07:29:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2016 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
