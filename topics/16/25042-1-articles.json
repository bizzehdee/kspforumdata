You also can increase the fuel percentage by staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a complicating factor, though. Gravity. In space all your acceleration turns into delta-V.

Larger rockets, ect, require more fuel as taking off weight will not help very much (depending on how much weight is reduced).

The other is Pegasus 3, coming in at 397t, with about 5.7km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV between two stages, it carries 32t into Munar orbit, a Command Module (with 3km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV by itself) and another 2.3km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV in the MEM. adding the 8t from the MEM drops the CSM \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV by about half, but the whole thing weighs 32t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther times, engines help, Intrepid rockets use multiple 1.25m engines because of their light weight, high efficiency vs the 2.5m engines I have.

I also liked to use KSPX\u0027s 2.5m nuclear engine, but I find this configuration of the 4 smaller ones gives more thrust with the same fuel efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll put an image of the rest of the rocket up later when I get back home to my gaming machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso yes, if you have a TWR of 1 on the launchpad, you won\u0027t get anywhere. That literally means that your thrust is just breaking even with gravity and you\u0027ll hover in place. If it\u0027s close to 1, you\u0027ll lift off very slowly and will probably not make it to orbit, as rockets perform poorly at low speeds (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOberth effect\u003C/a\u003E, it still takes effect at suborbital speed). For example, the Saturn V had a TWR of around 1.5 at liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a fundamental problem with rockets: they need to lift their own fuel. Say you want to lift a payload of a certain weight. You need propellant to lift the payload. But, the fuel weighs something, so you then need more fuel to lift that fuel, and more still to lift that, ad infinitum. Fortunately you\u0027re saved from an infinite loop because the rocket gets lighter as you burn the fuel and discard stages, and other effects like the atmosphere getting lighter and the gravity turn making gravity affect you less. It still goes to show how even a little extra mass can have exponential consequences on how much fuel you need to bring with you, so try to be minimalistic in your rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the concept of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Q\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emax Q\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s like terminal velocity, but in reverse. There is a speed at a given altitude where the force of thrust from your engines pushing you up reaches equilibrium with the force of drag pushing you down. If you go faster than that, the drag force wins out and you\u0027re wasting Dv.
