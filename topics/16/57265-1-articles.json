That way you learn fairly exactly where the safe limit is. It varies for every plane, and how you fly the plane (intakes are air speed sensitive). You get early warning signs from the intake air resource, and you can watch the right-click panel on the intakes and engines for clues as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen not doing crazy test pilot stuff, you don\u0027t have to push it to the very limit. Switching to rockets for space, or going to straight and level cruise for SR-71 flight is best done a little bit below the absolute max limit, without really losing all that much, but gaining certainty and ease of flight. Switching to rockets 1000m or 2000m below the abs max is not going to cost you all that much rocket fuel, and might even save fuel overall, as squeezing that last bit of jet performance out can be quite fuel intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T06:13:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight-click on the intake, see the airflow. Right-click on the engine, see the fuel flow. Make sure 15/16 times the fuel flow is a smaller number than what the intake provides. Fuel flow doesn\u0027t change nearly as fast as intake air flow, so mostly you just watch the intake airflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith turbojets, one intake get you to as high as 21 km at high speed and full throttle. Two intakes at high speed you can reach 25km; throttle back to 1/3 throttle and you can climb another 5km. RAPIER can go higher because its fuel flow is lower -- because its thrust is lower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T07:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GDJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GDJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOn my Jets it will start to yaw either left or right slightly just before the engines sneeze out.

As the air runs out, so does the atmospheric drag, so the loss of thrust isn\u0027t always a major issue. Since jets are hugely more fuel-efficient than rockets, cutting them out too early is very bad for fuel efficiency and therefore your payload delivery capability. I think it\u0027s generally best to stay on jets until the combined rate of altitude and speed gain has slowed down significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jsfalconero","CreatedById":89120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T16:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe flameout threshold for the turbojet engines is roughly 0.01 intake air per engine. If you click on the resources indicator during flight you can watch the intake air drop toward that point. Of course, intake air is also a function of speed/altitude. Generally I allow myself a safety margin of around 0.02 when I\u0027m at my jet service ceiling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick if you have 4 or more jets (generally not a good idea, but sometimes necessary) is to toggle one set of jets off on the same action group as your rocket engine -you can sometimes gain a bit more jet they thrust that way before you need to kill the second set of engines and close your intakes. You\u0027ll need the rocket engine(s) firing though, as usually one pair of jets won\u0027t be enough to keep your TWR high enough to offset drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
