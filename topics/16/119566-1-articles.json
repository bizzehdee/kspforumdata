Kerbals use Supplies and produce Mulch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Agricultural/aeroponics modules uses Mulch to produce Organics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbitat uses Organics to produce Supplies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. ...which you feed back to your Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cycle with TAC-LS involved is pretty similar, just replace \u0022Mulch\u0022 with \u0022Waste Water, Carbon Dioxide, and Waste\u0022, and replace \u0022Supplies\u0022 with \u0022Oxygen, Water, and Food\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cycle is not 100% efficient-- that is, if it\u0027s a closed system, you lose a little on each cycle and you\u0027ll gradually run out of stuff. However, there\u0027s a way to add more stuff to the system without having to ship up more resources from Kerbin: The Aeroponics Module has a \u0022Cultivator\u0022 function which, if you feed it Water and Substrate (which can both be mined), will generate Organics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your basic self-sustainable base will have the necessary modules to do the resource loop described above, and will also have a modest water \u0026amp; substrate mining setup so that it can generate fresh Organics to replace gradual losses. (It doesn\u0027t take very much mining to do this, quite a small mining operation will suffice.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe aware that running these modules to do the various resource conversions takes a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of electricity, so you\u0027ll definitely want to have a nuclear power module as part of your setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T12:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharkman Briton","CreatedById":148040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T13:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T13:09:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther handy resources:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource consumption rates per kerbal, useful for doing math when you\u0027re figuring out how much crew your base can support:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/One-Kerbal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/One-Kerbal\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to be aware of is that the amount of crew matters, the skill levels \u0026amp; professions of the crew matter, and the amount of \u0022living\u0022 and \u0022working\u0022 space matters. It\u0027s a complicated set of math rules, documented here,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/Efficiency-and-Load\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/Efficiency-and-Load\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but what it boils down to is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You need Kerbals to run things. The more kerbals you have, the faster your modules will process resources. (But only up to a point, so overloading your base with crew won\u0027t help.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Your Kerbals need \u0022work\u0022 space and \u0022living\u0022 space. If they don\u0027t have enough, their productivity suffers (i.e. your modules will slow down their resource processing). Only certain parts count as \u0022work\u0022 and \u0022living\u0022 space. Main thing is to make sure you have enough of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Each Kerbal has to pull his or her own weight. That\u0027s because adding the Kerbal adds a boost to your productivity, but also adds a resource drain as they consume supplies. Each Kerbal has a personal productivity that\u0027s determined by profession and level, and (this is the kicker!) \u003Cstrong\u003Ethere\u0027s a certain \u0022threshold\u0022 above which your kerbal is a net producer, and below which your kerbal is a net consumer\u003C/strong\u003E. So you\u0027d better have enough producers to outweigh the consumers, or your base won\u0027t self-sustain no matter how much hardware you throw at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for point #3, your crew needs to consist of \u0022good\u0022 kerbals as much as possible. This works as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pilots are terrible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Scientists are okay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engineers are best\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The higher the level, the better (no matter which profession it is)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne engineer is worth \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethree\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E pilots. Pilots are pretty much useless. To have a self-sustaining base, you want to have as few pilots as possible, and as many engineers as possible, and you want everybody\u0027s levels to be up. I\u0027ve been running a base with all level-3 kerbals, consisting of about half engineers and half scientists with a tiny scattering of pilots, and it does okay. The Training Akademy is your friend here, since you can use it to train everybody up to level 3 as long as you have some \u0022seed\u0022 kerbals that learned their profession the hard way and can teach the others.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T14:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal self-sufficiency is a pipedream, not worth the vast expense and hassle it requires.

The former would not be a good fit for UKS, the latter would be. Based on the subsequent comment about trying life support, I was guessing it was the latter, but could go either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, back to the OP: Whether you try UKS or not totally depends on what experience you\u0027re looking for. If you just want to save on shipping tonnage (e.g. fuel) up from Kerbin, and want to spend most of your time exploring and flying rocketships, then UKS isn\u0027t good for that. If what you want is a challenge that\u0027s all about putting a base together (as Geschosskopf said, pretty much a game unto itself), then UKS can be tons of fun. It\u0027s all a matter of what experience you\u0027re looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a worthwhile point that you can do a lot with partial-efficiency recycling. In USI-LS just stack up on the fertilizer and you can leave your Kerbals on their base for years, even decades. (If only there was a bigger fertilizer container). In TAC it\u0027s a bit fiddlier, but I think you can get it so food is your only consumable and it\u0027s not *that* hard to ship a big supply of food out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother excellent point. It\u0027s also worth pointing out that if you\u0027re using TAC-LS, it has some parts that can recycle wastewater back to water, and CO2 back to oxygen (not 100% efficiency, but fairly high). So if you want somewhat of a life support experience without the complexity of UKS, you can stretch your resupply schedule (e.g. don\u0027t need to take as much water/oxygen along since they\u0027re recyclable, just be sure to bring plenty of snacks).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T15:08:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T16:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a worthwhile point that you can do a lot with partial-efficiency recycling.

Still, you only need 1/5 the Fertilizer as you do Mulch. The 2.5m greenhouse starts with 500 Supplies and 500 Fertilizer. This means you can recycle all your Supplies 5 times, and get a 6th time for free becuase this runs at 120% efficiency. So your original 500 Supplies is effectively 3500 (500 to start with and 3000 recycled) before you run out of Fertilizer. And once the Fertilizer\u0027s gone, you can squeeze nearly 500 more Supplies out of it running at 50% efficiency. So a single 2.5m greenhouse will feed 1 Kerbal for nearly 10 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, the 2.5m Supply tank holds 4500 Supplies, weighs about the same as the 2.5m greenhouse, only costs $1000 compared to $5000, and has stack nodes on both ends, making for easier ship design. So the 2.5m greenhouse, and thus Fertilizer, are only really necessary if you plan to feed a large crew for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: When planning long-term missions using USI-LS, use a waste allowance of about 10% of your supplies on top of any safety margin you want to build in. This is because USI-LS has random events where a week or 2 of Supplies will \u0022fall out the airlock\u0022. While the daily chances of this happening are quite small, it\u0027s practically inevitable at least once during a mission lasting years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing about life support mods in general is to always put probe cores on your ships. That way, if the crew starves, you can still bring the ship home \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
