It didnt end up like that. First mistake i made, I started my 90 degree turn early. then just a series of events went bad. I ended up with a big orbit that would meet up with the mun. I thought that was cool, passes the mun. then was on a different track, one i actually liked better, it was quite bigger, but i was still orbiting kerban/kerbin. So, after that it ended up i was going to go by the mun again, so when i entered the mun\u0027s orbit, i decided to try to stay in the mun\u0027s orbit. So, i boosted my rocket in a random direction for about 3 seconds, then went to the map, all of a sudden i was orbiting the sun at almost 11,000M/s. Any suggestions on what to do? Im pretty much BRAND NEW to Kerbal Space Program. I can barely manage to orbit. obviously. Jeb, Bill, And Bob are stuck. i have a decent amount of gas. I dont think its enough to bring me home but im not sure, I have 700/1440. in my tank. I sort of like the idea of being in a big orbit, for the fact that this ship was meant to orbit anyway. which for me basically means i stuck a bunch of big solar panels on the sides. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have any questions/Suggestions please reply, ill try to reply to you within around 5 hours. unless im sleeping.
