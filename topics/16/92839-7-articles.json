Thus, even though horizontal burn might be more efficient for infinite TWR (i.e. impulse burns), in practice, there might be terrain in the way or it might be hard to perform accurately enough to keep apoapsis down low enough in order to keep horizontal burn the most efficient transfer method (let alone the fact that it requires an infinite TWR i.e. impulse burn). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end, you and LethalDose began to discuss the effect of finite TWR on horizontal burn. LethalDose provided the equations necessary to calculate the required burn angle, as a function of TWR, to balance gravity such that the craft could move horizontally across the surface. For low TWR (which you mention above is both cheaper and has more overall deltaV), the angle becomes more vertical, such that more fuel is wasted preventing vehicle from falling, and in the limit of TWR = 1, the angle is completely vertical such that all fuel is wasted to prevent the craft from falling, and none goes into accelerating the craft horizontally. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angle required is theta = arcsin(1/TWR); the wasted energy/sec is TWR(1-cos(theta)).

On the one hand, you can do the asymptotic calculations on the back of an envelope in 5 minutes and get an answer that\u0027s within 1% of being correct virtually all the time (This is like the vertical ascent: quick and dirty, but less efficient/accurate). On the other hand, I can use the exact method to get the exact answer and the calculation will take 8 days to run through (\u003Cstrong\u003EAlways \u003C/strong\u003Ethe most accurate result).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich one do you think I\u0027m going to choose?

The cost discussion was related to Mr. Horseman\u0027s challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this thread, we are talking about for a given craft with high TWR, which transfer method will require least deltaV to get out of Mun\u0027s SoI: vertical or horizontal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are all aware of the potential gains to be made to the total deltaV of the craft by reducing TWR i.e. using a lighter engine, but the focus of this discussion is not on getting the most deltaV of the craft by picking the right engine, but of the deltaV required by the different transfer methods for a given craft design (one with high but finite TWR). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, LethalDose and I provided theoretical calculations for the deltaV required for the different transfer methods (LethalDose even conducted super-accurate simulations of vertical launch with finite TWR and mass loss), and showed that while horizontal impulse burn is most efficient (it\u0027s the lower limit on deltaV), in practice, it is not possible, since there might be terrain to clear and it requires an impulse burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end, I showed that for infinite TWR, if one climbed only \u003Cstrong\u003E300 m\u003C/strong\u003E (by accident or to avoid terrain), it would pay to have just departed vertically. For finite TWR, I used LethalDose\u0027s excellent results to calculate the height at which point it pays to depart vertical is reduced-- for a TWR of 6, it was only 1 km, and for TWR 3, it was 7.5 km. Thus, even though horizontal burn might be more efficient for infinite TWR (i.e. impulse burns), in practice, there might be terrain in the way or it might be hard to perform accurately enough to keep apoapsis down low enough in order to keep horizontal burn the most efficient transfer method (let alone the fact that it requires an infinite TWR i.e. impulse burn). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo that end, you and LethalDose began to discuss the effect of finite TWR on horizontal burn. LethalDose provided the equations necessary to calculate the required burn angle, as a function of TWR, to balance gravity such that the craft could move horizontally across the surface. For low TWR (which you mention above is both cheaper and has more overall deltaV), the angle becomes more vertical, such that more fuel is wasted preventing vehicle from falling, and in the limit of TWR = 1, the angle is completely vertical such that all fuel is wasted to prevent the craft from falling, and none goes into accelerating the craft horizontally. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angle required is theta = arcsin(1/TWR); the wasted energy/sec is TWR(1-cos(theta)). The graph of that function looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gh085mV.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/gh085mV.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor sqrt(2) TWR, approximately 41% of the fuel spent is fighting gravity vs vertical\u0027s 100% (however, fuel spent fighting gravity decreases as horizontal velocity approaches orbital due to centripetal lift).
