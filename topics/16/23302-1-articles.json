Assuming there\u0027s adequate power, the thrust they provide is very useful for extreme low gravity environments like Gilly, Bop and Minimus where a sneeze could put you in orbit. On Gilly it\u0027s impossible to drive effectively without one. Interestingly enough, on Minimus, when I turned the rover upside down in a Dukes Of Hazard attempt, it turned it into a VTOL which was very interesting to fly until the solar sails got sheered off and instead of Luke Duke I was doing my best GiR impersonation *insert manic screaming here*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hav0c13","CreatedById":80771,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T12:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently trying to re-land a mobile command base on minmus cause I lost the first one due to low grav tumbleweeding.

Small, light rovers to move just a Kerbal or 2 around are really a waste, both in the dV needed to get them there and the trouble they have getting traction. I mean, you can fly all way from the ground on Minmus to LKO with just your EVA jetpack, so that alone is capable of letting your Kerbals explore pretty much the entire place without need of a rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you\u0027re worried about running out of jetpack fuel, or want to send out a group of Kerbals without having to move them 1 at a time, you can make a \u0022super jetpack\u0022. Just tape however many lawn chairs to a small RCS tank/thruster assembly and fly it around as you would Kerbals alone. Either way, this is a great opportunity to learn how to do EVAs in space, learn translation skills later useful in docking, and get the hang of translating hovering landers. Just never get up very high or go very fast unless you really mean it, because of the slightly terrifying ease with which you can accidentally achieve escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut OTOH, the \u0022super jetpack\u0022 also has other practical advantages. First, it can serve as a lifeboat for the whole crew, like if the main lander tips over (which is rather annoyingly easy to do on Minmus). Second, if you put a small probe core (and power) on it, you get the navball and other instrumentation you don\u0027t have on EVA, which makes it easier to get back to the lander (using the target function) and also to get back to Kerbin if need be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4nxs","CreatedById":80680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T14:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remapped the rover controls to the numpad (8 4 5 6).
