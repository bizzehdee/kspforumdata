In the end I just used my Duna craft design because I WAY overdid it with the amount of fuel in my Eve interplanetary stage. This caused it to weigh 125 tons, which was ridiculous and pulled less delta V than with the much smaller design I had made for my Duna lander, I just took out the lander stage and revised the tug a little. Thanks for the help either way!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-07T02:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, autostrut just the main engine at the center, at the bottom, to the \u0022root part\u0022.
