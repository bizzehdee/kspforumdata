A resupply vehicle (like the ATV) to my station in Kerbin orbit and put it in a slowly approaching orbit so that I lose as little fuel as possible. So, it would take a few days days for the ships to meet. During that period, I have time to do other stuff with other ships (sure I could timewarp, but that\u0027s no multitasking fun xD)... In mechjeb, there is \u0022closest approach in..\u0022 but it\u0027s only for one or two orbits, just like the KSP already does with those pink arrows. Kerbal alarm clock also doesn\u0027t have a lot calculations except the basic KSP ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like how the guys at ESA say after 5th June ATV launch \u0022docking in 13:46 GMT on 15 June 2013!\u0022 That\u0027s exactly what I need =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
