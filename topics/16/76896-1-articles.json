All of these things work, as long as they don\u0027t hit the tank directly. As someone pointed out, you can place them vertically on the outside of the booster, and you will still get some rotation away from the ship, by virtue of the fact that they\u0027re firing off of the center of mass of the booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, you can change it to \u0022answered\u0022 by going back to the first post, editing it, and going to \u0022advanced\u0022, and you should see an option there to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-08T14:33:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2014 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain_Brian","CreatedById":114608,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T14:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool, I\u0027ll try that!
