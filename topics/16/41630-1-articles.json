So, I recommend you get Firespitter. Make a simple plane with the pontoons under it. Be sure to include ladders that reach down into the liquid because swimming Kerbals can\u0027t climb onto floating objects but they can grab ladders. You\u0027ll need to put wheels in the pontoons if you want to land on terra firma afterwards, and that will require you to strut every pontoon part to its neighbor about 4 times, plus strut each pontoon part to the wing or fuselage once on each side. Thus, while the pontoons will turn to slinkies as soon as they touch dry ground, the struts will at least keep the pieces lined up enough to taxi more or less in a straight line and allow you to take off from land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T20:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy money\u0027s on that totally exploding on contact with the \u0022liquid\u0022 (because the oceans are NOT water).

Make the underwater fins out of structural panels and I-beams, not wings. Be sure to give it very long side outriggers or otherwise it will uncontrollably roll over once it gets going. You will find it totally unable to turn, however, regardless of the number of rudder both above and below the surface, except at very low speed. But this is a pure boat, at best and amphibious boat, not a seaplane.
