My movements are more mellow since I slowed the keyboard repeat function. I also increased the delay time for repeat. Maybe someone else can try this if they are having the same problem to verify that it does help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s251.photobucket.com/user/kf4ldp/media/keyboard.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg297/kf4ldp/keyboard.jpg:original\u0022 alt=\u0022keyboard.jpg:original\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
