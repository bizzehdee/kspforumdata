I seem to keep getting stuck. How do I... declare victory? I put a stayputnik in orbit. I thought that would be a noteworthy mile stone and be worth something. But then it\u0027s like I\u0027m stuck. I can\u0027t move on from that point. I can\u0027t get back to the launch center. I finale had to shut the game down and reopen it. Or as an experiment I tried to launch some thing out at escape velocity. Again stuck and had to turn it off. Or I put some thing into Muner orbit. But now what watch it circle forever? Had to shut it down again. No credit for what I assumed would be a mile stone. What does the abort button do? I crashed a probe into the Mun. It would then let me abort but I didn\u0027t want to just start the mission over at the pad so I clicked out of it and then the camera was just stuck on the Muner surface, I couldn\u0027t get back to the abort, again with the restart. Am I just completely missing the goals or is there some way to declare the mission parameters and declare victory or at least end it in some way that you could get some form of credit? Failing that is there a list of mile stones that will give credit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T06:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game is sandbox, and doesn\u0027t reward you for accomplishing things.
