The bigger issue may be that KSP doesn\u0027t use profiles. Someone would need to send you their entire settings.cfg.

In fact, I\u0027ve found that using the joystick to fly rockets is terrible, since it\u0027s hard to get the precision needed for maneuvering. You either have to have a big dead zone, which causes jerky maneuvering, or a small dead zone, which tends to result in little phantom torques and is even worse. The throttle is indispensable, however! It\u0027s a whole different game once you can use the analog throttle to get fine control. I just disconnected the joystick from the throttle, and only use the throttle axis, and the thumb button on the throttle for staging (less likely to accidentally hit that than something on the keyboard).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jebodiah1976","CreatedById":77095,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T20:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpeedDaemon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpeedDaemon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...

Usually the stick gives you pitch and roll, and twist is yaw, which is fine for aircraft, but rockets you really want pitch and yaw on the stick and twist for roll. Again, better to just leave the stick out when flying rockets, and leave it set up for space planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T15:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy joystick throttle broke a week ago and I don\u0027t understand how anyone plays using the keyboard for throttle.
