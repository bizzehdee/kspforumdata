I just docked the fifth module to the station and it was wobbling too much before it exploded. The core is poorly planned and lacked support. I\u0027m still in denial so my question is: did the station explode because of the stress from the wobbling or the number of parts (which I think is well over 500)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T14:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSC is on the equator, so just launch east and you will get a pretty good equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECauses for exploding stations are wobble and sometimes clipping parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"corvus2606","CreatedById":57190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T14:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esome mods also have trouble with switching vesels causing them to explode. something about physics loading. best bet if you\u0027re using mod parts is to always switch via the space center.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T15:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jploh\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jploh\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a way to have a near-perfect equatorial orbit without MechJeb? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.
