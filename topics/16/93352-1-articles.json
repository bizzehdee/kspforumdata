Check where the CoM is, and try to add parts in turn to the front and back of the tank, so that the balancing point for the plane stays close to the middle of the tank. This will minimise CoM movement due to burning off fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor multi-tank planes, the balancing rule applies the same, but it\u0027s crucial to make sure that the engines draw fuel from the middle tank (with the CoM in it) first. Consequently, you need to make sure the engines aren\u0027t attached directly to the tanks (unless you have 1 engine per tank), and use fuel hoses so that the fuel reaches the engines from the middle first. If you\u0027re using parallel tanks, it\u0027s only important that the CoM is in the middle on the \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E (front to back) axis - in other words, you don\u0027t need to put the CoM in a tank as long as it\u0027s between two tanks that are going to drain evenly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines always draw from the furthest away tank (by number of part connections). If two or more tanks are equally far away, it will draw from them in a balanced way, but if one is nearer it will drain it empty first. This will move your CoM. Some parts won\u0027t let fuel flow through them, so watch out for that - these can be a help and a hindrance, but you can always work around them with fuel pipes if you know they\u0027re there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDraining fuel doesn\u0027t change CoL, just CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why parts have the functions they have and not others, that\u0027s just how the game\u0027s designed. If you really want fuel in the wings, there may be mods that do this, but actually wings are rarely in line with the CoM so you\u0027d still have the same problem.
