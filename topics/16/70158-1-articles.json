You could use more DV it you didnt want to wait. Eve is WAY more trouble than it\u0027s worth. I remember when I made a Minimus Launchpad base, and the Kethane deposit was 10km away from the ore. I used a rover and it was awful. took 1km to slow down. Gilly would be IMPOSSIBLE for rovers, just use a hopper ship. It will be WAY better than using a rover or landing on eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
