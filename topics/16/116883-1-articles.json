Either send an empty capsule with a probe core for control, or attach another empty capsule below the one with your pilot in it (I assume you are using a Mk1, single crew capsule). Then, as the others said, EVA your rescuee over to the empty capsule."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T03:35:53Z","Content":"What the previous posters said: send up a ship with an empty seat, EVA your kerbal across, board, land it.\n\nHowever, it\u0027s worth noting that if you\u0027re feeling lazy, you don\u0027t actually need a ship to bring your kerbal home.

To help put things into perspective:  just a couple months before I wrote the above advice, there wasn\u0027t *\u003Cu\u003Eany reentry heating at all\u003C/u\u003E* in the game-- it was a brand-new thing at the time I was writing, and they\u0027ve tweaked it a lot since then.  In particular, at the time I wrote that, it was possible for an EVA kerbal to come all the way from Minmus and slam into atmosphere at over 3000 m/s, even *\u003Cu\u003Estraight down\u003C/u\u003E*, and have no problems at all.\n\nNow?  ...Not so much.  ![;)](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nAnyway.
