In the latter case, it doesn\u0027t take much force to bend the Claw and send things all out of whack. The common recommendation is to set your grabber up in a puller configuration, but still: bending will be problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means is that a) you can\u0027t seriously expect to apply the full thrust of a Mammoth without ill side effects, even without gimbals. For what it\u0027s worth, my personal limit was on the order of 500kN, but I guess you can get 5 different opinions from three people. And b) engine gimbals may give you a bad case of the wobblies even when pulling, and certainly when pushing. Expect to steer it with reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E; it\u0027s advisable to have several control pods, each with a claw, and to distribute them around the rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027m much in favor of a bundle of nukes. Besides fuel economy, you may tweak their thrust individually to make up for the (inevitable) offset between Center of Mass and Thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd these days, bringing an ISRU kit and converting the Asteroid to fuel is probably the smart thing to do. If you don\u0027t want to do it that way, assume 2500t for a Class E rock, 200-300m/s to get a close Kerbin flyby, and again as much to get it into a very lopsided Kerbin orbit.
