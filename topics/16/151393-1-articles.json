I have so many Gigantica array it looks ugly, is there some component that should accompany the Gigatic array, do I need more batteries, I connected 8 more big electric panels but it\u0027s only gone up from 1500 Eglc to 2155 I have no more room, it consists of, 1 lab,25 Kerbal accommodation science jnr,x2.mk3 command modules,x2. Indeed to reach 5.255. Any advice guys would be appreciated. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards Numpty Kerbal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T11:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to understand what you want to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTag is helping, you only need 5k of electric charge, right? Aaand you\u0027re packing solar panels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, you\u0027re doing it wrong. Solar panels only recharge batteries. And batteries are what you really need. Biggest contain 4000 of electric charge, then there are another with 1000, 400, 100, and probably 60. Pack them and do the math.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T11:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the 2.5 meter inline battery is 4000 charge, the 1.25 meter one is 1000, the large radial is 400.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow for an active science station I would use two of the 2.5 meter batteries even if no requirements as both the lab and transmitting data uses power.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo gigatron pannels would be more than enough to power it. bit it need power while in shadow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris Kerball","CreatedById":200845,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-03T13:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks mate, that\u0027s what I am doing wrong...not enough batteries...great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
