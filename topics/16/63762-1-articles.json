Most people build spaceplanes, because they are ultimately more interesting and more efficient, if also harder to build. Jet-boosted rockets (or VTOLs, dropships, landers etc.) tend to be easier and more practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, the most important thing to learn is how to get the most out of an airbreathing engine. If you climb too fast, you run out of air too soon, forcing you to switch to rockets at a low speed and a low altitude. On the other hand, flying too low will just waste time and fuel in fighting drag. Usually it\u0027s the best to get above 10 km as soon as possible, and then start turning so that you are flying almost level at 20 km. After that, keep accelerating while climbing at a slow but steady pace (e.g. 20-40 m/s), until you are about to run out of air. At that point, switch to rockets, close the intakes, and pitch up until you get your vertical speed to at least 100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had enough patience to build useful spaceplanes, so I\u0027m mostly using jet-boosted rockets.

The term SSTO applies to both. I\u0027m a specialist in SSTO booster rockets, at best an amateur with SSTO spaceplanes. But I\u0027ll pass along what I know about both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth types of SSTO start with the payload, of course - the bit you want to get into space - and more importantly, its mass. The payload part does absolutely nothing while the rest of the craft is tasked with getting it into space. So you figure that up first. For spaceplanes, the payload is everything you want to add except jets, jet fuel tanks and intakes. For rockets, it\u0027s everything except the fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for SSTO rockets, the general guidelines are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your payload fraction is 4%. These are super-inefficient rockets we\u0027re talking about here, the opposite end of the spectrum from asparagus. So, if you\u0027ve got a 10 tonne payload, you can expect to launch it with a rocket that has a total mass of approximately 250 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your launch TWR is going to be 1.2. This helps you figure out how much thrust you\u0027re going to want at liftoff using the standard TWR equation (TWR = T/Mg, T=TWR*Mg). That 250 tonne rocket will require 2,943 kN of thrust to take off, so you\u0027re looking at two Mainsails (12 tonnes) or five Skippers (20 tonnes). Design-wise, the Skippers are easier. That ups your deadmass to 30 tonnes -10 for the payload and 20 for the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Your Isp for the entire launch is going to be the atmospheric Isp. This isn\u0027t true but it generates a fuel reserve. For the Skipper, that\u0027s 300.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you just solve Tsiolkovsky backwards to figure out how much fuel you need to generate 4500 m/s of delta-V, using the assumption that the fuel tanks have a 9:1 full-to-dry mass ratio (i.e. M=9Md), and that part of both M and Md is the deadmass:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV=ln(M/Md)*9.81*Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV=ln(9Md\u002Bx/Md\u002Bx)*9.81*Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eln(9Md\u002Bx/Md\u002Bx) = dV/(9.81*Isp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(9Md\u002Bx/Md\u002Bx) = e^(4500/(9.81 * 300)) = 4.613801\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9Md \u002B x = 4.613801Md \u002B 4.613801x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.386199Md = 3.6138019x = 3.613801*30 = 108.41403\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMd = 24.71708, M=9Md = 222.45372 tonnes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake that figure and divide by the number of stacks you want - one per engine, so 5. Each stack will need about 44.491 tonnes of fuel in it - take that figure and divide by 0.5625 (the mass of an FL-T100 fuel tank) and round up - you\u0027ll need 80 FL-T100 fuel tanks per stack. Then its just a matter of picking a combination of tanks that will give you that much fuel. In this case, you want an Orange tank (64 FL-T100 equivalents) and an X200-16 (16 FL-T100) equivalents) in each stack (64\u002B16 = 80). All told you have 200 tonnes of fuel, 25 tonnes of fuel tanks, 20 tonnes of engines and ten tonnes of payload, for a total rocket of 255 tonnes (so the 250 estimate wasn\u0027t that bad). Empty, that sucker\u0027s mass is 55 tonnes, your Isp is 300 - so working Tsiolkovsky forward, it has 4,514 m/s of delta-V. You have five Skippers for 3,250 kN of thrust, so your launch TWR is 1.299, a good starting spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying a single-stage rocket is a matter of playing with your throttle - you won\u0027t need all that thrust once you\u0027re up in the atmosphere. Fly it like you would a normal rocket but watch your gee meter as you ascend, and keep it right at the top of the green zone; if it goes above that level, throttle back. By the time you\u0027re high in the atmosphere, you should be burning horizontal around one-third thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy notes on SSTO spaceplanes are a little less comprehensive - the general guidelines I go with are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) One turbojet engine per 9-12 tonnes of payload (depending on the number of intakes you add). Include any rockets you intend to make the final push to orbit in your payload calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) One Mk1 or Mk2 fuselage per turbojet engine (preferably the Mk2, but in practice the Mk1 is easier to work with)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) One pair of swept wings per 6 tonnes of craft. Delta Wings are the same but they don\u0027t have as good of a mass to lift ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) No fewer than three Ram intakes per engine. Each whole number increase in the ratio of Intakes to Engines adds another half-tonne to the amount your jets can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(i.e. 3:1 gives you 9 tonnes per engine, 4:1 = 9.5t, 5:1 = 10t, 6:1 = 11 t, 7:1 = 11.5 t, 8:1 = 12t - note that this is a guideline, not a hard and fast rule).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want your center of lift slightly behind the center of mass. Slightly above is also good for stability. Your control surfaces need to be as far away from their axis of motion as possible to ensure good control. Rudders need to be as far back as they you can manage and not lined up with the center of mass. Ailerons as far out on the wings as possible, elevators as close to the tail as possible. If you do elevons (combination aileron/elevator), put them somewhere in between. A pair of small control surfaces offers more lifting power than a large control surface for half the mass. Gear must be perpendicular if you want to make if off the end of the runway (actually, if you want to make it as far as the SPH taxiway before exploding); the rear gear need to be lined up with the center of mass if you want to take off without relying on the \u0022ski-jump\u0022 design of KSC\u0027s runway. Expect to go into the drink the first dozen times you try to make a new design take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"palioxis1248","CreatedById":100635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T14:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProtip: For reasonably-sized spaceplanes, you generally shouldn\u0027t need more than 160 units of jet fuel.

You can get into space using less fuel and carrying more weight with a jet/rocket combo than with rapiers. I would also suggest experimenting with small square struts. If you invert them and snap them on you can connect an engine to both sides of the strut, allowing two engines inline so that you do not have the problems of balance and thrust at high altitudes (30k\u002B) that other sstos often run into. As to vtol versus stol, the stol platforms are generally easier for most people to fly and more intuitive. Ultimately, the vtol\u0027s are generally able to carry larger payloads per size, though.
