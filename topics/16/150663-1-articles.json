Loving all the improvements thus far. But kinda struggling to appreciate the World-firsts contracts. My problem is that they keep sending me back to the same places, which is a bit of a grind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst a flyby, then orbiting-gather-science-and-return, then a docking mission... and it asks these for a planet, but also (and separately) for the moons. So, it appears that the game wants me to fly to Duna/Ike about 4-6 times before it is satisfied that I have explored it enough. You can of course just warp forward until you get a different contract, but it will keep recycling the ones you haven\u0027t completed, so at some point it keeps spamming me with docking missions around Duna and\u00A0Ike,\u00A0which I don\u0027t want to do because they are boring and yield very little science (I got that science when I landed on Duna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you guys achieve these targets efficiently? I am now considering to always send multiple\u00A0ships: one lander with all the science and crew, and as a bunch of\u00A0dummy-ships, just so that they can dock. The lander will then do its mission, return, while the dummy ships wait patiently in orbit until the contract comes up. At least I can do that docking contract without waiting for the transfer window.\u00A0These can also carry a thermometer in case someone wants to pay me for science-from-orbit. It appears a little silly to send so many ships - especially when I will get to Jool and its 5 moons. Also, it appears a little weird to send ships ahead to anticipate a contract that hasn\u0027t even come up yet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid any of you already come up with a quicker way to satisfy the Kerbin World-Firsts Record-Keeping Society?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T10:16:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, it is supposed to not ask you to do anything more once you have landed somewhere.
