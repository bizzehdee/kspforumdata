Docking ports, to be precise. Attach them in this order --\u0026gt; top girder, port 1, then attach port 2 to port 1, then the fuel tank to port 2. Port 3 goes on the lower girder, and port 4 goes on the fuel tank, touching or almost touching port 3. When you load the craft on launch, ports 3 and 4 will connect, completing the structure.
