I just cannot get the damn thing to fulfil, even though it says both criteria have been met (both criteria\u00A0 - \u0022Kerbin\u0022 and \u0022Landed\u0022 - have a green tick beside them). I have tried attaching it to an actual ship and landing; I have tried just attaching it to a pod and testing it on the launchpad. Nothing works, it just sits there. Both criteria are met when I conduct the test yet it doesn\u0027t give me it. And no, there is no \u0022start test\u0022 option on right-clicking the decoupler, there is only \u0022decouple\u0022. And yes, it is the correct decoupler. Seriously, am I losing it, or have I found a bug?
