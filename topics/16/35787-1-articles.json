Shut off RCS and use torque to turn towards the target (the purple ball). Activate RCS and thrust towards the purple ball (the prograde marker should appear close to center on it). Close to 50 meters, zero out relative velocity, do it again. Close to 20 meters, zero out relative velocity, do it again. When you get to ten meters, make sure the ports are aligned (switch to the other craft and line up on the first craft), then thrust forward. Slowly...0.2 m/s will do the trick. Adjust at five meters if absolutely necessary. Ports will engage about a meter out; hopefully all is cool and froody. If your alignment is off, the two ports will draw each other in but may take a few seconds before they settle down and an actual connection is made.
