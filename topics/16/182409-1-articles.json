on a lot of other variables.\u00A0 If you make a very small, efficient Mun lander and fly it perfectly, you can get away with a small rocket to start with.\u00A0 But if you bring a lot of stuff (either because the mission requires it or do to design inefficiencies), your rocket will need to be bigger.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would very much recommend that you get used to\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Edesigning from the top down\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Start with your final stage and figure out what you need on it to accomplish its goals.\u00A0 Then figure out what the next stage needs to get your final stage where it needs to be, and so on and so on, until you\u0027ve gotten all the way down to your launch configuration.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also suggest you keep working on delta-v, and playing around the delta-v readout (or a similar mod tool, like Kerbal Engineer Redux) until you\u0027re comfortable with the basics of what it\u0027s telling you.\u00A0 For instance, you may have seen that it typically takes 3,000 to 3,500 m/s to make Kerbin orbit.\u00A0 It\u0027s very helpful to be able to take that fact, and use it to see what kind of a launch configuration will give you that much delta-v.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as your question about thrust, are you also familiar with thrust-to-weight ratio?\u00A0 That\u0027s a more important number than total thrust.\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is\u00A0another data point you can see in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, or fudge by looking at the g-meter.\u00A0 But as far as how much thrust you need, you probably want your ship to start with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E somewhere between 1.3\u00A0and 1.8.\u00A0 Later stages can have progressively less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but It\u0027d keep it above 1 to start with until you\u0027re in orbit.\u00A0 From that point on, anything over 0.5 should suffice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EThe Rocket Equation: Live it, Learn it, Love

Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation, it\u2019s actually a pretty simple matter.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe equation solves for the delta-v a rocket can achieve using three, and only three variables:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E1.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EDry Mass: the mass

efficiency of your engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first two can even be condensed into a single number called the mass fraction (the ratio of dry mass to wet mass), giving you only two variables to work with.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESo if you want a rocket to go further, the equation gives you a few general guidelines:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E1.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EDecrease Dry Mass: this is arguably the most important point, and one I\u2019ll touch on in greater detail below.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut cutting unnecessary fat can pay enormous dividends in terms of delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E2.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EIncrease Wet Mass: that\u2019s a fancy way of saying \u201Cadd more fuel.\u201D\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ESimple enough, as long as the rest of your rocket can handle it.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut be aware that adding fuel runs up against diminishing returns pretty quickly, because that extra fuel equals extra dead weight up until the point it\u2019s burned.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is the core of the \u201CTyranny of the Rocket Equation.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E3.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EIncrease Specific Impulse: this just means selecting an engine with favorable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E numbers for the task at hand.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAgain, simple enough on the surface.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut (again as discussed below) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is just one of many factors you\u2019ll have to balance, and can be a bit of a trap if over-prioritized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s one more range factor that\u2019s not expressed in the classic Rocket Equation, but obviously has a large effect on your ship\u2019s range.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThat\u2019s staging, and while it\u2019s an important topic, I\u2019m not going to get too far into the theory here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EKeep it Simple:\u003C/b\u003E This goes back to the \u201Creduce dry mass\u201D point above.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is almost impossible to overstate how large an effect dry mass can have on your ship\u2019s delta-v.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EI don\u2019t want to get too technical, but a very significant fraction of your ship\u2019s delta-v comes when your fuel level is low, at which point the rocket is very light, and every unit of fuel burned can produce a lot of acceleration.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EKeeping dry mass light really helps amplify this effect.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is actually the major reason why real-life rockets can achieve much greater delta-v per stage than the KSP equivalents \u2013 their fuel tanks and engines are much lighter, giving you much better mass fractions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReducing dry mass can pay other dividends as well.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EYou will get better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E out of your engines, which at a minimum can improve maneuver efficiency, but can sometimes allow you to switch to lighter (or fewer) engines \u2013 further reducing dry mass in a virtuous cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with that as background, it\u2019s always good practice to approach a rocket with the question of \u201Cwhat can I cut?\u201D rather than \u201Cwhat can I add?\u201D\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoonMan22","CreatedById":78400,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-24T00:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

One of the big YMMVs is the 310 m/s requirement to turn a flyby into a capture around the Mun. As far as I can remember, I\u0027ve never had to spend 310 getting into low Mun orbit or to return from the Mun. It\u0027s more like 280 m/s. On the other hand, it takes a whole lot of skill to get a Mun landing down to 580 m/s: you essentially need to do a picture-perfect, nearly-horizontal suicide burn.

That is unfortunate, since the very easy setup is a 1.25m command pod, heatshield with 20% ablator, \u0022400\u0022-sized fuel tank and Terrier engine... which gives around 2.3km/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (if I remember correctly). Using the simplest and most obvious upper stage can get you down to the surface of the Mun, but will never get you home.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore, the design for doing a full Mun-surface-and-back trip needs a touch more thought. The most obvious is to have drop-tanks on your upper stage. An Apollo-style approach is possible but is actually a lot more complicated (separate lander, docking in low Munar orbit, etc.). Or simply making sure that your lifter stage gets you to orbit with another 500 m/s still in the tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022how to get this to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 therefore needs a bigger lifter..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I think that that\u0027s the reason why I always end up building a Mun space station quite early on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter all, the return from the Mun is very minor.

It\u0027s the 580m/s x2 for the landing that is the pain, especially if you need to go home using the same ship: it needs to include a heatshield, parachutes, decouplers and whatnot, all of which are sapping away at your fuel economy.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, therefore, the Mun is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ejust a touch too much\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to do, reasonably, on a single mission without exotic parts.

Therefore you can always combine a little prograde/retrograde and a little radial in/out to make sure that you meet the target craft exactly at your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E as it touches (or, ideally, very very slightly crosses) the target\u0027s orbit. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAlways\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. If you\u0027re having trouble with the tutorial, keep playing with the maneuvre node until it twigs for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd once you have that intercept set up (to less than 1km, touching or crossing orbits), you can do all of the rest simply with the NavBall and map view without any planning required.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou need to know your approximate acceleration. A small craft with a single Terrier probably has an acceleration of around 15-20 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. In the map, click on the intercept chevron to see your \u0022time to\u0022. Click on the NavBall to get target mode. Line up with the retrograde vector to target. Check velocity to target, and divide by your acceleration to get maximum burn time to match orbits. Start burning when you\u0027re about 2/3 of that time away from intercept (absolute minimum is 1/2 your velocity divided by acceleration, but you want a little room for error and therefore the ability to throttle).\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile burning, notice how if you aim off to one side of the retrograde vector, it will move away from where you are aiming. Use that \u0022pushing the marble\u0022 effect to push the retrograde vector exactly over the anti-target (pink cross) marker. If your intercept was relatively close to start with, it will get closer and closer as you do this. Throttle down if the \u0022time to\u0022 countdown stops counting down or slows too much. Stop burning altogether when the intercept chevron starts getting further away from your current location.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust by doing the above, you will perfectly match orbits at maximum efficiency in a minimum of time and effort. You can easily end up dozens of metres from your target at nearly zero difference in velocity with a single burn. Then you can switch to outside view for the docking procedure, which is way harder to start with \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
