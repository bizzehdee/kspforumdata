I\u0027m also toying with the idea of using the occasion as an excuse for trying my hand at establishing a permanent base (to support the operation). However, I\u0027m unsure if it\u0027d be useful enough to be worth it - I like my vanity projects to have at least a little real utility, if only because it gives me more excuses to visit the folly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I see it, I have two options, a VTOL or a rover. Or maybe a hideously over engineered mash up of the two. I\u0027m looking to bounce some ideas around to hopefully spark some inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantages of the VTOL - although it\u0027d essentially be a low-flying lander - would be I can cover ground more quickly, and surface topography wouldn\u0027t slow or hinder me, although because I\u0027d be looking out for interesting features to examine, I wouldn\u0027t want to go \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E fast, which relates to the main disadvantage I see: such a craft would rely on finite resources, and the relative slowness (my sub-orbital hops would have to relatively slow and low) and repeated landings would mean I run the risk of running out of fuel and leaving my craft an expensive bit of junk. Even with a supporting base/fuel dump, I\u0027d have to keep returning to refuel, and the base would probably require many supply runs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a rover, the resource problem is solved: as long as I have some solar panels, my rover\u0027s range is effectively infinite. The problem then arises that rovers are, compared to a low-flying spacecraft, rather slow to cover ground. Also that mountain which to the VTOL would just mean a slight course adjustment means a long detour or a risky climb. Also, I hear that you have to rebind keys or something to prevent flipping, or use docking mode: is there anything basic about KSP rovers I really need to know before I try one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I tried a mash-up of both, would I need legs as well as wheels? That is to say, are wheels tough enough to land on? While using it, what should the ratio of flying to driving be etc?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d probably want to make it a manned mission, so I have a kerbonaut on hand to fix landing legs or wheels, but beyond that I\u0027m not even sure of what size of craft to use in each case; part of me is considering trying more of a \u0022mobile base\u0022 approach with a rover, and this would probably be the scenario where making it a VTOL as well would probably work. However, would a small rover be less likely to suffer damage? What are the pros/cons of each wheel type?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, while I consider myself a pretty competent player, this is not an area I have much experience with, so any help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: it\u0027s a career save but I\u0027ve unlocked all parts.
