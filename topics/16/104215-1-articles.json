I usually encounter before it, and it made me wonder if there is a benefit to attempting to find an encounter on the return? I know in an elliptical orbit, the apoapsis is the point at which you are traveling the slowest. Would it be better to try and encounter after apoapsis to make the capture burn cheaper?\n\nI hope this is making sense, I\u0027m having trouble describing it. (If there are names to describe the two halves of the orbit, I would love to know what they are)\n\nEDIT: OK, what I\u0027m saying is which of the following would be more efficient on the capture burn?

Right?\n\nEDIT: As to the two presented pictures, I think the second one would be more efficient, but both would be suboptimal. Best result here (as for ease of circularization) would be the classic free return \u0022loop\u0022 around the Mun - that should mean arriving slightly ahead of the Mun with Ap slightly above the Mun\u0027s orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T01:23:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deutherius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:51:26Z","Content":"Well, aerobraking with atmospheric bodies is going to become more difficult with re-entry heat. You won\u0027t be able to dip down to 12km around Duna to capture without burning something up, unless you have a heat shield. If I understand correctly, the key element is your speed, the faster you are traveling, the more you will have to burn to capture. We aren\u0027t circularizing till we get there, so eccentricity of your orbit around the sun shouldn\u0027t matter, just how fast you are passing by Duna. So, I guess the question is, which method would produce a slower fly-by, or will it even make a difference?"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T02:10:43Z","Content":"Eccentricity of your orbit will make a difference, it is however something you will have little control over, as it is (in a simple Hohmann transfer) determined by your origin and destination. If you start on Moho and go for Duna (and place Ap at Duna\u0027s orbit), you orbit will be much more eccentric than if you start on Kerbin, your velocity at Ap will be slower, and therefore Duna will be moving faster relative to you, demanding a harder circularization burn and/or more intense aerobraking.\n\nIf you overshoot the Ap, you might be moving faster relative to Duna at randezvous, but in a different direction - the difference in Kerbol-relative speeds might be better for circularization, but the difference in velocities might not.\n\nThat\u0027s where the gravity sling comes in along with the atmo to help.\n\nI\u0027ll be the first one to admit that I have not studied orbital mechanics in depth, though, so I\u0027m just stating what feels intuitive to me based on what little I know from playing KSP...

(1) You are using Dv on your transfer burn in order to raise the Ap beyond the target orbit when you could get a cheaper encounter by burning to a lower orbit which uses less Dv, if you time your transfer correctly, of course. (2) As you already mentioned, at the top of an elliptical orbit is when your are moving slowest, relative to the sun in this case, yes, but since Duna\u0027s orbital velocity around the sun is more or less constant, any additional orbital velocity you bring with you by timing the encounter on the way down from Ap is velocity you will need to cancel out by burning and thus using Dv."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T03:38:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would it be better to try and encounter after apoapsis to make the capture burn cheaper?\n\nSometimes yes, sometimes no. What you want is the encounter that has the smallest relative velocity between the spacecraft and the planet/moon. One way to do this is to make the angle formed by the crossing of the orbits as small as possible. Generally, if the planet/moon is in the part of its orbit where it has passed periapsis and is approaching apoapsis, then you want to encounter the planet/moon before your spacecraft reaches apoapsis (called a Type I transfer). If the planet/moon is in the part of its orbit where it has passed apoapsis and is approaching periapsis, then you want to encounter the planet/moon after your spacecraft has passed apoapsis (called a Type II transfer). The reason for this is that if both are approaching apoapsis, then both have a positive flight path angle. And if both have past apoapsis and are approaching periapsis, then both have a negative flight path angle. By keeping the flight path angles both positive or both negative you reduce the relative angle and, therefore, the relative velocity. If the target planet/moon has a perfectly circular orbit (such as Mun), then it makes little difference whether you use a type I or type II transfer, the magnitude of the relative velocity will be the same, it will just have different direction. Of course a type I trajectory always has a shorter travel time than a type II.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T04:04:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 04:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:07:02Z","Content":"In your Mun examples (and in general when at least one of the orbits has low eccentricity), the closing speed of a post-apoapsis encounter is approximately equal to the closing speed of a comparable pre-apoapsis encounter, due to the conservation of energy and the symmetry of the situation. This is not the case if both you and the celestial body you\u0027re approaching have highly elliptical orbits with different arguments of periapsis. But fortunately, in those cases it\u0027s pretty obvious by inspection where the best (lowest relative velocity) intercept is going to be: you generally just want to look for the smallest closing angle (as others have said).\n\nThe main benefit to a post-apoapsis encounter in my experience is that it can give you much greater flexibility in creating an encounter window. You can essentially dial in whatever \u0022hang time\u0022 you like by boosting or lowering your apoapsis varying amounts above the target body so that you\u0027ll run into it on the way back down from your apoapsis. This can be nice when you don\u0027t want to wait years for a better interplanetary transfer window to come around. You can play with that in your Mun example by exploring how much flexibility you get to move your encounter window around when you allow yourself to play with the height of your apoapsis and then do a post-apoapsis encounter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T05:11:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 05:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T10:46:09Z","Content":"Relative speed shoud be nearly the same.
