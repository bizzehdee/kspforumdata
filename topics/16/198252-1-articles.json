So I gathered a bunch of Duna/Ike contracts and the time has come to do the trip. I\u0027d been twice before, but they were not-too-serious attempts with a big overpowered rocket and a bit of luck too. I transmitted a little bit of science data, not much, then got \u0022lost in space\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo on my third trip I\u0027d done a bunch of planning, and was taking an 8-pax station with a science lab and some Kerbals. I\u0027d done a few tests on electrical demands (it seems 8x 1x6 solar panels is a good rule of thumb to keep up with a busy Science Lab) and I understand comms required transmitting power too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI knew the timing would be critical so I read up on the angles etc and made the trip, after waiting a number of days in Kerbin orbit (and was able to check out the science gear too). I got a burn which took me to an encounter with Duna but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E was 18Mm, and the orbital insertion burn was ~1000dV. The specs say it ought to be closer to 250. It was so finely balanced when \u0026amp; how much to do the outwards burn I was afraid to fiddle with it too much. I am guessing some kind of mid-course normal/antinormal or radial in/out would have lowered my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E right down?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T20:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, interplanetary transfers are always extremely finicky for the intercept. Really, all you can do during your initial transfer burn is to get any intercept at all. You always need a mid-course correction. That is always still fiddly, but it\u0027s doable to get a nice low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E that minimizes your capture burn. For duna, it\u0027s fine to even lower your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E all the way down into the atmosphere -- it\u0027s thin enough that there are no heat issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T20:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterplanetary travel is difficult in KSP because there\u0027s nothing to say when you should make your transfer burn and you can\u0027t easily create nodes far in the future. An 18Mm periapsis and 1km/s capture burn suggests that you made the burn at a time when the two planets weren\u0027t well aligned meaning you have a lot of excess velocity when you arrive at Duna, which to me suggests you burned too late. Generally speaking, when heading outwards from the sun you want the target planet to be about 45 degrees ahead of the one you\u0027re orbiting, and when heading inwards it\u0027s about 45-60 degrees behind the one you\u0027re orbiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s often easier to make a pure pro/retrograde transfer burn towards the target and then match its inclination in solar orbit, which also gives you an opportunity to correct your trajectory and adjust your destination periapsis or to compensate for an inaccurate transfer burn- common for long burns with low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E craft as many interplanetary vessels are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there are some helpful guides floating around the forums and the wider internet, the best tool for basic interplanetary travel is the Astrogator mod, which tells you the time until the next transfer window for every planet and the moons around the current planet, the delta-V required to get there and can even create the nodes for you to tweak as you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022156657\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7914680036\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155998-18%E2%80%93110-astrogator-v0102/\u0026amp;tab=comments\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=2944922\u0026amp;embedComment=2944922\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-2944922\u0022 style=\u0022height:296px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T20:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I was able to at least capture a broad orbit with the excess fuel I had.
