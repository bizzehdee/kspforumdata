It\u0027s fast. It can fly nigh straight up. It rolls sharply and stops on a dime. It turns pretty well. (It\u0027ll turn too well if you\u0027re not careful and you can spin it out.) The rudder is useless, but good for trimming landings. I wish I had flaps for the final approach, but I\u0027ve emergency landed it just fine every time I\u0027ve taken it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s not without some sweat-inducing attributes.
