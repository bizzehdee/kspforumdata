Also moar struts, specifically stabilize the engines stacks and I\u0027d probably strut the center stack as well, any tilt while deploying those parachutes (even if they\u0027re on the tank) may result in the top parts falling off. Landing legs - shouldn\u0027t need that many. 4 if you\u0027re comfortable doing a soft landing, 8 at a stretch. To save mass you could swap the large probecore for a small one attached to the fueltank with a octocube strut.
