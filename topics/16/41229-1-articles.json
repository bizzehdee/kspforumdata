Instead of making an SSTO, I\u0027ve made a SSTOL (SERIOUSLY short take off and landing) plane. Very light, huge wing. Stall speed on Kerbin is less than 15m/s but it can easily reach 300m/s by the end of the runway and climb vertically right off the ground. I\u0027m sending it off to Duna on top of a rocket, launched vertically, because making it an SSTO would make it way too heavy to fly as slow as it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for doing it this way is precisely to avoid having long takeoff and landing runs on Duna. I don\u0027t yet know how it will fly there (if at all), but given how slow it can fly on Kerbin, I have hopes it will behave reasonably well on Duna. We\u0027ll find out in a few days. But the thing is a pure airplane, no space capability of its own. It\u0027s just got those jets that burn raw Kethane in non-oxygen atmospheres. So it will deorbit, drop its booster, and hopefully fly down under control, but then never leave Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T04:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed my STOL ssto spaceplane on duna to day on the old dry lakes.
