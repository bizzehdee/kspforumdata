However, after getting back to KSP yesterday after a pretty long break, I keep running in to a strange occurrence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently my rocket has four stacks of fuel-tanks\u002Bengines symmetrically placed around the center stack. Attached to each of those are two more symmetrical stacks. Totaling four stacks in the first ring, eight stacks in the second ring. Below I have posted a picture of how I hooked up my fuel lines. The red lines are where I connected the decouplers. Now, I double checked this about 20 times, there\u0027s no loops or double fuel lines. Also I rebuilt the entire rig from scratch about four times so far. The setup is as it shows in the picture. All stacks have the same amount of fueltanks and the same engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that when I launch my rocket, one side of the asparagus drains \u003Cstrong\u003Eslightly\u003C/strong\u003E faster. Resulting in a massive wobble and a deadly crash. Can someone please tell me what I\u0027m doing wrong? I\u0027m going crazy quadruple-checking every fuel line. Is there perhaps a problem with this specific asparagus setup? What could cause one side of the asparagus to drain half a second faster?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi44.tinypic.com/25ilut2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002225ilut2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPaint picture made by me to indicate my asparagus setup.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope you can help me, thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-06T17:04:33Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2013 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by odeonshiva\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luchelibre","CreatedById":61140,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T22:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be far better if you could provide the craft file for us to test.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pluto101","CreatedById":81607,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T23:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure during launch you\u0027re not encountering any structural failures in your tanks, and that your engines aren\u0027t overheating.

I drop them, and then I would expect tanks 2a and 2b to drain at the same rate and drop at the same time so I have the next stage activate the couplers for both 2a and 2b. However this does not happen, as 2a drains faster and when I drop both 2a and 2b, 2b goes flying up since they still have fuel and the engines are still active.

I am not going back to the VAB, so there isn\u0027t any change in fuel lines. Launch 1, 2a drains first. Revert to Launch. Launch 2, 2b drains first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery strange behavior...and I\u0027m pretty sure my fuel lines are all pretty close to the same height at the top of the tanks.

When the rocket settles down during the burn, revert to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Add the first pair of fuel lines that will form your asparagus system, and re-test as above. This time, you\u0027re looking for pairs of engines to burn out together. This is actually easier with mainsails burning hot; as they burn out, the heat bars should drop away in pairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If there is uneven burning, you know which fuel line pair the problem is in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Add the next pair of fuel lines and re-test the rocket with the new pair\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Repeat #5 until your asparagus system is complete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Return to the VAB to work on staging. If you need to, you can test the asparagus staging in a similar manner, but staging issues are more obvious than fuel line issues so you probably won\u0027t have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Now that your asparagus system is working, you can continue on from there with confidence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"running","CreatedById":82033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T11:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been suffering similar effects lately due to a rocket design that was just to unstable and kept shaking things apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF3 would show the link between fuel tanks being broken during launch/flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight clicking on the specific fuel tank wouldn\u0027t work any more as it was still on the rocket but not connected anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T22:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found that when you stitch tanks together that are already attached in a ring using symmetry, not all the braces will go where they are suppose to. The fix is to build the tank stack in the center, stitch with symmetry, then take a copy of that tank set to use for the onion or asparagus stage. For asparagus, start with a pair from the set copied from the stitched center core, brace to the center core, and get a copy by selecting the tanks at the decoupler including the decoupler.

Shown in the pic is my as yet unfinished Eve lander. It\u0027s a \u0022layer cake\u0022 style asparagus with engines in all three layers firing at the same time (except center engines of course). Basically the asparagus starts by draining the large tanks at the bottom in pairs, then goes into the bottom ring and drains pairs, then joins in\u00A0the bottom inner tank, then splits in two again to go up one level to the outer middle boosters, goes around the ring, joins in the middle, then does the same for the top level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the weird bit. One of the \u0022first\u0022 pair of tanks in the middle layer (first tanks to be used up and jettisoned in middle layer) strats draining at launch. Even more weird is that it doesn\u0027t drain quickly as if it\u0027s not getting any fuel from upstream. It drains quite slowly but still noticeably, so there is fuel from going \u0022through\u0022 it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have checked and double checked the fuel lines. I have rebuilt the entire stack from scratch (three times). I have tried different configurations. I have painstakingly placed the fuel lines in the exact same positions. I have tried doubling up fuel lines.\u00A0I have tried a quadsparagus instead of a twinsparagus. I have yelled at the PC and invoked dark deities. I have drunk beer and I have made diagrams. None of that has worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Solution\u0022: Remove the top layer from the asparagus, making it a \u0022traditional\u0022 self-contained upper stage that only fires when the final middle booster separates. The tanks in the middle layer now drain evenly.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest I don\u0027t lose a huge amount of delta-V from implementing the \u0022solution\u0022, and the booster is already ridiculously efficient (I\u0027m on track to make an Eve ascent vehicle weighing around 260 tons). It does bug me though, and\u00A0I am pretty convinced that this actually is\u00A0a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T7kvl7h.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T7kvl7h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-29T07:42:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/29/2016 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Starlionblue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
