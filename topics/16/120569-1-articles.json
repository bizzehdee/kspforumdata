If so, drain your rocket fuel tanks in the sph to see how the com is affected. As far as lift, I think last I read was 1lift rating per 10 tons, could be wrong on that. I usually use test flights to verify enough lift. I would drop the wing segments and just use the delta to decrease drag,and I think you need to remove the second set of tail fins, the delta wing is your horizontal stabilizer in this case so you only need vertical. Also make sure only the outer control surface is set to roll, the inner should just be pitch, and then tail to yaw only.

For example, if you are building an aircraft intended to fly supersonic, you might want to take area-ruling into account to reduce drag in the supersonic regime (again, there are graphical tools to help you do this). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDont worry though, its not too intimidating, it is entirely possible to cobble together flying craft without endlessly examining graphs and numbers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tools will be able to tell you things like how much lift you are producing, how stable your craft will be, how well you have done your area-ruling and many more things besides. One very useful thing I just discovered is that it will tell you, for a given speed, what angle-of-attck you need to stay in the air. If it is low, like 1-3 degrees, you know you are generating plenty of lift at that speed, if it is high, like 15 degrees say, then you know that something is amiss, maybe you are too heavy, maybe you need a bigger wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-flight there are options to graphically display the lift and drag being produced by all the parts on your craft, it is quite a powerful mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for spiralling on trying to achieve 10k, there are any number of reasons for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could be unable to go fast enough to generate enough lift - I agree that reaching 20k on basic engine might be a push, but you should be able to make 10k, reaching 20k could possibly be done with a larger, 4 engine design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour fuel usage could be shifting your CoL/CoM relationship, damaging your stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could be trying to go too high too soon, before you have built up enough speed - another thing the FAR tools will tell you is the lowest speed that will generate enough lift to keep your currently aircraft in the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket engine - it is totally valid to have a rocket onboard, but it does add a lot of weight for an air-breather. It might boost you to a higher altitude, but once it is out of fuel, you may not be able to stay there if your aircraft is now in a speed/height regime that it cannot fly in (especially with the now-dead-weight rocket). It will also be very easy to over-speed, at worst causing total breakup, at best causing unexpected aero effects, for example, if your craft is not designed to be supersonic and your rocket boosts you to Mach 3! It would be something I would leave out until you are more confident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last tip, especially if you move to FAR (Im not sure if it is simulated in stock) - long, narrow wings (a low \u0022aspect ratio\u0022 - ratio of length to average \u0022chord\u0022 [the distance from trailing edge to leading edge]) have a much better lift/drag ratio than stockier, wider wings, delta wings included.

You need to shift your your CoL backwards a little if this is the case. Try sliding the winglets on the front backwards a little. Changing control surfaces will improve control but is not necessary. Your fundamental problem is CoL is sitting right on top of CoM and you haven\u0027t factored in fuel drain. You have plenty of lift for that design. I would avoid installing FAR until you feel comfortable with stock aero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The CoL should always be behind CoM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The closer CoL is to CoM the more unstable/maneuverable the plane is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Conversely, the further the CoL is from the CoM the more stable/less maneuverable the plane is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is finding the right balance of CoL and CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T14:08:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tarheel1999\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T14:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would also remove that inner wing piece all together.

If you remove the canards and the inner wing, it should balance out and your CoL will be close to the same place.

Except, in my opion, emptying tanks of fuel is a bad strategy for making a craft stable. It will not change the Dry CoM and it will still be unstable when the tanks are getting empty. Dry Mass need to be moved forward or wings backward.\n"}]}
