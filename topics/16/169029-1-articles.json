I\u0027ve done a pair of 2-man returns and, the last one, a 3-man return. Eve is a unique animal, and IMO,\u00A0the pinnacle of the stock game. I\u0027ve learned some hard lessons, but had a great time. A successful Eve mission is the only thing that still gives me that first Mun-landing feeling of accomplishment. Some of the lessons I\u0027ve learned are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, I pay no attention to cost or even mass. Some guys may be able to make a cost-effective Eve ascent vehicle, but I am not among them. I just use whatever I need, cuz I already know it\u0027s gonna be a loss. Second is to design the mission backwards. This is something that I think we all sort-of do with every mission (design the lander first, then the transfer vehicle, then the launch vehicle), but it\u0027s especially important on Eve. I think my first mission was a bit like yours. I would launch a behemoth, refuel it at Minmus, then see if it worked. This was incredibly frustrating and time-consuming, but it finally worked. It was an ugly ship, with Mainsails and Darts, but I was ecstatic at my success. Later, though, I felt like I got off easy\u00A0because I used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. I landed empty, drilled, refueled, then dumped the equipment and launched. This was before I discovered the forum, so I don\u0027t have any screenshots. I just never bothered with them back then. For my next mission, I wanted to do a 2-man return without drilling, so I went to work again. This time, I didn\u0027t wanna waste so much time (and I had finally discovered the forum and learned the use of the Alt-F12 menu), so I used my current method. I now build my ascent vehicle, Alt-F12 it to Eve orbit, turn on ignore max temperature, then get it on the ground. Launch and see if it can make orbit. This can take awhile, as you\u0027ll certainly need to make changes, but it works really well. Once I can reliably make orbit, I begin working on a way to get it to the surface. This can be as tough as designing the ascent vehicle itself. You\u0027ll notice by this time that, in order to make orbit, your ascent vehicle has become larger than you\u0027d like. This means getting it to the surface in one piece is going to be difficult. You\u0027ll have to keep adding your shields until you can stop yourself from burning up. Once you can reach the surface, you\u0027ve got it. The rest (designing a launch and transfer vehicle) is a breeze by comparison. You can make your launch vehicle a bit smaller if you don\u0027t mind taking the time to refuel at Minmus, but I\u0027ve grown tired of that. I just figure it\u0027s gonna cost me 2,000,000 bucks and send it. I don\u0027t have as much game time as I\u0027d like anymore, so I try not to waste it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou want a 4-man return, which I\u0027ve yet to do,\u00A0but my last mission was a 3-man return with the Mk1-2 (which is obviously the heaviest command module in the game), so I know it can be done. You can make it work with the rover as well, you\u0027ll just have to do that much more testing to make it work. I can usually build a ship and have a pretty good idea of what it can do. However, nothing ever seems to work the way I think it will on Eve. Just because you think something\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0work, doesn\u0027t mean it will. You really have to put in the work and test everything. At least I do, anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are my 2 most recent Eve missions if you want to have a look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2-man mission:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XhnwnFs.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XhnwnFs.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the most important lessons I\u0027ve learned is the use of shields placed high up for drag. This prevents large ships from flipping and burning up during the descent. Getting it to work right was a huge \u0022aha\u0022 moment for me. Of course, getting rid of the inflatables prevents its own challenge. With this ship, I actually attached them to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s.

I wanted to use the Mammoth this time, but I always have trouble with ladders when the fuselage changes sizes. My Kerbals kept getting stuck on the way up or the way down. I finally scrapped the ladders and went with the Lander Can at the bottom for easy access. Of course, I couldn\u0027t get a single lined up right, so I had to use 4x symmetry. This obviously added a lot of unnecessary weight, but it worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SOjedJN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SOjedJN.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Alp1lcR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Alp1lcR.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy most recent success, is also my proudest.
