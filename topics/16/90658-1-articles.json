I have a question about calculating Delta-V that is probably extremely basic and I hope I don\u0027t offend any physics whizzes out there. Here it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn calculating the Delta-V your rocket has, all the literature I have read mentions the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, which I have pondered over and understand. What I am wondering though, is if you are on, say, Gilly, does one replace the gravity constant of 9.82 with the gravity of Gilly? In other words, does my rocket on Kerbin have a different Delta-V than when on Gilly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about in orbit around a certain planet, does the gravity constant change depending on how close/far away you are from the planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any clarity and knowledge y\u0027all may impart upon this poor wretch!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-18T19:39:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2014 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by justidutch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T19:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, you always use 9.82 m/s^2 as it is simply a means of converting the units of the Isp from seconds to m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T19:34:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou keep g0 the same, it\u0027s just a constant and dV doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E change given your location.
