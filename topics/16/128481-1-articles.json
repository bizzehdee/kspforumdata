Basically, I want to make a torch ship out of a habitat module, a Round-8 tank, and at least one Vector, and just go sightsee around the system.

thoughts of using maneuver nodes or projected trajectory in the map view, if you had any.\u00A0 The game gets horribly confused when your velocity is very high (and by \u0022very high\u0022, I mean

before re-entry heat and aerodynamics was a thing, I had an Eve land-and-return mission, and it had nearly arrived at Eve when I had a facepalm moment: I realized that I didn\u0027t send my kerbalnaut any way to get home.\u00A0 That is, I had this big mean ol\u0027 lander that would do the job to land on Eve and then return to low Eve orbit, but then didn\u0027t have any more fuel to get home.\u00A0 I had originally been planning to send a separate interplanetary crew-return vehicle, but then stupidly forgot about it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan

decided to make it a point of honor that the kerbalnaut would have his return vehicle waiting for him when he arrived at Eve.\u00A0 So I built a ship with the most insane dV I\u0027ve ever done in KSP, basically an ion engine with oodles and oodles of xenon drop tanks.\u00A0 Pre-1.0, reentry wasn\u0027t dangerous, so I figured just burn for Eve hell-for-leather and arrive super-fast, then
