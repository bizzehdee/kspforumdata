My long-established playstyle involves building up a lot of reusable infrastructure. \n\nI tend to put orbital transfer/refueling stations around pretty much every body I visit, with reusable landers running back and forth from station to surface and back again, spaceplanes moving kerbals and fuel from KSC to LKO, and nuke-powered interplanetary tugs/shuttles hauling kerbals and fuel from one orbital station to another...aerobraking at any destination which allows it. \n\nConceptually, the whole thing is pretty similar to the infrastructure popularized in the 1950\u0027s by Werhner von Braun/Willey Ley/Chesley Bonestell.\n\nIt occurs to me that this sort of infrastructure is going to be MUCH more difficult to pull off with the new 1.0.x re-entry heating. Seems Clamp-o-trons don\u0027t make very good heat shields, not even Clamp-o-tron Sr\u0027s. (Who\u0027d\u0027ve guessed?) And for obvious reasons, even a redesign that puts a docking port at one end and a heat shield at the other is not going to make for a permanent/long-term reusable vehicle, what with the temporary nature of anything \u0022ablative\u0022.\n\nAnd for equally obvious reasons, I don\u0027t want to give up on aerobraking if I can help it--I am ... unfond ... of the idea of keeping 1000m/s dV dedicated to a powered return to LKO (on return from Mun/Minmus/Duna, and even more when coming from further away). But in the absence of ballute-type high-altitude/low-heating deployable/reusable reentry parts, I don\u0027t see an obvious way to aerobrake one vehicle many times.\n\nI\u0027m sure some of you clever people out in Forum-land (especially the FAR/DRE users who\u0027ve been facing this for years) have already worked out suitable approaches to solving this little dilemma. So, any tips/tricks/pointers/clever design concepts? I\u0027m all ears (metaphorically speaking, of course)!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T00:10:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget**\n  \nMark as Answered"},{"CreatedByName":"Destroyer713","CreatedById":136956,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:43:20Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got my own question. How well do shielded docking ports work with the new re-entry heating? Do they explode like regular docking ports will, or do they tolerate heat better?"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:18:47Z","Content":"As you noted, powered return is an effective substitute for aerobraking - burning fuel instead of burning ablative shielding to slow yourself to a safe reentry speed.\n\nAnother approach you could try is to make the heat shields replaceable. In earlier versions of the game I had a line of SSTO spacefighters with rear-mounted docking ports, and a ground vehicle which could attach various modules to that port. Instead of this:\n\n[spaceship]\n\n[Heat shield]\n\nYou could do this:\n\n[spaceship]\n\n[Docking port]\n\n[Docking port]\n\n[Heat shield]\n\nAnd just swap out the heat shields as they are expended."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:19:29Z","Content":"I am currently using engines as heat shield in 1.02 for my rocket ssto. No need for heat shields with abalative. Sure you won\u0027t be able to aerobrake going in with 10km height but you can always touch the edge of the atmosphere (30 to 60km if you wanna push it 25km) and easily survive even a 4000 m/s entry. If you are too fast it might take more than 1 pass to slow down but it generally takes 2 passes max if im returning from a far planet. 1st pass gets me in to orbit and 2nd slows me down to the point where i can land."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T00:28:39Z","Content":"The stock airbrakes do a wonderful job of preventing re-entry heating and also tend to keep the correct end of the ship facing the heat."},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T03:28:33Z","Content":"Hmm...airbrakes. Haven\u0027t done anything with those yet, as they\u0027re new in this version and I haven\u0027t unlocked them yet. Even if I had, I doubt I\u0027d\u0027ve thought seriously about those for what\u0027s basically a deep-space vehicle... but you say they work reasonably well as a high-altitude drag source to allow meaningful apo decreases without dangerous levels of heating?\n\nReplaceable heat shields: I had thought of that, but was hoping someone had come up with something a bit more straightforward. It does add one more thing I have to keep bringing up from KSC, thus makes for more complex logistics--but obviously that doesn\u0027t faze me too awfully much or I\u0027d be doing single-launch throwaway Apollo-style missions rather than running an orbital-infrastructure business, right? :-D\n\nMaybe airbrakes as the primary high-altitude braking method, with a replaceable heat shield as emergency backup...?

I tried using a heatshield without ablator because the max temp is listed as 3400 degrees. After looking at the heat debugging info it has almost no thermal mass with no ablator, so I\u0027m not sure if it hasn\u0027t blown up because it actually works the way I thought, or if aerobraking just isn\u0027t that stressful on the craft. \n\nHere\u0027s a pic, although not a very good one. Just ignore the station piece it\u0027s pushing around, the ship is the fat one with the tiny neck.\n\n\u003E ![cfbjRFo.png](http://i.imgur.com/cfbjRFo.png)\n\nI haven\u0027t taken it out of the system, but it returns from Minmus and aerobrakes at 32-33km regularly.
