Increments are 5x, 10x, 50x, and so on. During this time warp all physical calculations are suspended. That means you can\u0027t fire your engines, can\u0027t turn your ship, and can\u0027t run into other ships.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhysics time warp has slower increments of 1x (obviously), 2x, 3x, and 4x. In this warp, all physics calculations are still being performed, but with more time in between each clock \u0022tick\u0022 (a sub-second increment where all the physics calcs are done over again). This can lead to some problems with stuff breaking at 3x and 4x, but 2x is usually fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo activate physics warp, hold alt (or whatever the mod key is for Mac/Linux) and tap \u0027\u0026gt;\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
