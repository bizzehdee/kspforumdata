I deleted my \u0027Demo version starter ships\u0027 document because I thought there\u0027d be no demand for it :-(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you performed the training mission \u0022To The Mun, Part 1\u0022? (Start Game \u0026gt; Training). That gives you a ship already in orbit around Kerbin with plenty of fuel and power to transfer to Mun, land, re-orbit, return to Kerbin and land. (That was interesting, I haven\u0027t played with the demo for a while. No wonder I bought the full game once I had!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important thing for getting to Mun is to burn (your engines) with the ship pointing prograde (in the direction you\u0027re travelling, yellow circle with \u0027wings\u0027 on the navball) roughly as Mun rises above the horizon - watch for this in flight mode. Switch to map mode (press M) and watch the apoapsis (high part of orbit) on your blue orbit line expand out towards Mun\u0027s orbit. When it intercepts Mun\u0027s it will change colour to indicate that you have an encounter. Press X to turn off your engines and off you go :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor getting to orbit a good first ship starts with a command pod with a parachute on top. This is the \u0027recovery stage\u0027 that will land when you\u0027ve finished. Add a stack decoupler, an advanced SAS module, an FL-T400 fuel tank and then an LV-909 beneath the command pod - this will complete getting into orbit and, when you want to, push you back out of orbit to land. Finally; put another stack decoupler, two FL-T800 fuel tanks and an LV-T30 engine to launch and power most of the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave then launch this vehicle. On the pad, once the camera \u0027settles\u0027, press T to engage the SAS unit. Press left-shift until throttle is at max then press the spacebar to activate the main LV-T30 engine. Standard ascent advice for beginners is to go straight up to 10km then disengage SAS (T again), yaw right (D) until the rocket is angled to about 45-degrees above the horizon then re-engage SAS (T once more). Getting to orbit means getting enough height AND horizontal speed so you stay in space instead of falling back down. This turn means you will be accelerating sideways as you climb. When the lower-stage burns-out (the engine stops) press spacebar again to jettison it and again to activate the upper, LV-909, engine. Yaw further right until pitched to only 20-degrees or so above the horizon - more of the thrust is going into building horizontal speed. Press M to switch to map mode and hover your mouse over the \u0027Ap\u0027 (apoapsis, high point of orbit) marker on your blue orbit line. When the apoapsis reaches 75km or more press X to switch off the engines. About 30s before you reach the apoapsis (hovering the mouse over the marker also shows you the time until you reach it) make sure the ship is facing prograde then increase throttle to max again. Burn until a \u0027Pe\u0027 (periapsis, low point of orbit) marker appears and then approaches in front of your ship. Hover the mouse over this and burn a little more until it\u0027s over 70km - you\u0027re now in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to orbit isn\u0027t easy; the first few times you make it is quite an achievement. Practice and, if none of this makes much sense, read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re ready to come home - turn the ship so it is facing retrograde (opposite the way it\u0027s moving) then burn the engines until the orbit line hits the ground. Turn off the engines (X) and press space to jettison the fuel tank and engine; now you\u0027re committed ^^. Watch as the capsule falls, press space again to deploy the parachute anywhere below about 10km. It will first appear \u0027semi-deployed\u0027, slowing you a little, until you get 500m above the ground where there is enough air-density for it to fully-deploy. Then the ship will just float down to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T21:46:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T21:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found this about the most useful page on the wiki.
