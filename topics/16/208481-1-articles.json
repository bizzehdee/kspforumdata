So I edited the \u003Cem\u003ESquad/Sounds/sound_rocket_mini.wav\u003C/em\u003E file\u00A0 - making it longer,\u00A0 playing with the low/high frequencies etc - and it still doesn\u0027t make any difference, even though the WAV file sounds so much different in Wavepad (where I modified it) than in game. No changes I make to these files is reflected in the game, and it\u0027s driving me nuts! Just what the heck do any of these lines of code actually do? It\u0027s possible I have screwed up the precise formatting of these lines of code, but the only changes I made were to these values. I also checked the file against the default version before over-writing it, they looked identical in Notepad\u002B\u002B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I am a noob, at least when it comes to Unity, programming, coding, etc. :)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linkageless","CreatedById":201088,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-08T18:09:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224142139\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221654555294\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002283805\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TimKerbin\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/6/2022 at 11:41 PM, TimKerbin said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI F5, reload F9; I \u00A0even save and quit the game, it makes no difference.
