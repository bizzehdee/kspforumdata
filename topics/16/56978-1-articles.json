It allows you to refuel craft, even stock ones by bring along the gear (connector ports) that you have your kerbal attach to the lander\u0027s fuel tank, then run a hose from the refuel supply and start a transfer. I actually did the same thing but by combining KAS with Kethane addon so I mined the fuel directly from the Mun, converted it to the right type and then transfered it to TWO of my empty landers (with 4 kerbals in each). So now I have a mini moon base and fuel stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Might have to get into the tech tree a bit more to get the required parts, but eventually you can bring that craft home rather then just send a rescue pod to get the Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb The Astronaut","CreatedById":97679,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T14:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethats a great idea jedensuscg.....i havent even looked at the add ons...and or mods....at least yet!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jedensuscg","CreatedById":76475,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T00:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jeb The Astronaut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jeb The Astronaut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethats a great idea jedensuscg.....i havent even looked at the add ons...and or mods....at least yet!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddons are fun, but can be addicting, and a hassle. Mainly during large updates of the base game, some addons can break until an update from their authors. And of course too many addons can cause issues. The smaller addons are not bad to stack, but parts packs are generally a one shot deal unless you mix and match. I like the extra lights from the B9 parts pack, but don\u0027t need the plane parts, so I just use those with the KW rocketry parts, but delete the fairings from that as I prefer procedural fairings...see what I mean, it can be a hassle and at times I wish the base game would incorporate parts from the more popular addons so I could run bare bones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
