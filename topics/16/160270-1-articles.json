I am new to this game and recently launched my first orbital rocket, which I sucessfully orbited around kerbin for 15 days, but upon reentry and retreival of the capsule, it said that the vessel was retreived after sub-orbital flight.

In KSP, orbit does not decay (unless with mod) so when you said \u0022orbiting\u0022 yet for \u002215 days\u0022 it\u0027s clearly that your rocket is on sub-orbital trajectory instead of orbital\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother assumption is that your rocket does make an orbit, yet the lowest point of orbit is still inside kerbin atmosphere, allowing atmospheric drag to slow your rocket, causing orbital decay that changed your orbital trajectory into suborbital trajectory (If you want to orbit kerbin, make sure the lowest point of orbit is above 70k meter)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhope that helps \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grounder","CreatedById":175867,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-06T18:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed. \u00A0You must be outside of the atmosphere (70km), this is considered a low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-06T18:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital means periapsis is outside the atmosphere.
