I figured out to use SPH to build the rover and the VAB for the crane \u002B rocket construction using sub-assemblies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I am having is that my placement node on the rover is always \u0022Wrong\u0022. In other words the rover can only be placed on top of the rocket, instead of [CRANE] - [LANDER/ROVER] - [ROCKET]\u0026lt;.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do I control the placement node of the rover? Any tips the construction order of the rover? Any other tips?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T16:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that is an issue with doing it as a sub-assembly, it seems to forget there are more than one node. Depending on the crane design would it be possible to save that as a sub-assembly and just flip the engines if needed? This is how I have been getting around this issue, but maybe someone has found an easier way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T17:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.90 there is a root selection tool at the top-left of the screen, to the right of the offset and rotate buttons.
