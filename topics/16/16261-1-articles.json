With a single SAS and the command pods own SAS, that thing should barely turn at all, and I find things to be quite stable in orbit. Something that would certainly help would be moving the SAS from it\u0027s current spot, and assuming your asscent rocket is not toally maxed out on its lifting capacity, stick one on top of each of your little side tanks (or even better, stick them on the bottom closer to the engine, assuming there is room for them there on your rocket). The further out from the center line of your rocket the units are located, the more leverage they have, because they are further from the center of gravity. You can also put them at the ends of your rocket since this is also moving them away from the center of gravity, hence the ideal position being the bottom of those tanks (so that you are low down, and out far). The same rule applies to RCS thrusters. Now, if you followed my previous point, most of your SAS power is located in the back end of your rocket, so your RCS will be most useful up at the nose helping out the command pods SAS if you get maxed out, or need to work quickly. You can stick it under the chute, on top of your command pod. Run a couple struts from the command pod to the RCS tank (you can\u0027t run them to the chute unfortunately, or at least I\u0027ve never been able to make that work) and your golden as long as you ditch the lander before the chute fully opens.

The capsule\u0027s own SAS effect is trivial for a ship of this size, I believe, so I don\u0027t take it into consideration. It\u0027s true that the ship is extremely slow to respond to steering at theses stages, which I also consider trivial because you don\u0027t need to make any rapid manuevers until you\u0027re close to Mun\u0027s surface anyway, and I\u0027ve discarded the orbiter stage by then anyway. Although I\u0027ve got linear RCS on the orbital-transfer stage, I really don\u0027t like to use RCS for anything except landing fine-tuning because the tanks run out so quickly. The struts may look a little sloppy, but are all placed on 2X symmetry, and so should balance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt never occurred to me that SAS might be more or less effective depending on where it\u0027s located on the ship, though that makes sense now that you point it out.

Clearly certain issues are inconvenient and those need to be sorted, like the wallowing that occurs for certain vehicles. But in my mind, the difficulty in rotation and control just equates to one of the challenges of piloting a much heavier object. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have encountered this with the aforementioned craft - winglets allow it to turn easier when within atmosphere, and when in orbit, if I need to manoeuvre the thing before the bulk of it is staged away, then the gimballed engines on the lowest possible throttle setting give me enough leverage to get it pointed where I want. Maybe I\u0027m just looking on the bright side a bit too much, but I wouldn\u0027t let it get in the way of using the full repertoire of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T03:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see your point point BillWiskins, but it\u0027s not that just it\u0027s more difficult. When I\u0027ve got RCS firing, an ASAS, the capsule\u0027s inherent attitude control, and 3 SAS modules all trying to hold the ship still and the random rotations are not even slowing down, that\u0027s a problem. And the rotations are not constant anyway, as if forces are acting on the ship while it\u0027s in freefall vacuum, which is not a piloting challenge but a physics flaw. Furthermore, the SAS and ASAS modules need to be reworked anyway because they are too narrow to form stable structural components between the wider tanks and capsules. In short, it might be a challenge to try to fly a 787 with the steering controls of a Cesna, but it\u0027s not much fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T04:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApologies to anyone who knows this already, but please remember that it does not matter how large or asymmetric or imbalanced a space craft is.
