After killing a lot of poor kerbals in the process I finally managed to land on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is about weight (in particular how it affects take off). Is there a way to see the total weight of the rockets when under construction in the VAB, or is it a case of having to add it up manually as we build. At them moment I\u0027ve mostly been doing it via trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T21:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Mechjeb mod will do it for you; if you\u0027re wanting to play vanilla, you\u0027ll have to do it manually. That\u0027s actually how I prefer to do it, but I\u0027m a bit of a masochist...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight affects takeoff in as much as you\u0027ve got to make sure you have sufficient thrust to get off the ground (the thrust-to-weight ratio or TWR). Total up your stage thrust, divide it by (Kerbin\u0027s surface gravity (9.81) multiplied by the total wet mass of your rocket). If the result is less than one, you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 nowhere. Optimally you want it somewhere between 1.7 and 2.2 but you can usually get away with a TWR as low as 1.3 without overheating/detonating an engine or six.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the game is trial and error, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-26T21:27:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2013 09:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T21:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, grab a mod like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/18230-0-19-1-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-0-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E for the much needed technical details until squad gets round to adding them to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zero81","CreatedById":61321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T20:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant - thanks for the responses\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
