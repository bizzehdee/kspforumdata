Only thing I\u0027ll warn you about is to make sure you place them high enough on what you\u0027re trying to land that it doesn\u0027t want to flip over (had that happen on a Duna rover lander once) and to be very, very sure the part you stick them on is well-attached to the rest of the craft (couldn\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve had pieces of my ships break off when the chutes open).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T21:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re landing more than just the capsule, add at least one drogue (if your career tech level allows).
