I have been practising with simple two stage rockets but I can\u0027t seem to improve how much delta V I require to get to orbit. My current assent profile is to pitch over to about 5 degrees at takeoff and by about 10,000m aim to be at a 45 degree angle, after this I will keep pitching over and when my aposapse is about 60,000m aim to be at about 5 degrees. How could I change my assent profile? \n\nI have also heard that my TWR should be about 2 for the first stage, is this correct.\n\nAlso sometimes at about 10,000m my rocket will flip to stop this should I be more gentle on the controls (the rocket does have 4 small non- controllable fins)? \n\nSorry if these questions are a bit simple and thanks for the help\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T15:11:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 03:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrmcp1**"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T13:42:17Z","Content":"If you are not using mechjeb only option you have is to let the craft do the gravity turn itself. The moment your craft turns more than 3 to 5 degrees infront of prograde the airflow starts hitting the sides which in turn costs you dV. Try using mechjeb and watch its ascent path. Try different kind of ascent paths with it for the most dV save. This way you can get solid data about what to do and what not to do. My crafts literally stays in the atmosphere %80 the launch without reaching terminal velocity and that actually saves alot of dV with mechjebs perfect assist. As long as you build the craft aerodynamic and with 1.5 -2.0 slt this seems to works great."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T13:55:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E after this I will keep pitching over and when my aposapse is about 60,000m aim to be at about 5 degrees.\n\nYou don\u0027t have to keep your nose above the horizon. Remember that it\u0027s not about getting up as fast as possible but about hitting the sweet spot between Oberth and drag. I usually go completely horizontal at around 30-35km."},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T14:11:03Z","Content":"You pitch your prograde by 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 for every 100m/s of surface velocity you have. So by 450m/s, 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. 600m/s at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at which point full throttle to 70km Ap is sufficient. It is very important to point prograde or near prograde after about 250m/s of velocity because there is about a 4-5x drag increase between 250m/s and 400m/s where the amount of drag stays fairly constant until about 600m/s, your gravity turn needs to be set up correctly before 300m/s surface velocity."},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T15:11:31Z","Content":"Thanks for the help, with the tips I managed to get into orbit with just 3,315 m/s of delta V."}]}
