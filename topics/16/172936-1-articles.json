Another mission scrapped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI now have 100G relay and direct antanne and control center at lvl 3. So I should be ok. But I have three casses that I would like to have shed some light on:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I once flew a mission to Jool with a mothership carrying a 100G relay antenna, which worked all the way to Kerbin. It had some probes with 2G direct antennea flying to the different moons. They should relay their data to the mothership. This only worked when the probe and mothership were very close, so I had to cancel most of the mission. This was somewhat disappointing, if a little surprising.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) So I tried almost the same mission again, but this time the probes had 15G direct antenna. This made little difference and I had to wait a lot of time for the probes to be with in antenna range. This was a big surprise, since I thought the the next tier of antennae (2G -\u0026gt; 15G) would drastically increase range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I just flew a manned mission with a probe core on it. I gave it a 100G direct antenna figuring this would have the same range as the 100G relay antenna which gave me a signal al the way to Jool. But once again I was in for a surprise! As soon as I ledt Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E I lost control of the probe!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m getting REALLY tired of guessing the type of antenna needed... and always guessing wrong! Can anyone inlighting me or do I have to put two 100G relay antenna on every craft to be sure? Maybe a rule of thump or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-24T14:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is very odd indeed.
