I do know that a command seat still requires some kind of other control unit to control a craft, as you can\u0027t make a ship using only a command seat. If you mount the command seat to an OKTO2 or something though it should work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T20:45:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuplicate thread, this has already been answered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T21:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Colonel_Panic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Colonel_Panic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell sorry if this sounds dumb but I have to check... is there a kerbal in the command seat, and do you have a probe core or other command piece for it?
