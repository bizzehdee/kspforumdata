Cant even use my mk3cargo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E with any kind of decent frame rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso ok I say to myself its a big enough ask this being on console anyway, so maybe I should just watch my part count and get on with enjoying the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand this is where things get really annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I done some testing an building and after a wee while, had myself a Duna expedition ready to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan was to send 5x vessels(1x duna lander,1xfuel tank station to be left in orbit of Duna, 1xsat/mini lander cluster and 1xlander and 1xsat cluster for Ike) to utilise the transfer window a bit better this time(only sent a probe first time then thought damn I should have sent more).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo once I had my epic one shot mission ready to go I put all 5 vessels making the transfer burn up into parking orbit ready to eject to duna.Next step I done all of the transfer burns to Duna, Then this is where the game begins to royally screw me over. After doing all the burns i was finally ready to go so I switched to my first vessel and BOOM! It explodes.OMG I say to myself what is going on here ?so I change to the next one KABOOM! Exact same thing happens with every single vessel\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I loaded up my earlier save(thank god I\u0027m so poophole about making a save all the time)and I tried to do the transfer burn for only the Duna lander and the fuel tank(which was needed forr my lander design, couldn\u0027t come home without refueling)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same god damm thing happened they both went pop. So I checked the mission report. And apparently one of my vessels crashed into eve and the other crashed into a plane?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat the hell???????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nended up having to dock my lander and fuel tank stages onto each other and then do ejection burn. And it worked , I got to the Duna system and done my manned mission in the end,Finally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso I made my peace with the fact I can only send one vessel interplanetary at a time(lame as f###k) and carried on playing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow however I am experiencing the same thing now that I am trying to capture an asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor some reason the klaw I was using just would not grab on after repeated attempts. So i went back to the space center and done a resart(usually gives u a good 20-30mins of the game actually working if u keep resarting on console)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo went to tracking station selected my vessel an yup you guessed it KABOOM!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor some reason the game/bad console port. Cannot handle multiple vessels being in interplanetary space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso after the long explanation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am curious to know, does this happen on PC aswell,and if so I there a remedy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand if I does not ,then this is something that must be fixed before this new port comes out Blitworks please actually test this port before releasing it and push it with the testing . Build a 300 part station on orbit and if it works fine you k ow you are dong better than Squad. Please please test the interplanetary bug .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally please just don\u0027t even release another port if we cant have a decent part count / multiple vessels travelling through space ,in a goddamn space game seems pretty basic to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(final note for moderators please do not move my post I have put it in the questions forum as I am asking PC players If they have encountered this. Also because it will be completely ignored if it goes into the console forum)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-14T15:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223091442\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162080\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497454904\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169509\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikey117\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, mikey117 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I play on console...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s basically your problem right there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP has been terrible on consoles since day 1 and I personally think it should never have been ported as it is not a game that is suited well to consoles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA new port is being worked on but don\u0027t hold your breath.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you love the game then beg, steal or borrow a PC to play it on because those problems don\u0027t happen there.
