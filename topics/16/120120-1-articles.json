You want the probe to go forward but it thinks you want it to go sideways/rotate. Try rotating the Okto so that it faces toward the \u0022front\u0022 of your probe. Then the N \u002B H keys will move it forwards and backwards, like maneuvering in orbit. Alternatively you can use the I \u002B K or J \u002B L keys to move forward/backwards and turn RCS off when driving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way you have it set up, it won\u0027t drive like a rover, it will \u0022float\u0022 like a lander. As you have it, Q \u002B E will rotate about the vertical axis, A \u002B D will pitch it left/right, and W \u002B S will pitch it forwards/backward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you look at the Okto in the VAB, keep in mind that the panel that says \u0022OKTO\u0022 corresponds with the door of a Kerbal pod\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthat is, the \u0022OKTO\u0022 side is \u0022backwards,\u0022 the opposite panel is \u0022forwards,\u0022 the top is \u0022up,\u0022 the bottom \u0022down.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps because otherwise I have no idea what could be going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit to say that RCS controls do not correspond with wheel controls. Usually when I build something like what you\u0027ve got there, I do it with the Okto facing up, just like you have it. But I use the RCS linear controls and rotation only when needed, otherwise I shut RCS off and drive like a regular rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T15:25:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pax Kerbana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jiminator","CreatedById":149196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T15:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethose are crappy wheels, about useless for anything. they break easily upon landing and also when accelerated too much. you may want to test your design at the spaceplane hanger.
