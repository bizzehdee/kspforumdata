Unfortunately, a lot of times I do not produce a satisfactory answer or one that I can comprehend; thankfully, everyone here is immensely helpful.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the title says, I\u0027m trying to figure out how velocity affects specific impulse, if at all. If I am going faster or slower, how does this impact how efficient my fuel consumption is? Does it even make a difference? I have been of the impression that it doesn\u0027t affect lsp at all, or at least in any measurable manner, but I wanted to confirm this.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second question, which is slightly related, is how does velocity correlate with altitude? Specifically, what are the approximate ideal speeds you should be flying at, at given altitudes? I assume that the farther away you are from these guidelines, the less efficient you are, and that\u00A0your fuel consumption will increase/lsp will decrease. Is this actually the case? I have been following what I have perceived to be roughly correct guidelines: generally, I shoot for not going any faster than 300 m/s until at least 7km above Kerbin (when you enter the next section of atmosphere with thinner air). After this point, I honestly don\u0027t have any idea what speeds are appropriate at what altitudes, or if they even matter in the first place. Speaking in general again, I usually run at full throttle the entire\u00A0time, as long as I kept my TWR at ~1.7, or at least below ~2\u00A0(at sea level, or SLT).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if these values/guidelines/assumptions/understandings are accurate, or even correct. I do\u00A0know that they have worked for me pretty well so far, and at a minimum, they get me from point A to point B with roughly the\u00A0same amount of dV (or less!) as that listed in most dV maps/calculators (using the most strict settings \u0026amp; least amount of fuel wasted).

Without a nozzle, they would expand in all directions and only very little of that expansion would be useful for the rocket. As they expand, the pressure of the exhaust gas decreases and its velocity increases. The nozzle follows the curve of expansion and therefore directs all the exhaust in the same direction, ensuring uniform acceleration away from the rocket and therefore, maximum thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen atmospheric pressure increases, the gases cannot expand to fill the nozzle because of that external pressure. Since they cannot expand as much, they also cannot be accelerated to such high speeds.

Changing the MR\u00A0effects\u00A0the combustion characteristics, such as the flame temperature and the molecular weight of the exhaust gases.\u00A0 Therefore, a change in MR changes an engine\u0027s specific impulse.\u00A0 Although an engine is typically designed to operate at a specified mixture ratio, the mixture ratio can shift slightly during flight if the respective flow rates of oxidizer and fuel change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh acceleration can also alter the flow rate of oxidizer and fuel.\u00A0 Under high g-loads, the liquid pressure upstream of the turbopumps is increased, which can increase the propellant flow rate to the engine.\u00A0 Clearly a higher propellant flow rate increases thrust, but it can also change Isp\u00A0because of a higher combustion\u00A0chamber pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth of these effects are usually pretty small, and in KSP they are non-existent.\u00A0 I just thought I\u0027d mention as a side note\u00A0in case anyone is interested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some cases, mixture ratio is changed intentionally, which can produce fairly significant changes in Isp.\u00A0 One example is the Saturn V, in which both the F-1 and J-2 engines had a \u0022propellant utilization subsystem\u0022 that monitored the remaining oxidizer and fuel and shifted the MR near the end of the burn to assure simultaneous depletion of oxidizer and fuel.\u00A0 In the case of the J-2 engine, the shift was achieved by changing the position of a valve controlling the flow of oxidizer to the engine.\u00A0 The PU shift decreased the oxidizer flow rate, resulting in a\u00A0pretty dramatic decrease in thrust.\u00A0 Although the thrust decreased, the Isp actually went up by several seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T13:04:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

By nature, spaceplanes do want to do this because they need air to breathe, which overrides concerns about drag and heating.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo your ideal speed (which is the \u0022question\u0022 we should probably get back to) is basically \u0022as high as possible without suffering the adverse effects\u0022. What your original post said sounds quite reasonable, but it could be a touch higher than 300 m/s once you get to about 4-5km, especially if your rocket is sleek. If you don\u0027t have any exposed temperature-sensitive parts, you can be at 350 m/s at 45\u00B0 at 6km and get to orbit very efficiently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo take an unrealistic example, I recently tried a few tests in sandbox with heating turned down to 0%. My most efficient launches with a stupidly high TWR for a direct-to-Mun trajectory were going at 900 m/s at 8km (angle: 30\u00B0 above horizon) and 1100 m/s at 10km. This was great for going to the Mun, but would have been inefficient for orbit because I would have needed to coast from about 15km up to a relatively slow orbital Ap, thereby losing all of the benefits of the Oberth effect. Trying to improve on that with a more reasonable ascent profile, I was consistently getting a vacuum-dv-to-orbit figure of about 3000 m/s with just a Skipper, but even without heating I was finding it hard to improve on that: excessive TWR just couldn\u0027t help because I still needed to climb some way out of the lower atmosphere to avoid drag (I was getting over 100 m/s drag losses just coasting up from the lower atmosphere), and that TWR was therefore going unused for much of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs OhioBob has pointed out, lower TWR can be more efficient if you consider cost: you certainly need a bit more fuel because of gravity losses, but you can cut down on expensive engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd as for throttling back, I agree that it should only be for control, but I do light all my engines off the launchpad (generally giving a TWR close to 2) while getting up to speed and initiating the gravity turn (therefore assisted by thrust vectoring) before throttling back to let the SRBs carry me through the turn and up to 8km or so. I feel (but might not be right) that this is more efficient than just waiting for the SRBs to haul me up, and uses a limited amount of fuel at non-optimal Isp to minimise that grinding, uselessly-vertical-and-fighting-gravity time before I can open up and direct my energies mostly horizontally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
