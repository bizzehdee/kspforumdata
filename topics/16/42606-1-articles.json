The old non-automatic SAS was redesigned as a \u0022reactionary control wheel\u0022. I wil often have a combination of both ASAS and reaction wheels. On my tiny SSTO spaceplane I just made, I included both an ASAS and a reaction wheel. Definitely helped stability. On my heavy lifter rocket, I have 5 ASAS units. 3 on the core and 2 on two drop tanks. Keeps it stable while it is insanely heavy, and then keeps it manueverable when it is insanely long and skinny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T13:06:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to clear up any confusion that might be there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ASAS is no more (since 0.21)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SAS is the \u0022computer\u0022, it uses reaction wheels, RCS, wings, and the like, but it can\u0027t do anything if used alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To provide actual rotational capabilities, add reaction wheels, RCS, wings, etc. for SAS to use\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You only need exactly one SAS computer per craft.
