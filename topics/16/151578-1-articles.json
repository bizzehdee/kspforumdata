For example. If I bring a surface sample up and process it, it won\u0027t let me to recover the surface sample at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E no more. Am I correct?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Antenna:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I have rovers that have a short range antenna without relay. (Yes they were landed / launched sometimes before 1.2). But then I put up a relay network up in orbit (They are strong enough to reach kerbin relay for sure). Can I transfer reports from those rovers and get science or I can transfer the report but getting no science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T00:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Unless you\u0027re playing older versions, the up-to-date behavior (I can\u0027t remember if this is introduced in 1.1.3 or earlier) is that a science experiment is \u0022consumed\u0022 or \u0022converted\u0022 into lab data - the original experiment will disappear.
