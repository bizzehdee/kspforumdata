On my own, without consulting any tutorials on it. It was probably the most inefficient thing I have done in the game, but it was glorious to do. Even when I came in with an AN angle of 155\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and had to practically turn my orbit around.\n\nOk, my question now, is...I have a contract to land on the Mun, and one to put another satellite in orbit. Is it possible to send both missions together? A manned lander with a satellite held on by a docking clamp, settle into lunar orbit, release the probe, land, put the probe in it\u0027s proper orbit, lift off the Mun and return the manned craft to Kerbin?\n\nAlso, when 1.0 is released, are we going to have to restart career mode?"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T08:22:43Z","Content":"Actually, I think so.

Just make sure your satellite has a probe core. If it doesn\u0027t have a core it will be labelled debris and it will not complete the contract.

Switching to a polar orbit is just a matter of adjusting your Munar approach to come in \u0027high\u0027 instead of \u0027around\u0027. It\u0027s usually easy to do as soon as you\u0027re about 400-500k up from Kerbin and on Munar approach with some normalization and radial adjustments.\n\nThe real trick is timing it so that you\u0027re coming in at a reasonable angle to your polar orbit. You\u0027ll typically arrive ~1-1.5 days after your departure burn from Kerbin, so you\u0027d want the polar orbit somewhere between perpendicular and about a 1/3 ahead of where you\u0027ll be when you actually come in. You\u0027ll have to learn to play with conics and focusing on foreign bodies. It\u0027ll also take some practice.

I came in 110\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off of the plane of orbit, which is 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 better than my first attempt, with a probe by itself. I planned for inefficient flying however. I\u0027m going to drain my 3rd rocket stage getting as close to my orbital plane as possible. My lander and my probe are both carrying small fuel tanks. the probe has about 1700 m/s delta V which will be plenty to get into my orbit. My lander, well. I am guestimating, but I think I have about 1000 m/s. Mechjeb won\u0027t show me the dV on that stage, probably because it doesn\u0027t understand how it\u0027s staged. I am pausing to write this just to keep myself from getting tense.\n\nUpdate: I just separated from my last rocket stage, and my probe and lander are connected and heading to peri. I realized an oversight as I was preparing to separate. I only put a mechjeb module on the lander. Luckily I haven\u0027t been relying on mechjeb to do my flying for me. I only use the autopilot for launching run of the mill equatorial launches, so being partially blind on the probe shouldn\u0027t bother me too much\n\nUpdate #2 Oops.

The profile I had for the descent, I wasn\u0027t able to land with the fuel I had. On the second attempt I managed to do this. when I circularized, once inside the munar system, my orbit was 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off on AN...not bad for a first attempt shooting from Kerbin, I think. \n\nSo, my new problem. I still didn\u0027t manage to land and retain enough fuel to come back. \n\nAs I see it I have 3 options. A problem I have though is there is no docking clamp on the lander on the moon. \n\nSo I can send a new lander, pick up Jeb and come home, or I can launch the lander into orbit, rendezvous, then EVA Jeb over and come home. Ideally though, I\u0027d like to grab on to the lander and bring it and Jeb home.
