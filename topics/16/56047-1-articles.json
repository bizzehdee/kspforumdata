I think those KAS pipes have some options for how they connect though, you might want to check. The kethane converter is iffy though. I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027ll be able to get fuel to flow from the converter to fuel tanks attached through those radial docking ports. Your best bet is to always stick a fuel tank directly onto the kethane converter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T03:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDmagic and TechniK3rbal are correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biker Joe","CreatedById":82495,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T15:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERight click one tank, hold alt and right click the other, click in and out accordingly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorked, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
