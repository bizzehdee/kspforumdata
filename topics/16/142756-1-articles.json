Like\u00A0using maths to finds out when a target to dock with is in optimum position to launch. Should I start to slow my spacecraft 1min before intersect? And lastly can I really figure out the avrege\u00A0altitude of a spacecraft\u00A0by adding the\u00A0apoapsis and the periapsis and then dividing the answer by 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks heaps guy!\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T17:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t really need math. Try the docking tutorial in training. Unless you have really low acceleration or you are try to dock with something in a really high orbit,\u00A0you don\u0027t really need to plan when to burn to match velocities.

It\u0027ll just slowly modify your orbit to match the target. I often do really high speed intercepts, and you have no choice then but to burn early. I like to burn when I have 50 seconds left to 0m (ie. speed = 14m/s, distance = 700m).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to play some games, you can try to use your burn to push the retrograde marker on top of the anti-target marker before you get to intercept. This mostly works (I do it all the time), but don\u0027t try to be too clever or get it too close! Both those markers move around a lot with respect to each other as you get close -- so if you push them right on top of each other, they will drift off significantly -- and you may end up\u00A0going too slow to get an intercept, and you may be in too low an orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your intercept is showing that you\u0027ll be less than 200 meters apart -- then don\u0027t mess with it! Just wait and burn retrograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAveraging the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E does give you a decent approximation for guessing orbit times, and especially for deciding how fast one object will catch another in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as an optimum time to launch: the kind of ships I launch do not give me accurate control of my initial \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E -- it\u0027s always quite high. So on my first orbit, my launched ship is going very slow. This means that if I\u0027m timing my launch, I have to launch at least a quarter of an orbit early. But that gives me a very good opportunity at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to watch the intercept markers as I burn retrograde to lower my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E.
