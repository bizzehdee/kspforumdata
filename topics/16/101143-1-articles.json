Basically I\u0027m trying to build a plane with the fuel tanks/engine build on the wings. It\u0027s a big plane, so the engine assembly has two fuel tanks attached together.\n\nThe issue is the the wing connectors won\u0027t join to the second fuel tank if I attach it to the back of the first fuel tank. Even if they are phased through there is no connection and the tanks \u0022flop\u0022 because it\u0027s only being held from the front. Likewise, if I attempt to attach the fuel tank to the wing I can\u0027t get it to connect to the other fuel tank\u0027s node.\n\nWhat\u0027s more annoying about it is that my first, quick prototype concept did join properly with all wing connector pieces attached to both the plane\u0027s core and the fuel tanks (multiple pieces). It ended up being one very solid wing (no symmetry build) despite having the weight in the middle. It didn\u0027t flop or wiggle.\n\nI don\u0027t understand why it worked once but now I can\u0027t get it to cooperate with me. Does anyone have any insight on what I might have done differently or a know-how on a way to get the wings to connect to both surfaces?\n\nSo far it doesn\u0027t matter if I build the fuel tanks first and then put the wing connectors in between or if I build the wing then add the fuel tanks.\n\nHere\u0027s a quick snap of the wing assembly in attempted function:\n\n![30v2nfb.jpg](http://oi59.tinypic.com/30v2nfb.jpg)\n\nAs you might be able to see, only the front wing connector and fuel tank are connected. The other tank and connectors are not joined, causing it to hang down."},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T11:08:08Z","Content":"Mostly this is probably due to the Tree Structure that KSP uses for constructing vehicles. Everything starts with a root part, and each new part attaches only at one point, and they all branch out from there.\n\nThus, many parts can be connected to a part already on the ship, but each of those parts is only connected to one parent part. You can\u0027t have parts connecting around in a circle, or looping back on each other, since that would involve making a child trying to become a parent.\n\nThe workaround would be to use struts to staple wing parts together, or reinforce the heavy parts that are loading the structure."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:49:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The workaround would be to use struts to staple wing parts together, or reinforce the heavy parts that are loading the structure.\n\nExactly that. You can only place a part connected to one other part.

All those huge cargo bays and cockpits look tempting, but it\u0027s not worth it for the use that they get. Crew transport? No need to send 16 kerbals into orbit at once- make multiple trips. Need to launch a Big Orange Tank to orbit? Send it up empty on top of a rocket, then refuel it later with smaller tanker aircraft. At best, I might consider building a Mk2 twin-fuselage design with the cargo slung between them, but I\u0027m not very good at building planes so haven\u0027t tried that yet."},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T04:10:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not exactly, in stock there is a defined \u0022Front\u0022 of the wing.

My mind tells me that someone mentioned (Scott?) that the position a wing assembly is attached to the plane matters, e.g. if we have a wing made up of three wing parts, it would make a difference if all of them are directly attached to the plane or the part in the front/middle/aft is attached to the plane and the other two attached to the first wing part.\n\nLife-like 2D rendered visualization:\n\n1.\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOPlaneBody\n\n...|\n\nWWWwwwWWW\n\n2.\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOPlaneBody\n\n..........|\n\nWWWwwwWWW\n\n2.\n\nOOOOOOOOOOOOOPlaneBody\n\n..................|\n\nWWWwwwWWW"}]}
