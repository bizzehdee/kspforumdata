I have done the basic missions and completed the orbits. A couple of thing I am confused about. There seem to be a dozen ways to save things. Saving ships is no problem, and quicksave/load\u00A0 (F5 and F9) seems pretty straight forward.\u00A0 However, hitting the orange\u00A0 Pause arrow top right, or the esc key open what seem to be the same window, not to mention the autosave the game does on its own.\u00A0 I am not sure what they do and where they put them. And then there is the one that you get when exiting a game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically if I save something as orbit, I want orbit to load back up exactly as i saved it when I need it.

There\u0027s a lot to go over in your questions, so please ask if anything I say doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are multiple different ways that the game creates save points, and they are all stored in different places so it\u0027s understandable to be a little confused. The first thing to understand is that a \u0022quicksave\u0022 and \u0022autosave\u0022 are not saving to the same file. The autosave is simply storing your game progress so that if the game should crash or the game is closed in a non-standard way then the game will load next time at the same point it last autosaved. This data is stored in a persistent.sfs file within the folder for each individual career or sandbox game you have created. The persistence file is what loads when you open your game, and it is considered the \u0022current\u0022 state of your game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuicksaves are different. There are two different types of quicksaves -- normal, and custom. For a normal quicksave, every time you press F5 it stores the state of the game at that point in your \u0022backup\u0022 save folder, and makes it available to load when you hold down the F9 key. This automatically loads the most recent normal quicksave. Also at the same time you load a quicksave it updates the persistent file to match the state of the game that has now reverted back to your quicksave point. This is now your current game state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also a custom quicksave option. By holding the ALT key while pressing F5 a dialog box will pop up that lets you name the save file. You can create as many of these custom quicksaves as you want. You can also load whichever one you want by pressing ALT-F9 to chose from the list of previous custom save points. Also in that list will be the most recent autosave point (called \u0022persistent\u0022) and the most recent normal quicksave point with timestamps attached that you could also load if you wish. The files for your custom named quicksaves are just stored within the \u0022Saves\u0022 folder for each individual career, next to the persistent file. A few recent backup quicksaves and persistent autosave files are located in the \u0022Backup\u0022 folder within the folder for you career save which you can copy into that game\u0027s \u0022Saves\u0022 folder if you want to access them from the ALT-F9 menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip: The \u0022Save Game\u0022 and \u0022Load Game\u0022 buttons in the Escape menu do the exact same things that ALT-F5 and ALT-F9 do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery time you change scenes the game will update the current progress in the persistent file. This means that whenever you take control of a ship, switch ships, or recover a vessel for example, the game will automatically update the current save state so that it will return to that point should you close the game. Any time you exit the game in the normal way it will also update the current persistent save. It doesn\u0027t matter if you leave the game by pressing \u0022Quit Game\u0022 in the ESC menu or by clicking the red button in the top right. This is normal operation. HOWEVER, if you shut down the KSP.exe process abnormally, whether from the Windows taskbar, task manager, or ALT-F4 then the game does not have the ability to update the save state. Then it will revert back to the last time the persistent file was updated, either because the game autosaved or the point when you loaded a quicksave or the last time you changed ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls, in a career play through the experience of your pilot or the technical details of your probe core will have an effect on what auto-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E abilities are available.

When you hover over their picture in the Astronaut Complex and I believe in the character portrait it should show you what abilities they have earned. Some probe cores are more limited than others. Only the most expensive probe cores will have all of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E options available.
