Or I can create my own poor-man\u0027s mod by copying an existing tank, doing a simple edit to the part name and .cfg, making some trivial edit to the texture so that it\u0027s visibly distinct (which is what I\u0027ve done so far). But it\u0027s irritating. I shouldn\u0027t *have* to mod that. If there\u0027s an engine, there should be a reasonable selection of fuel tanks compatible with that engine.\n\nMaking something hard because of an inherent physical difficulty (e.g. the LV-N makes lots of heat, is very heavy, is low thrust, uses a different fuel mix from anything else) is fine-- that\u0027s a challenge, and challenge = fun.\n\nMaking something hard because something that obviously should be there, isn\u0027t, is just un-fun. It feels like an oversight and makes things less fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T21:59:27Z","Content":"Yup.
