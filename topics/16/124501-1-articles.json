I haven\u0027t seen much discussion of this before, and I\u0027ve often wondered how others optimize landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheoretically, I believe the most efficient landing is essentially a gravity turn in reverse. All thrust takes place exactly retrograde, with the retrograde vector smoothly descending from horizontal to vertical as you burn, timing the burn so that your velocity relative to the surface reaches zero just as you touch down. In practice, the burn would need to be timed and throttled almost perfectly, or else you would reach zero velocity somewhere above the surface, requiring more dV to land, or below the surface, with obvious severe negative consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy landings are typically broken down into a deorbit phase and a descent phase. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the deorbit phase, my goal is to reduce my Pe a point low enough above the surface that I can begin the descent phase. I burn retrograde briefly at the beginning to lower my Pe, and then again shortly before the intended landing point to reduce my trajectory closer to vertical, beginning the descent. Because both burns are retrograde, I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E there is too much inefficiency in the deorbit phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the descent phase, burns have two purposes - the first is to reduce my speed enough to land safely, the other to fine tune my landing location. Any dV spent fine tuning the location is going to be over and above that necessary to land, and this can be reduced by making the initial deorbit burn more accurate. Most dV is wasted because I try to give myself enough time to respond as the landing develops, limiting my vertical speed to something I\u0027m comfortable with. Ideally, you would do a suicide burn as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince almost all of the dV losses happen during the descent phase, I try to minimize how long this phase is by bringing the Pe as close to the surface as possible during the initial deorbit burn. When landing on the Minmus flats, for example, I burn retrograde on the opposite side of the moon from my intended landing so that my Pe decreases from 20km to 3.5km, just enough to skim the mountains near the landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T17:35:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGoSlash27\u0027s \u0022Reverse Gravity Turn\u0022 is the most efficient non-suicidal method.

Tylo is hard, especially if you don\u0027t have an efficient landing technique.
