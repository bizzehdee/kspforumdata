So id like to learn an ideal ascent path that fits Laythe\u0027s thin atmosphere. Now the lander uses four of the B9 turbo jets and alot of the large intakes. The jets will go until flame out where they will decouple and rockets fire to complete orbit. So what would be a nice trajectory for such a craft?

This isn\u0027t a plane in anyway. Just a regular ascent stage with jets. So I\u0027m guessing I should start the gravity turn around 5km. Id like to stay in atmosphere as long as possible, but there are no lifting surfaces. But the thing has a very good TwR so the power of the engines should be able to keep it up. Just can\u0027t tip over to much. I\u0027ve only gotta get up to 60km so it should do it. Hell the thing reaches LKO with ease so Laythe would be a sinch.
