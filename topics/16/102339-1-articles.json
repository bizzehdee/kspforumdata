I\u0027ve made several attempts just to build plane huge enough to carry one someday. My latest attempt is this:\n\n[![STndug4h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/STndug4h.jpg)](http://imgur.com/STndug4)\n\nIt is capable of going into LKO and returning with enough fuel to at least try a landing. (Actually you see it here returning from Orbit, heading home. Didn\u0027t make it though, not enough liquid fuel left)\n\nBut on reentry it flips to it\u0027s back (actually to its tail). I observed this behavior now several times with different spaceplanes, but on the first ones I didn\u0027t take too much care about CoM or CoL, they should fly.\n\nBut on this one I had the CoM right in the middle of the cargo bay and CoL was almost next to it. As you can see there\u0027s a fuel tank in front of the cargo bay and one in the back and they\u0027re getting emptied evenly. The liquid fuel tanks are also balanced out around the CoM.\n\nIt only happens on reentry when hitting the thicker atmosphere. But it is stable again, if I manage to point it prograde (which is hard, because it\u0027s [wildly](http://imgur.com/STndug4)[spinning) and apply some thrust.](http://imgur.com/STndug4)(There\u0027s even a half full liquid fuel tank in the front just for balance, I do not feed from it and I checked that the fuel is still there)\n\nSo what happens here? I\u0027m out of ideas.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I managed to fix it thanks to your answers. The problem were the air intakes at the front creating too much drag. I moved them to the back, rebalanced the plane and now it glides during reentry like a charm. As if it was made for it. Oh wait. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E Thank you all very much, I never had though that this would cause my problems.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T11:44:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 11:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mat2ch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T22:55:56Z","Content":"Your pictures don\u0027t work quite right, but I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re playing under stock aerodynamics (in FAR you probably wouldn\u0027t make it into orbit without a tailfin).

Looks like your plane will be nice to control on the way up. Your fuel balancing is great, assuming the tanks empty evenly, but you seem to have checked that in flight. At re-entry speeds, though, I would suggest the problem must be your CoM. Try having your CoM slightly in front of your CoL by adding a little more wing at the back. This should make it very stable because it will automatically want to point forwards. The way you have it right now, it looks like it will have a slight tendency to flip, which gets greater and greater as the angle of attack increases.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T13:49:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deddly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mat2ch","CreatedById":139755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:55:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well done, Mat2ch.

I would\u0027ve never though of just tilting the plane in the hangar to see how it will behave at different flight angles.
