A tower for training parachute jumping.\n\n![daNRV6S.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/daNRV6S.jpg)\n\nFirst jumps were a mixed success. Some parachutes didn\u0027t open, some didn\u0027t provide enough drag. But the Radial-mounted one was fine. I\u0027ve remodelled the seats into something more lightweight and invited all my kerbals to take a jump.\n\nAnd none of them wants to. The moment they let go of the hatch, they lie on their backs and refuse to move. They may activate the jetpack and move around some, they are definitely not in the ragdoll mode, but to get to the seats? nope.\n\nWhile the in-character explanation is pretty entertaining, I\u0027d like to know what happens.\n\n![an2BQ6h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/an2BQ6h.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T18:10:22Z","Content":"Just to be clear: this is happening while the platform is just standing there on the launchpad, yes? i.e. it\u0027s not like the tower itself is free-falling or flying or something while you\u0027re trying to do this?\n\nOne thing I\u0027ve noticed is that the game doesn\u0027t really use pure physics to model kerbals walking; it has a special-case \u0022switch.\u0022\n\nThat is, suppose you have a ship that\u0027s orbiting out in space, and it has an engine on it that can give 1g acceleration, and it has a little platform outside the command pod, oriented so that \u0022up\u0022 is towards the front of the craft. In principle, when the ship is under thrust, a kerbal ought to be able to get out of the pod and walk around-- 1g is 1g, it shouldn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s \u0022I\u0027m standing on the ground with 1g of real gravity\u0022 versus \u0022I\u0027m standing on a ship that\u0027s using its engines to accelerate.\u0022 But in the former case, the game lets you walk around, and in the latter, it causes behavior like you\u0027re observing.\n\nSimilarly, if I have a ship that\u0027s dropping slowly out of the sky on parachutes, it\u0027s moving at constant speed and relatively low velocity, so I ought to be able to get out and walk around on the craft as it drops; but I can\u0027t, the kerbals act the way you\u0027re observing.\n\nSo what it boils down to is that the game seems to have a \u0022switch\u0022 where it considers \u0022is the spacecraft \u0027landed\u0027 or not?\u0022 (i.e. is it planted on the ground). If it is, then kerbals can walk around on it the same way they can walk on the ground. However, if it\u0027s not landed, then kerbals can\u0027t walk, even if the motion/acceleration of the ship is such that it seems like they ought to be able to.\n\nI\u0027ve never run into the problem you describe, but it sounds to me like the game somehow thinks that your ship is not \u0022landed\u0022 and therefore it\u0027s giving you this behavior. Maybe there\u0027s a bug, wherein if your ship is held up off the ground by launch clamps, Kerbal-walking-physics treats it like it\u0027s not actually landed?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mahnarch","CreatedById":114432,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T03:56:32Z","Content":"I tend to agree.\n\nIf there are only two clamps and the tower is way up in the air, it could be that it\u0027s swaying a little bit so it\u0027s not \u0022landed\u0022, maybe."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T04:02:44Z","Content":"Where is the gap between those panels? My guess is that the Kerbal lands directly on the gap and thus counts as \u0022falling\u0022 without getting knocked unconscious nor being able to pass between the panels. Maybe try using a open mk2 cargo bay or similar as jumping platform. Or maybe try movin those panels around a little."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T09:21:46Z","Content":"Nope, there was a sloping platform clipped right into the hull before I added the ladder, and it didn\u0027t help. Moreover, before the parachuting \u0022vessels\u0022 overhaul that didn\u0027t happen - and these are located quite a distance from where the kerbal lands. (and I didn\u0027t change anything with the center while doing the overhaul.)"}]}
