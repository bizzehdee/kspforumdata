The problem lies in the fact that you don\u0027t know precisely how much time it will take to get to orbit from the pad and once you do know that, it\u0027s highly variable from one launch to the next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What I do is first launch into a parking orbit with a fixed period (for example 11 orbits per day, which passes over KSC 10 times per day).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I can then track it and mark the time that it passes over KSC (using a guidance head on KSC grounds) and compute down to the second when to begin the transfer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The math is a lot hairier than it is for the single launch resonant spacing setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Best,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T17:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlshain,\u003Cp\u003E What I mean to say is that if you\u0027re setting up a constellation without any mods, then you need to plan out the process mathematically.
