Click on the little icon that looks like a calculator next to your flight timer. This will pull up a window that is kindof a combination of mechjebs smartASS along with an option to execute next manuver node. If you setup the manuver while you have signal you can tell it to fly the node and it will do it even if it has no signal when the time comes (still needs power though) Make sure you tell it to point at the node first otherwise it will turn on the engine while its rotating to face the node when the time comes and will fly it poorly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree with the geostationary relay sat above KSP though. That will give prety good coverage in general and once you start puting up the GPS sats they should bounce the signal around to the blindspot with their omni\u0027s. Just be aware the comunitron 16\u0027s probably wont have the range to talk to the sat in geostat. Youll either need the longer ranged omni (communitron 32) or have a directional dish like the DTS-M1 (the stock flat deployable one). the DTS has a nice wide cone so pointing the one on the geostationary at kerbin will cover most of the orbital area your intrested in and your GPS sats point another DTS at the GEOsat. agian omnies will bounce the signal around to the darkside as long as a couple can talk to the main one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
