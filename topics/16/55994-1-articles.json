Same principle: make a long burn to get as close to the target as you can manage, make one or two correction burns en route to lower that further, then make any final corrections once you\u0027ve arrived at the target\u0027s SOI (if you can manage it though, you want to get to your desired periapsis while still a fair ways off - you\u0027ll save delta-V in the long run).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s interplanetary flight planning in a nutshell.
