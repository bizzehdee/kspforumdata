But I was having problems on 1.7 making them work, the rockets were dead on the launched with no communication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the \u0022renaming rules\u0022 set to priority 1, type \u0022debris\u0022, so any leftover upper stages are just marked as debris and I don\u0027t have to worry about clutter. However this is 100% for sure making them unusable. If I change them to any other vessel type they suddenly get control back on the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I change the vessel type on the pad it does nothing (in either direction... setting them to debris doesn\u0027t lose control, setting them to vessels doesn\u0027t gain me control). It specifically is only when launching from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E that is giving me grief.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat the hell is this?
