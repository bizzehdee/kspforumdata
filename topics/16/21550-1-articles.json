Further, when I tried to follow along to a how-to video that was building a basic jet plane, my pieces wouldn\u0027t go on the way his did, even though I was sure I was using the same parts. I couldn\u0027t get my parts to attach in the same way as his. Yesterday, I ran the Patch.exe to do a Repair, and it said it fixed 500-something files, but I\u0027m sill having issues.
