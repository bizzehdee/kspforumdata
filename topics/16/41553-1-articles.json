There\u0027s a few ways to go about it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could put wheels on the bottom of your base segments, and then just drive them together. If your two modules are identical, you have the advantage of not having to worry too much about the height of your ports. However, if your base site is on any sort of slope or uneven ground, you might have problems with the modules rolling around on you or being propped up at odd angles. Because of this, it often takes quite a bit of finagling to line up perfectly and get the ports to actually dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal preference is to equip my base sections with fuel and rockets so that I can quickly fly them around to wherever they need to be. If you use MechJeb, you can set the Translatron to hover at a set altitude and easily navigate any terrain without fear of flipping or wheels breaking. Additionally, if you have RCS thrusters you can use them to jockey and wiggle the base segments together when it comes time to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to get really fancy and you don\u0027t mind some mods, you could use the Kerbal Attachment System to create some sort of construction vehicle that can pick base segments up and move them around, and put your base together that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T07:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal attachment system is my preferred way.
