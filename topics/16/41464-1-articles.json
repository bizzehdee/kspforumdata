I\u0027m trying to fine tune the position of the wings, canards etc. With out the canards it doesn\u0027t get off the ground until it gets to the end of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might have gotten it fixed last night, I don\u0027t remember now (it was late).

I\u0027ve tried with a single asas, a single sas, 1 of each and multiple sas together. I think it\u0027s just a matter of getting the wings and canards just right, along with getting the position of the CoM in just the right spot in relation to the wings. It\u0027s pretty close right now. Maybe I\u0027m just being too picky in wanting to get it so it\u0027s controllable by 1 degree.
