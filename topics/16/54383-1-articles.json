I quite often plan Laythe aerobraking while still in Kerbin SOI. Of course it requires a few corrections en route but the required accuracy is available to be planned and maintained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since SOIs are spheres, the angle at which you enter them doesn\u0027t matter. The speed does, but the speed difference caused by kerbin/eeloo inclination difference is next to negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: after a short maths session I take back one thing I said earlier: you won\u0027t end up on Eeloo equatorial orbit if you stay at Kerbin inclination. In fact if you do so your resulting orbit will be inclined by at least Eeloo\u0027s orbital inclination. Unless you fix it during braking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ When braking near Eeloo, you still have Oberth on your side. Which is not the case when you\u0027re fixing the orbit in interplanetary space without anything nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ Fixing your orbital inclination before meeting Eeloo will decrease your Eeloo SOI entry speed by whopping 1%.

If your speed is about half Eeloo\u0027s, then the difference is about 1%. If your speed is less, the difference is even smaller. On the other hand, if your speed is comparable with Eeloo\u0027s (i.e. you almost-matched your orbits in interplanetary space) then the difference is rather huge as with matching orbital planes you enter at next to zero speed and basically freefall on Eeloo, while without matching orbital planes you come at about 10% of Eeloo\u0027s orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
