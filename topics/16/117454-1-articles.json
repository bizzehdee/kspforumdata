There is a learning curve as with all things in KSP. To start with, you should check out this [basic spaceplane tutorial.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures)\n\nIt\u0027s a bit old now, but contains all the important basic concepts.\n\nFrom there, try checking out some of the threads that are devoted to spaceplanes to get some ideas from what others are doing.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T13:59:36Z","Content":"For starters you should use one big ore tank, not three little ones.

Use their space efficiency to transfer everything to Minmus (or wherever) and back. Refuel and reload with SSTO rockets; rinse, repeat.\n\nThe important point being that all the stuff that is only used in space only needs to be launched once. SSTO rockets or spaceplanes are your call depending on which you prefer to make and fly.\n\nThese myths that \u0022SSTO\u0022 means spaceplane and \u0022spaceplane\u0022 (neccessarily) means super-efficient are sad temptations to the uninitiated.\n\nThis SSTO will put a 100t\u002B payload in orbit. It is easy to build and fly and will launch and land using MJs standard settings, if you want it to.\n\n[![fURXN9Pl.png](http://i.imgur.com/fURXN9Pl.png)](http://imgur.com/fURXN9P)\n\nDecoupler below payload.\n\n3 stacks of\n\n 5 x S3-7200\n\n S3 KS25x4\n\n nosecones and fins to taste\n\nBatteries and RGU on centre stack, SAS units and drogues on side-stacks.

I\u0027ve made some pretty beefy SSTOs, but you don\u0027t really want to be sending them out away from Kerbin, it\u0027s a waste.\n\nThe problem with taking SSTOs (by which I, and the vast majority of people, mean a spaceplane..) much beyond LKO is that all the bits and pieces that you have on there for atmospheric flight are now superfluous, and dead weight.. and those jet engines are heavy. That means you have all this dead weight to accelerate and stop and you\u0027re burning waaaaayyy more fuel than you need to.\n\nGet yourself up to LKO, open your bay and send a lightweight payload on its way. You\u0027ll need an engine to land on minmus anyway, so you can use that for your transfer as well.. what I\u0027ve done in the past is strap a fuel tank to the TOP of my lander and pipe the fuel down to that to transfer across. Once you\u0027ve used that fuel up you can stage away and dump that weight before landing.. although on minmus it\u0027s really not all that significant anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:42:06Z","Content":"- Posted my original in the wrong thread, my bad -\n\nI was going to suggest that you could try building your plane so that it could be refueled; in KSP these days, the amount of delta-V an SSTO spaceplane requires for the final ascent phase (after transition from jets to rockets and circularization) is roughly 1,800 m/s - which, if you were to refuel your plane in orbit, would easily be enough to do a transfer burn to either Mun or Minmus. I did have a successful spaceplane ferry doing that very job not too terribly long ago. Of course, it was hauling passengers...an eighteen tonne payload is going to be a tall order. And there\u0027s still the issue of actually getting the payload down to the surface from there. And there remains the fact that what everybody else has said - that it\u0027s inefficient as hell - is inescapably true...\n\nIf you\u0027re in stock air, plan for your your plane to have a takeoff mass of around 72 tonnes - it\u0027ll require five or six jets and about 1,000-1,200 kN of rocket thrust (so a Mainsail).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T15:30:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T14:50:01Z","Content":"I have a basic design down for an SSTO with 17.1t to Minimus.
