Keep the pitch rate steady, and you will see your prograde marker switch from surface to orbit. At that point, switch to your orbit map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E if you\u0027ve kept your slow rate of pitch going, your apoapsis should be getting close to LKO altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now... the idea is to raise the periapsis without raising the apoapsis, so you steer it by what the apoapsis is doing. If you\u0027re pointed to the opposite side of the horizon far enough, your apoapsis won\u0027t change. If you\u0027re down even further, your apoapsis will decrease. Less, and your apoapsis will increase. No matter what, your periapsis will continue to increase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The time to apoapsis will also be affected by what you\u0027re doing and vice- versa. the closer you get to apoapsis, the less effect your pitch angle will have on it\u0027s altitude, and the more effect it will have on it\u0027s time. You want to try to keep it 30 seconds ahead throughout the circularization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So you juggle it simply by pitch to keep your apoapsis constant while raising your periapsis.

Real launch companies and agencies have a lot of money invested in methods of tracking the past, current, and future states of the craft very precisely, and spend weeks or months working out the correct burn and turn schedule to get their particular craft where they want it, when they want it, with minimal fuss. With launches costing from hundreds of thousands, or millions, of USD per launch, this is not something to be taken lightly.
