I\u0027m trying to use structural parts and Jr. docking ports to build some epic suspension. At the bottom of the makeshift springs, I built a ring out of cubic struts attached to the hull to keep the whole assembly vertical. Well, it didn\u0027t work in the slightest. It clipped through like there was no tomorrow and flipped over. I couldn\u0027t find a thread or tutorial on the subject, so I thought I\u0027d ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T01:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what your talking about.
