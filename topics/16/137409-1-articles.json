I don\u0027t remember ever having such a hard time attaching one to another, but in my current game it\u0027s nearly impossible. I can easily attack anything else under it, but it\u0027s almost impossible to attach another one of those donut tanks to itself. It stays red all the time, and only very briefly flashes green as you move the mouse away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I doing something wrong with these things?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T03:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly advice I can offer is to hold Alt while trying to place the second tank. That turns off surface attachment and forces it to use nodes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I know that those tanks aren\u0027t surface attachable, but you could try it anyway.
