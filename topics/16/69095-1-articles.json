You will naturally speed up as gravity accelerates you towards the Mun. But once you pass periapsis and continue along your trajectory, you\u0027ll see that your ship starts to lose speed just the same as it was gaining it before. By the time you reach the SoI boundary again, guess what speed you\u0027ll be going? That\u0027s right, 40m/s!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically once you\u0027ve encountered another body you have to do something to bleed off that excess velocity if you plan to stick around.
