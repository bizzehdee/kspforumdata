Planes! Now with real plane parts! Except for the part where I always fick up. Either my planes don\\\u0027t fly, or they don\\\u0027t stop flying. I\\\u0027ve taken to just slapping parachutes on all the parts; just in case.\n\nAlright. Per Aspera Ad Astra. So instead of going back to rocket-based planes, I decided instead to just steal a flying device. I noticed weird things...other people, they use canards. Ducks? Hah hah, very funny. But they actually work, so I copy that. And control surfaces, and trims, and air-breathing engines, and mk2 fuselages and...wait, I already don\\\u0027t get this.\n\nQUESTIONS!\n\n1. Control surfaces. I understand them, but they do not understand me! They always attach the wrong way! They\\\u0027re ment to be parallel to the wings, yes? But they always end up sticking up in some manner of 90 degree angle! Why is that, and how may I fix it?\n\n2. Air-breathing engines. What, why, and how, gentlekerbs?\n\n3. Trim. Is that...no, I actually have no idea. What is trim? Why would I want it? And how does it work?\n\n4. Mk2 and Mk3 fuselage. I apologise for my ignorance, but \\*what\\* are these?\n\n5. RCS-Port-Linear. I know RCS. I do not know Port-Linear.\n\n6. Avionics Package. It says \u0027sensors\u0027 and \u0027computer\u0027. Guess what? - WHAT?\n\n7. Rams. Evidently not meant for battering. Someone explain, please.\n\n8. The Tail Connector. It looks ridiculous, but surely it has some manner of purpose, yes?\n\n9. I accidentally dropped my original Kerbonauts (Bill, Bob and Jeb) in a command pod cum parachute somewhere half a continent north of the KSC, along the coast. How will I best go about retrieving them? Fly a plane there? Or just go up into space and try to drop down next to them? I just want to make sure they\\\u0027re OK.\n\nI will be most grateful for any assistance \u003E![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"The Darkness","CreatedById":25306,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T01:01:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.

Right now they\\\u0027re decorative, but I suggest using them anyway so your design will still work later. Same story for the nacelle and radial engine body.\n\nThe avionics package and computer is an Advanced SAS.\n\nThe RCS port (linear) is like the old RCS thruster block, except it only thrusts in one direction, perpendicular to wherever you place the port. Restricting the thrust to a single direction actually makes this kind of RCS more flexible, since you can fine tune exactly how much thrust you want, exactly where you want it.\n\nThe tail connector (I suggested this part, yay!) is primarily for attaching control surfaces, but get creative with it. Many real aircraft have tapered tails."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T03:20:47Z","Content":"1. Control surfaces.

But they always end up sticking up in some manner of 90 degree angle! Why is that, and how may I fix it?\n\nThis is a new feature. They didn\\\u0027t used to work like that. But you can still get horizontal surfaces by putting them on the wingtip.\n\n2. Air-breathing engines. What, why, and how, gentlekerbs?\n\nBasically, these will not work in space. Less air - less thrust.\n\n3. Trim. Is that...no, I actually have no idea. What is trim? Why would I want it? And how does it work?\n\nElevons and airlerons. Like what most jet airliners use.\n\n4. Mk2 and Mk3 fuselage. I apologise for my ignorance, but \\*what\\* are these?\n\nMk2 is the smaller one. Use these on things like fighters and light bombers. Mk3 is the larger hull type, and this is for airliners, heavy bombers, and crazy Tim\\_Barrett designs.\n\n5. RCS-Port-Linear. I know RCS. I do not know Port-Linear.\n\nThis was in C7\\\u0027s Flight Pack. It\\\u0027s an RCS port pointing straight outwards, rather than to the sides like normal RCS. Used for pushing the ship around, rather than moving laterally.\n\n6. Avionics Package. It says \u0027sensors\u0027 and \u0027computer\u0027. Guess what? - WHAT?\n\nIt\\\u0027s an ASAS, only smaller.\n\n7. Rams. Evidently not meant for battering. Someone explain, please.\n\nRamscoop, I think. Probably just something to make it look cool, and to give it the impression of looking like an engine. Haven\\\u0027t seen it myself.\n\n8. The Tail Connector. It looks ridiculous, but surely it has some manner of purpose, yes?\n\nIt\\\u0027s for putting tailplanes on. Basically, this is where the rear wings go on a small aircraft.\n\n9.
