Whenever I turn SAS off, my spaceplane gets a phantom roll signal presumably from the joystick and only goes away if I apply an input on the same axis. Without any input it goes to full roll. How can I fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I should add that I use FAR\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-19T14:20:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2015 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AK von Bismarck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T06:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be able to remedy this by setting the dead zones for your stick. IIRC, there are settings for this in KSP on a per-axis basis, but the fancy sticks usually also come with access to modifying dead zones in the joystick properties as well. Check the joystick settings, or whatever joystick programming software the vendor has supplied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it will only work if it\u0027s still functional, and the phantom signal isn\u0027t twitching past a reasonable threshold for the dead zones. For example, my X-52, the Twist axis on the stick was twitching so bad at centre (again, checking the Joystick Testing within the custom drivers provided) that a dead zone was useless,...so I eventually had to cut it out of the inputs all together...for all games, as it seemed to be a hardware problem at that point. (The stick is several years old, and has seen a few thousand miles)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
