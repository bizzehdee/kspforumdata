Higher listed temperatures and larger mass are some things that contribute to better withstanding heat. However, some parts just blow up more than they should due to shape and other factors, so you will likely need some experimentation.\n\n2) Some people design stock weapons, so you could try searching around that\n\n3) Struts!"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T00:17:30Z","Content":"First question: I do not know which part is the most resistant to heat but there are 3 factors which, for a single part, can be used to determine this:\n\n1: heat tolerance, given in part description in the VAB or SPH\n\n2: Area: highly radiative parts evacuate heat better and overheat less (wing parts are the best radiators). You can have an idea of which part is better by using the debug menu (Alt \u002B F12), enabling thermal info in part menus (don\u0027t remember the exact name of the option) then right click on a part in flight and compare radiative flux with others.\n\n3: Thermal mass: the higher it is, the more energy a part will need to heat. Fuel tanks are usually the best at these. Thermal mass is displayed the same way as radiative flux above.\n\nSecond: I think all 1.25 m parts have the same explosion size, if not I guess the biggest 1.25 m part which is the Kickback SRB. Not sure on that one.\n\nThird: All parts in KSP are rigid, it is the links between two parts that actually bend. The larger the parts linked are, the more rigid the link; although, larger parts are more massive and exert more forces on the links, making them bend more, so that will depend on your rocket layout and the use of these parts. If you want to have a more rigid rocket, use struts (this is easily in the Top 5 golden rules in KSP). You may also want to look at impact tolerance, shown in the VAB/SPH which tells you how hard a part can hit the ground without breaking."}]}
