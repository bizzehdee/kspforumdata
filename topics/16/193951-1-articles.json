I\u0027m not trying to do anything extravagant now, just trying to get a good launch into equatorial orbit.\u00A0I seem to have two problems that I can\u0027t completely solve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem 1: After turning east after liftoff and turning on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E-prograde the rocket deviates from its heading and heads off-course quickly resulting in a predicted orbit not 0 degree inclination. This issue doesn\u0027t occur if I remove the boosters completely, showing that the side boosters are the problem. I\u0027m 99% sure I don\u0027t have any asymmetry in the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem 2: Sometimes the boosters wobble after launch causing all sorts of problems, sometimes catastrophic.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve already tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Playing around with exact position of radial decouplers on the main stage, and the position of the boosters on the decouplers. I can sometimes mitigate the issue of wobbling but it\u0027s counter-intuitive since in the picture below I have everything seemingly \u0022centred\u0022 so it should be ok??? Yet there\u0027s still wobbling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Moving booster orientation from N/S to E/W (that shouldn\u0027t make any difference right??)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Removing fins from main stage (doesn\u0027t help)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Changing solid boosters to liquid ones (same issue with course deviation)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Adding struts to connect the booster pairs together with 2x symmetry (no matter how many struts I add there\u0027s still a significant problem, should I connect struts to the main stage or just between the boosters)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Adding launch stability enhancers (doesn\u0027t help at all)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice appreciated. Really getting frustrating since this issue never seems to come up in videos of other people using them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KMaj5pG.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.96\u0022 height=\u0022679\u0022 width=\u00221014\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KMaj5pG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-17T17:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither the boosters nor that type of fin can pivot to help with steering. I suspect your problem is a matter of having to apply a lot of corrections and counter-corrections, causing flexion. Use the pivoting fins, if you have them yet. Yes, strut the upper part of the booster to the central stack. Just one each should be enough to eliminate most of the trouble. And otherwise, just try to steer gently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWelcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-17T18:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002227914\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Vanamonde\u003C/a\u003E said, which is true, your fins aren\u0027t steerable - your solid rocket boosters are the only thing firing on your first stage and THOSE aren\u0027t steerable either. They don\u0027t have a gimble to redirect your rocket\u0027s course. You don\u0027t have much control until you drop them and switch to the stage with what I\u0027m guessing is an LV-45 engine which DOES have a gimble to pivot and direct the rocket\u0027s course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, like Vanamonde said, replace the fins with steerable fins, and/or maybe move the LV-45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine down into the first stage so that it fires with the side boosters to give you more steering control. Just be sure to right click on the boosters and turn down your thrust so that you aren\u0027t accelerating too fast with all three going. This might not be necessary if the steerable fins give you enough control to steer the ship though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-17T19:41:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2020 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-17T19:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStrut the nosecones rather than the boosters.\u00A0 I know it looks terrible, but the boosters are already fairly well secured by the decouplers.\u00A0 The game simplifies physics in ways that makes things weird, like strutting parts that already have a direct connection having little effect.\u00A0 I\u0027ve built many a rocket with virtually the same design and I always strut the nose cones.\u00A0 Actually I autostrut them, but the difference should be minimal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat pod is not horizontally symmetrical in the orientation you have it sitting in.\u00A0 There\u0027s a ladder and window on top that doesn\u0027t exist on the bottom.\u00A0 The game does some calculations for the aerodynamics on the surfaces facing into the airflow so that could be causing a pull to the north or south.\u00A0 I\u0027m seeing something hanging off the \u0022bottom\u0022 side of the pod too, near the parachute, that would be the left side in the photo.\u00A0 That could be pulling.\u00A0 Rotate your nose cone so the window faces N or S and you should only get pull in the vertical direction during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that I have NEVER seen a flight come off the pad and turn east with precisely 0 inclination without my input and most of the time, even with active piloting, it doesn\u0027t go below around 0.04 degrees on my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E readout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour rocket is simple and pointy, there will be more gravity losses than aerodynamic ones in this design.\u00A0 Fire both boosters and the main engine at launch and get away from Kerbin as fast as possible, while also enjoying the gimbal on that Swivel engine.\u00A0 You shouldn\u0027t need the fins at all in this case.\u00A0 Use fuel flow priority to drain the fuel at the bottom tanks too which will help keep the rocket pointed prograde.\u00A0 I used to concern myself with airspeed on launch, but I have seen far less delta-v consumed with a max speed launch than slow and steady with concerns about breaking the sound barrier, in these designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompletely irrelevant to the topic, but do you like that shroud on the heat shield?\u00A0 I hate them, you should be able to move the decoupler to a slightly higher attachment point and eliminate the checkerboard shroud.\u00A0 I also wonder about their aerodynamic effects since it sticks out from the side of the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-17T22:09:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2020 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by overkill13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekJ","CreatedById":204698,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-17T19:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put struts on the boosters and more importantly added steerable fins.
