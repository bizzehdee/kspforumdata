at minimum output, then you will have problems\u00A0because it means that your daytime recharge rate is at most 1.7 EC/s.\u00A0 The closer you orbit Kerbin, the more of your orbit is spent in the dark, and if you do not have enough panel to charge the station in the day to make it last the night, then you will run out of power every orbit.\u00A0 You can make your panel situation better by boosting to a higher orbit (one where the darkness time is one third or less of the\u00A0orbital period), but while that means you spend less of a percentage of your orbit in darkness, it also increases the total time spent in darkness, which necessitates more batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion to you is to dock a power module to the lower docking port (have docking ports on both\u00A0ends so you don\u0027t lose your docking point) that consists of at least three of the 1.6 solar panels in a column\u00A0arranged in trilateral symmetry (for a total of nine panels), a few Z-400 batteries (I prefer to arrange them between the solar panels), and preferably a level 2 or better probe core (that list\u00A0starts with the Okto-2, I think).\u00A0 The level-2 cores include normal/antinormal hold, which is helpful with docking and can be exploited for better power control, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you set your station to normal (not north), then with the panel arrangement I described, you will never run out of power in daylight (I leave provision of\u00A0sufficient batteries for night and eclipses to\u00A0you); the minimum power output of a trilateral set is just over 1.5 times the maximum output of any one side, so each side needs to produce only two-thirds of your total.\u00A0 If your current set of four can run the station in full sun, then you\u00A0need two and two-thirds panels on each leg of\u00A0a trilateral set, which is why I specify three.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, \u003Ca

stay\u00A0where you left it, and assumes the labs had power to convert data to science if there was charge when you left. \u00A0\u003Cem\u003EAssuming \u003C/em\u003Ethat holds true for your game, you

you lift your station high enough, \u0026gt;250km over Kerbin, \u00A0the game leaves the station in fixed orientation relative to the stars while you are away. \u00A0That would leave your original design working well for about 1/4 of a year, until Kerbin\u00A0orbits to the other side of the sun, taking your station with it. \u00A0Gargemel\u0027s advice helps here,

posting a reply last night, visitors came in unexpectedly and pushed the whole space program off schedule, did\u00A0NASA have this problem when planning on sending Neil and the boys to the moon?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt looks like the charge does indeed freeze when I\u0027m away from the station.\u00A0 Ok it might actually jump up a point or two when I switch back, but that slight boost is the same whether I\u0027m away for one minute or ten (an few alarms triggered and I had to deal with a couple of things during testing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah Zhetaan you\u0027re right about the lack of power generation.\u00A0 As I said previously, my original plan had been to have the station orientated so the panels faced antinormal while passing over the daylight side of the planet.\u00A0 This would also have made docking much easier as the docking ports are on both ends of the station.\u00A0 I am indeed planning on launching a new module with more panels and additional batteries and attaching it to the side facing south using a Klaw.\u00A0 That should resolve any problems the demand placed on my present generations system by the greedy science lab is creating when processing data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving tested how the recharging works while away from the space station, I have now turned off all science processing, recharged the batteries fully, and now started processing again as SpaceLab crossed the terminator and started its journey over the night side of Kerbin, now I\u0027m not focused on it and will go back after it has started going over the sunlit\u00A0side to see if the processed science has increased.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there\u0027s a bug then I\u0027m in trouble, but I\u0027ll cross that bridge when I come to it.\u00A0 I have 1.4 and the DLC, but for some reason I just can\u0027t warm to it.\u00A0 I have had problems with contracts not completing even though all test conditions had green ticks beside them, I think that hasn\u0027t helped.\u00A0 So I\u0027m still on 1.2, working on flying a Kerbal to Duna and bringing it home again.\u00A0 Lifting the station into a higher orbit, would involve me sending a new module with an engine to propel it as I jettisoned the original and deorbited it.\u00A0 It\u0027s doable but I would prefer to keep it in\u00A0its current orbit if
