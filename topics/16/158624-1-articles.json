Every stack needs a pointy object on the front, and a pointy one on the back. \u00A0 You can even apply cones to the back of engines that have rear attach nodes, to avoid the drag penalty from unused nodes - just offset the cone inside the engine so it doesnt block exhaust. \u00A0 Finally, when joining parts together, the attach nodes of the parts being joined should be the same size. \u00A0 \u00A0 Eg. \u00A01.25m engine attached to a 2.5m attach node on a 2.5m part creates excess drag. \u00A0 Use a 2.5m to 1.25m adapter in between the two, or a 2.5m triple engine mount, to reduce drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reusables","CreatedById":179182,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-03T04:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is single-stage-to-orbit.

You don\u0027t want the plane shifting its balance point mid-flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E close behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. How close is a judgement call; the closer it is, the more agile the plane; the further it is, the more stable the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) You want enough wing to keep your takeoff speed below 100m/s, and enough engine to hit that speed before the end of the runway. Anything more is a luxury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) In a tricycle setup, the rear landing gear should be just behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. If it\u0027s a lightweight Mk1, you can get away with mounting gear on the wings. Anything heavier and you want to stick to fuselage mounting to reduce flex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Drag is king. Don\u0027t mount anything on the surface of your ship if you can stick it in a cargo/service bay instead. If it\u0027s a Mk2 or Mk3, build in enough wing incidence so that you can keep the nose on prograde during the speed run; a few degrees is usually sufficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) You need sufficient control authority to move the plane in three axes: roll, pitch and yaw. In each case, the further the control surface is from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, the more power it will have. It\u0027s all about leverage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) One shock cone or intercooler will feed three RAPIERs. One ram air intake will feed two. Etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) Make it look like a plausibly realistic plane. You can make freaky SF ships once you get good, but to begin with, you\u0027ve got more chance of success if you copy the basic airframe of a real plane.

For Science and more. If the tool can\u0027t be included \u00A0(stowed) it works Perfect and is interactable for Kerbals but Greatly reduce drag for the craft. On other hand if you dont have anithing breackable inside of service bay you can missuse them as Aerobrakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny Kabooms\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUrses\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T14:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst thing is not all SSTOs are planes. \u00A0So if you are good at traditional rockets, try building a rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0 One that takes off like a rocket, and lands on its tail or lands like a plane. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one that I built it is a fascinating test craft, that I may expand on later. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E space plane takes off like a rocket (from its tail on a launch gantry). \u00A0But lands like a plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228Do2B6m.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8Do2B6m.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this was a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0022Rocket\u0022 and tail lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CcVX0z2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CcVX0z2.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbital","CreatedById":170602,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T15:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ: How do I \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: Tweak your engine cfg files \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
