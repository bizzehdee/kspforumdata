Higher TWRs also work, but the launch may be a bit inefficient, if you can\u0027t do the gravity turn quickly enough. Throttling down is completely unnecessary, unless the rocket starts to wobble due to an extremely high TWR (usually above 3 or so).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also quite difficult to get the dynamic pressure high enough to cause any trouble.
