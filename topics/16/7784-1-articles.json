A drawback is that it may create more space junk around the planet than necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been doing it differently, I just keep going straight on up until the trajectory maximum reaches 11400km which is the Munar orbit radius. Consumed steps will fall back to Kerbin as no orbit exists at that stage. Ideally the moon waits for you there (at this point the fuel consumption should be equal to the Trans Munar one), but otherwise you have to accelerate in the opposite direction of the moon and align with its orbit. A good thing is that you never miss it. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-07T21:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can always drop a stage so it reenters the atmosphere or crashes into the mun surface. The fuel consumption of orbiting Kerbin first vs. going straight up depends on how much thrust to weight you have available.

A good way to demonstrate this is to burn your engines at a low enough thrust that you leave the launchpad very slowly. Obviously, you\\\u0027re going to have to use up a ton of fuel to get to orbit (if it\\\u0027s even possible like that). By burning towards the horizon, you add orbital energy without any of it being eaten up by gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just did the calculations...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting at 100km, the velocity required to go straight up to 11,400km is 3077m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe velocity required to get to the same altitude with a horizontal vector is 3087m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question is: which way can you get to that velocity while burning the least amount of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-08T17:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaunch over the sea to a \\\u0027parking\\\u0027 altitude. That\\\u0027s anywhere outside the atmosphere, 70,000m or 1 million metres, it doesn\\\u0027t matter. Depends how much fuel you want to waste. (lower is better, obviously.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you get an orbit - it doesn\\\u0027t have to be particularly circular, just within reason and the Apses (Ap, Pe) should be above 70,000m (150,000 for 50x warp). Then go into time warp, making sure if your rocket\\\u0027s attitude is somewhat close to your prograde vector. (Green circle with 3 lines coming off it and NO X inside, this should only be an issue if you have a fairly large or hard to control rocket like my standard Mun rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch while in time warp (I advise no higher than 50x) until the Mun has appeared over the curve of Kerbin, then burn at the prograde vector I mentioned earlier. Your Apoapsis (Ap) will begin to move, across and up. It should settle at around 70-90 degrees ahead of the Mun. Burn until you have an Ap of 11,000,000 to 12,000,000. You\\\u0027ll then be on an intercept course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your intercept is successful, your sphere of influence will change to the Mun, indicated by a rapid shift in all instrument data. On the orbital map, you should now have a green line, a parabolic orbit, going towards the Mun. Ideally, if you have a periapsis, wait until here then burn retrograde (the same icon as Prograde but with an X) Until you get an Apoapsis and lower that down to your intended orbit. There you go, a Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of this is inaccurate/doesn\\\u0027t make sense, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProof that this method works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/2n1w6qd.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222n1w6qd.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just used this method to get to the Mun; this is the only method I ever use. Also, the probe here is excellent for landing practice. I had an NP mid-length 1m tank and the medium power NP 1m engine under it, decoupled at about 5m/s and 1500m alt. Don\\\u0027t expect to return home in it, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s worth noting that using this method, you sometimes end up with an orbit that intersects the Mun. This means you\\\u0027re going to go boom if you keep going on it. My solution to that is to point at the triad with the dot on the navball (retrograde vector to KSC I think), turn 90 degrees, then burn across. This gave me a Pe in a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xivios","CreatedById":3685,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-09T00:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the Horizon method is very good and always works. You can, with some experience, learn to \u0027tweak\u0027 the parabolic orbit by shifting the apoapsis, but it\\\u0027s not really necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you enter the muns SOI, it\\\u0027s very easy to enter an eastbound or westbound munar orbit by watching the map view and burning either east or west until the periapsis appears on the desired side - just because the mun is a fairly small dot doesn\\\u0027t mean the navball artificial horizon/compass doesn\\\u0027t work - east, west, north and south still have a lot of meaning even when the ground is so far away. Incidentally Kerbin will be to the east from your position, which is why KSC pro and retrograde marks also work at this stage. It doesn\\\u0027t take much fuel to do s as long as your far away from the mun when you do it, ideally, it would be done by a proper timing of the initial injection burn, but it\\\u0027s much easier to see with the map view when you enter the muns SOI and at that point you\\\u0027re still far enough away to correct it how you orbit the mun without burning much fuel. A mid-course north or south burn can even help to reduce the inclination off the equator, but you probably won\\\u0027t fix it entirely until your in munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve also noted that a fresh persistance file will allow a fairly direct ascent with no Kerbin orbit if you pitch over about 30 degrees east and hold it there until apoapsis is at munar orbit. But that only works for your first launch, or a demo launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-09T16:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy main issue with Munar transfer right now is indeed being off the ecliptic by a LOT. My inclination if I burn using the horizon method tends to be screwed up because I always end up in a direct descent and have to burn perpendicular. Without any autopilot or an orbital plane indicator, it\\\u0027s almost impossible to keep that 0 degree inclination. That\\\u0027s my main worry when it comes to my Munar missions - I\\\u0027m planning 1 more landing mission with the pod I posted before I land a third then attempt to rendezvous with a manned mission; Surveyor 3 and X craft (\u0026lt;--- gold star to the first person to work out which craft X craft is.)

I just managed to get Surveyor II to tap Surveyor I after landing 8km to the south. Might be a bit more difficult with a Manned Lander because there\\\u0027ll only really be one direction of thrust instead of the 6 made available by RCS.
