I\u0027m new to the game and have looked at a few of the tutorials, but I have a question about orbit angles - I\u0027m not quite sure that\u0027s the right word.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, a picture is attached to explain. I\u0027ve tried heading north or south after liftoff, but then am not able to get into orbit. Can anyone please help?

Launching East or West will put you in an equatorial orbit (90 or 270 on the navball), East being in the direction of the planet\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything in between is a balance between N/S and E/W; launch North-East or South-West for the other orbit you\u0027ve drawn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all cases, the only difference in getting to orbit is the angle at which you\u0027re moving relative to the equator. At apoapsis you\u0027ll need to circularise by burning in the direction you\u0027re moving, which may be where you\u0027re going wrong (hard to tell what the problem is, the difference in dV between orbits you \u003Cem\u003Elaunch\u003C/em\u003E into is next to nothing) rather than burning East like you would in an equatorial launch. For a polar orbit, launch north, push your orbit out of the atmosphere by continuing northwards, reach the apoapsis and then burn north (or south, if you\u0027ve passed the pole by that point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively you can get into an equatorial orbit and burn North/South to change to one of the orbits you\u0027ve drawn.
