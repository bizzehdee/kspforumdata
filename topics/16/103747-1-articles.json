You could have hundreds of mods like kerbal engineer while a few part heavy mods like B9 or basically any mod that adds a lot of textures will quickly bring you to the memory limit.\n\n1.0 might allow you to use a few part mods more if they manage to get rid of the memory leaks."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T10:21:53Z","Content":"A 32-bit application such as KSP can only use a maximum of 4GB, even if run on a 64-bit operating system. Internally, it just can\u0027t \u0027count\u0027 high enough to talk about/with any more memory than that.\n\n\u0022How many\u0022 mods depends on how big they are though and, since 1.0 is changing the memory-handling along with everything else, how (in)efficiently KSP handles them.\n\nSince we don\u0027t know what 1.0\u0027s performance is going to be like yet and every mod has a different requirement there\u0027s no straightforward answer to the question I\u0027m afraid."},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T10:39:42Z","Content":"As I find KSP bland without B9, Novapunch,KW and extra planet mods I have had to switch to the linux version.
