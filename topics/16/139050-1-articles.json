The station in orbit. A drill/ore\u00A0ship. A rover with a convert-o-tron on it, a klaw, and a big fuel tank. And a very simple lander, with an even bigger fuel tank. The rover attaches to the drill, converts to fuel, drives over to the lander, fills it up. The lander flies up and docks with the station, then comes back down.
