I am sure that will be changed once the part recovery mechanic is implemented in the game, but right now any part that is dropped from your rocket is considered debris, and if you place the parachutes in the same stage as the decoupler that releases the part, when you drop it the parachutes will open nicely (if you follow it down it you can see that it will probably even survive the landing), but as soon as you move farther away from it than 2.5 kilometers it will simply be deleted if its altitude is lower then 20km or so... This is because of the current debris atmosphere reentry mechanics - unless it\\\u0027s landed, any debris is deleted as soon as it drops below 20-25km if it is on rails (which it is as soon as it is farther than 2.5km from your ship).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MFToast","CreatedById":14280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-20T05:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou\\\u0027re right, VincentMcConnell, it does work... was I imagining things?!
