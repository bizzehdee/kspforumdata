Even with nuke engines, if I need to carry a sizeable lander beyond Duna I bring an interplanetary cruise stage, the lander itself, and a refueling tanker. The cruise stage carries the lander and uses up the vast majority of its fuel getting to Jool and then getting into orbit. Then the lander goes and lands. In the meantime, the refueling tanker (flown separately from the other two) arrives with about half of its fuel or more still remaining and docks with the cruise vehicle in orbit, transfers all of its fuel and then deorbits with RCS. The lander returns to the now partially-fueled cruise stage, the crew transfers and the lander is ditched before burning back for Kerbin. By doing this I have plenty of fuel left upon my return to Kerbin to circularize my orbit and rendezvous and dock with my space station so I can reuse the interplanetary stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a breakdown of my standard deep-space mission design so that you can see what kind of infrastructure you\u0027re going to need to bring:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECruise stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 big orange tank, four nuke engines (mounted radially on some structural parts), four 1-m RCS tanks and RCS thrusters for docking, one hab module, one 2-kerbal lander can, and senior docking ports on the front and back (plus extras like solar panels, lights, batteries, antennae, etc. for utility/show).

My Vall lander had two nuke engines, but the Dres version only used 2 LV-909s, it turns out that the extra fuel required by the chemical engines weighed less than the difference in mass between the nukes and the chems.

There is a single senior docking port on the front.

One of the types of separate \u0022ship\u0022 you can send is one in which the payload is just an unburned full fuel tank with docking ports.
