I have tried to switch the controls back to the way they were before 1.0 and now they\u0027re completely knackered. so I guess what I\u0027m asking in short is: How do I change them back to the way they were pre 1.0?\n\nany help with this will be greatly appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
