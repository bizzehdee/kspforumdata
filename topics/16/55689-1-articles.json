I\u0027m no longer synchronous with Kerbin , I am lost as to how to plan interplanetary transfers without knowing what phase angel I need to shoot for in order to time the encounter. This ship does not have mechjeb. The best aprt about mech jeb is that it gives you that burn window time. That\u0027s all I need as I basically get the stock maneuver node maker to fine tune after I see there will be an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, I\u0027m Lost in Space, I don\u0027t know how to find a reference point for the phase angels that are found on the phase angel calculator some one made, in order know WHEN to burn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDANGER WILL KERBALSON HELP WILL KERBALSON!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T02:49:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a pinch, you can always almost-match orbits and warp until close enough for an intercept.

You should see an indicator of closest approach and it should be at the other (Dn/An) node. Execute that maneuver\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4/ put a maneuver at the place where the two orbits intersect and pull prograde till the other indicator is against it. If that would mean you would exceed the target orbit, time warp one orbit and try again. When the approach indicator tells you that you get below 2000 km distance, it\u0027s ok (but of course get it as low as you can). When you find a match, execute that maneuver. While thrusting, delete the maneuver node and check what real indicators are doing. Stop your thrust at minimum of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5/ Time warp a little behind the place of your next-orbit-rendezvous and put another maneuver node on it. This time do what is necessary to put the two orbits on top of each other (i.e. match inclination, excentricity, Ap, Pe, everything as close as possible). Execute that maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage you should be relatively close to your target (below 2000 km) and at approximately matching orbital parameters (i.e. low relative velocity). From there you can start executing standard orbital approach using navball. Use map view only to check your distance to the target (necessary when the distance is over 100km; shown when you put mouse over it), do not trust anything else shown in the map.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-10T11:12:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2013 11:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
