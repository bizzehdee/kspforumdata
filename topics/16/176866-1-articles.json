looking for a window.\u00A0 If your two vessels share an orbit, there technically is no window, because they will always have the same relative orbital alignment.\u00A0 Thus there\u0027s no time that is any more or less favourable to make the transfer.\u00A0 Since you\u0027re obviously running Outer Planets Mod, I invite you to look at Polta and Priax; Priax is a simulated Trojan body, so it has no transfer window to Polta (and vise versa) because it never gets any closer or farther away.\u00A0 The correct solution for this is to burn for an intercept in much the same fashion as you would an asteroid rendezvous.\u00A0 If you haven\u0027t done that yet, then look at the video tutorials (don\u0027t try to run one on your own copy of KSP--the tutorial scenarios won\u0027t play well with the

of as a transfer window is actually a window for a Hohmann transfer.\u00A0 If you\u0027re using a different kind of manoeuvre, then different windows apply.\u00A0 You\u0027ll have to determine what is best for yourself, though; I don\u0027t know the\u00A0type of manoeuvre you\u0027re planning to use.\u00A0 Note that if you want to send a second flotilla (or only a single resupply vessel) on a Hohmann transfer, the Hohmann transfer windows for the outer planets all occur about once per\u00A0year.\u00A0 This is because the outer planets revolve about the Sun so slowly compared to Kerbin, and over so much more distance on\u00A0their\u00A0orbits, that they are relatively almost motionless compared to Kerbin.\u00A0 That means that you can plan on sending resupply a tiny bit less than once per year if minimum-fuel rendezvous is important to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWere I in your position, I would choose to try to rendezvous the \u003Cem\u003ENissee Orbit Spares\u003C/em\u003E first.\u00A0 My reasoning is pragmatic:\u00A0 the vessel is already near to rendezvous anyway, and it\u0027s the more expendable of the two:\u00A0 whether or not you manage to\u00A0effect a rescue with \u003Cem\u003ENissee Orbit Spares\u003C/em\u003E, you will\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the \u003Cem\u003ENissee Base\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 If\u00A0you have

if you lose\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ENissee Base\u003C/em\u003E, you won\u0027t be able to get back.\u00A0 I\u0027m going to guess that you planned the same amount of food and supplies for the return trip

\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003EBecause you\u0027ve got that nice, long seven-years-out-of-a-nine-year flight ahead of your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt means that if you open your map view, you can already see where your troubled ship is going to hit its solar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E, nine years from now.\u00A0 So you just need to visually estimate \u0022where is the ship going to be, around 2-3 years before \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022.\u00A0 And that\u0027s easy to do, because those last 2-3 years are going to be when the ship is moving super slowly (because it\u0027s waaaaaay out in the outer solar system at the outer end of a very eccentric orbit), so it won\u0027t cover much distance during that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all you need to do is look at where your target ship\u0027s solar \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E is, and then mentally estimate a point along the orbit that\u0027s \u0022a bit\u0022 before that.\u00A0 It helps that you don\u0027t have to get it exactly, because as long as you can get it somewhat approximately, that\u0027s good enough for launching purposes.\u00A0 Even though you won\u0027t nail it perfectly, the error will be easily corrected by adjusting burns at launch time and won\u0027t

the sun at the center, all you\u0027re trying to guesstimate is \u0022at which o\u0027clock will the intercept happen\u0022, and as long as you get it within one or two clock-hours, you\u0027ll be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note:\u00A0 If this kind of wild-ass guesstimate bugs you and you\u0027d prefer a more accurate picture, you could always just do a quicksave and then timewarp

a hard-and-fast requirement, nor are they a simple binary on/off thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRather, there are certain times that are \u0022ideal\u0022 for making the transfer (i.e. require minimum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E)... but it\u0027s not as though you have to be right at that moment and if you go outside it there\u0027s suddenly a huge stair-step increase in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required.\u00A0 Rather, if you launch a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elittle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bit outside the \u0022ideal window\u0022, it just needs a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elittle\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E bit of extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Launching further outside requires more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically, you can launch any time you like.\u00A0 It\u0027s just a question of how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you\u0027re willing to spend.\u00A0 As Kerbin circles the sun, a few points in that orbit will be really good \u0022windows\u0022; and there will be some points that are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eabsolutely terrible\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E; and there will be a really broad swath of points in between that are kinda mediocre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is very tight-- e.g. you\u0027re lugging a heavy

have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare to take a less-efficient trajectory.\u00A0 But the more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E you have, the less you have to care.\u00A0 If you\u0027ve\u00A0 got 2000 or 3000 m/s of \u0022extra\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, that can make a huge difference in flexibility of launching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this case, you\u0027re shipping a pretty small payload (six tons), so it\u0027s not too hard to engineer your ship to give it a metric crapload of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to play with, which gives you a lot of flexibility.\u00A0 You don\u0027t need to worry about \u0022get a really good launch

straightforward here because you know what direction you\u0027re going (having estimated the intercept location in step 1 above).\u00A0 You know that you want to eject from the inner solar system going in a certain direction.\u00A0 So all you need to do is pick where to eject from Kerbin in order to make that happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few ways to slice this, but there are two main types of path you could follow, both of which probably involve a similar amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, so you should just pick whichever one is available soonest.\u00A0 (Yes, there will be some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E difference between the two, but it won\u0027t be a

a-ticking so sooner is probably better.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroadly speaking, the two choices of trajectory you could take are \u003Cstrong\u003Edirect\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ebi-elliptic.\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EMore wordage below, but the executive summary of these two paths looks like

title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E and do a big burn there.\u00A0 In other words, you eject from Kerbin going the \u0022wrong direction\u0022 but then use the sun\u0027s gravity to make a U-turn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you\u0027re wondering, \u0022what\u0027s the longest I\u0027d have to wait for one of these windows to pop up, some analysis in

orbiting the sun in its 360-degree circle, there will be some point on that circle that\u0027s the best place to eject for a direct path... and there will also be another point, roughly 180 degrees away, that will be the best place to eject for a bi-elliptic path.\u00A0 Those two points will be the \u0022best\u0022 places to eject.\u00A0 The \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eworst\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E places to eject will be 90 degrees away from those points.\u00A0 Since you\u0027ll design your ship to have a fair amount of extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, you\u0027re okay with being a reasonable distance away from the optimal points-- you just want to avoid the worst ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say we\u0027re okay with launching when we\u0027re, oh, 20 degrees plus-or-minus from the \u0022ideal\u0022.\u00A0 What\u0027s the absolute longest you\u0027d need to wait to launch?\u00A0 Well, in the worst-case scenario, you\u0027ve just gone a bit too far (i.e just over 20 degrees) past one opportunity, so you need to wait until you\u0027re 20 degrees before the next opportunity on the opposite side of Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 So, that means in the worst case you\u0027d need to wait for 180 degrees of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, minus the 20 degrees you\u0027ve already gone past one window, minus the 20 degrees before the next opportunity, i.e. 140 degrees of Kerbin\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 So that\u0027s about 39% of an orbin, meaning you\u0027ve got a reasonable window coming up no more than 160 or so days away even in the absolute worst case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR:\u00A0 you don\u0027t have to wait all that long for a window.\u00A0 Significantly less than half a Kerbin year, even in the worst possible case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay.\u00A0 Now that we\u0027ve established that you won\u0027t have to wait too long... let\u0027s figure out which of the two path types you want, and when to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo describe these, I\u0027ll go back to the clock metaphor again.\u00A0 Picture the solar system as a clock dial, with the sun at the center and your target intercept location (i.e. nearly out at the distance of Neidon) as being on the rim of the clock.\u00A0 On that scale, Kerbin is orbiting really really close to the central hub of the \u0022clock\u0022.\u00A0 To keep visualization easy, let\u0027s rotate our frame of reference so that the intercept location is at 12 o\u0027clock on the clock rim.\u00A0 I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re looking down at the solar system from over the sun\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enorth\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E pole, so all the planets are orbiting counterclockwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what we\u0027re trying to figure out is, \u0022at which o\u0027clock would Kerbin need to be located in order to launch on a direct path?\u0022\u00A0 And same deal for a bi-elliptic path.\u00A0 Got it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, let\u0027s look at the direct path first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nImagine the slowest possible scenario, where you\u0027re trying to optimize for \u0022minimum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022 and don\u0027t care how long it takes to get to the destination.\u00A0 In that case, you\u0027d want to launch when Kerbin is at the 6 o\u0027clock position.\u00A0 That\u0027s because your transfer path is half of an ellipse, so you\u0027re going through 180 degrees of clock in order to get to the

gun, and you\u0027ll be travelling in a nearly perfect straight line the whole way.\u00A0 In that case, you\u0027d launch when Kerbin is at the 3 o\u0027clock position, because the target\u0027s at 12 o\u0027clock and Kerbin-at-3-o\u0027clock is where Kerbin is traveling in the desired direction, i.e. straight towards the target.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, those are the two

and 5 o\u0027clock position-- I\u0027d guess closer to 4 than 5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, that\u0027s the \u003Cstrong\u003Edirect-path\u003C/strong\u003E launch position.\u00A0 What about the bi-elliptic launch position?\u00A0 Well, it\u0027s around 180 degrees away, so that would be likely between the 10 o\u0027clock and 11 o\u0027clock positions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight.\u00A0 So.\u00A0 Rotate your map view so that the intercept location is at 12 o\u0027clock, and look at where Kerbin is now, and picture Kerbin continuing in its orbit.\u00A0 Will Kerbin arrive at roughly 4-5 o\u0027clock sooner?\u00A0 Or 10-11 o\u0027clock?\u00A0 That\u0027ll tell you which one of the two main path types will open up to you
