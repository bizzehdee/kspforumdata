Most notably, if you have a probe on a suicide drop into Jool\u0027s atmosphere or on a super-fast fly-by of a celestial body, being able to transmit faster can make a huge difference."},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T16:03:40Z","Content":"I guess looks plays into it as well.

Sending off 500 data with the little red/white antenna takes several real-time minutes, which you can\u0027t time-warp to speed up or switch to another ship.
