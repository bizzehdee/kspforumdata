It bent back while it was going on but made it there intact, 4 ports would be better, but any large construction with that kind of docking would have a lot of parts. so count up the total parts and if thats lower than what your computer can handle then use the quad or tri dock. but if you are docking a bunch of separate quads at once then you will prolly run into the same issues but havent tried that bit just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei can confirm that all the ports did indeed dock, none were left just looking like they did\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T16:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh jeez, that is a monster.

LV-Ns only provide superior dV overall when you have a TWR somewhere less than one, due to how low their natural (i.e. without payload) TWR is.
