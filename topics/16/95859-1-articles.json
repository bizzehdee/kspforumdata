You will generally want a variable thrust main engine (you can use boosters but dial down your main engine as the boosters burn off their fuel). Approx. thrust to weight ratio of 1.5 minimum at launch which should climb to 2\u002B by the first 10km of ascent. Higher TWR (2.5-3 ish) is useful above 10km until about 30km altitude to keep accelerating up to terminal speed, which rapidly increases with altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) A smooth ascent profile (the simplest to learn first is the classic 10km vertical then 45 degrees until apoapsis is 75km, then coast to apoapsis for circularisation. I personally (unless I have seriously too much TWR) start turning slowly at 8km then keep reducing heading until dipping below the artificial ground horizon so the gravity turn continues at about 50-55km until apoapsis hits 75km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Adequate torque (for a light craft), or a gimballed main engine (for heavier craft) and/or control wingtips to maintain this smooth ascent profile. The T30 engine may look better than the T45 engine due to lower mass and more thrust but for any early-career typical multi-stage tall and wobbly rocket, the T45 will give you more consistent dV to orbit due to a superior ascent profile. T30\u0027s work ok if you have lots of torque or wingtips and a symmetrical design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best launch vehicles at early game include SRB\u0027s for cheap launches. Tweak the thrust downwards in the VAB to prevent it blasting above terminal speed. Boost initially with your main engines till 100 m/s then let the SRB\u0027s carry you up to 10km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to ascend efficiently makes a vast difference to the tonnage and dV you have to play with once in orbit for your payload. Ascending too fast or too vertically can easily cost upwards of 500 m/s which is equivalent to the dV needed for a Munar landing descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T22:51:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeddah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zeddah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you mean by set throttle to 26%.
