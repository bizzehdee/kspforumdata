So the only efficient way to do this is to launch into the right inclination, or change your inclination from a very high Kerbin orbit (further away than the Mun).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T19:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDMagic, I had thought about that as well in the past, but I couldn\u0027t figure out the right way to do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esometimes, after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, my ship even had an inclination that went in the opposite direction I was seeking. ugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat\u0027s your method?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T20:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen launching into the correct inclination I first have to wait for Kerbin and Moho to be at a node (I think I use the descending node, because that lets you meet Moho near its periapsis). Just target Moho so that its orbit shows up in green, then try to look straight through Kerbin to the sun. You can use the Mun\u0027s orbit to do this, line everything up so that the Mun passes directly in front and directly behind Kerbin. Then just wait until you are about to cross Moho\u0027s orbit, the green circle representing its orbit will start to collapse to a single green line near a node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have to launch at the right time. When the KSC is directly opposite from the sun (so it is midnight KSC time) is when I launch into a 20\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E orbit, but you could also launch into the opposite orbit at noon and have the same effect. This means that when I burn for Moho, on the side of Kerbin facing the sun, I\u0027ll be heading down on the map and should come out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI within 1\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E or so of Moho\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important part is timing your launch correctly and figuring out whether you need a positive or a negative inclination. Launching near midnight or noon should put you in the right orbit (actually a little before midnight or noon would probably be best). You just have to figure out which node you are at with respect to Moho. It\u0027s a little counter intuitive since you are burning retrograde with respect to Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun, but it makes sense if you think about it a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: This might help a bit. Moho\u0027s orbit is in green. This is just before the ascending node, so the green circle is collapsing into a straight green line going up from left to right. The white line through the middle is the Mun\u0027s orbit, I\u0027m using that to line up my view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/2013-06-22_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-06-22_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T20:17:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 08:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T20:35:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmmm thanks, I will have to try this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebrotip: to know a planet\u0027s inclination relative to Kerbin at any time, put a probe in a heliocentric Kerbin-like orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
