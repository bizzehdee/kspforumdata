It\u0027s no longer needed there. I wanted to top it\u0027s tanks off, and send it to another planet (Mun and Minmus were covered by other probes). My station and refuellers are in an equatorial orbit, of course. In a roughly 100km orbit (106 and change, nearly circular), and playing with maneuver nodes, I came up with 3181 m/s to shift the orbit to equatorial, keeping it roughly circular in the process (which also does bad things midburn, but that\u0027s another story).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a more efficient way to do this? Or do I just bite the bullet on refuelling any polar probe... it\u0027ll be expensive, or worthless to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not new at this, but I\u0027ve not done much in the way of refuelling/docking, so I\u0027m wondering if I\u0027m missing an obvious bet here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-19T04:11:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2013 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CCKinnison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGot my answer.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robbii6","CreatedById":69855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T21:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately i dont think there is anyway around it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E a tip if you didnt already know if your getting an intercept the best thing to do is to try and get your plain as you want it way before you get there and this will be more efficient that changing it once you are in orbit with it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T21:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds about right. A plane-change of 90 degrees costs about 1.414x your current orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, for plane changes over about 55\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 it\u0027s more cost-effective to burn to push your apoapsis out to near the edge of the SOI, do the plane change there, then return and recircularize. That tends to max out at about 0.85x of your current orbital velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d porbably just leave the mapper where it is and launch other probes based on its design to head to interplanetary destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T21:24:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead, you could try getting it on an intercept to the Mun from your polar orbit.
