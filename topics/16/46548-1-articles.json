I recommend to set up that nodes without the node adjustement plugin. They are way too sensitive and you can spend \u002B15min on it easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem also. Remember that is more important to have an encounter that anything else. Is just not possible to set up a perfect 1-node encounter 100.000.000.000 meters away. The game uses a lot of reference windows, and scale transitions from map view to ship view. So I finally realized that, unless you are aiming for a moon, or something in the neiborhood, the precission for such a long trip, is so low that you will need to make course correction along the way from planet to planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, remember that Moho, Dres and Eeloo are the only bodies that have a sightly inclination and eccentricity orbits. Maybe you want to use my method if you are doing a classic Hozltman:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- from the map view, zoom out until you see the planet and you orbit at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- locate the face of the planet is facing the sun and the one that is in the shadow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- trace an imaginary line that comes from the sun and crosses the planet, and trace other at 90\u0027 angle, so you put an \u002B in top of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Your ejection node will be almost always, in top of one of the lines of that cross, so when you burn, you will follow the planet orbit path, prograde or retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- burn around 1000m/s and them zoom out again to check how close you are to the destination planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fine-tune the burn to get an encounter at the apo. WARNING be sure you know WHEN is the correct date to do the burn and not fail your target miserably. Any encounter out of the apo. is 100% harder to tune.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a node planner plugin have its uses, for a precise aerobraking / slingshot maneuvers, I find it indispensable.
