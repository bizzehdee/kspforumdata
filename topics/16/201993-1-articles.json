Getting there is a bit complicated, but once you are there, any lander that works for Mun works for Dres too. In fact, Dres has less gravity than Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, rovers that work well on Mun may not work well on Dres, because the lower gravity and more bumpy terrain tend to flip them. but i doubt you are interested in rovers right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-26T18:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean tips for staying awake?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes as others have said it\u2019s a\u00A0pretty standard mun-esque planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Philae_Rosetta2021","CreatedById":211135,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-27T09:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that\u0027s a bit unfair on Dres.
