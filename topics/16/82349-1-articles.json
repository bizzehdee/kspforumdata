I really love it! I have a few ingame issues that I lack the skill/knowledge to deal with that\u0027s making the gameplay very frustrating at times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital docking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s 2 parts to this story. Firstly, I sent a crew of 3 to the Mun. All went well until I tried to return. I didn\u0027t have enough fuel. I then send out Rescue Pod I. It lands on the mun with no problems. Two of the kerbals board the rescue craft, the third had to much to drink and bumped into the side of it. The Rocket tipped over and broke in half. Oh, did I mention that the game autosaved seconds after this happened?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I send out Rescue Pod II, an unmanned version of Rescue Pod I. It makes it to muner orbit without problems. Landing was a bit sketchy due to the terrible controles with unmanned craft. I end up burning way to much fuel bouncing around trying to touch down safely. It finally lands and I speed up time waiting for the sun to rise. I fly my 4 kerbals into Rescue Pod II without problems. Then I find out that the ship is totally dead. Yup, I didn\u0027t realize that unmanned ships need power...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then send out Rescue Pod III, a slightly larger manned version of Rescue Pod II. It carries a little bit of extra fuel due to the extra weight. I land it down safely on the Mun. The 4 kerbals board the ship, now I have 5 in there total. I fly away from the moon watching my fuel reserves quickly dropping. I escape the Muns gravity and drift toward kerbin. With about 10 seconds of fuel left I burn a new orbit to a crash course with kerbin. It doesn\u0027t work. I run out just shy of 200,000km from kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow my crew of 5 needs a 4th rescue... They\u0027re stuck in a football shaped orbit that extends well beyond the Mun. I\u0027ve tried and tried to rescue them but I can\u0027t seem to get close enough. The kicker is that after about 30 orbits they get sucked in by the Mun and crash. I have no idea how to get close enough to save them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking problems continued...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got so frustrated with trying to rescue them that I decided to ignore them and build a space station. I got a science bay into a nice stable circular shaped orbit around kerbin. It has 4 docking ports on it. I\u0027m trying to attach a section of solar panels to it, but again, I can\u0027t get close enough. Even with perfect orbital conditions the closest I\u0027ve came is 27km. I don\u0027t understand what all the orbital info means, which is why I probably suck so bad at it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last question...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science bay was spinning wildly out of control. I managed to almost stabilize it by strategically bumping a kerbal into it. This seems wrong to me, surely there\u0027s a better way. If the science bay had power would I be able to stabilize it? Or maybe I was suppose to stick a cockpit on it? I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s things about this game that I don\u0027t understand and most of the guides make no sense, because they assume you already have a grasp on the game dynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops one more question...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose I wanted to store fuel on my space station. If I stick a full tank to a docking port in orbit, will there be an option to transfer fuel from one tank to another? Or is a fuel pump required, which honestly doesn\u0027t make sense because how would you stick it to another tank without being in the build screen...

So, \u0022rocket juice\u0022 is measured, both in KSP and the real world, in a quantity called delta-V. You can look up the exact equation if you want, but basically the more fuel you have left on board and the harder you can burn that fuel, the more delta-V you\u0027ve got. Everything you want to do has a fixed \u0022price\u0022 in delta-V: getting off Kerbin into orbit, transferring to the Mun, and so on. There is a big chart of these costs \u003Ca href=\u0022http://flyonbudget.onegiantleap.info/_downloads/bg_pic-chap2-delta-v-map.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. The point being that if you know how much delta-V your rockets and landers have, you will know if you can successfully fly to the Mun and pick up your dudes or if you are just adding to the Munar dance party. To calculate your delta-V you can either do a whole bunch of math or use a mod like Kerbal Engineer, the latter option being rather the more convenient one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You need some sort of stabilization system, or you\u0027re not going to be able to counteract any unintended rotational forces -- as you are seeing! Attach a stabilizer (the \u0022inline stabilizer\u0022 from the \u0022Control\u0022 tab) to your vessel, and make sure it has electrical power to operate. This means batteries and probably a solar panel or two. Other options for stability include RCS -- monopropellant tanks and thrusters located around your vessels, and, within an atmosphere, control surfaces, i.e. wings and fins. Without some sort of control system and power to operate it, you will inevitably tumble out of control as soon as you are not under thrust (assuming your rocket is gimbaled and you attempt no particularly wild maneuver, otherwise you\u0027ll tumble out of control then too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.
