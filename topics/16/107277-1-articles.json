After 1.0.2 - I used the same design but this time couldn\u0027t reach past 50k without it tilting slowly and then spiralling out of control. \n\n--- first thing that comes to my mind is elements of drag, design symmetry, fuel payload imbalance, - but all seems fine (seems so), and it worked a day before but not after?\n\nSince then I have tried all I can think of. Added and took off various parts, changed to very basic design, but anything that has the potential to bring me anywhere near the mun spirals out at around 30-40k. I\u0027ve even reinstalled the game and started fresh.\n\nIm hoping that its just the gameplay has got more difficult - in any case - any help is greatly appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T22:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zekib88**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:46:25Z","Content":"at 50k-60k aero shouldn\u0027t matter that much... if you completely lost control, maybe you\u0027re running out of electricity?\n\nsome pictures will help clarify what you exactly mean."},{"CreatedByName":"zekib88","CreatedById":142927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:53:22Z","Content":"Here\u0027s an image of the rocket design in question\n\nwhat happens is that it starts to tilt even though it is going straight up, then just spins out and there is nothing I can do about it![QeyUKPR.png](http://i.imgur.com/QeyUKPR.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T22:13:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 10:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zekib88**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:13:14Z","Content":"Could you upload a picture of the rocket at the point when it is actually spiraling so we can see the stage, engine... ?\n\nA cause could be too high TWR and no gimbaling but you seem to have RCS and SAS...\n\nIt is strange though as aerodynamics \u003E40km are negligible.\n\nAnd that\u0027s a bit out of topic but your rocket seem to be really fast, this may be linked although very unlikely."},{"CreatedByName":"MrCynical","CreatedById":116703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:17:04Z","Content":"If it was an aerodynamic issue you\u0027d be seeing a problem at 10km up, not 50\u002B.

I\u0027ve tried a new design and when I keep it at full thrust the same happens, but when its kept to about 50% thrust its fine (no boosters on it). Could it possibly be what you mentioned that with boosters it can\u0027t be controlled and the high accelleration somehow is affecting it? what confused me more was that this issue arised not with 1.0 but 1.0.2 update."},{"CreatedByName":"ghpstage","CreatedById":129622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:19:35Z","Content":"396m/s at 6km altitude is far too high and is the primary cause of your problem.\n\nTurn down the thrust on those SRBs in the VAB and it should perform better."},{"CreatedByName":"zekib88","CreatedById":142927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T22:21:37Z","Content":"When I build a simply 2 stage design to go into orbit its fine and control in space is normal as expected.

Thanks so much guys, I just panicked that it was working before but not after the update and only thought it must be a rocket design flaw (which is pretty flawed to begin with). Much much appreciated.
