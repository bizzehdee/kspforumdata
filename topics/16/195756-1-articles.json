As long as you have a craft in a reasonably equatorial orbit, you can make a node somewhere that gets an encounter, and transfer immediately. However, the Mun is the only destination the game for which this works. All other destinations require better timing, called a \u0022transfer window\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinmus is a bit of an edge case. If you launch into an equatorial orbit, like you normally do, there are technically two perfect transfer opportunities for each complete orbit of Minmus around Kerbin. You can transfer at any other time too, and probably fudge things in place with a mid-course correction, but it\u0027s less than ideal. You can also launch directly into Minmus\u0027 inclination, and then you have a similar situation like with the Mun, where you can just make your node and go - but launching into Minmus\u0027 inclination is, again, only possible at two specific times for each of its orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds to me like you\u0027re trying to make a node at a point in time where the transfer is not ideal, probably because Minmus is too far above or below the equatorial plane at the point you try to intercept it. You can just barely get a tiny sliver of an encounter, but it\u0027s a poor one, and easily missed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour options: 1.) perform a mid-course correction to finetune your encounter; or 2.) wait until a more convenient time. But without knowing where Minmus currently is in your game, I cannot tell you when that time will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-20T19:51:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2020 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-20T19:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds to me like you have 3 issues here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first is, if you are ending up in orbit around the sun, then you are burning too long. You have to stop burning when your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E gets just above Minmus -- even if it doesn\u0027t look like you have an intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second is, the orbit of Minmus is not in the same plane as Kerbin\u0027s equator. Since you say your maneuver node is very delicate, that makes me think you are not adjusting your Kerbin orbit to be in the same plane as Minmus. If you do that, it will be much easier for you to make a maneuver node that works. However, it is not necessary to adjust your plane in order to get to Minmus. Doing that just makes the \u003Cem\u003Emaneuver node\u003C/em\u003E easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third is that it is not necessary to reach your destination with just one burn. There is a very important concept called a mid-course correction\u00A0burn. With your first burn (your \u0022ejection burn\u0022), all you really need to do is get close. Then once you are halfway to your destination you can make a few tiny burns to give yourself a really good intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T00:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also think your problem is orbital plane. to get to minmus, you need to change your inclination. set minmus as the target, so you can see the ascending and descending nodes. then correct your inclination, and then getting an intercept is not a big deal. that\u0027s the easy way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe efficient way is to change your orbital inclination later. it\u0027s much cheaper to change inclination when you\u0027re farther away from kerbin. i found the best place to do so is after passing mun\u0027s orbit. that\u0027s harder to set up because, if you want to visualize the intercept, you need to set up two manuever nodes while you are still in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway, since minmus is much farther than mun, it is only natural that slight modifications of your original trajectory will have a bigger impact on your destination. you have 5-10 days of travel for those small deviations to accumulate, instead of just one for mun. so, to get a precise insertion you really need a course correction manuever halfway from your target. it\u0027s not a bug, it\u0027s just how things are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrSystems","CreatedById":195047,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-21T00:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easy (and fuel-inefficient) way that \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204876\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204876-king-of-nowhere/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@king of nowhere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0was talking about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGet to circular Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nClick Minmus and Set Target.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLook for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E (Ascending/Descending Node) markers on your current orbit, and set a Antinormal/Normal\u00A0maneuver node there such that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E readout shows 0.0\u00B0.
