The final moments of a Tylo landing aren\u0027t exactly the finest moments of a space program, especially if you\u0027re doing it for the first time. You basically crash the lander on the surface in a more or less controlled way, hoping that no critical components get destroyed, that the lander doesn\u0027t have too much horizontal speed to flip over, and that the thrust isn\u0027t too high for the lander to bounce and flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-909 isn\u0027t the best engine choice for the ascent stage, as its TWR is quite low.

By the time current contracts are complete, I should have about four million dollars \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 er, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfunds.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sending eight, or 10, or 12, ships, whatever I can afford. There are 100 days between Joolian arrival and our Kerbin Return departure window. So that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s 100 days of \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eoperations\u003C/span\u003E in the Joolian system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple landings on every moon (maybe not Tylo) Not just flags and footprints, but orbiters and rovers, too.
