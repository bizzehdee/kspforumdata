Let me try one more time but ask a bigger question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrimary question: Does KSP allow for analog gamepad inputs? That is, does gamepad support allow partial control inputs or can joysticks only input full deflections as with a keyboard? I would like to fly an airplane without having to flick control surfaces to full deflection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorollary: The official steam controller profile maps keyboard inputs to the controller\u0027s joystick. If possible, I would like to change this to analog inputs.

I use a 360 pad and have the left stick as pitch and roll and the triggers as yaw. All fully analogue, makes for very smooth flying.
