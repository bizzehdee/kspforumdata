Say, MK3 fuel tank with several ramjets and NERVs attached to the bottom. I\u0027ve seen a tip where someone placed an octogonal cubic strut between the engine and the tank, but the screenshot dated quite a bit back, so I don\u0027t know if it would still work.\n\n(if bad comes to worse, I can attach the tiny [FL-T100 Fuel Tank](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/FL-T100_Fuel_Tank) centrally and several more copies of it radially. But I wonder what other parts (or tricks) can I use.\n\n[![60px-FL-T100.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/9/9c/FL-T100.png/60px-FL-T100.png)](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:FL-T100.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T10:54:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T09:03:45Z","Content":"I used radial attachment points but there is surely a more cost/mass efficient solution. Maybe build a test vessel that is basically a giant fuel tank studded with connecting parts and spark/ant engines. Either way you can also try connecting fuel lines to the engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T09:08:00Z","Content":"If I\u0027m not mistaken, jet engines use fuel from the whole plane dispite have fuel conduit or not. I haven\u0027t check if it crosses decoupers though (as planes rarely have decouplers)\n\nOn the other hand, rocket engines uses fuel in the same stack and they need fuel conduit to get fuel from other stack.\n\nSo if you put a LVN at the bottom of you tank (rocket engine) and Ramjets around it, all engines woulld consume fuel without lines. I\u0027m not even sure you need your small lateral tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T09:55:41Z","Content":"\u003E So if you put a LVN at the bottom of you tank (rocket engine) and Ramjets around it, all engines woulld consume fuel without lines.

The Tail Connector A radially attached in symmetry with fuel lines from the main tank, rotated and offset down and into the fuel tank makes a nice looking outer core on a multi-engine set-up; the octogonal cubic strut then is used for the inner core.\n\nIf you set against fuel lines try looking at mods."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:11:22Z","Content":"Cubic octagonal struts are still the best ways to do engine clusters like you describe. They are light and you can flip them around 180 to be inside the tank for a very clean appearance. \n\nFor fuel crossfeed, anything that does not explicitly say no fuel crossfeed in orange text should crossfeed fuel. However some parts like fuel tanks only crossfeed along the axial directions. I find that the deltaV \u0026 TWR readouts of Kerbal Engineer Redux or similar are good ways to detect odd fuel flow rule issues (i.e. Why is my deltaV so low with this much fuel? Why is TWR still zero?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:17:01Z","Content":"Almost every radially attached part can conduct fuel. The most important prerequisite is that the part may \\*not\\* provide the resource itself. See this:\n\n![crossfeed.png](http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/crossfeed.png)\n\n(picture was taken to file a bug against MJ which didn\u0027t know about this way back when)\n\nThe small tank does crossfeed not because it is empty, but because it\u0027s own storage has been switched off so it no longer provides fuel and oxidizer. If a part does not hold a resource, it automatically crossfeeds. The precooler or the Big-S wing will crossfeed oxidiser; in order to crossfeed fuel, you have to toggle their own tanks. Other structural pieces that are no tanks at all usually crossfeed without further ado. Except for very,very few parts which don\u0027t.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is no real \u0022cross\u0022feed. Between radially-attached parts, fuel only flows from parent to child (that usually means \u0022outward\u0022). If you want fuel from an radial tank flowing into the main stack you have to use fuel lines."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:54:30Z","Content":"Thank you very much for the comprehensive answer."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T11:17:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t attach them just to a random location of a tank.

I thought radial outside the central tank. You want to do an engine cluster. I projected my way of doint things : I attach engines radially on interplanetary stage. \n\nI did that in beta 0.9 for my Tylo lander. I pluged 4 cubic struts with 48-7S under a small rockamax fuel tank. But that\u0027s easy to test. Put you stage on launchpad (with clamps) and check if you engine works.\n\nThe issue with cluster engines is the way to put it on top of the launch stage.

(well, currently, before RAPIER, everywhere without a thick non-oxygen atmosphere). \n\nA mix of excessive number of turbojets, nuclear engines and a portable refinery for refuelling on nearby low-gravity moons (and planet surface between landing and re-launch) should give me that capability. I might support them with a couple Mainsails for the intermediate phase between 20 and 50km when Ramjets flail and NERVs still didn\u0027t reach full performance.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly hog bi/tri/quadry-coupler aren\u0027t reversible.\n\nUh? Before the \u0022flower\u0022 idea (and researching Ramjets) I successfully tested my Tricoupler Quilt Drive.\n\nIt was really funny looking, a huge triangular carpet woven of tricouplers in normal and upside down positions, pelted with jets (plain) and NERVs on the bottom, with many small fuel tanks and air intakes on top. It really flew like a carpet, waving, bending, folding. It reached 6km on the jets, then 10km on NERVs, then it ran out of fuel. I suppose with Ramjets and a little more fuel it would reach orbit just fine; NERVs really perform abysmally below 20km and plain jets simply can\u0027t reach that high. I could place multiple moderately heavy tanks and facilities spaced sparsely around a quilt much larger than my test one, and it would fly just fine; it can scale indefinitely as long as the computer can handle it."}]}
