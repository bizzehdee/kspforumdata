How do I know where the \u0022bioms\u0022 are? So far I am launching capsules to different parts of the globe but only recover 1.5 to 3 points per landing?

Do a crew report (Transmit as this is a no loss science)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do an EVA report (Transmit as this is a no loss science)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

Do a Science Jr. experiment (KEEP, once its used, go to the next biome and use a new science jr, you should have more than 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Do a Goo experiment (KEEP, once its used, go to the next biome and use a new goo, you should have more than 1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. etc... (if more science devices, continue the list)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOST IMPORTANTLY - If you want to get full science points, bring your ship (or experiment results) back to Kerbin and dont transmit any science that has a percentage less than %100. By the way, when you\u0027re landing back on Kerbin, how about doing temperature and barometer, and EVA report, and surface sample (yes, even if you land in the water, do a surface sample), and a science jr, and a goo. All that adds to yet more science and each time you land back on Kerbin, if you have any left over science jr or goo, you can do it. Granted, if you land in the same biome, there are diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts very possible to just about (or maybe actually) fill the science tree without going outside Kerbin-Mun-Minmus... I say just about, because I\u0027ve not done it, I went to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027m not sure if this explains it like you are 5 because I think you know more than you think you do.

I found out the hard way about resetting the sample containers (a simple warning that the data will be lost if reset would be nice). Actually I was half way through the tech tree when I figured that out, since I had taken so many units with me. I made the mistake also of assigning action groups to science units; you should do each experiment individually, at different locations. Also, there are times when you return your Kerbal from EVA to the craft, that you will only be given the option of dropping the samples/ data to go inside or to cancel going inside, because it cannot hold more samples or data; thus leaving your Kerbal outside with no way to get the data home.\u003Cp\u003EScience is set up so that you get ever diminishing marginal returns, unless you do not reuse a unit and unless you are at a place (biome, planet, moon, etc.) that you have not ever been before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, when you reset experiments you are resetting them.

Some can only be done in atmosphere, some on the ground. When you\u0027re storing those experiments in the capsules, you can only store one unique experiment at a time. So you can\u0027t store two Mystery Goo samples that were obtained in high orbit around Kerbin (nor do you need to). If you try to enter with an experiment that is already in the capsule (or your EVA kerbal is carrying two), it will tell you it can\u0027t hold any more samples.

How do I know where the \u0022bioms\u0022 are? So far I am launching capsules to different parts of the globe but only recover 1.5 to 3 points per landing? I can get anyplace in the system and land on just about any body but this career thing is kicking my butt. I do\u0027nt know what to do next after each mission I dont have any direction to go. I just shoot rockets in different directions with no structure. When I use the goo containers I then reset them. is this erasing the last collection?

Goo containers and Science Jr containers can only be used once. You can reset them as many times as you like, but once you collect on EVA or transmit, they are done. Also realize that if you take them to the Mun, do the science, transmit, then return them you will only receive the science for transmitting. And any science that you transmit during the trip will not be reflected in the end of flight summary. Transmitting science does not prevent you from performing a subsequent mission to collect and return it later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA \u0026amp; Crew reports: You can only store 1 of each. Transmit it before you take another report. EVA and crew reports get 100% science when transmitting. Make sure you have sufficient battery power and recharge ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoo containers and Science Jr: If you do the experiment then reset, your last experiment is gone. If you do an experiment and collect on EVA or transmit the data, the device is no longer usable for that trip unless you clean it with a lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70818-Transmission-Reduction-of-Science-Points\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread \u003C/a\u003Eto see my short discussion of how transmission impacts science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewiki KSP science page \u003C/a\u003Ethat someone linked to above.

On this one, don\u0027t worry about all the multipliers. But on the last column it shows you what the altitude is to be considered \u0022low orbit.\u0022 This is useful to keep from repeating the same experiment in the same location. Now you can plan your orbits and such to reach for and obtain science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for only recovering 1.5 or 3 points per landing, you are probably repeating experiments in the same biomes (if you\u0027re doing them at all). Someone earlier posted the biome maps. Once you can mentally map those onto the surfaces in-game, your science will greatly increase. Different biomes at different altitudes (low/high atmosphere, low/high orbit) can net you more science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, if you\u0027ve lost total track of what science you have done up to this point, go to the \u0022Research and Development Center\u0022 and click the yellow \u0022Science Archives\u0022 button.
