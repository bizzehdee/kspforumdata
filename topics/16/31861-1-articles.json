I was informed that the optimal transfer orbit is a \u0027darkside\u0027 transfer and that this means the solar panels don\u0027t get power. That\u0027s no problem for a small probe, I can rebuild it with better propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere this becomes an issue is my new MTV vehicle. It\u0027s intended as a manned Duna transfer vehicle based one the Copernicus MTV NASA conceived for the more distant part of the Constellation project. It relies on solar power and I want to keep it powered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a reasonable transfer orbit to Duna that will keep my solar panels lit?

But you\u0027re in dark for the same time (or less) than you would be in a single orbit of Kerbin so if your ship can\u0027t handle darkness for that long you may need some more batteries or RTGs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoDores","CreatedById":56567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T15:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it, it might work to launch retrograde around Kerbin and then burn in daylight to transfer to Duna.

My advice would be to switch to a nuclear stage, or if you really like long burns use the ion engine to spiral out without worrying about where your pe/ap are until you are nearly going fast enough to escape and then time your final burn to send you off into kerbol orbit in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberick","CreatedById":65954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T15:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as it doesn\u0027t have Ion engines you can add batteries to keep it powered on the dark side of a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it relies on Ion engines, no amount of batteries will allow it to make a 1000d/v ejection burn:(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an alternate solution, you could try a moon slingshot if you want to keep it in the sun most of the time.
