The command pods won\u0027t be very nimble on larger craft, but it you include an additional SAS module, you can fly a lot more easily now in space with larger vehicles. For things with command seats, you can get by just fine by sticking a command seat on an OKTO2 module. Depending on how heavy the lander is, it performs just fine. I use SAS for turning and maneuvering in space and save RCS for craft that need to dock, otherwise you don\u0027t need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RadHazard","CreatedById":80815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T18:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes this mean that there is no reason to use the ASAS module (now renamed to inline advanced stabilizer) except on vessels that only have the external command seat?\u003Cp\u003EIts got the same torque as the reaction wheel, and the SAS function is redundant, so, its just more mass for the same thing, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, the inline advanced stabilizer is completely useless.

I think that due to the very low weight of RCS thrusters and fairly low weight of monopropellant, its worth loading up on that and using RCS to orient your ship. The level of torque generated by a single SAS module alone is so low that it isn\u0027t worth dealing with. Saying that, SAS is very useful for a landing stage, and so I will normally design a craft to depend on RCS initially and then use SAS of the landing stage when SAS delivers all the torque needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geoff-AU","CreatedById":91720,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T03:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorthwhile considering is that SAS should be as close to the centre of mass of your rocket as possible to have the biggest effect. The SAS module is trying to spin the rocket around the SAS\u0027s own location (that\u0027s how reaction wheels work), so if you stick it right up one end of the rocket it will be less effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS is the opposite, because the forces are generated perpendicular to the rocket\u0027s body and you want the RCS modules at the extremities to provide the largest amount of torque.
