One problem, though. I\u0027m doing career mode and it seems to be impossible to earn more than 6 science points. I\u0027ve tried different combinations of parts and crew but I just don\u0027t ever earn science points after my first tech unlock. Any suggestions for this hapless n00b?"},{"CreatedByName":"ub43","CreatedById":119634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:07:59Z","Content":"Use goo, take surface samples, crew reports, whatever. Should get more than 6 science."},{"CreatedByName":"Callmedave","CreatedById":62412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:09:49Z","Content":"What are you doing to get thIs science? Science points decrease rapidly for each time you repeat them. There are many combinations of experiments to be run. For example. You can run a crew report on the launch pad, and if you run a crew report while on the runway, this is classed as a different experiment. Then there are the mysterious goo and thermometer (and others) that you can run also. Check the kerbal wiki for more tips."},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo Kerbonaut","CreatedById":65299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:10:19Z","Content":"Science is abundant in KSP. Try using different science equipment (goo canister, thermometer, pressure meter, ) in different biomes. Later you can also upgrade your KSP building so you can do EVA\u0027s and pick up surface samples."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:15:08Z","Content":"You don\u0027t have to watch all of them, the first few explain how science works.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:16:45Z","Content":"The Kerbal Space Center(KSC) has a lot of small biomes, if you can walk a kerbal around to different buildings he can gather EVA reports and Surface Samples (right click the kerbal to do this)\n\nIn addition, if you can throw a small lander or roll a lander can out to some of those places with a science part and/or a kerbal inside you can gather even more by right clicking the parts and capsule."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T20:19:30Z","Content":"Don\u0027t panic.
