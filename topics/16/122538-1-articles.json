I just put a probe into orbit around Duna, and I would like to verify my plans in my very non-math, trial-and-error game before I make an uncorrectable error (ideally avoiding f9-ing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy orbit is, just like my first Eve probe, extremely polar (celestial \u0022north\u0022) and extremely elliptical. My Ap is at 39,000km and my Per is 100km. I have (should-have, \u0026gt;50% fuel remaining in stage) enough dV to leave Duna\u0027s SOI, but I want to clarify my plans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Escape Duna, my thrust needed at Per should be very small, as all I am doing is lifting my Ap to escape. However, once I Escape, will I be in a solar orbit at Duna\u0027s distance (therefore only needing a retrograde intercept burn with Kerbin to lower my Per and come home), or will I find my ship is falling in towards Kerbol on a very low Peri orbit due to a small exit \u0022velocity\u0022 from Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy orbital mechanics lessons continue; thank you for your continued patience...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T22:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022However, once I Escape, will I be in a solar orbit at Duna\u0027s distance\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore or less, yes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022will I find my ship is falling in towards Kerbol on a very low Peri orbit due to a small exit \u0022velocity\u0022 from Duna?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour exit velocity will be small compared to your solar velocity, so your peri may be lower, but not \u0022very low\u0022, it will still be more or less even with Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be higher, that depends on how you eject relative to duna\u0027s motion (since you haven\u0027t specified enough orbital parameters in your post).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Apopasis is over the north pole? so you\u0027ll be burning to escape over the south pole? half the Dunar year, you\u0027d escape into a slightly higher orbit, half the dunar year you\u0027d escape into a sightly lower orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, its most efficient to do your entire burn within Duna\u0027s gravity well, and get a direct trajectory back to kerbin, without going into a solar orbit and then \u0022needing a retrograde intercept burn with Kerbin to lower [your] Per and come home\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, why did you insert into such an orbit (the extremely eliptical polar orbit)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jodo42","CreatedById":68895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T22:05:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you captured around Duna, you made your orbital velocity relative to the Sun essentially the same as Duna\u0027s.

The plane is easily fixed with a burn near apoapsis - you\u0027ll want to orbit such that your normal vector is directly towards or away from the sun. Positioning of periapsis isn\u0027t so cheap, though you can probably make do by executing your escape burn maybe 10-15 minutes (at a guess) before periapsis.
