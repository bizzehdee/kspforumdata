The main question I have is how can you make more than one ribbon set, and put them both in the signature? For example, I have put a space station, rovers, and just normal crew things into orbit around Kerbin. This means I have to make a separate ribbon for each. However, when I put the links into the signature they all become the newest ribbon.
