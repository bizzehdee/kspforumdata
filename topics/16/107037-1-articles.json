This place was terrible to land as it is.\n\nI\u0027m picturing the cascading effect of the changes to this engine, leading to a bigger final stage, to an even bigger lander, and so on. Has anyone got a screenshot of something that managed this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:58:53Z","Content":"I think is still the same way with 47-8S, you just need more engines and add some more fuel to balance the mass increase. Beware that massless parts seems to be gone. So recheck your TWR and Delta-V.\n\nAs for low TWR landers (with LV-N) the challenge should have increased quite a lot as nuke weight has increased ... I don\u0027t think my SSTO (non plane) would be able to land and take off now (starting TWR was 1, landin was 1.6, DV=6000m/s, down from and to 30km orbit. Total 14T in 0.90)."},{"CreatedByName":"technion","CreatedById":85380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T05:17:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Beware that massless parts seems to be gone.

I\u0027ve always considered reorbit the easy part though. A TWR \u003E 1 is enough to do reorbit, and only a small fuel tank was required. It\u0027s landing where you need to shave off that 2km/s with the ground pounding towards you that was hard."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T07:45:19Z","Content":"But since you won\u0027t need to carry return fuel, that might mean that you\u0027ll need less engines to have the same TWR and landing might be easier, too. The general idea is that such craft can be lighter overall. And a side bonus that it could be used to refuel your interplanetary ship off the smaller Jool moons."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T08:53:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So those batteries and panels count now? damn.. that\u0027s going to hurt my designs.\n\nIt seems to be.

Each planet in the Kerbol system is either relatively easy to land on from low orbit, or has a moon that\u0027s easy to land on. That means, you don\u0027t need to bring fuel for your return trip since you can just refuel your interplanetary ship in orbit and go home or even visit another planet. You only need enough dV in your mothership to get into orbit, and a lander that can mine ore and return to mothership."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T11:00:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Poodle looks like it might be a good Tylo lander engine now.
