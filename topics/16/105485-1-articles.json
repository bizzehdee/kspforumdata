I am kind of stuck at the 45 science per node tier. I have some contracts but they only award maybe an average of 2 or 3 points of science.\n\nI have access to the goo and materials bay and have taken both on an orbit run, but now I don\u0027t have much else to do.\n\nSo, how do you collect science efficiently(no spam)?\n\n**Answer**, Supplied by basic.syntax,\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Science progression was too quick before... contracts gave too much science, that was nerfed. Now the emphasis is on science parts. (I\u0027m echoing AmpsterMan) You could increase the Science percentage payouts in new game setup, to reduce the feeling of grind.\n\nSo I went and started a new game, adjusted the science payout to about 250.% I am now thinking this might be a bit much but it is the answer I was looking for. Might go to a point somewhere in-between 150% and 200% to get the \u0022right\u0022 amount of science.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T22:43:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by krillin678**\n  \nforgot a \u0022not\u0022, found answer."},{"CreatedByName":"a2soup","CreatedById":68260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:30:54Z","Content":"Go to the Mun!"},{"CreatedByName":"krillin678","CreatedById":79985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:32:33Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think I can, all I have are solid rocket boosters some small (lfo) tanks...
