Then you use a utility, such as [ddrescue](http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/) to try to read the drive bit by bit into a disk image. Once you have the disk image, mount it as a read only loopback device, and see if you salvaged enough to browse the drive. If not, you might be able to extract the important parts of your install (The saves, screenshots, and ships directories.) by scanning through the image for data resembling the contents of those folders.\n\nSo simply put: Yes, it\u0027s possible. I only know how to do it in linux, but for any OS, here\u0027s a broken down todo-list:\n\n1. Connect the drive somehow as a secondary drive\n\n2. Read everything you can into a drive image\n\n3. Salvage data from drive instead of disk\n\n....that way you won\u0027t have to cope with failing hardware as you\u0027re looking for the stuff you want to extract."}]}
