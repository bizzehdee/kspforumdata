I understand that a SRB is an off or on thing but, I just don\u0027t get the logic! Either it is what it is or, it is what it isn\u0027t!?

When SRBs are manufactured, the burn rate is set. The fuel is solid and burns straight on through once started, there is no throttle or valves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go look up the SRBs for the space shuttle, they were made with two patterns inside. The forward portion consisted of an 11 point star pattern. The rear portion consisted of a (more or less) tube. The booster ignited from the top down. The top portion burned faster to provide more initial thrust. The aft section burned slower to provide lower thrust for a longer period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T11:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it might be possible to make an SRB that changes thrust as it burns, through careful shaping of the propellant.

Solid rocket fuel burns faster as the pressure increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuote from a very helpful into document: (link in next post) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Burn rate is profoundly affected by chamber pressure. The usual representation of the pressure dependence on burn rate is the Saint-Robert\u0027s Law,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere r is the burn rate, a is the burn rate coefficient, n is the pressure exponent, and Pc is the combustion chamber pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er = a Pc^n\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne can *easily* fiddle with the burn rate, and thus the thrust, of a Solid rocket by fiddling with the nozzle aperture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake it larger, and you get less pressure, less burn rate. Unfortunately, less ISP too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake it smaller, and pressure increases. Make it too small and the propellant will MAKE a bigger exit, either by ablating the nozzle to a suitable size, or more usually by rupturing its casing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf mass was not a factor, one could throttle a SRB by using some symmetrical aperture-adjusting nozzle, something like a camera shutter. But one capable of withstanding SRB heat, pressure and abrasion would also serve as a good anchor to keep this SRB on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-05T12:28:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2014 12:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MarvinKitFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T12:26:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it might be possible to make an SRB that changes thrust as it burns, through careful shaping of the propellant.
