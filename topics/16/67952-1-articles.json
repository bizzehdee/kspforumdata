Also, you\u0027re using the nuke engines which have very low thrust so it\u0027s possible that you don\u0027t have much power either. Try reversing the design and pushing it instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T01:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
