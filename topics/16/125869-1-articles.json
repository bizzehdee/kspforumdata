Is there a mod or calculator out there which can find gravity assist windows? I just launched a flyby mission to Neptune and needed a direct burn of over 10k delta-v to get there inside of the 15-year contract deadline. If I could have used Jupiter/Saturn or something I bet I could have shaved off 20-30% of that. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there help for this, or do I need to make every outer-system launch with a rocket larger than the Saturn V?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T12:34:59Z","Content":"\nYou might want to have a look at this tool:\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-WIN-Flyby-Finder-V0-82-KSP1-04[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is also a version for RSS referenced in that OP.\n"}]}
