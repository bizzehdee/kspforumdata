It\u0027s fun once you turn the tolerance down enough that you have to start actually caring about it; the defaults are very forgiving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m pretty stuck on a contract to get two tourists to fall unconscious while sub-orbital. It doesn\u0027t accept them losing consciousness in a flight that then becomes sub-orbital, nor losing consciousness on re-entry. They must lose consciousness while sub-orbital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that KSP doesn\u0027t consider Gs from centrifugal (go away nit-pickers)\u00A0force. I built a rocket-powered centrifuge that got the tourist module out on the end of a beam spinning so fast the navball was just flashing. Nope, they didn\u0027t care, and nor did the parts, even though they would\u0027ve really been turned to a thin paste on the walls before the whole thing fell apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you have to use linear acceleration. But none of the reasonable-sized\u00A0engines have the grunt; KSP doesn\u0027t have very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E short-burn engines so you have to fake it with under-fuelled big boosters. So you need lots of boosters and/or to launch a truly ridiculous engine with a teeny amount of fuel. At .5-g tolerance I could do it with 4 Hammer SRBs each fueled to 1/3 to optimise \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but launching that is a pain. Two S1 SRBs launching a 3rd fueled to ~20% did the job better. But it\u0027s\u00A0an expensive pain relative to the utter pittance that tourism contracts pay - and \u0022turn my brain to paste while in orbit\u0022 ones don\u0027t pay a useful amount more. If you start your blackout burn while still in high atmosphere you have to time it carefully so the lose consciousness after you reach 70k, since *being* unconscious or *regaining* consciousness\u00A0when in space isn\u0027t good enough, you must *lose* consciousness in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now a player on default G-force settings will have to launch a cluster of 8 part-fueled\u00A0Hammer SRBs or something absurd, which means a pretty serious vessel just to get them up there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really think this is a bug as it stands. Since rotational Gs don\u0027t count, either these missions should count losing consciousness in flight after sub-orbital, pay a LOT more, or just not be generated. Even if the tourists were made to have more easily squished little brains it\u0027d still be too hard on default G tolerance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I really want of course is rotational G to count so I can rocket-centrifuge their little brains to mush. But I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s tricky for the physics system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it meant to be this tough and unrewarding, or is it just not quite baked yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshots:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/semhA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/semhA\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis finally worked:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LNuhWd0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LNuhWd0.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ErI5Jgz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ErI5Jgz.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eQsk4GM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eQsk4GM.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis ...
