Since FAR changes the aerodynamics of KSP you don\u0027t need to wait until the usual 10km to start your turn. I usually start gradually turning about 200-300m. Also, instead of using Canards (Which have a tendency to want to fly backwards anyway) use the Delta Deluxe Winglet, it will help at trans-sonic speeds. I don\u0027t know why they help, but they do. (The same goes for the AV-R8 winglet I\u0027ve had it start rockets spinning uncontrollably) Also, instead of just having more fuel in your second stage, use less fuel, but use boosters on the side, and depending on how big the booster is you can not fire your center stack until they burn out.

FAR greatly reduces the density of the atmosphere, meaning that you can get away with 50% or lower thrust for certain lifter designs and still hit that gravity/air resistance butter zone.
