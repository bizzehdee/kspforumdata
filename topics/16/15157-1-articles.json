Grab a few proven rocket designs from The Spacecraft Exchange section of this forum. Practice your flying on them before using your own built rocket. I think your rocket \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E good... but i\\\u0027d say that is way too much weight for only 3 engines on the first stage. Need more engines, or downsize, which will be easier and still orbital capable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Watch some tutorial videos on YouTube. I\\\u0027m finding for this game, video is much more useful than anything that is written (at least as a starting point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Finally, on any serious craft design, I recommend using an ASAS module, and have some or all engines on each stage be able to gimbal (ie. direct thrust to help steer). Also, apologies if you already know this - but you need to have SAS off to steer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-25T07:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of \u0027movement in space\u0027 trouble are you having?
