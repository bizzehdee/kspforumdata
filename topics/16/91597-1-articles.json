I personally use Kerbal Engineer for my needs. The stock screen lacks the information required for any precision stuff in general. It is great for beginners so that they don\u0027t get overloaded with data but I would have a hard time flying any of my missions, even the most basic ones without some sort of supplement. So I strongly recommend getting MJ or KER if you want to do anything sophisticated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
