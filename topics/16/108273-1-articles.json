But now I tried putting it into another rocket and it seems like it should work fine except when I\u0027m launching it and flying the rocket, the whole thing is just vibrating, like as if the ship had some kind of earthquake going on. The navball is vibrating like that as well and my surface lateral velocity keeps extremely rapidly going between 0-5 m/s and stuff. Actually, I just tried to time warp while on the launchpad and it made my ship explode ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Any ideas why?\n\nedit:\n\nScreenshot:\n\n![F44808D925D2799512715E1C0EDE40A0839305D5](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489817088851561/F44808D925D2799512715E1C0EDE40A0839305D5/)\n\n![93353CC98AFDD4F000177D7E6B8DA9569BE6DFCF](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489817088851742/93353CC98AFDD4F000177D7E6B8DA9569BE6DFCF/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T20:46:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jadis**"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T20:38:49Z","Content":"Do you have a service bay module?

If the ship is oscillating more and more like a sinus curve during travel in the atmosphere the connection between the rover and the rest of the top part of your ship isn\u0027t fixated enough. So either more struts there, or, since the rover is a huge windbreaker like this, better build it in a vertical position if possible.\n\nGreets,\n\nJan"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:23:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It is probably that service bay on the bottom of your rover.

I called it vibrating because it\u0027s so weird! Definitely not a like a sine wave, more just random shaking.\n\nMy next question is that in the VAB, my whole ship is off-center and the camera only rotates around the center. I can\u0027t seem to get the ship back in the center of the VAB. Is there a reset camera button or something? Thanks!!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nI\u0027m just rebuilding it and will cross my fingers.
