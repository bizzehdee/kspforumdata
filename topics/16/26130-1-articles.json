When that marker read: \u0022target\u0022 (click on it if it isn\u0027t), the relative velocity is what you have different in your velocity vector to your target. Ideally, you want that to be zero at zero meters, because by definition that puts you in the same orbit that the target ship, at the same place. In reality, you want to keep it as high as it wants to to get the encounter until you are close to the 2.1kms physics sphere, then bring it down to 10-50m/s, depending on skill, and then moving the markers around with little burns to make pink coincide with green, all the while keeping a velocity in the tens of meter per second, the slower the easier because you have more time to think before you zip by the target. When you are really close, like \u0026lt;1km, bring it down further, all the way to 0.1-0.5 just before docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
