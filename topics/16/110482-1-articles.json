There is one thing bugging me however, and that is that I have no target indicator in external vehicle view. I\u0027ve watched some videos on this subject and they all have their target marked by a green diamond with a distance indicator in EV-view. This is of course of great help and I have no idea why I don\u0027t have it, and I would really this feature for when I start to do docking missions. I guess I also should mention that I have set the object as target as well.\n\nI play career mode and have the tracking station fully upgraded, most other buildings are atleast level 2. I run the mods Kerbalengineer, Europeflags and Planetshine. Does anyone have any idea of why I\u0027m missing the target indicator?\n\nAny help much appreciated. \n\n-V\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T13:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Valday**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T13:18:44Z","Content":"I think it may be from a mod, given what you are describing."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T13:24:55Z","Content":"Have you tried **[F4]** yet?
