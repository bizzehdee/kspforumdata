The goal is to get an orbit so that the mun is close to you when you approach apoapsis. You have two options: You can completely circularize the orbit when you reach apoapsis, and since your orbit is slightly wider than the mun\\\u0027s you will be moving slightly slower than the mun. You just increase time warp to max and wait. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option is to restart your launch. This is the best way to get to the mun: You launch from kerbin and get your ship into a circular orbit around it at around 150-170 km altitude. You point your ship towards your heading (the yellow circle with nothing inside it and three lines outside) and timewarp/wait until the mun starts to rise over the horizon. As soon as you see the mun, you burn prograde at full thrust untill the apoapsis of your orbit is at the same altitude or a little lower then the orbit of the mun. Turn off your engine, timewarp and watch the map untill you see that your orbit has changed - That means that you have switched to the Mun\\\u0027s sphere of influence. When you reach your Periapsis, burn retrograde (green circle with lines inside it) until you circularize your orbit around the mun. When you are ready, burn retrograde untill your orbit intersects the surface of the mun.
