An empty MK3 Cargo SSTO (full of fuel, but with no cargo) will\u00A0mass about 75 tons. To push that through the air, you will need 250kN at takeoff, 400kN for acceleration and atmospheric climb, tapering to 120kN at 40km\u002B altitude. And those engines have to get you to 1200 m/s in airbreathing mode, or you won\u0027t make it. 15 tons of those 75 are budgeted for engines. You can go a little over budget if it gets you a big bonus. If you want to really carry some stuff, though, then double the mass and quantity of everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe the sidenote: to make that maneuver work, you have to really know your engine. All those jets have a high-thrust zone that you can see when you have them really pushing their limits. An afterburning panther at 410m/s is just getting started. A Whiplash or Rapier at 370 m/s is just about to start really ticking. Below those speeds, the engines feel pathetic.

If you cross the magic number, then the engine will come to life. And you need to leave it be, to get really into the zone. If you pull the nose up manually, you will lose it again (lots of drag = -50 m/s). The nose will rise by itself over time, and you have to let it happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Yeah, that\u0027s a tricky one. If your nose is pointing way above prograde, that is draggy and bad. If you see your nose doing that during ascent, play around to see if you can add a lifting surface somewhere. The BigS is a problem, yes. All you really have available there (if you care about looks) is the BigS strakes. I have seen people clip multiple BigS wings exactly into each other. You can put rectangular wing parts against the fuselage and attach the BigS wing to the outside of that. A lot of workarounds to adding wing involve clipping. But basically, once you\u0027ve built\u00A0an almost-functioning SSTO -- just try adding a little more wing to it and see what happens. If it gets you to orbit with more fuel, then try adding a little more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.

If you can get your takeoff speed down to 100m/s or below, you\u0027re probably okay. Building with wing incidence helps to get maximum lift with minimum fuselage drag; important if you want decent fuel efficiency from a larger ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003ETo demonstrate what you can do with just a few wing\u00A0pieces:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAble to lift up to 60 ton\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022JFYj7ID.png\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/JFYj7ID.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E3,700m/s unrefuelled; enough for a Mun return.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NOYwtKP.jpg\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/NOYwtKP.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEeloo...via Minmus, Duna, Dres, Laythe and Pol.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QMfaLse.png\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QMfaLse.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFull science, scanning and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E kit aboard, 4km/s in the tanks.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oJQB7re.jpg\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oJQB7re.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022YD6DixQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YD6DixQ.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Usually, you shouldn\u0027t need struts. You certainly shouldn\u0027t need\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Evisible\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0struts. Keep your wings as simple as you can; use fewer, bigger parts. Autostrut is available if needed, but usually isn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid needing struts, you need to think about the tree structure of your craft. If you\u0027re putting a long stack of\u00A0fuel tanks on the side of the fuselage, don\u0027t hang them off the nose; support the centre of the stack. Etc. If you do have to strut, you can usually arrange things so that it\u0027s just a single pair that can be hidden inside a wing or somesuch (saves aesthetics, doesn\u0027t reduce drag).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Control surfaces at the back work by pushing the tail down, canards up front work by lifting the nose up. While canards are deflected for climb, the lift of the canard surface is increased; while rear elevators are deflected for climb, the lift of the control surface is decreased (usually into negative lift). However, the effect is minimal; most of your lift should be coming from the wings, not the control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there are other tradeoffs; canards are draggier and more stall prone; as overall \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E increases, the local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E on an elevator decreases, moving it away from stall. With canards, the reverse happens; they gain power as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E increases (giving canard planes a tendency to be agile\u00A0but twitchy) and may stall out, losing lift and creating drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-29T06:22:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2017 06:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T14:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223001326\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140993\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490767577\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112611\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 hours ago, Wanderfound said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstuff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty solid info.
