I\u0027ve learned how to design Mun-capable ships. My only issue is the actual actions required to get to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where\u0027s what I do...I launch until I get into about a 100km or so orbit. Then I add a burn/node at the next apoapsis as soon as my orbit is stable and I make an oblong orbit that goes all the way out until the tip of the new to-be apoapsis is right in the orbit pattern of the Mun. I delete that node and create a new node/burn at the new apoapsis of the oblong orbit and turn it into a circular orbit and try to get that to match the circular orbit of the Mun. Then I speed up the time and let it go around a certain number of orbits until it seems to encounter the Mun somehow by itself. It will say \u0022Mun escape\u0022 eventually by itself and will have a circular-like icon and a bent arrow like on the Enter key of a keyboard. I have actually crashed into the Mun this way...my lander wasn\u0027t quite ready, but this method got me there. I\u0027ve kind of self-taught myself this method...the other ones like the Wiki methods, etc. do not seem to put it into plain terms and are quite confusing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI click on the Mun and \u0022set as target\u0022 and it places some kind of vertical or horizontal up/down tabs...they say something like up/down on each one.

Kill your brun when you get the Muner intercept, you can slowly increase or decrease your speed with pro/retrograde burns to get a really close intercept, say under 30kms. then you just need to worry about doing a slow down burn when you are at your closest to the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T06:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe up and down things are basically the points your orbit \u0022intercepts\u0022 the inclination of the another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the degrees in the node?
