about 2000 credits each - so you\u0027re recovering over 80% of the cost of the vessel. \u00A0 \u00A0If you\u0027re dropping RAPIERs or NERVs back into the atmosphere at 6000 each, then the economics look questionable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a 2 NERV . 1 Whiplash SSTO I made -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160423151723_1_zpsecpbyexa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20160423151723_1_zpsecpbyexa.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt did reach orbit with 1000dv left when flown up empty (nothing in the two cargo bays). \u00A0 I do wonder if it\u0027s got enough wing area for high altitude flight when heavily loaded however, \u00A0also whether it\u0027d struggle to get through sound barrier with more onboard?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160423122421_1_zps0olg4gf8.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20160423122421_1_zps0olg4gf8.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove pic is a quick and dirty stage-discarding Whiplash-NERV vehicle I built. \u00A0 The back end comes off, intentionally. \u00A0 2800dV in orbit means it has the potential to take you places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160423124153_1_zps8nppanbx.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/20160423124153_1_zps8nppanbx.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/whippynerv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/AeroGav/whippynerv\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T15:34:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSingle Stage To Orbit. \u00A0Nope, still can\u0027t see anything in those words that says \u0022wings\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWings don\u0027t have much to do with getting To Orbit with a Single Stage and nothing to do with saving deltaV.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWings will make it harder\u00A0to get to orbit because they add mass and drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other\u00A0hand -
