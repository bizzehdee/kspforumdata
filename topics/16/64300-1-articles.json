Specifically, I\u0027m trying to set up an ISRU facility on the great plain of Minmus in order to set up a refueling facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a practice run, I\u0027ve located a uranium deposit on Minmus, and by a combination of luck, save-states, and miraculously strong landing struts, I managed to put a reactor and generator down near the target site (the sensor broke, so I don\u0027t yet know if I\u0027m actually inside the hotspot or not). Now I\u0027ve sent up a craft carrying a pair of ISRU refineries, along with some robotics and KAS parts to connect everything on site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that I\u0027m noticing that my delivery for heavy equipment is really pretty bad in terms of efficiency. The methods I\u0027ve uses for launching countless probes and 1.25m craft isn\u0027t working so well when I\u0027m sending up refineries, reactors and generators. In other words, it doesn\u0027t seem to scale well. I ended up spending all my transfer fuel on orbital insertion for my ISRU launch, so I sent up a refueling mission, but the fuel was pretty heavy too, so I ended up losing about half the payload on insertion and rendezvous. I managed to launch into a really nice position, but the heavy fuel delivery was more than I\u0027d bargained for. I haven\u0027t unlocked the really heavy rocketry node yet (the one with the huge orange 2.5m tank) but I have a bunch of KW parts that I\u0027ve been using for 2.5m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I\u0027m really asking is, is there a trick to launching really heavy payloads like reactors and etc, or do I just have to wait to unlock larger engines?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-26T15:05:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2014 03:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Khatharr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T07:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use cubic octagonal struts to attach lots of engines to those tank bases to get you more thrust (some take this to an extreme and use piles and piles of super efficient engines rather than 1 powerful but not so efficient engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find launching heavy things by using solid rocket boosters in the initial stage helps a lot. They have a very good thrust to weight ratio and can save liquid fuel in your asparagus set up by letting you throttle down (But the SRBs are still going at the power you set them at in the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPay attention to the efficiency of whatever engine you use as well. Some make awesome upper stages but suck lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally my rocket design has a core engine that will have a TWR of 1.1 when it\u0027s by itself after losing the initial boosters. then I have 4 to 6 liquid boosters set to drop 2 at a time in an asparagus fashion. Then I may have solid boosters on those boosters either set to drop with that tank or in another separate staging event (timing those through setting thrust in the VAB can be tricky so the booster runs out first, drops, then the liquid tank, then the next SRB, and so on or whatever seems to work best). I want to have my TWR be 1.6-2 as long as possible until I hit those upper stages. Once out of orbit ISP is what matters but I like to have a TWR over about .3 (personal preference).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been messing with drop tanks rather than drop boosters. I save quite a bit of weight on engines with that and you can use lots of smaller tanks and drop often though if you get to crazy with that you have lots of mass in decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re running into mostly is rocket equation problems. Heavy things are expensive and difficult to move around. The best space craft is a light one and the bulk of your mass is always fuel. Figure out what your deltaV requirements are for each stage of the flight and that makes things much, much easier to know if you need to add more boosters/fuel or if you can keep it light. Always keep it light and ditch excess weight whenever you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilots generally have 10-15% more fuel than they think they will need, seems like a good plan to me.

The larger engines have a lot more thrust, but their isp tends to be lower, so I end up carrying more fuel, which harms the TWR. Because of the cramping, I also tend to end up with fewer thrusters as well. When I asparagus a 2.5m, should I use 1.25m for the side-tanks? Using the big radial decoupler I can fit on a ring of 2.5m tanks, but the thing is so fragile that I\u0027m sort of afraid of going beyond that. I managed to get some big SRBs on the one I used to send up the reactor stuff, but I had to make several attempts to get that thing into orbit. Anything less than a perfect g-turn was a disaster in terms of gravity losses, and it was in dire straits when it reached Minmus. Fortunately, the lander stage was able to compensate with RCS, but that made the actual landing something of an event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about the cubic octagonal strut thing, but I declined it for two reasons: firstly, it feels a little cheaty when there\u0027s radial engines; secondly, I haven\u0027t unlocked them yet. I think I\u0027ll probably look into the radials next and see if I can get better performance that way, but I\u0027ll also try using some 1.25m side-stages with a more complex asparagus, since now that I\u0027m thinking about it, I could probably get a much better initial TWR, which seemed to be the root problem with the heavy loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess, could someone show me an example of a good 2.5m rocket for delivering heavy loads? The biggest one that I\u0027m interested in is delivering a big LFO payload to diverse places inside Kerbin SOI. I think if I can get the hang of that, I\u0027ll be able to fiddle from there until I don\u0027t need to launch refueling missions anymore.
