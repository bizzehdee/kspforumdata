But up until now I never realised the importance of a mid course burn trajectory. Because I can\u0027t for the life of me correct my orbit so that I get an equatorial orbit around Jool. My ship simply is not in the right spot to begin with. Now I just left the SoI, but I fear even if I wait until an AN/DN node I still will not be able to flatten out my orbit to Jool\u0027s plane. So what I\u0027m thinking is I have to burn anti/normal and completely lose my perfect Jool periapsis. Just so my craft can cross Jools orbital plane THEN make the adjustment burn. Problem is..how will I know when my craft is nearing that point? Engineering redux gives me relative inclination, but only the orbits inclination..not the craft itself..I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat or I flatten the orbit as best I can. ( best I can manage is a periapsis about 15 degrees off Jools equator. Areobrake, then ..circularize? I\u0027m going to laythe so should I level off the orbit before or after circularization? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry guys I know its a mouthful, but ill take whatever insight I can get.

The closer to midway they are done, the less fuel needed for the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get an encounter with one of Jool\u0027s moons, you can tweak a slingshot maneuver that will realign your orbital plane to the equatorial using very little fuel. It may take thrusters to fine tune the change as such maneuvers can be very thrust and angle critical.

Thanks Ron gives me some things to try. My issue is that this is a very big mission. Four probes break off the mothership. Two will be diving into Jool\u0027s atmosphere. And two landers for Vall and Tylo. The mothership then orbits laythe and sends down a lander/rover/return stage. Now I don\u0027t want to control five ships at the same time so I gotta get each one exept the Jool landers into a parking orbit so I only have to worry about one at a time. It\u0027s gonna be tough, but ill do what I can with what I got. Thanks fellas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
