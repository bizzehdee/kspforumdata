The problem is with the SRBs. I\u0027m having the devil of a time getting them to connect to the TT38K decouplers. Eventually they \u0022stick,\u0022 and they appear right, but by then I\u0027ve been flailing so much that I don\u0027t know how I got it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, in flight, the damn SRBs won\u0027t come OFF. According to the flight log separation is successful, but they\u0027re still stuck on. I tried Seperatrons, but that just sends the whole assembly spinning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp big dum nooby pleez.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T21:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics of your craft would help, upload them to imgur.com then post the url\u0027s here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using the demo there is a radial attachment bug, just fit the boosters onto somewhere else first then on the decouplers, and you might be finding that your SRB\u0027s aren\u0027t exactly on the decouplers but are on the main part of your craft, so when you fire them they aren\u0027t actually pushed away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pontiac","CreatedById":62216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T21:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your staging.

One trick I used was to turn on symmetry mode, (and in the case of 4 boosters) then put 4 decouplers. Then rotate the camera so you are facing the decoupler directly. Pick up the booster and place your mouse pointer ON the decoupler and check if the other boosters turn green. Then look to the right of your screen- a white border should appear around the decoupler(4) icon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Troberg","CreatedById":66999,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T07:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck that you\u0027ve actually put the boosters on the decouplers and not on the central stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, when you place the boosters, you are aiming with the mouse, not the booster.
