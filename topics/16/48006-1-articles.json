You can also make it so the front landing gears are lower than the rear, so the airplane\u0027s nose would raise on the runway. Front canards can help a lot too, to make your plane turn faster around the pitch axis. With the size of this plane, i think 40-50 m/s should be enough to start to raise from the runway (you dont have to go to the end) - at this speed your plane does not have to be too stable on the ground either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd generally - the more wings the better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TUFOM","CreatedById":83820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T12:50:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will try but it does not even try lift off before 85m/s.

Btw, maybe you dont know: the fact that it wont raise before 85m/s does not mean that it can\u0027t fly under 85m/s. But raising from the ground can be difficult. This is why you need to help it with front canards, and by lowering the front wheels, so the angle of the plane is better on the ground.
