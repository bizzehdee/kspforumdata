NASA calls it a Buggy. My strategy is to launch it separately before your mission and get it into a Mun orbit. Once your Kerbals are on the surface safely, fly it down to the landing site (or use MechJeb to get it down. Whichever is easier for you). After you\u0027re done and ready to go home, just leave it. Or you could put docking ports under and on top of the lander and dock the MMEV to the lander, separating it when in the atmosphere (don\u0027t forget the parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAAAAAND I\u0027m done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
