My ships are still hanging around, but numerous research nodes just don\u0027t want to stay researched. Used the debug tool to rebuild the tree, seemingly fixes it. Go back to VAB, half my stuff is gone again.\n\nGo back to RnD, tree is the same as when I first logged. Tried using:\n\n-Unlock All nodes\n\n-Research all parts\n\n-Rebuild tree\n\n-Reload parts \u0026 rebuild tree.\n\nnothing works, this is a bit frustrating.
