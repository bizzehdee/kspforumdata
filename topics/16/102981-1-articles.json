Those are just paved, commercial airports with publicy known characteristics. Scroll down that wikipedia page, and you\u0027ll learn more.\n\nEdwards Airforce Base for example, has ***7*** dirt runways over five km. one even 12km long. KEDW, as you may or may not known, is mainly of note as testing ground of a lot of America\u0027s X-craft and the space shuttle. Then there\u0027s Edwards\u0027 dependency Groom Lake, better known as Area 51 (Yes, *that* area) which is rumored to have a 7km runway, and Nellis Airforce Base, with a 7.3km strip. *All three of which in the same Nevada Testing and Training Range.* All those airstrips are closely tied to aircraft/spacecraft testing and training, and all of them were spaceshuttle runways.\n\nMind you, those are just the publicly known (or suspected) runways. I highly doubt there\u0027s no runways like that in Russia and China, for example.\n\nTL/DR; Nevada state is pretty much one big airport.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-30T20:31:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2015 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Redhaze**\n  \nCapitalisation is important."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T21:35:09Z","Content":"Guys, this is obviously a troll thread.
