My craft has 4 rapiers and currently 2 shock cones and 2 ram intakes. Can anyone shed light on the matter?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T15:19:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 03:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Branjoman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T16:51:11Z","Content":"I would try replacing the shock cones with the rams.

I tested this and when going fast the first to explode on my plane was ram intakes. But while using the SC the first to explode was the advanced nosecone which took a while. I must say the Ram is not for long fiery flights the 200 degree resistance doesn\u0027t help much. I actually use engine pre coolers half clipped under the craft. They never explode and give good enough intake for the rapiers. 2 of them gives enough close performance to ram \u002B you get to stash more fuel. If you plan to exit the atmosphere really quick always use the ram tho.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T16:08:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T02:23:17Z","Content":"[Relevant thread.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119553-Ram-vs-shock-cone-intake?highlight=intake)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBrisbyMouse","CreatedById":80175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T02:32:15Z","Content":"Personally, I say screw those two.
