If say, you have more air engines than shockcones, 2 of these things can feed the 3rd engine, plus the increased heat tolerance may increase your max speed (by virtue of not having the intakes explode from friction) assuming the shockcones are attached to these things. These also look pretty snazzy, you might even find a use attaching lv-ns to them to naturally keep them cooler. But because their so bulky and carry so little fuel, they might not important enough to find room for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T15:03:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll they do differently is look cooler on different parts of the plane.
