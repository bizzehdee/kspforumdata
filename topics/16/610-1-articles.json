About 5-10 meters after launch, in it\u0027s pictured configuration, the launch vehicle has already attained a 90 degree un-commanded horizontal attitude towards the orbiter vehicle side. Then at about 20 meters from the launch tower, the launch vehicle has successfully reconfigured itself into a lawn dart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave tried different configurations, including the use of the orbiter\u0027s engine to balance the asymmetry. However, doing it this way means you have to be jockeying the throttles constantly or the trajectory will destabilize rapidly/horribly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorch","CreatedById":2269,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-18T13:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t really much you can do other than attempting to balance the craft via rockets on the other side of the craft.

I also tried to edit the thrust vectoring for the boosters/main engine, but it didn\u0027t have the right effect (that, and I really have no clue about how that parameter works). I also saw the placeholder parameter for engine gimbaling and assumed that was tied to the thrust vector parameter somehow. Also tried to place a dummy OV on the other side of the main fuel tank for weight symmetry, but the thing is still unstable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, no amount of SAS modules will help this bird.

It\u0027s a very precarious balance. Made it to 10K by pure luck at one point (and never again). Separated the SRB\u0027s, and from there, was able to nudge it a bit higher with the main 4 cluster engine and OV engine. The split second I over-corrected, things went side ways in a hurry. Jettisoning the main fuel tank went beautifully though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, might make a beefed-up cheater SAS module that could maybe handle the force.
