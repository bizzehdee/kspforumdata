(haven\\\u0027t seen anyone else using this way yet! - Could be wrong though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing two of Captainslug\\\u0027s parts you can make a mini breakaway launch tower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put quad-configured (or triple) Explosive Bolts at the bottom of your rocket.

They can also handle the weight of much larger rockets as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen staging, put the bolts and legs in the initial stage with the first engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore liftoff, make sure you throttle the main engines high enough so that they will have enough thrust immediately up ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit the spacebar and voila!
