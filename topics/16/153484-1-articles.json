I\u0027ve done kerbin to duna and back with a realtively large lander and 2 kerbals.

The nice part about that is that you can leave it behind. The hard part is building and testing the rocket that gets your Kerbals back to orbit from the ground. So you start by designing and testing that. So I\u0027d say your mission goes like: launch all the parts from Kerbin, assemble and refuel in Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0if necessary, travel to Eve, drop a rover and land it, drop your lander, EVA to the rover, zoom around and take your data, load all the data into your lander, get back to orbit, move all your data into some little Kerbin return vehicle, get back to Kerbin, then maybe transfer your experiments and Kerbonauts to a Kerbin RV, and deorbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo maybe a few spacetugs to drag all this junk to Eve, and one to drag your Kerbals and experiments back to Kerbin in some tiny capsule.

You just need to get a Science Storage Unit back to orbit and its contents back to Kerbin,\u00A0leaving your crew on Eve. It\u0027s surprising how much easier getting just a SSU\u00A0to orbit is than a manned can. Again, that\u0027s only if you are doing the mission for the science and/or don\u0027t mind leaving the crew on Eve.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes just tell the Kerbals that they will come back and then on Eve, tell them, its only going to be a couple of decades until you design a lander that can get them off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo Eve last. You need as much experience with other planets as you can get. Do either Gilly or Dres next. Gilly is hard to get to as it has next to know gravity and is in a very elliptical and inclined orbit around Eve. Dres is like the moon although it has slightly less gravity, (I think) and is on a very inclined orbit further out from Duna. I also find asteroids easier to catch there than Kerbin because they are orbiting Dres so you have more than one chance to catch them. And there is also a cool canyon to explore. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFire\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T16:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222887325\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481720341\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167187\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Magzimum\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Magzimum said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou, sir, are making a name for yourself as the most evil doctor on the forum. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evil\u0022 is such a strong word.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer \u0022maliciously motivated\u0022.
