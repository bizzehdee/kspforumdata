Extended exposure to microgravity causes adaptations in balance and vision. Eye movement is closely linked to the vestibular system; it\u0027s why we can keep our eyes steady when our heads are moving. These adaptations are fine so long as you stay in microgravity, but they\u0027re totally crippling once you come back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor quite some time after returning to a non-microgravity environment, your sense of balance is roughly equivalent to someone with near-fatal alcohol poisoning, and your eyes constantly flick in random directions.
