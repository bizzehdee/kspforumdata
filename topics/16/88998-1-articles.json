In the current state, with an imput of dv and payload mass, it will choose the most efficient design with either 1 or 2 stages (design=fuel \u002B engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem is that to be able to do that, you have to imput a TWR. The point being, the lower TWR, the cheaper / lighter rocket you will ends up with. But TWR to low will make manoeuvres difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is : what are the typical TWR you use (using Kerbin gravity), for theses manoeuvres:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Circularization burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbin orbit manoeuvre (or burn to get to mun / minmus SOI)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Munar landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Minmus landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Escape burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Transfer to another planet\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Th3F3aR","CreatedById":124827,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T08:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Kerbin the common TWR used is (as far as i know) 1 \u0026lt; TWR \u0026lt; 2.5\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T08:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 means you stand in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;2 on Kerbin means you move too fast fighting atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest option is 2 but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you burn fuel in tank your rocket gets lighter and your TWR increases. So if your initial TWR was 1.8 the final might be 3.0. That is more obvious with bigger parts than with small ones. For example with KR-1x2 you can start with TWR 1.2 and end up with 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBigger TWR is no big deal on airless bodies.

Or is it an input field as well, and you\u0027re just not sure what to input?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor circularization, you can technically get away with fairly low TWRs, but it depends strongly on your player skill, and your rocket\u0027s ascent profile. If you fly up relatively steep and end up with just 1km/s velocity at your apoapsis outside the atmosphere, you\u0027re going to need a huge push quickly to avoid falling back down. On the other hand, if you get to apoapsis with 2km/s, you can circularize just fine with something like 0.2 or so. I\u0027m fairly sure that almost no one designs their rockets with an upper stage TWR higher than 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all other maneuvers once you\u0027re in orbit, TWR is no longer a necessity, but rather just a convenience. Technically, the longer the burn the more TWR you need to keep burn times down, but ironically you\u0027ll see people accept really low TWRs for the really high dV burns (largely because adding more engines costs you dV). Nuclear interplanetary transfer stages often fly with as little as 0.1, while most people don\u0027t do Mun transfers below 0.5. Basically, the lower dV transfers are easier to provide with a high TWR, so you\u0027ll see this counterintuitive phenomenon with TWRs actually going down with increasingly difficult burns, creating a doubly growing burn length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich of those provides a mathematically optimal design? Difficult to say, because these build decisions are only partially driven by math. I mean, you\u0027re building this tool in the first place because it\u0027s often really difficult to find a suitable combination of engines and tanks, right? A lot of build decisions are made because the vessel is assembled around a certain tank or engine, or needs to be a certain length or weight, or needs to have a certain shape for utility and/or aesthetics, and so on. All these things constrain the builder\u0027s flexibility and make it difficult to cater to both dV and TWR at the same time. And ultimately, because the former is a hard requirement and the latter is just convenience, the former pretty much always wins out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR once again becomes a requirement instead of a convenience when you\u0027re landing, and for this, I have a rule of the thumb: for landing, I want \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E twice the takeoff TWR, better three times. Trying to land with a local TWR of 2 or below is an exercise in pure frustration, since you basically need to burn all the way from orbit to touchdown (performing a reverse launch), and starting just a second too late can splat you into the ground. For a human being, the right moment is close to impossible to estimate without sheer dumb luck... or with a healthy safety buffer, which makes for a really inefficient (dV-wise) landing. Much rather you want a small deorbit burn followed by a coast phase down to the surface and short, hard deceleration started only when you\u0027re almost there. The higher your TWR, the shorter this final burn is and thus the easier it is for a human to eyeball correctly (and the less dV you waste fighting gravity).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-31T08:59:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2014 08:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilir","CreatedById":122948,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T09:20:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t intend to hardcode it.
