If you want a more realistic flight model, I suggest getting a hold of the Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research mod - colloquially FAR - which replaces the flight model wholesale. It causes issues with some mods that use the base drag numbers, but the planes that fly well end up looking like planes more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T17:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour \u0022arrow\u0022 looks way \u0022cooler\u0022, sure - but your doublewinged hopper has its own charme - so I am not sure which one would be the ugly one? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GROOV3ST3R","CreatedById":27590,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T17:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile the simplified drag model does make it nearly pointless to actually build aerodynamic craft, it also provides us with some really interesting opportunities.

I did use debug menu to put on 2 ram air intakes on each engine and one right behind the cockpit.

Also, if you have trouble keeping the nose pointed upwards, it means your craft is too nose-heavy. Balance the CoG and CoL together. Make sure that as fuel drains from the craft, it doesn\u0027t destabilize it too much. CoG Will shift as tanks become empty. If possible, stack them laterally and not longitudinally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you prefer a more conventional design, look at this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/963/navigatormk56.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022navigatormk56.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote canards at the front help keep the craft pointed the right way up. Vertical control surfaces are angled so they also provide SOME lift and stability. Keep all lifting surfaces pointed EXACTLY in the direction of travel.

Lift increases up to typically 16 degrees where you suddenly go from max lift to stall! In KSP, lift increases to a max at 30 degrees then goes down again, with no stall. In both cases, higher angle of attack increases induced drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why people keep banging on about how it\u0027s not possible to build a realistic looking and flying plane in KSP (without FAR).

Also, the tailplane actually creates a downwards force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
