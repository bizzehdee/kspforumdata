As Jason said, burning downward is a loss, but I think it\u0027s essentially the same as any other steering loss, 1 minus the cosine of the steering angle. And a burn anywhere other than 80km can\u0027t put you into an 80km circular orbit, period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut assuming the periapsis in the \u0022old technique\u0022 before the final burn is negative or very low, your gravity turn should have flattened out at a lower altitude. Then you would have burnt more during the gravity turn than you did with the \u0022old technique,\u0022 but the savings in the final burn will more than make up the difference. To think of it in a different way, you don\u0027t need to bring your apoapsis all the way up to its final height until after you\u0027ve gotten to orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T18:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I understand it, due to the nature of vector addition, any thrust off your velocity direction is inherently less efficient.

When you are burning downwards while still rising to apoapsis, you are wasting a LOT of fuel. Any optimal ascent to orbit will include a fast burn at the apoapsis. The only question is how much rotation you should do while you are raising the apoapsis. In vacuum, the answer is easy. You do the exact reverse of a suicide burn. With atmosphere, it\u0027s a much harder problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
