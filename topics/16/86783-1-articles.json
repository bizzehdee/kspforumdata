It\u0027s just lazy and (speaking as a mod on another forum) I feel it\u0027s disrespectful. Someone took the time to answer the question - not bothering to look for the answer before consuming bandwith and time is...wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only potential confusion I see is that we seem to have a rule against necro-posting, so there might be a conflict between \u0022This question is answered\u0022 and \u0022I have further questions about this topic\u0022.
