The way you have your tri couplers there, they are clipping, or occupying the same space. When your rocket loads up, these pieces flex off eachother, since there is no velocity, it isn\\\u0027t reading a collision in your report, but the flex does cause the structural failure you are seeing. A tri coupler can never directly connect in line under another tri coupler without this issue unfortunately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo create a triple stack ship, radially coupler a stage around your command module stage. After that you can mount tri underneath. You can rotate and manipulate parts using your q, w, e, a, s, d controls like the flight controls. These will rotate parts 90 degrees. hold shift to do fine rotations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rustymcclintock","CreatedById":20487,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-04T21:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh man, I remember these days.
