Poor chap seems to be cruising round Kerbal in his space suit at about 110km. I\u0027ve built a rocket with a second cockpit which is empty, and rendezvoused with him in orbit, but now I\u0027m stuck. As he doesn\u0027t work for me it seems I can\u0027t control him and use his jet pack to get him in to Jeb\u0027s spare seat whcih was my original plan. I\u0027ve gently bumped the crew hatch in to him but I think he\u0027s asleep and not taking the hint. I\u0027ve not researched the robotic arm yet but if I get that and grab him presumably I still won\u0027t be able to get him on board to be able to get him back to Kerbin safely. Any suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dartguy","CreatedById":98197,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T17:24:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the ] [ keys to switch to him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dzikakulka","CreatedById":116606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-26T17:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, yes you are able to grab him gently with the claw and do a (gentle) reentry, landing and recovery to complete the mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....but the [ ] switching should be stickied somehwere here.

If someone has to ask, the UI is bad (for that function), period. It\u0027s not intuitive, and even the idea of switching between craft you own would not be intuitive in this case, because when you try the usual mechanisms to switch for a noob (tracking station or clicking in map view) the game explicitly informs you that you cannot switch to units you do not own, so why would you think you could switch with ][?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
