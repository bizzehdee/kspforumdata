Burntime the maneuver gives me should be messed up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I calculate this for myself?

Now divide 271,5 dV by 1765 m/s and you get the time your ship needs for 1 m/s dV. Which equals 0,15382[...]. And finally take this times the deltaV needed for the maneuver: 917.3 * 0,15382[...] = 141,1 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the past has shown that it doesn\u0027t work that way.

When in aggregate the total change in velocity equals or exceeds the delta-V of the maneuver, you have your actual burn time.
