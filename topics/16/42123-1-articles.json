Spending that while travelling at higher speed results in a greater change in energy than spending it while travelling at a lower speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe math to show this is simply the kinetic energy equation: E = 1/2mv^2. Consider two cases where we apply the same delta V of 10. (constant mass in both examples, lets set it to 2 to make things easy). Units don\u0027t matter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitial Velocity = 0. Initial energy = 0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal velocity = 10.

Work is force over distance. The rocket is going to burn (apply a force) for the same amount of time no matter how fast you are going. But the faster you are going the more distance you will cover in that time. Therefore the rocket does more work at high speed than at low speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does not conflict with the relativistic property of requiring more and more energy to increase your velocity as you approach the speed of light. What that would be telling us is that the amount of fuel you need to get your delta-V change in the first place (10 m/s in our examples above) needs to get bigger and bigger. But if you did have enough fuel to do it, the orbeth effect would still entail that those extra 10 m/s are \u0022worth more energy\u0022 at high speed than at low speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T08:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, what did we really gain for our voyage/orbit after using the oberth effect?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf adding 10 m/s just adds 10 m/s to our orbital velocity regardless of planetary mass, height of the orbit or initial velocity - then what is the extra gain in energy doing for us?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T09:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, what did we really gain for our voyage/orbit after using the oberth effect?\u003Cp\u003EIf adding 10 m/s just adds 10 m/s to our orbital velocity regardless of planetary mass, height of the orbit or initial velocity - then what is the extra gain in energy doing for us?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne easy way to see the oberth effect is to make an Mun flyby, make an node changes your Pe (closest encounter), now make an new node at Pe.
