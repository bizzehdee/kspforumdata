I don\u0027t know how you got pass reentry without burning up since two crew cabins plus a mk 1 command pod always blow up. If you have fuel, try entering kerbin orbit first. Then slowly burn your engine (pointed retrograde) just so that your craft drops below 70 km. Then just wait as your craft reenters (you might need to wait for an orbit or two before it clears reentry. Then you should be slow enought to slow down. I tested your craft and if you dive straight into the kerbin from the mun with no burns, well I burned up during reentry so I have no idea how you survived that. I turned on the ignore max temp cheat and tried again. It was coming in really fast. You will need to slow down a lot. Try adding the radical parachutes on the pod and the the crew cabins as well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-27T09:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni ued to deploy parachutes when risky (yellow) all the time before i unlocked better pieces, i never had any malfunction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tried to deploy them on red a few times in bad situations, they always ripped immediately. they didn\u0027t even slow down the craft slightly, which was all i was hoping for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
