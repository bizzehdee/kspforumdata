This is, as you pointed out, an approximation: the escape speed at the SoI boundary is 290 m/s, so the ship will leave Kerbin going slightly faster than my calculations assume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd at this point you assume that the velocity difference (between Kerbin and the transfer orbit periapsis) can be set equal to the escape speed at the SoI boundary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it is quite easy to calculate the needed velocity at 80km periapsis within Kerbins SOI and calculate the difference to the 80 x altitude orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the explanation. Clever idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be easy to correct for this (just move the planets down by v_inf -\u0026gt; sqrt(v_inf^2 - (290 m/s)^2) in the above chart), but it wouldn\u0027t change much. I\u0027m pretty sure my assumption that all the planets are coplanar introduces a much bigger error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t think this is much of a stretch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
