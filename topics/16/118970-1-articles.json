I\u0027m tired of launching a whole bunch of individual satellites, one for each SCAN-Sat probe I want to use, so I decided to design one mothership that can drop off microsats at the correct orbits. The design was easy enough, I just used Clamp-o-Tron Jr.\u0027s radially on the orbital stage. The idea is when I get to the right altitude, I\u0027ll just undock the sat and let it do it\u0027s thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that when I test it on the launchpad, I loose all communications with the probe after I decouple it from the mothership. Each microsat has its own OKTO2, a Z-400 battery a 1x6 solar panel and a Communitron 32 for RT along with a sensor for SCAN-Sat use. Anyone know why I\u0027m loosing control when the sats decouple from the mothership? It\u0027s not RT.
