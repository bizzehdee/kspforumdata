Still, how can I make a rover or should I be aiming for something else to explore the Minmus?

When taxying, there is almost no friction, at least without elevation change. You can cross the great flats loosing only 1 or 2 m/s in velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI drove from the flats to the poles, crossing 5 biomes. After freewheeling across the flats, we headed north to the highlands. This required gaining over 5000m in elevation so I used a fair bit of fuel (300LF?) doing so. After that I was coasting downhill to the north pole, riding the brakes. I was very worried about busting off a control surface, so kept my surface velocity to about 10 m/s. That certainly increased my fuel use when climbing to the highlands, due to increased gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the picture we also brought a tourist. The science payout from this mission was enormous, more than i\u0027d have got for slinging unmanned probes at Jool all week.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe if your vehicle is not an airplane, you can make it more robust and stable, and taxy at higher speeds, using less fuel. I would stick to landing gear legs rather than rover wheels, they\u0027re much tougher.
