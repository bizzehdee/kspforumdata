As long as your stages have a TWR high enough (1.5 is a good minimum) and around 12,000 m/s of total delta-V, you can get off of Eve. That way you can tell if the vehicle has the ability to leave Eve from the surface, just from math. The rest is up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T23:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBesides taking into account the TWR which I also advice to check with mechjeb in the vab. I also recommend practicing in eves atmosphere with hyperedit as mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you have enough delta V and TWR to get into orbit theoretically. You have very severe restrictions to terminal velocity on eve. That means you can very easily waste alot of Delta V by ascending to fast which then costs enormous amounts of delta V. So I would suggest practicing terminal velocities on ascend a couple of times so you know what ascend speed to maintain during different layers of eves atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a table of recommended terminal velocities on this page. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Eve\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Eve\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I recommend practice on the basis of those values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso don\u0027t forget that all your stages need to have a TWR sufficient enough. And usually you need multiple stages to ascend on eve. So besides carying alot of fuel you need a sufficient strategy of high energy engines on basically all but the last orbit insertion stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
