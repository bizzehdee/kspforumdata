The new patch has screwed up KSP for many of us. example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TouhouTorpedo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TouhouTorpedo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny news on bugfixes/improvements for some of the previously implemented changes that have proven unstable or non-optimal?\u003Cp\u003EList of things that come to mind for me with suggested solutions :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- seats as crewable component. Makes no sense that hype was made about how you launch a Kerbal on an SRB on a seat - when you can\u0027t without a whole load of tedium first. I\u0027ve worked on a plugin to try this, and can\u0027t see why it isn\u0027t doable properly in the seat module itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- eliminate large rocket wobble and collapse (of even sensible designs) once and for all - by upgrading attachnodes of at least the larger parts to have built-in, invisible strutting between rigidbodies, using scaled strength related to the masses of the connected parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the new terrain is cool but a nightmare to rove - its normal forces on contact are all over the place and can either bounce you off them, suck your vessel into them, or even power you up the mountain you\u0027re on for no effort at all. Could do with sorting out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- make new ASAS and old ASAS both available (locking behaviour more beneficial in some scenarios. Why would we used to have had 3 different SAS methods, and now only one?) The \u0022stop then lock\u0022 method is not reliable in \u0022lock\u0022 only designs. Old ASAS is still needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- configurable automatic crewing behavior in gameplay settings would be pretty neat, its easy to forget too late your hitchhikers are empty, or maybe some people would like to manually define it all from empty?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- upgrade the tracking station UI. It takes far too many clicks to end/recover flights. I know why it would have been done this way, but when you have a whole load of debris to remove three clicks a fair distance from each other everytime takes a while. How about keyboard shortcuts working here? select one and hit del to instantly end/recover selected flight - especially if its debris at the minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got a great game concept Squad and I\u0027ve really loved being involved, playing from an earlier stage and getting into modding with KSP. But I find I don\u0027t play the game as often as I used to, as each play is starting to feel tedious with seemingly small overlookable problems stacking up together into a disappointing experience overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you please consider overhaulling some of these sorts of issues before getting to into adding yet more features. If you don\u0027t fix or improve anything you\u0027re building on, and just stack up more incomplete features, I feel its ironically making a less complete gaming experience as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere might be more good an interesting suggestions. If I\u0027ve missed anything, someone else go ahead and mention it. Just thought I\u0027d let my opinion on the current development known. I\u0027m not saying I don\u0027t want new features. I\u0027m saying I want the ones I have fun to play more than tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TouhouTorpedo has been modding for this game since before I started in November 2012. I love his mods and I hope we don\u0027t lose him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
