Minmus is way easier to get to.\n\nIt may need slightly more delta-v to get there but it requires a lot less for the landing and return, even the inclination change isn\u0027t that big a deal as you can often just place your maneuver node at the ascending or descending node, burn equatorial (i.e without changing planes to match Minmus) and still get an intercept. The low gravity makes landings much more forgiving too and if you aim to land on the \u0022sea\u0027s\u0022 then you know that the landing area will be perfectly flat and at zero altitude. \n\nMuch easier for a beginner in my opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T08:17:52Z","Content":"I shall solve this debate.

If you plan your burn to raise your orbit\u0027s apoapsis to near that of Minmus\u0027 such that your apoapsis is roughly on the line made by the descending/ascending nodes with Minmus\u0027 orbit, you can then get an intercept 4 out of 5 times (in my experience) simply by messing with your apoapsis and the position of your manouvre node. \n\nThat\u0027s what I often do - so long as Minus is anywhere from just past one node (say, the descending node for instance) to about 2/3 the way to the next node, I\u0027ll just aim my apoapsis at the (in this example) ascending node, then adjust apoapsis until I get an encounter. This generally means that my orbit loops some distance outside that of Minmus\u0027, whilst waiting for Minmus to catch up, but the extra fuel used to get that encounter is minimal. As an added bonus, chances are that you\u0027ll get an encounter with a significant inclination with regard to Minus, so when you buirn to get an orbit around Minus, you\u0027ll cover plenty of territory and so have lots of choice in your landing site, without having to do another inclination change.\n\nNot terribly professional, but it works fine with stock KSP. Not advisable if you\u0027re using any kind of life-support mod unless you make sure you\u0027ve got plenty of snacks stashed away, as the flight time may be weks longer than you\u0027d expect from a \u0027proper\u0027 approach.. And to return, just wait until the bit of surface your ship is landed on is more or less facing backwards along Minmu\u0027 orbit. Then take off, turn your ship so it is pointing veen close to directly backwards along Kerbins orbit until you get escape from Minmus. Then burn retrograde until you get a peripasis within Kerbins atmosphere (I cant give an altitude, as I\u0027m still playing 0.9 due to graphics issues with my PC, but about 35km worked up to 0.9).\n\nThis isn\u0027t very neat, and may not be the most efficient way to get to Minmus, but it is the simplest - IMHO - way to get you there and back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T09:55:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**"}]}
