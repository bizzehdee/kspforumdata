I doubt you need anything special -- just the correct \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E at Eve. So use Precise Maneuver and gently change your escape burn from Kerbin. I\u0027m sure that as the trajectory slowly changes, you will see hundreds of projected encounters with Jool, Duna, and Kerbin. You might even get lucky and get a few of the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
