Always launch to 90 degrees (due East) from the launch pad. But, I think they were trying to say go prograde of the planet for outer planets and retrograde of the planet for inner planets. This means you want you ejection to be prograde or retrograde of the planet you are leaving. So, if you wanted to go inward, you want to leave your current planet on the sunny side. Making your ship travel around the sun in a lower orbit around the sun. But, this is not alway the best practice. There are better ejection angles that will optimize your fuel/DV needed. But for general, off the cuff, ejections, just orbit counter-clockwise as you normally do but when you \u0022break away\u0022 from the planet\u0027s SOI, you want to have less energy (lower orbit) for inner planets or more energy (higher orbit) for out planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s not too muddy, maybe it helped.

From there to visit the outer planets, plan your escape burn, usually the night side of Kerbal, when you are traveling pro-grade to Kerbal\u0027s orbit. For the inner planets, do the escape burn, usually from the daylight side of Kerbal, when you are traveling retrograde to Kerbal\u0027s orbit. The burn should be done when you are parallel to Kerbal\u0027s orbital path around the sun. Pro-grade equals the same direction of travel, retrograde is the opposite direction of travel. In either case, beware of a possible encounter with Mum\u0027s gravity field which can throw you way off and even change your orbital plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is interesting, due to orbital mechanics, is that your path is actually backwards from your direction of acceleration when you aim to visit the inner planets. That is because you are burning retrograde in relation to Kerban\u0027s orbital velocity thus going slower then Kerbal is going around its sun which causes you to fall towards it\u0027s sun to reach a new stable solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-26T12:18:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2013 12:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T12:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the Mun to show how this works.

For best exit from the Mun back to Kerbin, would be to burn on the far side of the Mun and make your apoapsis rise on the near side (closest to Kerbin). Then when it breaks open, you are then in a lesser energy orbit around Kerbin. If you keep burning a bit more you will decrease you orbit even further.

They burned just enough to get into the Moon\u0027s SOI and then let gravity do the rest until they circularized. Getting into a retrograde Earth orbit before departing would cost a lot of delta V and burning to get into a prograde lunar orbit would require a more direct path (also more delta V).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, you can always burn prograde or retrograde to the orbit of your parent body regardless of whether or not your orbit is prograde or retro grade. The only thing that changes is where you start your burn. Ships in prograde orbits want to burn near-side for access to the inner bodies and far-side for the outer bodies. Ships in retrograde orbits will do the opposite; near-side for access to outer bodies, far-side for inner bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee.g. A ship in prograde Kerbin orbit will want to burn dark-side (far-side) to get to Jool, while a ship in prograde orbit of the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn will want to burn on the near-side to get back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Apollo missions were in retrograde lunar orbit they burned on the far-side to get back to Earth. It was risky having their major burns for Lunar orbital maneuvers on the far side, but it was much cheaper in Delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoriW","CreatedById":57866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T13:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is indeed true that whether you are going to the inner or outer planets, the most efficient way to approach it is with a 90 degree (East) heading orbit.
