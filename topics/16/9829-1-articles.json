If you decelerate (or accelerate backwards) At your Ap, your orbit will become more eccentric and your Pe will decrease height. If you decelerate at your Pe, your Ap will decrease height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, acceleration at x will increase the height of y. Decelerating at x will decrease the height of y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do a burn perpendicular to the path of your orbit, you will be able to change the path the orbit goes around the planet. If you are initially orbiting the equator, you can make your orbit shift towards the north by accelerating north. The same effect can be achieved by pointing south. Your orbit\\\u0027s path ahead of you will shift north or south, respectively, while the orbit path behind you will shift in the opposite direction (Newton\\\u0027s second law: equal and opposite reaction). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWATCH YOUR AP AND PE HEIGHTS AS THEY CAN \u0027SLIDE AWAY\u0027 FROM YOU IF YOU ARE NOT ALWAYS PERPENDICULAR TO THE PATH OF YOUR ORBIT.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA completely round orbit is almost impossible to achieve in KSP as there are slight rounding errors that will always take effect.
