On my machine it\u00A0is reproducible in stock KSP with fresh settings.cfg\u00A0by just launching anything from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, don\u0027t do anything but 50x warp, and just watch the sky (or watch your shadow). I\u0027ve not noticed this behavior in 1.2.2, only since 1.3. I understand it could be some optimization, but it really annoys me - enjoying the scene of the sky at time warp is something that I enjoy from this game... Do people also see this behavior? If yes,\u00A0is there any hidden config setting or even something involving a quick c# coding that could fix it?
