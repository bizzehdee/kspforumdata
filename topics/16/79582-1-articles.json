If you put your Kerbal in a command chair you are better off with 1.25m parts imo. If you want to land with a capsule things become larger, much larger. Still, I would try to avoid using the new parts for an Eve lander - but they are great to get your lander into LKO! ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo build your Eve lander you probably want to use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-24-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-8-and-v1-0-0-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/a\u003E.

The newer NASA parts are incredibly helpful at getting something capable of an Eve ascent, all the way to Eve. Previously, my lifters would have a monstrous lifter underneath them, and still empty their first two stages getting in orbit. Then I\u0027d go out send a tug, then make a third launch with a refueller before departing.

If you want to do some testing on Kerbin, you can add tanks to simulate the extra weight that will be exerted on the ship on Eve, useful for testing landing gear. For testing TWR, limit your engines to about 55% to achieve a similar effect.
