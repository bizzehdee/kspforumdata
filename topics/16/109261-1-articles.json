Therefore, there is nothing at all unrealistic about making said atmosphere whatever the user desires.\n\nBTW, thanks for the data ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:43:32Z","Content":"Thanks! Yeah, the 1.0.2 aero does seem *right* for KSP. Rockets fall over too easily. This makes waterlubber a sad panda.
