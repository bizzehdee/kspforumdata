So if you re-enter prograde (parallel to the equator) with an orbital velocity v\u00A0your velocity relative to the surface will be (v - 460) m/s but if you re-enter retrograde from\u00A0the same orbital velocity your surface relative velocity is (v \u002B 460) m/s or 960 m/s faster. The atmosphere rotates at the same speed as the surface. From LEO your initial orbital speed is about 7.5 km/s so the difference between prograde and retrograde will be around\u00A013%. A lunar return will have a higher orbital velocity at atmospheric interface but since the difference in surface velocities is fixed the percentage change between prograde and retrograde will be less (around 8-10%) but still significant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-21T06:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of this, heating tends to go as velocity\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecubed\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, so a small incremental increase in velocity has big implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aelfhe1m","CreatedById":142910,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-21T07:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223177033\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165706\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221505977179\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n25 minutes ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of this, heating tends to go as velocity\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecubed\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, so a small incremental increase in velocity has big implications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery good point as increasing a\u00A0value by 10% increases any other value that\u0027s proportional to\u00A0its cube by\u00A033%!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
