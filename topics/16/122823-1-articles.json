I feel like it must do this somewhere, it makes sense to send a probe first to gather data before kerballed missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T01:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really.

For example, if you\u0027re flight testing a plane on Kerbin, you can see how it flies at different pressure levels, which might help in calibrating for other planets.
