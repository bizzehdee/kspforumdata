Your flight to Mun and back should be the same, including setting up a reentry. When you are escaping the Mun/ you can set up your PE (lowest point around Kerbin) down around 30km right away. You don\u0027t have to wait till you get back near Kerbin and do more burns to circularize. Just head straight into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Thar dV map that Tortoise posted is a great start. Just know that those numbers aren\u0027t perfect for every flight. Changes in when you leave Kerbin and where the target is can have a big impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And no. MJ and FAR do not play well together without some adjustments.

The boost phase is all about brute power. You want something that can lift a heavy load quickly, so \u003Cstrong\u003Euse engines that have high thrust numbers.\u003C/strong\u003E You want this phase to generate about 2 Gs of acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The transstage is working with a lighter load and, since it is tipped over on it\u0027s side, it doesn\u0027t have to push as hard. Look for an engine that has \u003Cstrong\u003Ehigh Isp numbers in atmosphere\u003C/strong\u003E and medium- low thrust. It needs to push just hard enough to keep the show rolling. The lighter you can build this stage the better, since the boost stage has to haul it up there from the pad. It only needs to generate about 1 to 1 1/2 Gs of acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The injection stage will be working in space for a long time and thrust really isn\u0027t an issue with it. You need to use an engine with \u003Cstrong\u003Ehigh Isp in vacuum\u003C/strong\u003E and don\u0027t worry so much about the thrust. Getting this stage light and efficient is critical, since it\u0027s weight has a cascading effect down the stack. If it\u0027s heavy, then your transstage will have to be a lot bigger to move it and your boost stage has to be gimongous to lift both. 1/2 g acceleration is fine here, and if you fly it right it can still do the job with less than that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A good design starts with the injection stage and works backwards, but since that\u0027s pretty much 100% math, that\u0027s where I\u0027ll have to leave it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When working with the upper stages, always be thinking \u0022how can I make this lighter and more efficient while still making it work?\u0022 Try to get creative with your payload by doing things like breaking it into smaller pieces and assembling them in orbit, or sending them up empty and fueling them in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-17T22:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FiesesAlien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FiesesAlien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey.\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answer so far.
