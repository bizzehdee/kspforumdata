The ship is very massive (two orange tanks, lander on the front and side tanks), although I can detach one orange tank when it runs out, the ship is still very slow, even with two nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is doing my burn from Kerbin to Moho, whenever I set my maneuver nodes, I have to burn directly into Kerbin. This seems like it\u0027s wasting a lot of fuel, which I really don\u0027t want. Plus, the burn still takes a good half hour to complete, so that\u0027s a lot of fuel (and then I have to do an insertion burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I use engines with higher thrust? or any other help?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T00:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse multiple burns to raise your AP before you deorbit Kerbin, just burn for a few mins either side of where you want Pe to be.

That will place you in a more efficient solar orbit to encounter Moho and heading away from Kerban when you do your intercept burn.. The most efficient burn would be when your orbital plane crosses Moho\u0027s tilted plane at intercept. Otherwise, it will take a lot of fuel to intercept, then get the orbit.
