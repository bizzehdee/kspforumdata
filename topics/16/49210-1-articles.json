The same thing happens if you use a seperate sample return system (pod seperates from science container and they both descend on their own parachutes, useful if you have a lot of samples and need to ensure they land softly). After you recover your main craft you\u0027ll need to go to the tracking station, select \u0027debris\u0027 (unless you gave them a probe core) and recover the packages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
