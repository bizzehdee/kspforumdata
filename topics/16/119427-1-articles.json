You can climb the tree a fair distance just by getting things from Kerbin, even before you go to the Mun. Make sure you\u0027ve made the rounds of the various KSC buildings, they all count as their own biomes and you can pick up quite a bit of science there. When you\u0027re in low Kerbin orbit, get an EVA report from space over a bunch of different biomes. Make sure you\u0027ve gotten science \u0022while flying at Kerbin\u0022 (and some experiments are per-biome while flying). And \u0022from Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere\u0022. And \u0022in space high over Kerbin\u0022 (not just near Kerbin, you only need to get a few hundred km up). This should at least get you to the point where you get some reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, make sure you\u0027re not over-thrusting too low. Aero drag goes \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E up once you pass Mach 1, which means if you go too fast too soon, you end up wasting lots of fuel just fighting drag. Keep your speed under 300 m/s until you get up around 10 km, then floor it. You\u0027re using SRBs. You can\u0027t control their throttle... but you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E choose their thrust at design time in the VAB (right click on them, you can set the thrust to less than 100%). By picking the right amount of thrust, you can make it so that the SRBs don\u0027t burn so hard, which means that they last longer and you also don\u0027t pass Mach 1 too soon. (The benefit of doing this is, first, your rocket is easier to steer when it\u0027s not going too fast, and, second, it means you\u0027re making more efficient use of the rocket, which means you can build a smaller rocket for the job, which makes it easier to steer, too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to calculate the right thrust for your SRBs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Take the total mass of your ship, in tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Multiply by 9.8 (this is Kerbin surface gravity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Multiply by 1.5 (a reasonable TWR, you could go a little lower if you like). This is how much total thrust you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Add up all the thrust for all the SRBs that fire when you launch. This is how much total thrust they give at 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Divide the answer from #3 by the answer from #4. This gives you the answer of \u0022what fraction (i.e. percentage) should I set my SRBs at\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: if you\u0027re milking for science, consider sending a munar \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eorbiter \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003Efirst (i.e. just get there and orbit around it and then go home) before trying a landing. Not having to land and take off will save you well over 1 km/sec of dV, which means you could build a much smaller rocket for the mission, which in turn means you\u0027d have an easier time controlling it. You can get a lot of science just from orbit (in particular, take your kerbal on EVA over the various munar biomes). Doing that (and also getting science instrument readings from \u0022high over the Mun\u0022 and \u0022space near the Mun\u0022) will give quite a bit of science, which should easily take you high enough in the tech tree to get some good reaction wheels and steerable fins. Then you can use that to build a bigger, fancier crewed mission to do a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T19:12:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trainsis","CreatedById":150277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T19:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow do i add up the thrust ?? where do i get the thrust value??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHumm?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T20:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022trainsis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022trainsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow do i add up the thrust ?? where do i get the thrust value??\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-game, you can get the info in the VAB.
