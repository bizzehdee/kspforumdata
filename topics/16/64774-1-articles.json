I had them as close and as aligned as humanly possible (I\u0027m being completely honest in saying the only way they could\u0027ve been MORE perfectly aligned was if they were actually docked), but they refused to dock. What I\u0027m asking for is some way to either edit a file to make it so the two ships are docked, or a way to mark the empty tanks I\u0027m trying to fill up as full (again, in the persistence file or whatever).
