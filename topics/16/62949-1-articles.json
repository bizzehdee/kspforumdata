As you\u0027re flying just hit Esc jot down your notes and continue on. An example might be the current terminal velocity readout which saves having to look it up in a chart and extrapolate for your particular altitude and can help you get the most out of your \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v. It also has various trajectory info and so on. One other thing that comes to mind is one of the freeware sticky notes programs you could put it off to the side and make your notes right on screen, I\u0027m pretty sure these are available whichever OS you\u0027re using.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T13:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor recording/replaying flight paths I really like this one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49216-0-23-Persistent-Trails-record-share-and-replay-track-data!-%28Dec-19-V1-1%29?highlight=persistent\u002Btrails\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49216-0-23-Persistent-Trails-record-share-and-replay-track-data!-%28Dec-19-V1-1%29?highlight=persistent\u002Btrails\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T18:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55625-0-23-In-game-notes-notepad-checklist-v0-7-1-1-24-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis\u003C/a\u003E mod allows you to make notes in KSP itself.
