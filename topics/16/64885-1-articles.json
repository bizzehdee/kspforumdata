If the difference between the ap and pe is very small, it will make them bounce around a lot or even switch places for almost circular orbits. For large enough ships, turning the ship around is enough to switch the ap and pe if the difference between them is less than a few hundred meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T18:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell this is a problem with limited computational accuracy in the code that calculates spacecraft trajectories. It should only happen when \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You\u0027re in real-time mode (the orbit should freeze in time warp)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Either your orbit is very close to circular, or the periapsis passes very close to the planet. In the first case, a small uncertainty in trajectory turns into a big uncertainty in the periapsis location because all points along the orbit are at almost the periapsis (or apoapsis) height anyway. In the second case, I assume it has something to do with close approaches requiring smaller simulation steps, but I don\u0027t know the details of how the engine handles that (e.g., an adaptive step size).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nepos","CreatedById":73416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T19:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI notice that when mine is jumping and I want to set a nav node I just put the game in 5x time warp and the bouncing stop. this allows me to set the node without all the jumping.
