If you quicksaved before the liftoff, you can do it again and choose the right direction. It\u0027s the less expensive way, but if you have around 1200 Delta V left in the tanks you can revert the directio fo the orbit with a retrograde burn till it became prograde, then you must accelerate to generare a new orbit in the right direction.
