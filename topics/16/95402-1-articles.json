For liquid-fueled boosters, remember that the booster will be empty when you stage and the engine is the heaviest part, so the center of mass will be low, near the engine. So the sepratrons need to be low (just above the center of mass for the booster). You get into trouble when you place the sepratrons near the center of the booster, far above the center mass, so that the boosters rotate outwards too quickly, causing the booster engines to collide with the main engine and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolid boosters have a different distribution of mass. The center of mass is more near the center of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to figure this out is to construct the booster by itself and tweak all the fuel out of it.
