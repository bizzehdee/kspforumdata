Save that as a subassembly and use it as a template-piece. Also re-root it so that one docking port will be the root part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to use I-Beams as a construction aid, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E attach one ring of docking ports to your tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E attach one long I-beam to the port\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E attach your template-piece to the I-beam\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E attach a short I-Beam to the other port on your template\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E place another port on your tank, again sticking a short I-beam from it\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E slip the second port on the tank around until the I-beams match perfectly\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe I-beams are easy to judge by eyeball.
