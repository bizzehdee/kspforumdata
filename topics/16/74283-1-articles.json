Am flying a Kethane mining ship from Minmus to the mothership in orbit for refueling but i have to fly several times to fully fuel up. Am mining/refining on Minmus surface and then dock with the mothership to exchange the tanks contents. That means for the flight back to Monmus surface i just leave enough fuel in the miners tanks to have it safely touched down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 2 succesfull flights in this way (and in principle that worked 2 times before), when i throttle up to deorbit the miner the engines show (slight blueish, LV-T45) exhaust flames but consume no fuel and produce no thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have checked that the right engines connected to the tanks that still contain fuel are activated, thrusters are not limited, the control is set to the same unit (capsule, the miner is kerbaled) as on the 2 flights before, there is plenty of electricity.

I\u0027ve done this design thinking of why it works on mine but my secret is I only ever used one tank for the engines. The problem is that fuel can flow through a girder out of a tank so long as the receiving object is not a fuel tank (in this case it\u0027s a kethane tank). You won\u0027t get a circular flow through this system so the bottom tank drains first causing your engines to flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo fix this: Run the fuel lines from the kethane converter to the bottom tank instead of the top tank on each engine stack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eempc","CreatedById":110483,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T23:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kemde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kemde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen i pump the fuel from the lower to upper tanks (the ones further away from the engines) it works ...\u003Cp\u003EMiracles in space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlaus\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just had a similar phenomenon happen to what you described with my two fuel tanks and an LV-N.

For flight purpose the control is set to the kerbaled capsule, for docking purposes to one of the docking ports. I wrote \u0022no thrust\u0022 because the velocimeter does not change, the orbital path stays the same and when i deactivate all but one engines the craft doesn\u0027t start to turn when thrusting up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel flow could be interesting, though. Up to now i thought that engines take their fuel from the directly connected tank and if other tanks are attached to that fuel flows from there in the direction towards the engine, from distal to proximal sotosay in respect to one stack of engine and tanks. Fuel lines direct the fuel from one tank to another in a single direction, keeping the receiving tank proximal and making the connected tank distal. At least that were my assumptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was not clear to me that fuel passes through girders. The contents of the tanks (Kethane tank is empty after delivery to the mothership) did not change during the effectless burning. The fuel lines that connect the upper tank to the kethane converter run from tank to converter because the kethane pack tells to do so. Maybe i forgot to shut down the converter functions and that was the difference to the previous flights, but i can\u0027t test that anymore right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next miner will have a different design, just for mining purposes, no science/lander/capsule stuff, shorter, broader and more sturdy to land in rugged areas and with single LF-tanks as proposed by michaelhester07.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe it as it may, i know about the problem (thanks everyone), the design can\u0027t be changed anymore.
