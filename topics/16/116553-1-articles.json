I\u0027ve landed on Mun and have two interplanetary probes. Doesn\u0027t seem to be an excuse for the game to not believe I can do more than Kerbin LKO...\n\nI have 50 peoples in my roster, and I\u0027ve never hired any Kerbal. So it\u0027s all relative!\n\nAnd since rescuing four of them cost me around 2,000 credit and 30 mn (20 for the takeoff/landing \u002B 3mn per RDV), it is definitely free money. Plus it allows me to do some space plane flying from now and then. But I rarely have more than two of these spawn at the same time, sometime three. You can always bring some orbit tourists in the remaining seats, though.\n\nIf I had a complain, that would more be regarding the un-randomness of the kerbal class. Everybody seems to be getting different, yet fairly imbalanced distributions. I\u0027m quite low on engineer (5 out of 50), which isn\u0027t good for the end game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T12:02:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain H@dock**"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T11:29:31Z","Content":"Once you know how useful they are - you\u0027ll want to increase the frequency.\n\nThen once you have too many kerbals - you\u0027ll want to decrease the frequency again.\n\nWell since you can reject for free, just use rejection to adjust the frequency, then."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T11:39:33Z","Content":"Hiring is expensive.

(asteroids, satellites, science, surveys, part tests, tourism, outpost/station constructions, flag planting, progression, grand tours, and yes, the discussed rescue and recovery type).\n\nYou can also see this in the in-game debug screen (Alt-F12 on PC), on the Contracts tab, under the button \u0027Add\u0027. Every line you see there is a different class/type of contracts, that correspond to the list mentioned above (in stock, cause mods can modify this)."},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T20:37:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, swjr-swis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E the game does actually have classes or types of contracts\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027re missing my point.
