The insertion burn will vary depending on your approach, but can also be as low as ~550. Ike, it\u0027s moon, is also *really* easy to get to. You can (Relatively) easily land on either Duna or Ike and take off again. The biggest downside to Duna is that it\u0027s optimal transfer windows are pretty far apart.

On the other hand, Eve has a big sphere of influence but as its atmosphere is really dense, your probe might explode without warning when you enter the atmosphere.\n\nIf you want to land your probe, then Eve because if you survive reentry, chutes will be enough to slow down your craft for it to land safely (it has higher gravity than Kerbin so be careful still) whereas Duna\u0027s atmosphere is not dense enough and you\u0027ll need to brake using rockets before landing.\n\nFinally, if you desire to get back from your mission, then you don\u0027t want to go anywhere near Eve unless you\u0027re very well prepared with a lander designed specifically for the purpose: the atmosphere is very dense (so lots of drag in low atmosphere), gravity is high (so more dV needed) and Isp asl is simply non-existent for most engines.

Both Duna and Eve are very easy to get to, and easy to land on.\n\nThe two main gotchas for Eve:\n\n- It\u0027s *incredibly difficult* to take off from. It\u0027s by far the most difficult body in the game to return from after landing-- it\u0027s pretty clear that the designers did it that way deliberately, to offer players an extreme challenge. So if you\u0027re sending a manned mission and want your kerbals to come back, Eve should be your final challenge, not your first.\n\n- If you\u0027re just landing an unmanned probe, Eve is easy to land on. However, be aware that solar panels work surprisingly poorly there. They work great in Eve *orbit* (lots of sunlght), but provide very small amounts of power from the surface (something about the temperature and/or thick atmosphere renders them less effective). So if you\u0027re sending an unmanned lander, give it plenty of batteries, and expect to need more panels than you\u0027d think."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T13:41:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The biggest downside to Duna is that it\u0027s optimal transfer windows are pretty far apart.

On the other hand, Eve is not that harder, and it\u0027s system will generally give you more science. \n\nIf it is going for orbit, well: up until 1.0, Eve was the undisputed winner because of its thick atmoshpere, while now Duna is the undisputed winner- for the exact same reason. It seems that hitting Eve\u0027s atmosphere at interplanetary speeds is a guarantee that your craft will implode in a fraction of a second. Most likely will be changed soon, but until then aerocapture is impossible - but aerobraking can still save you some Dv after initial capture. \n\nFor atmospheric operations and landing, Eve is generally better ; again, if you don\u0027t burn up, you need a miniscule amount of parachutes. However, even if Duna is almost impossible to land on by parachutes, powered landimgs are as easy as on \\*almost\\* any airless body (I\u0027m looking at you, Tylo), so it is also a good solution. \n\nNow, if you\u0027re a beginner and want a manned mission that will return home, you can simply remove Eve from your brain with a sledgehammer for now.

It\u0027s close to Kerbin so the dV required to go there is small, you can aerocapture at will without fear of reentry heat, so need minimal dV for simple maneuvers within the system. The dV to land and take off again is also small, and you can reduce landing dV even more by using parachutes. It\u0027s quite possible to build a non-airbreathing airplane to fly all over the place but it\u0027s also quite good rover country. Then it\u0027s easy to get back to Kerbin and you arrive slow enough that you can aerocapture there, too (provided you have a heat shield and air brakes). Oh, and while you\u0027re at Duna, you can easily go see Ike, too.\n\nEve, OTOH, is a total pain. Without WAY more heatshield-building effort than it\u0027s worth (or turning down reentry heat to about 20%), aerocapture at Eve is out of the question so you\u0027ll need about 1500-1800m/s to stop there in a low circular orbit. Landing from there is quite difficult due to the intense reentry heat (shields and airbrakes and maybe even retroburning are required) before you get low and slow enough to use parachutes. Once down, don\u0027t expect to get back up again without a HUGE rocket specially designed for that task, so most folks just send 1-way probe landers. Gilly is so small that it\u0027s difficult to hit and operations there are a total annoyance because everything happens practically in real time.

Relatively easy to intercept and comes around for a transfer window with good frequency. Atmosphere is safe for capture even in 1.0.4, reducing dV requirements.

Ike is close to Duna and easy to encounter, orbit, land and return. \n\nEve/Gilly, on the other hand, is nothing but trouble. Very easy to intercept and encounter from Kerbin, but there the trouble begins. The atmosphere is positively deadly at entry/escape velocity and yet does not slow a ship down enough to make a difference--you will have to burn engines to capture. Even if descending at incredibly shallow angle from a 90x90 orbit, parts are going to heat up and likely explode. Once you\u0027re on the surface....well, that\u0027s pretty much where you\u0027re going to stay unless you brought a LOT of dV along. And as for Gilly, that little rock is completely annoying. Crazy elliptical and inclined orbit plus low gravity makes it very difficult and expensive to find from Eve orbit. You might think that its low gravity makes it a nice place to visit, but it also means that it takes forever to get down and up--especially since you will be restricted to 1x time warp under 8000m.\n\nFor my longer (and highly dramatized) opinions on these two systems, click on the links in my signature ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T16:07:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuzzter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T17:12:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But what\u0027s the point?
