For my particular scenario, I have a stack separator that is in the wrong stage, but has not been decoupled in the save yet. I couldn\u0027t make sense of the save file, so I figured I\u0027d post to see if it was even possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-02T00:59:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2014 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Git\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T00:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can do this in the save file although I would imagine it can be quite a pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s a mod out there for this, but I might be confusing it with the action group mod.
