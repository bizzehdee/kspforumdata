Look at the total EC drain on all the engines combined, use that to determine what the longest possible burn time is. How big are the burns you are planning compared to that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA single tiny solar panel can mostly charge up huge batterbanks on a probe since you generally timewarp days/months with it until the next burn. It is best to compare those by mass, because many solar panels will be able to extend your charge during the burn. Find the sweet spot between amount of batteries vs solar panels to get the job done\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
