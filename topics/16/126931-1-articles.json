I\u0027m trying to look at gravity assists. One homework problem in my physics class was the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA satellite (with mass negligible compared to that of the Earth) is making a fly-by of the Earth on a hyperbolic orbit. Let the velocity of the Earth be v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E. The satellite originally approaches from the negative x-direction, does a loop around the earth, and then flies off in the same direction it came from. Far from the Earth, the magnitude of the satellite\u0027s x-component of velocity is v\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E when approaching and v\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E when receding. For the case where v\u003Csub\u003Ei\u003C/sub\u003E=4v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E, what is the final speed v\u003Csub\u003Ef\u003C/sub\u003E of the satellite in terms of the speed of the earth v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for the class, the answer was 2v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E. Simple enough. I wanted to visualize this in KSP. The first thing I did was I switched the wording from \u0022earth\u0022 to \u0022mun\u0022 - don\u0027t want to deal with any annoying atmospheric effects. Then I did a bunch of math to get the following HyperEdit parameters:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInclination: 0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEccentricity: 15.292\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSemi-major axis: -855000\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLon. of asc. node: 344.657\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArgument of periapsis: 216.221\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMean anomaly at epoch: -9.705\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpoch: 36643.375\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese numbers should put you in a gravity assist with mun at around 9,000 m closest approach. The velocity of the mun is 542 m/s. Thus, to fit with the problem\u0027s value of 4 times the velocity of the body, we want to be going around 2168 m/s. Time warping until just before mun capture confirms this number. Once we\u0027re into the mun\u0027s SOI, we have a velocity of 1625. Once we escape the mun, we\u0027re going 1625 relative to the mun - to be expected. Once we get back out to Kerbin\u0027s SOI, we expect our velocity to be 2*542, or 1084 m/s. But we look and we\u0027re at 2165. This gravity assist only took off 3 m/s from our velocity. Nothing, really. Why is this? I think it lies in the fact that I\u0027m not fulfilling the \u0022does a loop around the [mun]\u0022 that existed in the original problem. But how could I possibly make it do a loop? It seems like my speed is too high to really be affected. Can anyone explain where I\u0027m going wrong here? If there are any true saints around here, it would be excellent to get a modified set of orbital parameters, but if not, that\u0027s fine, I can do it myself. I just need to have a nudge in the right direction to understand what\u0027s wrong with my maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T15:13:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake the velocity after you get into the SOI of the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe larger this velocity is, the less the gravity of the Mun will bend your flightpath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to do \u0022a loop around the [mun]\u0022 (which I interpret as leaving the Mun\u0027s SOI in the opposite direction of entering it) you should have a minimal velocity (near to 0 after entering the Mun\u0027s SOI.

If it says you will leave going back the way you came after the flyby, I read that as saying the planet will turn your path exactly 180 degrees. There is only 1 type of path that will turn you exactly 180 degrees, and that is a parabola. With a parabola your v infinity is always exactly zero. Therefore the ship will end with the exact same velocity it had before the flyby, which is zero relative to the planet! Now I see the contradictory word \u0022hyperbolic\u0022 up there, which would mean the departure velocity vector would not be exactly 180 degrees from the entry vector, but if our entry speed was, say, 1 m/s then we would end going, say, 179.9 degrees from the start direction at almost 2m/s. Now, as Snark pints out, if we keep increasing the entry speed until it equals 4 times Earth\u0027s velocity around the Sun (where in the galaxy did it come from?)\u00A0 then the ship will have a v infinity relative to Earth of about 120000m/s and it will turn nowhere near 180 degrees. I think with a lowest possible flyby of 200km (avoid the air!) the ship would be turned about 0.5 degrees. In that case your final velocity would go from 4VE before the flyby to 4VE\u00A0 after, in pretty much the same direction, with a little extra either towards the Sun (if you flew by outside Earth) or away from it (if you flew by inside Earth\u0027s orbit). The test maker should have postulated an Earth-mass black hole as the object to be flown by. A flyby altitude of about 2 meters above a 1-cm Earth-mass black hole from a V-infinity of 120km/s would turn you 179 degrees.
