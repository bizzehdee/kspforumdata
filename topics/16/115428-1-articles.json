Here\u0027s a screenshot to describe it better : ![lf5wp09h7](http://postimg.org/image/lf5wp09h7/)\n\nAs you can see, there are 2 ships : one\u0027s mine, and the other is from a mission ( Gregdour ). The problem is that we both spin along eachother, so we\u0027ll never \u0027regardevouz\u0027 as it should. I tried burning in all the axes directions, from up and down to the mid-left and left and mid-right and up-left etc. It will reduce the relative speed ( 4123 m/s ), but it will break my orbit.\n\nSo how do i do it ?

(makes sense right ?)\n\nTo slow down, you need to go in a higher orbit, because higher orbit=\u003Eslower orbit. To go higher you have to burn prograde, wich is the green marker (not the crossed one, the other). Make sure your orbit is circular and just a bit above the target\u0027s. It will then catch up !\n\nTo go faster and catch up, do the exact opposite.\n\nTimewarp until the ships are very close and then execute the inversed procedure to bring back your orbit to normal. Here you go !\n\ndon\u0027t be afraid of terms like prograde, retrograde, normal, radial... it\u0027s fairly easy to remember, it will get you good grades in physics (it did for me) and it\u0027s the first step towards becoming a badS KSP master"},{"CreatedByName":"SoWeMeetAgain","CreatedById":145256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T23:30:21Z","Content":"did you do the rendezvous tutorial? try recreating it\u0027s starting situation ... as said, do an orbit that is slightly bigger or slightly smaller. then just follow what you learn in the tutorial"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T23:34:47Z","Content":"First picture is broken.\n\nSecond, those terms are common jargon, refusing to learn them is really crippling yourself.\n\nYou have matched orbit, that is a good first step. Now you need an intercept. Unless you are already close enough for direct burns to be useful (5 km or lower) you need to use orbital mechanics to get closer. Orbital mechanics are a little counter intuitive for a neophyte.\n\nIs your target ahead of you? You need to slow down. Slowing down will lower your Pe (low point of orbit). You will now actually go faster at that Pe than before (more than you slowed down) and reach the same point in your orbit sooner (your orbital period is shorter)!\n\nIs your target behind of you? You need to speed up. Accelerating will raise your Ap (high point of orbit). You will now actually go slower at that Ap than before (more than you speed up) and reach the same point in your orbit later (your orbital period is longer)!\n\nBoth scenarios will bring your closest distance markers (the pair of orange or pink arrows on your orbit in the map) closer until you overshoot. If you overshoot, just follow the opposing advice but ease up a little bit. The more you change the orbit, the more you close/open distance.\n\nI can\u0027t stress how important it is to learn the jargon. Once you start understanding the concepts you can do really fun stuff. For example, I never need to match orbits before rendezvous. From any orbit, I can crash my ship into another with just two burns in one orbit! With a third, I can rendezvous instead of crash. I\u0027m thinking in terms of prograde and normal vectors for these manuvers."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T01:01:00Z","Content":"If two things are in the same orbit they\u0027ll be going at the same average speed so will not get closer.

If you\u0027re at a low periapsis of a long orbit. moving very fast, then the encounter must be very accurate. If you\u0027\u0027re at the outskirts of Kerbin SOI, 50km is still fine - all depends on your speed. \n\n- burn towards Target marker on the navball, get some 10m/s, maybe less.\n\n- USE RCS CONTROLS to chase the prograde marker into the middle of the target marker. J,K,L,I - see how pressing them affects the prograde marker, then make it move right into the target marker.
