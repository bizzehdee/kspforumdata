I burned hard retrograde and then did a straight down landing from about 40km, which all in all is quite demanding on the fuel supply (ie inefficient).

Keep an eye on your navball, get your retrograde marker to the middle of the blue on the navball (so you\u0027re heading straight down) then just keep an eye on your descent rate. You can use RCS to translate and kill your horizontal speed using IJKL keys in staging mode, but for the most part of your descent just tilt the lander in the same direction your retrograde marker veers off to until it\u0027s back to middle. Try to land with less than 5 m/s speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a decoupler below your pod to drop everything else before deploying your parachute. The ASAS ring is weak enough to actually detatch everything when your chute deploys, but I wouldn\u0027t take the risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re carrying way too much RCS fuel. You can drop the large tank, the small radial tanks are more than enough for course corrections and landing help. Pod torque is enough to turn so you don\u0027t really even need RCS unless you\u0027re docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need that many batteries either, I didn\u0027t see any power source but you could stick on a RTG or solar panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that you could downgrade the fueltank to a X200-16 if you swap the engines for a poodle, while removing the large RCS tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T16:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E480 thrust is PLENTY for a Mun landing, even though that lander is bigger than it needs to be for the job. It is top-heavy as well, what with the big RCS tank sitting up high. But you should still be able to land it by simply shedding more of your horizontal speed while landing. Either brake harder high up, or point your nose below the retrograde marker on your approach burn, which will increase the fraction of thrust being applied against your horizontal speed. But just as a suggestion, a low, wide lander will be much more stable and resistant to flipping.
