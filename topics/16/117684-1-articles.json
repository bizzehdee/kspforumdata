Mostly, I used radial parts like rocket engines and fuel tanks. Science equipment is just placed somewhere on the final stage.\n\nNow I\u0027m working on a Minmus base.\n\nI already have a skycrane out there. Consists of lots of structural parts like panels and stuff.\n\nI\u0027m also workin on a rover to move the segments of my station around.\n\nAnd the station itself, containing habitats and towers spiked with solar panels.\n\nWell, I have problems to get this bulky stuff into orbit.\n\nFor the skycrane, I took a big lifting stage from my Duna mission.\n\nI removed the lander and put my skycrane atop.\n\nIt worked, but I had lots of troubles flying this craft.\n\nI got wobbling, and my craft turned around (roll-axis) without any reasons. Also, my craft tipped over, a problem I had during my first munar missions for the last time.\n\nWell, I finally got it up there, with no fuel left (although my skycrane is smaller in weiht than my Duna lander).\n\nI guess this is due to the really bad aerodynamical behaviour of my skycrane.\n\nAnd I guess I will have this problem with my rovers, station segments...\n\nSo, I need a solution to get this stuff up there.\n\nI relly googled alot, and it seems there are no stock cargo parts for rockets.\n\nOk, for spaceplanes there are MK3 cargo bays.\n\nBut I have no experince using planes, and my tech tree is not yet finished (in fact, I don\u0027t even have the 45 points aerodynamic parts).\n\nI know there are fairings and cargo parts for rockets in some mods, but I would like to only use stock parts.\n\nSo, what is your best practise with bulky stuff and rockets?\n\nHow do you transport stuff like skycranes, big fuel rovers...?\n\nGreetings,\n\nlugge"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:54:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, what is your best practise with bulky stuff and rockets?\n\u003E How do you transport stuff like skycranes, big fuel rovers...?\n\nUsually I put these components into stock fairings at the top of the rocket\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Fairings](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Fairings)\n\nThe are however a bit higher in the tech-tree.\n\nFor larger components strutting helps against wobbling.\n\nEdit: For rockets that have a high drag at the top, it also helps to add [wings](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Irregular_wings) or [control surfaces](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Control_surfaces) at the bottom of the rocket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T09:13:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mhoram**"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T09:34:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E Ok, for spaceplanes there are MK3 cargo bays.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\n The Mk3 cargo bays can be used on rockets too."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T10:06:48Z","Content":"There are fairings for rockets in stock too. They help against drag and overheating but not against wobbling unless you strut the cargo to them. Which requires a trick: you can\u0027t draw a strut from the cargo to a fairing but you can draw it to an element outside the fairing - Kickback SRBs make good dummy parts to draw the struts to. And if it encounters a fairing along the way, it attaches to the fairing instead of the dummy outside part.\n\nAnother solution is \u0022some assembly required\u0022 - launch the craft in a few parts forming a tube, maybe with cargo bays, and then move them around and attach to docking ports in orbit.\n\nFor example this is my nuclear tug on the launchpad (and this could have been easily split into two much more lightweight launches - one with the tug and engines, and one with the cargo bay with the drone and accessories; and not carry full fuel tanks but refuel in orbit too),\n\n![GeucsqZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GeucsqZ.jpg)\n\nAnd this is the same, assembled.\n\n![m18xs1X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m18xs1X.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"lugge","CreatedById":143343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T10:20:59Z","Content":"Hello all,\n\nthanks for your supply.\n\nSharpy, thanks for your pcitures, too, but I\u0027d like to see some of your fairings crafts instead :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T11:36:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello all,\n\u003E thanks for your supply.\n\u003E \n\u003E Sharpy, thanks for your pcitures, too, but I\u0027d like to see some of your fairings crafts instead :-)\n\nThere\u0027s a short intro to Fairings here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKqOZl7xwBo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIf that\u0027s what you were asking for?"},{"CreatedByName":"mrclucks","CreatedById":139561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:02:31Z","Content":"When I launch something huge I\u0027ll have a more efficient stage directly underneath which is usually for completing orbit or transferring and then build bigger stages on the side(usually in big enough that it will cover the payload as well) and have them feed fuel into the underneath stage.

The only way to get this into orbit is to stay under 300 m/s and pointed almost straight up until about 25,000 meters. 30,000 is better. If you go too fast, or attempt a gravity turn too low it will immediately tumble and explode (pretty impressive explosions, I might add.... lol)\n\nSecond issue is after 1.0.4 came out the bottom stages wanted to overheat and explode, even at 1/2 throttle. Adding radiators helped, but I can tell they\u0027re still right on the verge of blowing when I stage them.\n\nLastly, this skycrane will only get a station or base into low Kerbin orbit, no further. Continuing onto the Mun or wherever will require refueling first."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:57:33Z","Content":"Fairings are only good for moderately sized payloads - they do have their size limits too after all. For larger assemblies you must work with their natural structure - see the hulls that can be integrated into rockets, make multi-rocket launch vehicles. \n\nThis is a H-shaped lifter I made. It\u0027s for lifting/landing payloads on the Mun. Landing legs, H-shape, the payload goes under the klaw in the middle. I integrated the two \u0022bars\u0022 into the rockets, and launched it in upside-down position, with two fuel tanks/nosecones to save the worst of drag, and to keep 2.5m parts stacked tightly.\n\n![2015-07-31_00007.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00007.jpg)\n\nAnd these are two fuel trucks. I bit the bullet of the air drag by using a launch stage meant for 50% heavier payloads and only filling them with fuel halfway. The setup was too large for any fairing, even the largest, and even if it did fit, a fairing so wide would create more drag than all the exposed parts you see - it\u0027s not a cure-all solution, it has mass and drag too and sometimes these are worse than what you\u0027d get with exposed payload.\n\n I removed the engines by landing on the Mun at 10m/s sharp, engine down. \n\n![2015-07-31_00004.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00004.jpg)\n\nAlright, here\u0027s something like you requested. This payload actually is \u0022smooth\u0022 enough that it doesn\u0027t need a fairing. The parts introduce very little drag and the fairing\u0027s mass doesn\u0027t outweigh the occlusion benefit. But it\u0027s added for a very important reason.\n\nYou see, fairings are very stiff. Like, infinitely stiff. The payload may wobble all the way out of the fairing clipping through it and breaking off, but the fairing remains perfectly vertical. That makes them awesome structural elements, especialy considering they are relatively light, can be easily discarded when no longer needed and provide the occlusion benefits.\n\nIn this screenshot you see the setup for strutting the payload to the fairings. The girders and the Kickbacks will be removed in a moment as the cargo is already firmly strutted. See the batteries just below the klaws - the struts on the right of the right battery and on the left of the left battery go to the fairing. They were made by attaching them first to the craft, and then *attempting* to attach them to the Kickbacks - since there was the fairing in the way, they attached to the fairing instead. Instead of three wobbly towers I have one firm fairling and the three pieces of payload nicely attached to it.\n\nYou can similarly strut things to the fairing on the outside, drawing struts to the payload, though it\u0027s a little trickier. See below.\n\n![2015-07-07_00021.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00021.jpg)\n\nThis setup is not optimal as the kickbacks go a little too close to the fairing - they should be angled away. The trick is not to hover the cursor anywhere close to the fairing when \u0022attaching\u0022 the ends of the struts to the Kickbacks. The fairing animation extends it as you hover over it - and unfortunately that\u0027s not just an animation. The struts would attach not to the fairing in its standard state but to the animated segments floating outside. So move that cursor away and let the fairing \u0022settle\u0022 before attaching the ends of the struts. (actually, as you watch the left strut, they are angled sharply upwards - that\u0027s because I was \u0022attaching\u0022 them to the upper ends of the Kickbacks, far enough from the fairing that it wouldn\u0027t expand.\n\n(and in the end launch, strutting, fairing, all worked alright and the payload exploded into million pieces when detached, because the SavingKlaws were placed too close together, clipped into each other and disasembled explosively once they became separate crafts).\n\nOne more thing that took me a while when building a fairing. The writing changes color.\n\nOrange means disallowed, the fairing is clipping some parts.\n\nGreen means allowed, go ahead and click.\n\nCyan means closing the fairing is allowed - it\u0027s either coming to a tip, or closed around a regular round element.\n\nGrey means calculations in progress. Don\u0027t move the mouse, wait a second or two, and it will turn orange, green or cyan.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T14:02:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 02:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T16:35:39Z","Content":"If you don\u0027t mind some clipping, the TT-70 \u0022Strutty\u0022 radial decoupler will attach to suitable cargo inside the fairings while the radial attachment point remains on the outside, the fairing wall has to be between the cargo wall and the radial attachment part. You can radial decouple and blow the fairing without worry.\n\nAlso extend the tip of the fairing to a pointy end instead of closing it as soon as possible. It adds some mass but greatly reduces drag and allows more optimal ascents - savings of 300-500m/s deltaV for big payloads can make a big difference to how large the first few stages are! And after pointing it in the right direction very early on and get some good speed, the long needle-like fairing naturally steers itself into a gravity turn.\n\nWhile not super large, to give an idea of how effective fairings can be, the ship below ends up in LKO with 3250m/s deltaV.\n\n![96VSApV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/96VSApV.jpg)\n\n Remember to blow the fairing as early as possible to reduce weight - anywhere from 23-43 km depending on how fast the rocket is going and how \u0027draggy\u0027 the payload. \n\nThe **proper Kerbal way is to add MOAR boosters,** especially if one hasn\u0027t unlocked the largest fairing in career!![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Having thrusters with gimbals attached as laterally as possible and/or a really strong central gimbal thruster can save some grief. Tail fins at the end of boosters and reaction wheels at the top of the payload help alot too.\n\nNote the sideways build to give stability - as it gets higher and faster after launch, the used boosters get dropped and drag is reduced.\n\n![oaXxoK2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/oaXxoK2.jpg)\n\nDefinitely MOAR boosters (4 types of engines, 1 solid fuel booster) and tail fins, radial boosters used and dropped heaviest to lightest.\n\n![dbBPD4K.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dbBPD4K.jpg)\n\nDrag coef at 95\u0027ish isn\u0027t too bad but the first rocket is only 4.5...have to get that largest fairing in career mode.\n\n![lEF1eMi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lEF1eMi.jpg)\n\n110tons on the Mun, hopping from biome to biome collecting science while drilling for ore to refuel - capable of getting to Minumus after that too. (and Duna with a slightly different design) Lands on its tail then gently tips forward with the help of RCS and the Thud rockets to slow the fall to horizontal. Launching is the reverse with the Thuds angling it up for lift-off. \n\nPerhaps some creative skycrane decoupling \u002B vertical to horizontal engineering for your permanent structures?\n\n![w8Oj6aZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w8Oj6aZ.jpg)\n\n![7BCgtVA.png](http://i.imgur.com/7BCgtVA.png)"}]}
