The idea being I could use the engines to slowly lower the ship down through Kerbil\u0027s atmosphere. Once I am down below say 6,000, eject the fuel tank, engines and landing structs and open the parachute. (A heat shield adds too much weight)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA third idea I am toying with is to use the Mk1 Command Pod with a RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit on top. That drops the weight by about 3 tons, which, hopefully, makes the ship easier to handle. The idea is to use the RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit to land on Mun, and put Valentina in the MK1 pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you attach stuff on top on a parachute? Ultimately if you can, I could add a parachute to the top of the MK1 pod with a decoupler and the RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit on top of the parachute. With a heat shield on the bottom of the MK1 pod, returning to Kerbil is rival.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe I can add the heat shield to the bottom of the MK1 pod and the parachute to the top of the\u00A0RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T15:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have Win10, but if you go Control Panel, check out the Ease Of Access Center...
