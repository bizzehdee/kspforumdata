I know, F5 it, but that\u0027s something I don\u0027t keep up with as I\u0027m playing. When something bad happens, by the time I figure it out and go back to the persistent file, it has all ready updated the game to after the bad thing happened. Is there an adjustment to change how often the persistent file updates? If it\u0027s updating every 1 minute..\u00A0 can it be changed to every 5 minutes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFYI, this is Linux v1.4.5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-12T19:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2019 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Dan Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-12T19:37:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Gameplay Questions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s adjustable in game, but there are incremental backup saves in the \u0022Backup\u0022 folder inside your save\u0027s folder.\u00A0 And you can adjust how many of those there are.\u00A0 So if your game really is saving every minute, and you set that to 60, you would have at least an hour\u0027s worth of saves to go back to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter checking the settings.cfg file, looks like you may be able to change both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 300\u003Cbr\u003E\nAUTOSAVE_SHORT_INTERVAL = 30\u003Cbr\u003E\nSAVE_BACKUPS = 5\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dan Kerman","CreatedById":193616,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-12T20:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome!
