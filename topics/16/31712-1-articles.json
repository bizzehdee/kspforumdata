The radial decouplers are too weak, and struts does not help (not even lots of them, intelligently placed (I\u0027m an engineer, so I know hot to place struts...)). if I use several radial decouplers to hold the stacks together, it behaves as if only one of them actually couples. If I build it high, the joints between tanks wobble until they fall apart, even with strut reenforcements. I\u0027ve tried using beams to make it more solid, but it doesn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my tries has been with stacks of two orange tanks, usually with two \u0022circles\u0022, an inner circle with 6 stacks and an outer with 12. Engines has been either mainsails or a combination of mainsails (for T/W ratio) and tricouplers with aerospikes (for Delta V, when T/W ratio is sufficient). Asparagus staging is used, but they seldom have time to stage before falling apart. Typical take-off weight is around 1500-2000 tons. My old lifter is similar, but with one orange tank stacks, and it works, if one is careful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve rebuilt various configurations over and over, from the start, so there is no standing oversight/messup in the construction. What am I missing? Some of the constructions, which are about as solid as I can make them with stock parts, fall apart even before the clamps are released, and most fall apart before even reaching 1000 m. This is starting to seriously frustrate me, I\u0027ve had about 20 failed launches (but no kerbal lost).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it simply that stock parts are too weak to build vessels of that size?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, hints?
