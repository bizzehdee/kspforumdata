I use Steam, so I\u0027m not sure exactly how the KSP website option works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the update, you will be able to load your old game, and KSP will update it to 0.24. As you\u0027re playing in career mode, the game will load it in the new career mode, including funds and reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would prefer to continue without funds and rep, just with science as in your current save, you can follow the steps \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86622-How-to-import-a-0-23-5-Career-save-into-0-24-Science-Mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E to convert the save into a Science\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E mode save instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the update won\u0027t affect your save files, if you want to back them up anyway (which isn\u0027t a bad idea), you need to copy the files and folders from C:\\{Your KSP Folder}\\saves\\{Your save}\\ to a safe location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat folder contains the persistent.sfs file (the most current state of your game world), and any quicksave files (also *.sfs) that you may have created. It also has two subfolders, Ships and Subassemblies, which hold your saved ships and subassemblies (fairly self-explanatory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T00:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWOOT!
