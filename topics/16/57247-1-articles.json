Some people have posted the resulting map, but it\u0027s not as useful as you\u0027d think as it\u0027s not really color coded, it just looks like it might be. You have to mouse over each of the areas in game for it to tell you what the biome actually is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T06:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I\u0027m going to apologize in advance for the eye-bursting colors, the incomplete status, and any errors, this is me manually filling in between the lines on a map.
