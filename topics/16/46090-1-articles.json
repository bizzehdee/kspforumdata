I can get to mun and minmus easily but with mechjeb I literally cannot get to another planet. It keeps saying the next node is like 220 days and shows no intercept, What am I doing wrong? Then my next question is how to dock? I have the first part of my Kerbal Space Station up (KSS#1) but I don\u0027t know how to begin even docking the second part. Then my last question is rovers; How would I deploy a rover to the surface of a moon or planet?

Folks use it Mechjeb or no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat didn\u0027t quite address your question though, did it? Basically, if you finish your transfer burn and don\u0027t get an intercept, you\u0027ll have to plan for a correction burn. I usually put mine about halfway between Kerbin and the target. Just fiddle with the node until you get an intercept; the earlier you correct the less delta-V you spend, and be ready to pull radial burns if absolutely necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond one: how to dock. That question gets asked at least once a day around the forums. Sarcastic answer is \u0022very carefully\u0022, but of course, that\u0027s not helpful.

Be prepared to start braking early if you\u0027ve got a heavy ship or if you\u0027re strictly on RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne you\u0027ve zeroed, aim at the pink meatball icon on the nav ball and slowly thrust ahead (to about 1 m/s tops).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt fifty meters, zero out your velocity, adjust your aim and thrust ahead (no more than 0.5 m/s at that point). Within 100 meters you need to have the specific docking port you\u0027re aiming at targeted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt twenty meters, zero out your velocity, adjust your aim and turn on SAS. Switch to the target, aim its docking port towards the first craft (target it and set your control point as the docking port first). Switch back to the first ship and thrust ahead slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt ten meters, zero out and adjust your aim one more time. Turn both craft if necessary. Thrust ahead with the first ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not spot on, your two craft may dance about a bit as they come into contact. That\u0027s normal - do nothing and just let them settle on their own. When the view shifts, you\u0027re docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird one: Again, this is a topic that gets asked fairly frequently and there are varying schools of thought. I\u0027ll have to hunt for pics of how I\u0027ve done it...right now I\u0027ll post so I don\u0027t get ninja\u0027d...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkycranes are fairly common, though - basically it\u0027s just a lander module that carries your rover underneath or on the sides, it has enough delta-v to get the rover close enough to the target\u0027s surface to drop them or land; if it drops them, it usually crashes before making orbit again. Slapping them on the sides of a lander works too. Usually it\u0027s a good idea to bring at least two rovers to keep the load balanced. Or, if you\u0027ve got a single rover that is itself large/unbalanced, be sure to add a counterweight somewhere on the skycrane - my first Hellhound 7 skycrane utilized a counterweight, the second one just packed two rovers and has proven to be much easier to fly. I think I\u0027ve got pics of that but imgur\u0027s being fussy this morning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck; if you have more questions, ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T14:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T14:01:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. make sure mechjeb has auto-warp enabled. 220 days is a normal time for a good window\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. watch videos on youtube for orbital rendesvous and docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. you can use a skycrane or attach parachutes to your rover\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T14:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to get some nice rovers on your craft is to use the sub assembly manager from the spaceport. It lets you build a rover and then save it. Once you start the main ship you can load the sub assembly and stick it on. I started with a small girder as the principal part as the principal part HAS to have a free node to attach it to anything. Then I made a little rover and shoved it onto the side of my fat lander.

Add some delta v until the projection gets close to the orbit of the planet you want and then move it around and tweak the delta v until you get an encounter. Watch for the little nods moving round, one should say closest approach and target position at closest approach. Get them to intersect and hey presto, badda boom, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking requires RCS fuel and thrusters. Place the thrusters so they point left/right, up/down and forward/backward. When you get close engage RCS and drift in. To orientate yourself don\u0027t be afraid to turn off the RCS and use the SAS to spin round and then back to the RCS for the gentle push together of the docking ports. Make sure they\u0027re the right way round as well. Easy to get them backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, experiment and practice.
