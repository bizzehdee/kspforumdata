My question is since its just a file size reducer, does that mean there is no way to \u0027uninstall\u0027 it? Even if you uninstall it the files should remain compressed right? So do you have to have a fresh install of KSP and your mods to undo it, or does unchecking the box and following the uninstall process through CKAN do the job? (I use CKAN for every mod)\n\nAny help would be appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:53:26Z","Content":"No, you can delete it just fine. Delete the ActiveTextureManagement folder from your GameData folder. ATM caches the compressed textures in a subdirectory of its folder -- it never touches Squad\u0027s textures. You don\u0027t have to reinstall KSP either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T04:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lincourtl**"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T03:59:00Z","Content":"ATM is Active Texture Management, keyword is active. The plug in resizes the textures in memory as KSP is loading. It doesn\u0027t alter the source files. So if you remove ATM, the next time you start up KSP will just load from source files like normal.
