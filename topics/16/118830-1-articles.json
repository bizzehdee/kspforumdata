I thought I\u0027d play the training missions as a refresher and now I am having big troubles with \u0022To the Mun, Part 2\u0022. In this tutorial you actually have to get back from the Mun. I\u0027ve tried searching on the forums, google, youtube, but the advice there just doesn\u0027t seem to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the tutorial is easy enough. I can get my craft in a circular orbit below 300km around Kerbin, with enough fuel left to get to the surface. Problem is getting there in one piece. I enter the atmosphere with just the capsule and a parachute at between 2,000 and 2,400 m/s. When I have lost enough speed to deploy my parachute (approx 250m/s), I am between 6,000m and 8,000m above the surface. The parachute fully opens around 500m, but doesn\u0027t slow me down enough and I crash hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea what I am doing wrong? I didn\u0027t use to have this problem before, and I even see the exact same scenario in youtube movies where they land without problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T08:53:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mumman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T14:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParachutes take longer to fully deploy now and the default opening height is now 1000m.
