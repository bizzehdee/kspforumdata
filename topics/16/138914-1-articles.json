The combination of these two things makes Moho have a very small sphere of influence, and on top of that KSP likes to just not tell you how close you are to an actual encounter when your orbit isn\u0027t close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple things you can do:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop a maneuver at your apoapsis, right click on it to switch modes, then move it forward one orbit at a time. If your periapsis is close enough to Moho\u0027s orbit it should eventually give you a marker telling how close you\u0027ll get, but this could take a long time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake sure you perform your ejection burn from Kerbin at an appropriate transfer window (according to a transfer window calculator, such as \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E).

Set Moho as your target, and check where Ascending and Descending nodes are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Depending on which one is closer, set a maneuver node and match your inclination with Moho\u0027s orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. When both orbits are on the same plane, drag Retrograde marker until your orbit intersects the orbit of Moho. Not by much, mind you - the bigger the angle of intersection, the bigger relative velocity of encounter will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Click-grab the newly created node, and drag it slowly back and forth along the orbit until you get encounter with Moho. Aim for longest encounter possible. Short encounter means high relative velicity, and less time for braking burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouple of tips:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to get encounter near or at Moho\u0027s Apoapsis. The planet will move a bit slower there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPack plenty of dV and an engine with decent TWR. If TWR of your ship will be too low, you will zip past the Moho despite braking frantically all the way, and return to solar orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNERV\u0027s are your friends - but you the bigger your ship, the more engines you will need to have high enough TWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t wait with the start of braking burn to the last moment. Start burning retrograde immediately after entering the SoI, and then set a maneuver node at Pe. This will give you a bit more time inside the SoI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoho is a nasty, vicious son of a Kraken and it hates you with a burning passion.

This means that whatever you do, it\u0027ll be relatively expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, your AN doesn\u0027t look to be too far from Moho\u0027s Pe (the map doesn\u0027t actually tell you Moho\u0027s Pe relative to the sun, but you have to guessstimate). That means that if you burn right now - or ideally about an eighth of an orbit earlier than where you are - you should get an encounter at AN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a good encounter, however, will be necessarily slow and a touch compicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) simplest option: place a maneuvre node behind you (I\u0027d guess about halfway between your ship and DN) and pull retrograde until you get the target chevrons appearing on the orbit. Then drop a second node just after \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eyour ship\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u0027s position chevron which should be near AN. Then add a third node about where your ship is now. This third node is 2 orbits later than where you are. If the target chevrons are close, great. If not, add orbits to the third node until it they are relatively close. Then go back to the second node and add prograde/retrograde until you get an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) better option: it looks like you should be able to get an encounter within two orbits from here. Place a first node between AN and Pe. Leave it be for now. Place a second node between your ship and DN. Add retrograde on this until the target chevrons appear, then back up a bit until they disappear and add some anti-normal (not too much, you want this to be a small fraction of the total cost of the burn) until the target chevrons reappear; this should move AN a touch closer to Pe. Again, remove some of the retrograde until the chevrons just disappear, then drag the node around that part of the orbit until they appear again (the idea is to get the most efficient location for the burn in that area). If they are close, go back to the first node and add pro/retrograde; if they are far, right-click and add an orbit (or two) to the second node before going back to the first node. You should now have an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, to avoid great problems wth Moho, you should start off with a better approach:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nforget about launch windows - they are unlikely to give the best result\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nfor a cheap trip, launch when \u003Cu\u003Eopposite\u003C/u\u003E to the part of Moho\u0027s orbit which is \u003Cu\u003Eclosest\u003C/u\u003E to the sun.
