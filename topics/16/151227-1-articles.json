Yes, having \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E behind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is a problem... but you can have a plane with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E that is still really

title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 Basically, if your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is in the back of the plane, there\u0027s

solution will probably\u00A0 be some combination of the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMove your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E way far forward.\u00A0 (95% of the time, this is the issue, and solving this solves the whole problem.)\u00A0 You may need to reposition your engines-- often the engines are by far the heaviest part of an empty spaceplane, and putting them way back at the back causes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E issues.\u00A0 One configuration that often works well is to have the engines located amidships, side-mounted to the fuselage, like Skylon.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake sure you have control surfaces far away from (i.e. far in front or behind) the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe sure to disable everything on your vertical stabilizer except yaw, and make sure it\u0027s well positioned:\u00A0 as far, far aft as possible, and not sticking up too high above the plane\u0027s centerline.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nControl surfaces located in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E (e.g. canards) should be disabled for everything except pitch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nEasy way to test for stability:\u00A0 try taking off from the runway, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewith empty fuel tanks\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (you can turn on the infinite-fuel cheat) and then see whether it\u0027s flyable (including keeping stability during turns, pitch up/down, etc.).\u00A0 If you can fly the plane when the tanks are empty, then it should be fine for reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris-Barboris","CreatedById":133181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T22:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
