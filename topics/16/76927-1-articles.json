I\u0027ve managed to get kinda-sorta close (within a couple km, anyway) to a desired landing site on Mun or Minmus by the simple, if fuel-wasteful, expedient of killing ALL my orbital velocity when essentially directly over my desired landing site, plummeting for a while, then burning to remove the accumulated vertical velocity in order to accomplish a \u0022landing\u0022 rather than a \u0022new crater\u0022. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E But there has to be a more elegant (and fuel-efficient!) method than that.

As you start to land, you want the pink circle marker to be close to the retrograde marker during the last few steps in the descent. You can adjust it\u0027s position by putting the retrograde on the opposite side of the navball.

If you line your target up by way of inclination as mentioned by earlier posts then you should be coming \u0027close\u0027 already but because the map is way zoomed out it won\u0027t be exact. This is where you target. As you get close you want to push the pink marker just like how you push the retrograde marker to stop your lateral speed. In this case, don\u0027t be afraid to go back up a little. You want to push the pink marker near the top of the ball, but in this case it\u0027s not a big burn like slowing lateral movement, instead you want to get your arc headed that way a little past the target and wait for the lateral movement to bring you in close to where the pink marker is near the top of the ball and then finally kill the lateral movement using the way you already know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last note, you want the pink marker very close to the top of the nav ball... not on the very top like with retrograde (doing that would set you down right on top of the target)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-08T03:59:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2014 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blind Dead McJones","CreatedById":109600,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T03:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you said stock, but besides mechjeb you could also look into Kerbal Engineer Redux (gives you all sorts of information including speed, delta-V, apoapsis and periapsis...) and Scansat (make maps of the surface of a planet, which also shows you your orbital path and exactly where it ends).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for going all stock, remember that you want to start from a lower orbit, because stopping will take less DV.

Oftentimes this requires an inclination change, so try and get that sorted before you begin your landing. Next, pop into map mode and set up a maneuver for a retrograde burn about a quarter circumference before the target, such that your trajectory intersects the ground a few kilometers past the target zone. If there are any particularly tall mountains or ridges in the way, you may need to execute the burn later (and come down steeper) so you don\u0027t smash into them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, once you\u0027ve started your descent, the exact procedure depends on the TWR of your vehicle. A high-thrust craft can coast for longer and brake harder, whereas with a low-thrust craft you will need to manage your descent a little more carefully. Once you\u0027ve coasted down to about 6km or so (I\u0027m just basing these numbers off the Mun), you\u0027ll want to start braking and managing your vertical speed. Stay in map mode, and watch your trajectory as you brake. Ideally, your landing point should slowly approach your target. This is where I like to have a data readout plugin like Kerbal Engineer, so I can watch my vertical speed, horizontal speed, and radar altitude while still in map mode. Commonly you\u0027ll find that your landing point will shorten up too quickly and move uprange of the target; this means you\u0027re braking too hard and need to either ease up on the throttle or pitch up or both. You also might need to correct your trajectory to one side or the other if you find it drifting sideways. Continue to manage your trajectory in map mode until you\u0027re very near the target. At this point you should be within a few kilometers and closing at only a hundred or so m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor terminal descent and an eventual pinpoint landing, controlling vertical speed is the most important. As long as your initial descent was good, your horizontal speed should be low and steering towards the target should be relatively straightforward. It\u0027s better to come up a little short than to overshoot, as you can just ease back your descent rate and glide on down. It\u0027s really quite simple to park your lander right next to the target once you\u0027re close enough, it\u0027s just like flying over and landing on the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T16:55:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like lots of people have some good tips on targeted landings. MockKnizzle raised a good point about an inclination change often being needed to put you at your base. Normally I do that when I set up the node for the de-orbit burn. I also start from a lot higher. I keep a refueling depot in orbit around the Mun in a 100km orbit so that\u0027s usually the altitude I enter orbit of the Mun and the altitude I de-orbit from. I usually start about a quarter orbit before my base and don\u0027t touch the throttle till I get down to about 15km. Like the others I set my de-orbit to overshoot my target so I can use the retrograde marker to decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like to start my descent from too low an altitude since the Mun has a lot or hills and ridges and I don\u0027t like too much surface speed close to the ground. I\u0027ve flown into hillsides because I was moving too fast to get over them even at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of throttle, when flying manually I sometimes like to tweak my engine power down once I get close to the ground and have gotten rid of most of my velocity. A lower TWR lets you use more of your throttle range and gives you more precise control at low descent rates. (like for your final landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is only practical for single engine setups though since you\u0027d usually have to spend more time than you can spare tweaking a bunch of engines to the same settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally for the players reading this that don\u0027t mind using mods, There\u0027s 2 that will make landings a lot easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne is Diazo\u0027s vertical speed controller, the other is MechJeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor MechJeb you want to make a custom window. (they\u0027re real easy to make)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe info you want for landing is: True altitude, vertical speed, surface speed, time to impact, time to suicide burn, and remaining dV. The time to suicide burn is the most useful for me as it tells me when to start braking hard from my de-orbit trajectory. I usually start decelerating when it gets to 15 seconds and try to slowly work it down to about 5 seconds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get to about 500m on manual throttle you can use the vertical speed controller to manage your descent. This lets you concentrate on managing your horizontal speed for a precise landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a ship is fairly tall and I\u0027m landing it among buildings I also like to put a ring of linear RCS thrusters right at the top and use the IJKL keys to operate them. The reason I only use the top mounted RCS is that if your ship is drifting forward and you activate the forward RCS thruster it will kill some of your velocity. It will also cause the ship to pitch back a bit which also slows you. When you stop thrusting with the RCS MJ or the SAS will return the ship to vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got enough fuel to hover for a while this lets you place things exactly where you want them letting you make your base a nice tight cluster of buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-08T16:58:25Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2014 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kerba Fett\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T17:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/38IYZUizX3E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphobius","CreatedById":79391,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T17:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/38IYZUizX3E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s that?
