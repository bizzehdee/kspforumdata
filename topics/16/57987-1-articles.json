I put the z100 rechargeable batteries on my command module, to get more charge for my transmission of data, but it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything. How exactly do these work?

They\u0027ll give you an added amount of stored electricity (the amount depends on the number and type of battery) of which to use whenever the ship needs it. If you want to recharge these batteries you\u0027ll need either solar panels or a generator. Most engines will also charge the batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to determine how much battery power you have just either count the number of batteries and multiply that by how much each battery carries or just go to the launch pad and hover your mouse over the Resources tab. This\u0027ll show you how much energy storage you have in total as well as the charge/drain rates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Illiad","CreatedById":98853,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T05:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour batteries need an incoming source of power in order to recharge.
