If you overheat past a certain amount, the engine will explode. (The overheat is shown by a red temp bar next to the fuel bar.) I don\u0027t know if the probability of an explosion rises with the amount of overheating, or if it\u0027s just a threshold thing. I recall reading the devs planned to do more with this functionality in the future. In practical terms, I\u0027ve found that you can run a Mainsail attached to a single orange tank at 1/3 overheat without any problem, for at least a couple of minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Each fuel tank dissipates a little heat from the engine. A big orange tank doesn\u0027t dissipate enough heat by itself, but in-line with a small tank the two can keep up with a Mainsail engine at full power. It\u0027s not exactly *realistic* but it makes a crazy kind of Kerbal sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I take that back a bit. Now that I think of it, the SR-71 Blackbird used to run its fuel through a network of little pipes under the hot skin of the aircraft on its way to the engine, as a clever way to preheat the fuel while doing double-duty as a coolant. Oh those brainy engineers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS The Blackbird also used that fuel as the fluid for the hydraulic systems.

Nasty stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPPS A further note: I\u0027ve used a Mainsail attached to a single orange tank at about 70% power with no problem. It\u0027ll reach about 1/3 overheat, and I\u0027ve never experienced an explosion at that level. But as the rocket climbs the overheat slowly reduces, even though the throttle remains steady. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s a function of changing atmospheric pressure, or something to do with the fuel tank emptying.

It\u0027s probably because they have no current value of something like \u0022thermal dissipation.\u0022 So what ends up happening, is that a large tank, and a small tank have the same thermal dissipation values. So a large tank has, say, 500 Joules/second of dissipation; but so does EACH small tank. So the thermal cooling rate is double, when it shouldn\u0027t be.
