At this stage (haha), I\u0027ve just been hiring only scientists, with no real downsides that have become apparent. \n\nI\u0027m playing in Science Mode, so perhaps in the Career Mode it makes more impact on the play? \n\nAlso - are there any other abilities or skill sets each individual kerbal builds up over missions? I know that the Stupidity/Courage is just a candy stat for facial expression, but someone on one post mentioned leveling a new kerbal up? What levels? \n\nThanks all! \n\nBosun"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T06:32:58Z","Content":"There are limitations to what each class can do, and bonuses they can give you to missions.\n\nFor example, Pilots as they level up gain the ability to hold specific orientations (pro- or retrograde, normal, anti-normal, etc) via SAS (and probably other stuff?). Scientists are able to reset experiments like goo and science Jrs so you can repeat experiments, as well as man research modules, while engineers can repair parts that break and repack parachutes, and increase the efficiency of mining operations.\n\nSo.. \u0022Yes.\u0022 There is a difference."},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T06:33:18Z","Content":"Pilots give you access to extra SAS modes such as hold-prograde or point-at-manoeuvre.\n\nEngineers can repair stuff, and provide efficiency bonuses to ore mining.\n\nScientists improve the science lab, and provide bonuses to the amount of science you get from experiments.\n\nAll of these classes get better at what they do as you level up, and you currently level up by going out and doing stuff to get XP. For instance, achieving orbit, landing on another celestial body, planting a flag there. Currently you have to return the kerbal to Kerbin for any XP gains to apply.\n\nAnd yes, planting a flag gives you XP."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T07:36:46Z","Content":"Those differences are for Career mode only."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T07:47:02Z","Content":"All kerbals in Science Sandbox are five-star.\n\nThe engineer increases a mining operation output; at five stars - 2500% of unkerbed."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T13:07:22Z","Content":"That\u0027s enough to use fuel cells to power mining ops \u0022profitably\u0022 (like there\u0027s any value to ore but for the extra fuel)."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T13:12:24Z","Content":"a 3-star engineer breaks even on fuel cells (about 2% above the break even line, at a good deposit)."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:49:03Z","Content":"I have always wondered what the 100% bonus to science experiments scientist were supposed to get but I have never seen it in all my experiments on kirbin scientist and pilots all get the same science from experments"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
