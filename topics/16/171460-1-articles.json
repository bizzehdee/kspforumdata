Ive worked out how to set a navigation point for my current mission on the navball, and I can guide my craft to the point where the yellow circle is directly over where the research area is supposed to be, but when I do my crew report all I get is a comment about kerbal grassland,\u00A0or kerbal coastline, or \u0022I can see my house from here\u0022. The actual research mission never gets fulfilled. I\u0027m tempted just to give up and focus on getting into orbit,\u00A0\u00A0but I suspect the lessons these early missions are trying to teach me will become useful later on. What am I doing wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-27T11:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223306044\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519728598\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185850\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ColdEthyl75\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, ColdEthyl75 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut I suspect the lessons these early missions are trying to teach me will become useful later on\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnah..its just a way to pay the bills.If the contract don\u0027t have a good cost/reward skip (or even decline) it.

The target waypoint for the contract is a funny-shaped teardrop hanging in\u00A0 the sky. If you are too high or too low, you won\u0027t be able to find the exact spot. As spricigo said, when you are there you will see a message on your screen that you are entering the proper area. Then you have to be above or below a certain altitude, generally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect you are trying to fly a rocket to the targets?

The mission I was trying required altitude below 16000 which was definitely the case. I didn\u0027t notice any messages popping up although I could easily have missed them. Most significantly, I was indeed using a rocket so that\u0027s probably where I was having so much trouble. If these missions aren\u0027t worth doing I\u0027ll just focus on getting into orbit.
