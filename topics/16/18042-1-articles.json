Burn until map view shows your apoapsis matches the moon\u0027s orbit of 11,400km and then wait until you get close to the moon and the map view shows your trajectory change to one into/around the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point don\u0027t worry about orbiting the moon, just make sure you\u0027re headed towards the surface rather than around and back out.
