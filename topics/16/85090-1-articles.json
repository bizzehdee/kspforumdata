Then I mount the rover to the top of my lander vertically, which if your using NEAR/FAR also makes it easy to enclose in a fairing. Right before de-orbit on the mun, I inverted it to a docking port below the lander so I would land on the wheels, undock and take back off and land on landing legs nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design allows you to have large rockets underneath to get it to the Mun. However it depends on radial engines on the lander and you need to make sure you don\u0027t dock with the engines blocked.

Sometimes it is small (if i want just to test out a design on Mun or Minmus), other times bigger. Ocasionally i use a descend stage if the fuel reserve of a lander is insufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small rover with the skycrane for example has not enough DV to deorbit and land on Mun. But on a celestrial body like Minmus with it\u0027s low gravity or Kerbin with an atmosphere it will work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe rover to Minmus (an actual running competition). First ten pictures. The rocket consists of two and a half stages. First the boosters are gone. The remaining rocket is a little Asparagus** system witch is enough to lift (early gravity turn at 7k altitude) the transfer stage and the \u0022rover compartment\u0022 nearly to LKO (there is for an little time an PE, witch vanishes due drag). The rest of the flight - circularisation burn, Minmus transit, Minmus orbit insertion burn - is performed through the transit stage. Because i had some fuel left, it was used as a descend stage too (no debris in space). As the destination was Minmus, i decided that a chemical rocket is enough.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe second is a Kethane map sattelite for Eve. (picture eleven) Because it was an interplanetrary journey and the sattelite have to enter an polar orbit at Eve i used an nuclear drive for the second (transfer) stage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe third example is an full Asparagus** system for an Mun shuttle, witch is orbiting Mun and capable of landing and go back to orbit twice before it needs refueling. (picture twelve and thirteen) Due to the arrangement of the nuclear engines of the shuttle i should have used them for the transit too (witch i haven\u0027t obviosly). That would have been resulted in a smaller transit stage (no engine, smaller tank), maybe even a smaller Asparagus** system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/d4wnx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

A normal rocket have plenty of them (in the second and third stage for going near/into LKO). An Asparagus have not, since all engines are ignited at liftoff witch results in in mutch more DV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA central tank (with engine) is surrounded by tanks in pairs (up to three pairs, if they have the same diameter as the central tank). These pairs too have engines and are connected together with fuellines clock/anticlockwise. You can however - when the payload is not too heavy - go without engines on the Y2 tanks, witch can result in a bit more DV. From the last pair (Y3) there are fuellines to the center tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first pair (Y1) is running very fast out of fuel, since the tanks have not only to deliver fuel for their own engines, but for all other too. After depletion these tanks are jettsioned. The remaining system have full fuel tanks. This scheme is repeated for the Y2 and Y3 tanks, leaving at last a full central tank remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EX     = central tank\u003Cbr\u003EY(1)  = outer tank (pair number)\u003Cbr\u003E-     = fuellines between the outer tanks\u003Cbr\u003E\u002B     = fuellines to the central tank\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E   Y2  -   Y3  \u003Cbr\u003E   -       \u002B \u003Cbr\u003E   Y1      X       Y3\u003Cbr\u003E           \u002B        -\u003Cbr\u003E           Y3   -  Y2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: Where do you want to go, Duna/Laythe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Duna, i would use more and bigger parachutes/droges to slow down.
