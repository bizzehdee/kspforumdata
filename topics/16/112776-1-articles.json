So when returning from a high aopsis (mun, minmas or any other planet) as soon as you get into Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence fast forward to the nearest multiple of 6 hours before your projected landing time (6, 12, 18, 24 etc). Check out where you will be landing on kerbin at that time (ie let\u0027s say 30 hours before you actually get to Kerbin). \n\u003E \n\u003E Your landing point shown will be your actual landing point geographically as Kerbin will exactly rotate 5 times before you land (6x5 = 30). Simply adjust your course slightly to pick your preferred landing site. Given you are so far away dv costs are minimal.\n\u003E \n\u003E You can also use this on any other body as long as you know how long their day is. This usually allows me to land those early missions within 5-10km of the space centre with little do cost.\n\nCould someone explain what he\u0027s talking about? How do you \u0022fast forward\u0022? And what does he mean by \u0022your landing point shown\u0022? KSP does not show me where I\u0027m going to land, at least not on a world with an atmosphere; it just shows me where the current orbital path intersects with the the planet, which given atmo drag is quite a bit different.\n\nOr, if you have another way to bring a craft down (spaceplane or rocket) so you end up close to KSC, I\u0027d like to know, as I haven\u0027t figured out the trick yet. Thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:57:56Z","Content":"By \u0022fast forward,\u0022 OP means the game\u0027s ability to accelerate the passage of time, \u0022warp.\u0022 with the keys: \u003E and \u003C for faster and slower. And by \u0022shown,\u0022 OP is talking about the point where your blue projected path line intersects the planet\u0027s surface. And yes, that is not taking into account atmospheric braking. OP is merely pointing out that the same landing site is presented to you every 6 hours."},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:00:13Z","Content":"I think what he is saying is that if you are returning from somewhere with a course that will take you straight to the surface i.e. no establishing an orbit first, you should use the time warp function until your flight time to reach the surface is an exact multiple of 6. This will then show which part of the planet you will be arriving at, not allowing for atmospheric drag. Usually you need to aim a bit to the east of your intended landing spot to allow for drag slowing you down, but the exact amount will depend to an extent on your speed on arrival, and the angle that you come in through the atmosphere.\n\nETA : Ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"OldLost","CreatedById":143451,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T18:15:57Z","Content":"I thought maybe he was talking about warping as well, but then his later statement doesn\u0027t make any sense, in that if you warp until you\u0027re close then you\u0027re no longer \u0022*so far away dv costs are minimal\u0022.

You want to do the adjustments a multiple of six hours out so you know where KSC will be. (or use a mod to map body fixed trajectory)\n\nKeep in mind this method of step suborbital reentry will be (relatively) violent. Your ship should have good thermal mass or a heat shield to blunt reentry heating.\n\nWithout mods, the only way to predict reentry is through trial and error. Use a reproduceable decent (prograde, retrograde, dead stick, or manual) and see where your reference should be. A popular approach is deorbit burn on the far side from 75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 to set Pe to 45 km over KSC. Correct for over/undershoot by adjusting Pe height on future attempts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T20:45:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"OldLost","CreatedById":143451,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T20:53:20Z","Content":"Say you\u0027re exactly 30 hours out.
