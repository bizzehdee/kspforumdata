Using FAR/NEAR, what you do instead is design for 1.2-1.6 TWR (I strongly recommend 1.2-1.4 unless you are using short-duration SRBs), and make sure you have fins at the bottom (to pull center of lift/pressure/drag behind center of mass). You then begin a true gravity turn: at 60-100 m/s, make a 2-5 degree turn (earlier and steeper for high TWR rockets), wait for your prograde vector to catch up, and then ride that prograde vector all the way through to upper atmosphere. Once you\u0027re at 20-30 km altitude, you can begin to have your own ideas about where to point your rocket, but until then, aerodynamics will screw you if you try to deviate from prograde by more than ~5 degrees*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Under 5 degrees, though, aerodynamics (if your rocket has fins) will tend to pull your rocket back to prograde. Thus, if you nailed the 2-5 degree turn at exactly the right moment, you can literally go \u0022Look Ma, no hands!\u0022 all the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary factors behind this all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1: FAR removes the souposphere, and you as such have \u003Cem\u003Emuch \u003C/em\u003Eless atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2: With proper fin placement, aerodynamic stability will return you to prograde if you stay close to prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3: Regardless of fin placement, moving far from prograde in low atmosphere is a quick way to flip out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4: A consequence of #1-3: you\u0027ve got to start your turn early, because otherwise you will waste a lot of dV going straight up, because you\u0027ll be unable to turn horizontal until very high atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#5: Another consequence: you can generally get away with a lot less TWR than in stock, because you\u0027re not losing nearly as much to atmo drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#6: Build for 1.2-1.6 TWR (probably best in the 1.2-1.4 range), have fins at the bottom, and turn 2-5 degrees at 60-100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#7: You will probably want to use KIDS (KSP Isp Difficulty Scaler) or some RSS config, because your dV to orbit will shrink drastically and make your LKO boosters seem laughably small. I personally use 6.4x RSS and RealFuels with the stockalike config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*From personal experience of building many 1.6 TWR rockets: not worth it. You will struggle and curse to get your velocity vector closer to horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, fairings. You\u0027ll need them for anything except already-aerodynamic payloads: I tend to remove fairings around 45km altitude, but I\u0027m really not sure where the crossover point is. There will be some point at which the reduced atmo drag is no longer worth carrying the mass of the fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-13T23:08:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2014 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandi94","CreatedById":33424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T15:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes i just downloaded FAR and houahhh a pin straight rocket starts wobbling short time after launch , huh.
