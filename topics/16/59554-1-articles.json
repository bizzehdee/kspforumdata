But I\u0027m having trouble figuring out where this thing would actually be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, the mass is pretty significant, even if you plan on leaving the lab behind on whatever world you visit - especially if you want to land somewhere without a convenient atmosphere to slow you down. Second, the science gains seem to be pretty minimal - usually around 10-20% improvements, compared to the 90% you get for just bringing back the (extremely lightweight) experiments themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only place I can see where it would make sense would be for a manned Eve mission - the thick atmosphere would let you parachute it down with ease, and given the extreme delta-V requirements to get back into orbit, even the small added mass of the science experiments might be prohibitive. Alternatively, I could see it being useful in a case where you don\u0027t plan to return at all, but that requires abandoning two kerbals and I just can\u0027t bring myself to do that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you use the science lab?

Rinse and repeat until it\u0027s time to go home, then collect the full recovery science value on \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E the data you recovered. This lets you do things like have a tiny efficient lander collecting science from every biome and anomaly while bringing it back to a big return vehicle between trips.

Let\u0027s say you want to land on every biome on the Mun, as I\u0027m doing right now. That\u0027s a minimum of 15 landings, more if you then decide to go to the various anomalies. Now, we can only perform the main experiments once per mission, before the module becomes inoperable; that means you\u0027d have to launch your entire rocket into LKO, insert into a Munar orbit (and sit through the long journey there), land on your chosen biome, launch back into a Munar orbit, and return to Kerbin. That\u0027s not only wasteful and time consuming, it\u0027s also somewhat tedious, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science lab gives us an alternative to that. You set up a station in low Munar orbit, with a science lab, spare fuel and monopropellant, and lots of snacks. Then all you have to do is undock your Lander Module, land on the surface and get your science, then rendezvous with the station. You can then store all your experiments on the station and refresh the science modules, refuel, and then repeat the process as many times as you please. Once you\u0027re ready to cash all that science in, you just use a light return vehicle to get yourself, and the experiment data, back to Kerbin. That\u0027ll give you a massive amount of science, since you\u0027re returning 100% of data. It\u0027s more efficient than doing 15\u002B individual launches, it\u0027s arguably quicker, and, as far as I\u0027m concerned, much more fun. It\u0027s also a great way to practice rendezvous and docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/688223409987011514/4DB9509ABDD8A481FA73D0AA96775F2ED57AFE44/\u0022 alt=\u00224DB9509ABDD8A481FA73D0AA96775F2ED57AFE44\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll stock apart from Kerbal Engineer, and doesn\u0027t need a whole lot of advanced parts, so you can set it up fairly early on.

It saves so much time being able to just hop down to the surface and back, you can get away with heavier landers, since you only need a tiny amount of dV to get back to your station, and you\u0027re not wasting massive amounts of fuel and money punching through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and making that 12,000 km journey. (hypothetically speaking, of course. I know all that fuel and lifting costs us nothing right now). Then there\u0027s also the coolness factor of it; most of us have done your regular moon landing and returns countless times already. An apollo-style mission is a tad more interesting, but to me, having a permanent research station around the moon, with a reusable lander that I can use to make quick jaunts down to the surface whenever I want, feels much more satisfying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the difficulty of docking every time, I disagree. The station is in a 10km orbit, so you\u0027re rarely any more than 7 or 8km below it along the equator. Matching orbits from that height is very quick and easy, you can more or less just wait until it\u0027s almost directly overheard and just burn straight towards it. The way I see it, after the first couple of times, I can land anywhere along the Munar equator, get my science, rendezvous and match orbits, get in close, dock, refuel and be ready for the next mission in less than 5 minutes, not counting the time sitting on the surface waiting for the station to come back around. That\u0027s quicker than launching a new vehicle into LKO, with less effort needed, as far as I\u0027m concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, it\u0027s largely down to personal preference, but I\u0027d say that for extensive lunar exploration, orbital labs are the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Burtsp","CreatedById":98839,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T01:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Sabreur not sure if you are 100% clear on this, if you are please disregard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can store all science in any command pod, not just the lab.
