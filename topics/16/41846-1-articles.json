Does anybody have any tricks? Can I perhaps read it from the craft\u0027s TWR somehow? Or can I somehow use a maneuver node to give me an estimate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I think I need to clear up my question a bit. The whole burn to kill your horizontal speed can take up to 3 minutes. So you have to start burning maybe 50-100km before your target area. Problem is you don\u0027t really know when exactly. I don\u0027t want to do trial and error all the time to determine the right moment to start the burn. It\u0027s different for every moon, each craft design and sometimes even each craft (because it carries different amounts of fuel). I was hoping I could make some prediction before the actual landing. I tried two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- to guesstimate it somehow from the numbers: I know the thrust (240kN), the initial weight (80t) and the horizontal speed (500m/s), I thought I could get a reasonable number if just calculate - my TWR is then about 0.3, which means I can produce an acceleration of about 3m/s^2, and that means I will need about 160s, or 2m40s to kill my horizontal speed. However this isn\u0027t a good way to go at it and my number ended up about 50% off\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- to make a maneuver node right above my target and hold the retrograde marker all the way to 0 final speed. It then gives me a time estimate, but it\u0027s way off too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, I just thought there would be some way to guess about the right number.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-10T07:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2013 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jackissimus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T01:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need a TWR above 1, that\u0027s all there is to it. The \u0027trick\u0027 as such is keeping an eye on your descent rate (top of your screen, right side of the altimeter, arrow pointing at a scale). The hard part is landing on locations with height differences, but if you know the area you can keep your altitude steady at a given range while you\u0027re still taking down your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I was participating in a challenge for M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landings (this was before the surface changes) I started around 2500 meters above what I knew to be the surface altitude, then just burned hard to kill horizontal velocity, trying to keep my vertical velocity at -10. If I noticed I was dropping too fast, I\u0027d tilt up to decrease my descent rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would advice that you put your craft into a specific orbit, say 20x20km on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, then start practicing killing your horizontal velocity while maintaining 20km altitude. Once you\u0027ve got the hang of that, move to lower orbits and/or parabolic trajectories where you\u0027ve anticipated the touchdown area (and know its altitude).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T01:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit takes forever...makes me sleepy..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027d rather just kill most of the horizontal speed up high and let it free fail till it almost crashes and then quickly burn toward the zenith to touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyways\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto answer your question\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027ve heard trial and error would be a nice way to figure out things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T01:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat huge lander has a TwR of more than 1 with only a 909?
