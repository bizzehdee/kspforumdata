Once in a while i\u0027ll still overshoot a rendezvous... or forget my ship as abysmal TWR and not start braking soon enough. Docking at 50m/s tends to create many debris.... also landing at that speed seems bad too. ha ha ha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mun base is kind of a big project. especially if you haven\u0027t had a successful landing (or... intercept???) I would practice landing with a small probe or single kerbal capsule first. Try it on minmus. It is much more forgiving than the mun and takes about the same amount of deltaV to accomplish. Then you need to design your base with the landing stage in mind. How is it going to be deployed? Sky crane? Will it land itself and then have the engines disabled? Are you going to attempt connecting multiple modules together? If you are then the docking ports need to be exactly level with each other on the ground. Kind of annoying to do but there are many many pictures of people that have done just that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carlos_media","CreatedById":120483,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T14:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enervemind! i get it! i finnaly orbited the mun!
