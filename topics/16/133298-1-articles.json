1.0 to get off the ground in the 1st place, but KSP doesn\u0027t tell you that, nor does it say what your rocket is capable of doing while you\u0027re building it. \u00A0So you have 2 options. \u00A0You can do a lot of hand calculations on paper outside the game to figure your dV and TWR from the stats of the parts (which the game DOES show to some extent) or you can use an instrumentation mod like Kerbal Engineer Redux or MechJeb, which do the math for you. \u00A0But anyway, you need to know where you stand vs. what you need or you\u0027ll never get to space, or you get there but waste a lot of money on more rocket than you need. \u00A0So I really recommend getting 1 of those mods if you haven\u0027t already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there\u0027s 1 other thing to worry about---going too fast during the ascent in Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere. \u00A0If you do that, your rocket will either disintegrate or flip out shortly after launch as it approaches Mach 1. \u00A0This means that too much TWR is a serious problem, so you want to make sure your TWR is \u0026lt; 2.0 to start with. \u00A0I generally go for about 1.5 for the lower stages and 1.5 to 2.5 for the upper stages, which works just fine. \u00A0Understand that a stage\u0027s\u00A0TWR will increase as it runs due to fuel consumption making the rocket lighter, so you can start out pretty low and still end up with \u00A0high TWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this, finally, is where we get into SRBs. \u00A0SRBs are used for the 1st part of the flight, from the ground up through the lower, thicker part of the atmosphere. \u00A0SRBs have a pretty high TWR individually and if you\u0027re using them at all, it\u0027s because you want them to provide a significant amount of the dV needed to reach orbit. \u00A0That means you\u0027ll have multiple SRBs on the ship, which means that the ship\u0027s initial TWR will be VERY high, too high to survive in the lower atmosphere. \u00A0So what you do is, on the 1st stage, add however many SRBs it takes to get the dV for that stage. \u00A0Then you right-click on one of the SRBs and drag its thrust limiter slider down until your initial TWR is about 1.5. \u00A0Now you\u0027re good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put this all together, you always design rockets from the top down and give each stage the TWR and dV it needs for the part of the flight it does. \u00A0So you start with the payload, say a small probe that will do a Mun flyby. \u00A0So you\u0027ve got a small wad of electronics on top, and it needs a small engine with about 900m/s dV to get from low Kerbin orbit to Mun. \u00A0TWR doesn\u0027t matter for this engine as it will be in space and the light weight of the probe itself will automatically give it a very high TWR. \u00A0So that\u0027s your total payload. \u00A0Now you need to get this to orbit, which means everything from here down on the rocket needs about 3500m/s total dV and a TWR that starts out about 1.5. \u00A0You can usually make a relatively small, cheap, and simple LFO stack here that will have about 2500m/s and a TWR of about 1.5-2.5. \u00A0If you\u0027re going to use SRBs, that\u0027s all you need. \u00A0This stage will get from wherever the SRBs burn out to establishing a low Kerbin orbit. \u00A0This stage will not be running at launch---you launch on SRBs alone. \u00A0\u00A0So then you make the bottom (or 1st) stage out of SRBs. \u00A0The SRBs need about 1000m/s of dV---add SRBs as needed to achieve that. \u00A0Now limit their thrust so that they proved about a 1.5 TWR at ignition. \u00A0In the stock game, limiting thrust has no effect on stage dV, so you\u0027re all set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is, of course, possible to have SRBs and the LFO core all running at once on launch (like the Space Shuttle and many other real rockets). \u00A0But this is only necessary if the SRBs alone can\u0027t provide a TWR of about 1.5, and that\u0027s generally not a problem in KSP with stock parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira1000","CreatedById":152681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T16:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly in career you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E hit orbit and save money with a couple of staged Thumpers and a small LF final stage with a Terrier, but once you have access to better gear, SRBs should be relegated to \u0022initial launch kick\u0022 and that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do use them as a primary launch system, there are 2 rules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Put steerable fins on them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Tweak thrust to less than TWR 2 in the VAB (1.7 seems like a happy number for me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CSE","CreatedById":145588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T20:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to KSP!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs well as considering your rocket design, it\u0027s worth practicing your launch profile.

For example, timing your burn out of Kerbin\u0027s system to take you screaming past the retrograde side of the Mun at low altitude will significantly increase your orbital velocity, saving you a hundred or so m/s dv.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, if you can get to Jool then you have a multitude of options to use Jool or its moons to slow you down or speed you up. So yes, with a 2km/s burn from Kerbin to Jool (950 to edge of Kerbin SOI and 980 from there to Jool, plus inevitable inefficiencies), you should be able to get a gravity assist out of Kerbol system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, going from moon to moon within a planet\u0027s SOI does not require you to go down the branch and back up, as it were.
