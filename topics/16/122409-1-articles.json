Its basically a habitat for use by future crewed missions. It has a crew capsule (a Cupola) and a remote control (RC-L01) unit (as well as hitchhiker and lab modules, solar panels, batteries etc). It also has a MechJeb to provide true altitude and time to impact info. After I land it might show up in the tracking center at least for a while, but inevitably when I go back to Duna or look later in the tracking station its just not there.
