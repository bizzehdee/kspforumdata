What I found out seems contradictory, now I\u0027m trying to figure out how the various displays work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI opened up the aerodinamic display, and it\u0027s telling me my total drag, at the moment, is 77 kN. I decided to see which parts were more responsible, so I also activated the display in action menu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ypp4wnw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/ypp4wnw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is the plane. 77 kN total drag from aerodinamic window, wings are 2.13 each.

The nose cones make 0.02 each. Those in the front and rear have similar values.

So far, we\u0027re at 16 - even approximating up all the calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI further checked the control surfaces, the other fuel tanks, none of them is dragging significantly. All together, there will be maybe 20 kN of drag accounted for. Less. I checked the parts inside the cargo bays, to make sure they are properly shrouded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if looking at the parts menu one by one gives me a total of less than 20 kN, and the aerodinamic window is telling me 77 kN, where the hell are the other 60 kN of drag coming from? which of the two windows is wrong? are they even telling me what I think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lt_Duckweed","CreatedById":201466,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-10T23:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen and then close your service bays.\u00A0 For whatever reason, when you close service bays, the gui glitches out and keeps using the last drag value for everything in the bay, in this case, your props.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey don\u0027t actually contribute any drag, but the GUI will still add their \u0022drag\u0022 to the total value.\u00A0 That makes up for a large portion of the drag.\u00A0 The rest is lift induced drag, because the lift from wings in ksp is perpendicular to wing surface, not to velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-11T01:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224017922\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221628639338\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201466\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lt_Duckweed\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Lt_Duckweed said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen and then close your service bays.\u00A0 For whatever reason, when you close service bays, the gui glitches out and keeps using the last drag value for everything in the bay, in this case, your props.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey don\u0027t actually contribute any drag, but the GUI will still add their \u0022drag\u0022 to the total value.\u00A0 That makes up for a large portion of the drag.\u00A0 The rest is lift induced drag, because the lift from wings in ksp is perpendicular to wing surface, not to velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nearlier during the flight, i already opened and closed the cargo bays.
