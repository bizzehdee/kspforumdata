In stock KSP, some of the stock planes have their fuel being balanced everytime, and so their center of mass stays exactly where their center of lift was previously before using fuel, so it keeps balancing correctly. I would like to know : how do they do that ? I tried some balancing mods but they just balance using % of the fuel, and that isn\u0027t weight-based balancing. I like very much planes, and this is something that I need to know. I recently made a plane and when it got nearly empty, it was unstable as hell, so I needed to balance manually and not accurately using alt\u002Brightclick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there any tip to keep the fuel balanced like the stock planes do ?
