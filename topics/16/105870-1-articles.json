Also for your comment about fuel tanks mounted radially without fuel lines, one thing you can do is make symmetric stacks (same engine \u0026 tanks in 3 stacks for example).

I can understand why Squad leaved 2.5m tanks for later tech, but i never understood why all the 1.25m tanks aren\u0027t available from the beginning. It just looks.... hokey. I also agree with the \u0022airbrake\u0022 chutes. Getting used to popping the .625 chute at 24km is difficult, but on the bright side, I\u0027m getting a lot of chores done while KPP (Kerbal Parachute Program) takes ~10 minutes to touchdown from initial chute deploykment.\n\n And to be clear to others, I didn\u0027t mean teir 1 of tech, i meant teir 1 pad and VAB.

I still feel like giving me access to radial decouplers but not to fuel lines is the devs way of punking me. Career mode is great for making me appreciate what once seemed like little things.
