Yes, this will make your orbits not match. This is ok, they can\u0027t match if you need the ships to move relative to each other. When you do this, you should see some closest approach indicators on the map (1 if the orbits don\u0027t actually cross, 2 if they do). With each orbit you\u0027ll see the closest approach distance getting smaller (timewarp will help speed this process up). The lower the Pe, the more distance you\u0027ll shave off each time, but you run the risk of overshooting your target. Once your closest approach is at an acceptable distance, at the closest approach kill your relative velocity (click the velocity indicator on your navball until is displays Target, this is your current rV. Burn toward the retrograde indicator on the navball to reduce rV). Once it reads 0m/s, you\u0027ll find that you are back in a matching orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThePsuedoMonkey","CreatedById":58589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T18:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery maneuver changes your orbit, so don\u0027t worry about that (but don\u0027t change it so much that you can\u0027t fix it later). The idea is to change your orbit just enough to get close to the target on your next pass (the \u0022closest approach\u0022 nodes that Captain mentioned). When you get to that pass, fix your orbit (don\u0027t be obsessive about it though) and make sure your velocity readout is relative to your target. Check the navball and use its readout to make a burn towards your target; do not face directly toward the target, rather on its opposite side as your prograde vector is currently pointing, as this will pull your prograde vector toward it without making you speed up too much. Keep that vector facing the target, but keep the speed in check. If you overshoot the target, then kill your relative velocity, take a breath, and make a tiny burn towards it again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T18:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoboRay\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoboRay\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPeople that get hung up on trying to preserve \u0022perfect\u0022 orbits during the rendezvous and docking phases are the ones that struggle the most and the longest to learn how to rendezvous and dock.

Yeah...you\u0027re going to be waiting a while. Do what everybody else has said; get your periapsis lower and you can catch up. You might also need to adjust the angle of the orbit; you can do that by burning north or south at the ascending/descending nodes until the node says 0.0 degrees; that might not be an issue for you since it looks like you\u0027re using Mechjeb. Might want to check that all the same since you had issues during the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you only have to lower the periapsis?
