The Mun is not easy to reach at first but it become easier once you become proficient at orbiting. I remember my first satellites were all over the place and i had no idea how to actually controll where they end up. Then i found a video that mentioned a neat little trick of leaning every rocket onto the 90 degree heading during ascent, and pretty much every launch after that ended in a nice equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you made orbit, you have succesfully overcome one of the first hurdles in KSP. Keep going at it, you can only achieve more.

I\u0027ll try doing what you meant georgTF. But anyways, I don\u0027t know if this is a bug but, in the 0.20 update, whenever I burn towards the prograde vector, I always end-up orbiting the Sun. I realised that to make a \u0022stable\u0022 orbit around Kerbin (only Celestial Body I could test) you need to burn a little, but not too much, far from the Prograde Vector.

First of all you\u0027re going to want to make a ship capable of getting into orbit, then, fly that ship up, and try to get into an orbit with 0 inclination and that is about 100km x 100km. Then you\u0027re going to time warp until you see the Mun rising over the horizon of Kerbin. As soon as you see that, you\u0027re going to burn prograde. Press M , to look at your map and make sure you don\u0027t overshoot your target. As soon as your orbit changes to the Mun\u0027s SOI, then you\u0027re going to press X to cut all engine power. If you over shoot, don\u0027t worry, just point your ship retrograde and burn until you\u0027re back in the Mun\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T20:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RockyTV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RockyTV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...I always end-up orbiting the Sun...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck your map and see how high your apoapsis is. When it\u0027s above 69km you\u0027re in space. A good Ap is 75km, so once you have that or more, cut the engines, wait until your craft reaches Ap, then point prograde and burn. Since you\u0027re now in the highest point of your orbit, burning prograde will not raise your altitude any higher, instead your periapsis will raise, which is what you want to achieve a stable orbit. You can fly the rocket while in the map mode, all you need is to watch your navball, keep pointing prograde (engage SAS if you have it) and burn. Watch your Pe rise to about 75km and voila. You\u0027re in a nice stable low Kerbin orbit. The trick is to wait until you\u0027re at your apoapsis before burning. If you burn before, you\u0027ll unwillingly raise the apoapsis, and if you raise it enough, you\u0027ll escape Kerbin and wind up in a solar orbit. Heck if you can manage a solar orbit, you\u0027re not doing a bad job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t worry about inclined random orbits. That\u0027s normal and i remember my first launches were all like that. The solution is to lean the rocket on the 90 degree \u0022line\u0022 on the navball as it ascends. This will make your heading due west and will assure you end up on in a equatorial orbit. Leaning towards 270 is also possible but will cause you to travel in the opposite direction and since you will also fly against Kerbin\u0027s rotation it will require a bit more dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuver nodes are wonderfull. Not only can they simulate a course change without wasting fuel, they can also be used to tweak trajectories to help intercept targets as well as easily change/match inclination. They\u0027re also usefull during orbital injection as you can ascend until you reach an apoapsis of 75km, then create a node on the Ap mark, drag the prograde handle until your computed periapsis is also 75km. A blue target marker will be added to the navball. All you have to do is point towards this marker when the timer reaches zero, engage engines and wait until the displayed delta-V requirement for the maneuvre \u0022empties\u0022. Hey presto, you\u0027re in the orbit you wanted to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the estimated burn duration is shown to be longer than 10 secons, you should start burning roughly half the time needed before the countdown reaches zero. For example if duration says 50 seconds, start burning 25s early.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RockyTV","CreatedById":57161,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T03:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help guys!
