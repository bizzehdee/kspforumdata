If i have only a scientist on board rocket has no control wahtsoever ?\n\nNo, your controls will respond whether your crew has a pilot or just scientists/engineers. What pilots do is let you turn on Stability Assist with the T key; then they\u0027ll automatically stabilize the ship.\nMore likely you just don\u0027t have enough control authority. The basic Mk1 capsule has a weak set of reaction wheels; if you want to fly in atmosphere, you\u0027ll want steerable fins like the AV-R8 Winglets.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2 - If that was the reason, how do i actually reach that point and at that height ? I clicked on the map the point and then \u0022navigate here\u0022. Activated \u0022T\u0022 key, but there is no option to navigate anywhere. Maybe because of previous point (no pilot) ?\n\u003E Also, how to reach that part AT THAT HEIGHT could be a problem maybe.\n\nGenerally such contracts are more easily fulfilled using airplanes instead of rockets. Clicking on the map point and choosing \u0022Activate Navigation\u0022 merely adds an icon to the navball - point your rocket at the icon to go to it.\nNote that the T key is not an autopilot. Activating Stability Assist (the aforementioned T key) only tries to keep the rocket pointed in the same direction.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3 - How do you detach only one part from the rockets while building ? Sometimes it gets frustrating and you have to do the whole rocket again.\n\nThe parts of a rocket are organized in a \u0022tree\u0022 pattern. There is one \u0022root\u0022 or \u0022parent\u0022 part, the one you select first. Then \u0022branch\u0022 or \u0022child\u0022 parts get attached to it. And more \u0022child\u0022 parts get attached to the first group. And so on and so forth.\n\nYou can click on and therefore detach any part from the rocket at any time. However, any \u0022child\u0022 parts of that part will be detached with it. If you want to remove just that part, and e.g. replace it, then you need to detach its \u0022child\u0022 parts first. You can drop the \u0022child\u0022 parts elsewhere in the VAB while you work on the main rocket; they will turn transparent, and you can later pick them up and reattach them."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:41:14Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nIf you cannot steer your craft, it may be because you have no, or not enough, control authority (which is a fancy word for saying \u0022something that steers\u0022). There are four principal ways to gain more control authority:\n\n1.) Reaction wheels - the magic sauce that makes your basic command pod twist and turn and roll at the push of a button. Reaction wheels have a certain strength, and the heavier your rocket gets, the less affected it will be from the same reaction wheel. It might be that your rocket is so large that the built-in reaction wheel in your command pod is no longer sufficient until you drop a stage or two. There are dedicated reaction wheel parts you can add to your ship.\n\n2.) Engine thrust vectoring - the ability of an engine to swivel its nozzle around to steer. How well each engine does this depends on how much thrust it creates, and on how big the angle is in which it can tilt. The latter one is the thing called \u0022gimbal\u0022 that you will find in some engines\u0027 stats. Some engines do not have any gimbal at all, and thus cannot steer using thrust vectoring.\n\n3.) Atmospheric guidance - the way planes steer by means of moving control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, canards...). Stops being useful when you get above maybe 20km. At the same time, fixed wings or fins can make your rocket *more* stable, inhibiting your ability to steer it. In some cases this is useful, but in other cases, not so much.\n\n4.) Reaction control systems - or short: RCS. These are little multidirectional thrusters your attach to your ship, which run on monopropellant. You only unlock those a little later in the tech tree, I believe. They\u0027re not fully efficient inside an atmosphere and are more for in-space use, especially for rendezvous and docking.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, you should be able to find out why your rocket is having issues.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T08:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:45:33Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nYou should watch this series of Tutorials.
