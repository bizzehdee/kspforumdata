Preferrably in the SPH and in flight showing the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is actually that your craft is flying plenty fine. You are climbing up and accelerating. When you descend, you are going back into more dense air. An airplane\u0027s engines can only push it so fast, based on it\u0027s drag. If you make the air more dense, there is more drag. If there is more drag, then the engines won\u0027t be able to maintain speed and you will, in fact, slow down. This will happen in either FAR or stock (and real life for that matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, your navball might be in orbit mode. In which case your speed won\u0027t make much sense at all.

As a baseline, it\u0027s pretty easy to get a plane up to 1600\u002B m/s at 30km. If that plane starts to descend, it\u0027s speed will almost certainly go down, and quite a lot. The atmosphere starts to thicken up around 25km (where it will probably slow to 700 m/s or less) and even more around 12km (300 m/s ish).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP actually lets you accelerate to a craft\u0027s high end of drag pretty easily.
