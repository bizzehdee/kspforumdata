I use something near identical to the stock Z-MAP satellite launcher, a simple small 1.25m stack, with the M700 on top. I use a 1.25m fairing for it and the probe it sits on. All you need is for the fairing base to be a bit lower than immediately below the M700, and expand outwards as the first/lower part of the fairing until it\u0027s wide enough for the widest part of the M700. Once it\u0027s wide enough, next segment is vertically up until the M700 starts to taper in. Next segment is a long taper inwards roughly following the shape of the folded M700 scanner dish thing. Finally, taper in and close on top of that."},{"CreatedByName":"davidpsummers","CreatedById":108982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T01:37:20Z","Content":"\u0022We should test the experiment going really fast!\u0022\n\n\u0022Why?\u0022\n\n\u0022SCIENCE!\u0022"}]}
