Logic dictates that the reverse should be possible too, waiting for a Jool-Kerbin launch window, and then slinging past Laythe or Tylo to get on a Hohmann trajectory back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, how do I set up such a slingshot? First off, my initial trajectory is nowhere near circular, as a result of multiple previous slingshots, but at least it is zero inclination. It is entirely possible that I\u0027ll need to make multiple slingshots past the Jool\u0027s moons to get enough velocity to escape in the right direction at the right speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan somebody teach me how to do this? Eye-balling it takes hours, and is rarely accurate enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-13T12:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never tried multiples to get home (without some type of calculator, it would be pretty tough to get the timing right for the window), but I like to use Tylo.
