After a few spectacular failures I managed to finally do one-way trips to Duna and Eve. Problem is, one-way trips rub me the wrong way, and even a one-way trip to Duna I found to be harder than a return trip to the Mun. The target planet is much further away, requiring lots of fuel, it has a much higher gravity than the Mun, meaning that landing a ship that has enough fuel for a return trip isn\u0027t practical (frankly, such monster rockets usually disintegrate on the launch pad for me). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I came up with another way - I\u0027ll launch two craft to Duna; one will be an orbiter with the bigger, three-seater pod. Since this ship doesn\u0027t need to land, I can just give it a massive interplanetary stage with nuclear engines instead. The other ship will be a one-seater craft that will be able to land on Duna, than take off again, perform and orbital rendezvous with the orbiter, transfer the crewman to the orbiter via EVA, and then return the orbiter home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart 1: Securing our return ticket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it all went.. perhaps it can help someone do the same. Before I begin though, I don\u0027t claim that this is the best or only way to do this - but it worked for me. I\u0027ll also include the .craft files below in case someone wants to try it with the same ships I did it with. Note that I haven\u0027t used any mods at all - the game was as vanilla as it gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I needed to design the craft to do it. Even the two-craft approach meant building rather massive rockets, as you\u0027re about to see:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna01_zps80294a9d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna01_zps80294a9d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna Orbiter Mk I on the launch pad. You\u0027ll notice only two crewmen on the screenshots - I had one EVA on the launch pad, and then I did an \u0022end flight\u0022 for that crewman only.

I spent the almost the entire first series of tanks of the interplanetary stage to do this. But, I expected this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna10_zps90434541.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna10_zps90434541.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that will make or break your trips is efficient trajectory planning. It took me a few trial and error runs to figure out how to do it without spending too much fuel. Before you even attempt this, however, you should be familiar with KSP basics; you should know how to modify your orbits, change orbital inclination, and having performed several orbital hook-ups before helps too. Once your map view shows that you\u0027re on the way to Duna encounter, check the projected periapsis to Duna. Due to extreme distance, it\u0027s probably a rather large number, say 25 million km away from it or so. The problem with that is, if we stick to this course it will take us way too much fuel to slow us down once we get to that point. Now it\u0027s time to put to use all that knowledge about modifying orbits - burn a tiny bit prograde/retrogade to get the periapsis as close as it will go, then wait until you get about halfway of the projected path to Duna. Once you\u0027re half way there, modify your orbital inclination a bit if needed - I was usually able to bring my periapsis down to say, 250-450km away from target planet. These correction burns are tiny and don\u0027t cost much fuel at all, if done at these large distances. Once you get to Duna, correcting large mistakes will cost you so much fuel it\u0027ll usually be enough to ruin the whole mission. So, do tiny correction burns at a distance until you have a proper approach set up, and you\u0027ll end up here soon enough:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna08_zps8073ee3f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna08_zps8073ee3f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna Orbiter Mk I, orbiting Duna.

I equipped the lander with 5 chutes, but they\u0027re not near enough to do the job. First of all, Duna\u0027s atmosphere is really thin and only begins at some 42km above surface. Relying on just the chutes just means making another crater. Secondly, our lander is way too massive for the chutes to handle on their own - and you really don\u0027t want to use the chutes to kill your horizontal velocity; you need to use your engines to control your descent. Make sure you don\u0027t come in too fast when the chutes deploy, either, and be prepared to assist the chutes with engines sporadically all the way until touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna19_zps6c80c208.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna19_zps6c80c208.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere goes nothing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna20_zps0a8dd2be.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna20_zps0a8dd2be.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal burn to slow us down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna21_zpsbd4e90ef.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna21_zpsbd4e90ef.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and that definitely earned us the rights for some Duna-themed tacky postcards \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna22_zps5647f2c3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna22_zps5647f2c3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i827.photobucket.com/albums/zz196/newman1702/KSP/duna23_zps742d9e1e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022duna23_zps742d9e1e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna.

T-T\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to Eve is merely getting from a point in a higher orbit to a point in a lower one - so you can apply the same principle I used to return from Duna (there are screencaps that show the return trajectory above). Since Eve is in a lower orbit than Kerbin, it orbits the Sun at a much higher velocity, therefore you will need to apply a retrogade burn while you\u0027re still ahead of it along the orbital path. There is one small complication with Eve, though - it\u0027s orbit is inclined a few degrees relative to Kerbin\u0027s - not much, but just enough to miss it, so you will need to correct for that first. The way I do it: after achieving orbit I do a Kerbin escape burn. This puts me on a similar orbital path around the Sun as Kerbin. Now I wait until, from the side view on the map, my orbital path seems to intersect that of Eve\u0027s - at this point you do an inclination correction maneuver so your orbital plane is more or less parallel to that of Eve\u0027s. Now you need to wait until you\u0027re, say, 30 or 40 degrees ahead of Eve on your orbital path, and apply a retrogade burn until the map view shows up Eve encounter. Now you adjust your periapsis with tiny prograde/retrogade burns to get to Eve as close as you can get it, then wait until you\u0027re half way there, then slightly adjust your inclination (tiny burns, again) until your periapsis is a few hundred km away from Eve. Considering Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere, you could consider aerobreaking to save fuel on slowing you down - when you get closer you could adjust your periapsis to, say, 70km altitude to assist you in your breaking maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
