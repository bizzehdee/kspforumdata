Plus, you will need much more engines of the same type to push that weight of the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI managed to create a simple eve ascent rocket with a lander can into orbit. I\u0027m personally am very demanding of myself, and have build eve ascent rockets with 2 lander cans and even a ascent rocket for 4 kerbals in previous versions (the latter with external command seats)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried a design with 2 lander cans. I run into issues where I need so much surface thrust that I either have to part clip girders or tail sections to accomodate enough engines just to get enough TWR, or switch to a candlestick design, or a combination of both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe efficiency of engines on Eve re crap. It suffers the thrust ASL almost by half and the fuel consumption for engines in high pressure atmospheres is obviously a attempt at realism but very punishing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne thing bothers me,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is the hardest planet because it has 1: the most gravity, and 2: the densest atmosphere. It should always remain this way. If theres any alternative I would get wet at it\u0027s a planet in the Solar system that\u0027s even harder.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlthough it bothers me that Eve is hardest in both gravity and atmospheric density, The realistic changes to SLT makes eve harder in one area at the least. Which is strange because there seems to be no stepping stone in between eve Laythe, Tylo or Kerbin. I think there should be atleast a body that has similar gravity to eve but with little to no atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if Squad doesn\u0027t want to add additional bodies in the game, perhaps change the values of a already existing object.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy question: \u003C/strong\u003EWhat Kerbal grade rocket engine for a future KSP update based on a in real life counterpart would be produce a more efficient SLT? If such a engine design is unrealistic and thus shouldn\u0027t be added to the game is it possible to add a weightier engine, with the same bad efficieny, as long as it is a 1.25meter part with increased thrust so I don\u0027t have to use to many strap on engines? I care both about a alternative for increased ASL engine efficiency on EVE aswell as better SLT limiting the amount of engines to engineer slimmer rocket designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run into both problems as soon as I want to launch anything into orbit thats weightier then 1 lander can. Now you might suggest, \u0022just use one lander can\u0022 and send multiple rockets to the surface if you have more then one crew member there. A obvious thing to suggest. But I always like to have the freedom in KSP to push the limit, and on Eve this seems to be limited with the current stock parts. And any modded rocket part aswell as they suffer the same efficiency as long as they use rocket propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-16T09:31:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2016 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T13:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to look into \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022128005\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@OhioBob\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136342-112-eve-optimized-engines/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EEve Optimized Engines\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T13:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany thanks, I didn\u0027t know about that mod, what a relieve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless Squad considers the current challenge with stock nozzles a fair one, I think optimized engines for EVE should be stock to the game.

I used a design with vector engines, but I refrain in using them as throw aways because the design is asparagus obviously and only use them on the center core. Shedding one and each vector engine on a asparagus strap on tank is very wasteful. The vector is a little more efficient by isp, but in practice less efficient because of it\u0027s enormous weight, limiting any efficient use of it to the center core on the first stage.

I\u0027ll be redesigning later this week with 3 Mk 1 command pods instead of the crew cabin. But tell me how 3 Mk 1 command pods would be better then 1 mk 1 command pod and the crew cabin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe point of direction is where the air is coming from, and the Mk 1 command pod diverts the air away from the crew cabin. Which seems to me that no matter how much a drag value the cabin has it simply isn\u0027t collecting any air,\u003Cbr\u003E\nthe Mk 1 pod is. Either I don\u0027t understand it then or KSP is flawed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA crew of 3 consisting of Mk 1 command pods looks silly if you build them one on top of the other.

Not sure what it will do from actual sea level. The funny thing is that if I remove the first stage with the vectors completely, I have a much smaller 3 man craft which can get into orbit from 7km.
