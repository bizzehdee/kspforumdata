It looks like you are on a slight incline, so depending on the durability of that starship, you may be able to \u0022plane\u0022 it, and use the upwards angle of the slope to get you off the ground.

Duna is a bit funny - its kinda intermediate between an atmospheric entry (float down at slow speed on a parachute) and vacuum (rocket retrofiring to control/fly). I\u0027ve found \u0022terminal speed\u0022 is about 40 m/s on chutes, which is way too much for most parts to cope with, so I\u0027ve always aimed at a retro burn once near the surface. And its always sloped...or there\u0027s not much control for choosing. So I\u0027ve tended to go for wider landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you stick a bunch of engines around the edge, then its possible to deactivate/activate some and that can sometimes get it back to vertical - but its dicey!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-08T18:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you just want to get the Kerbals back home then send another mission- you\u2019ll need an interplanetary propulsion system that stays in orbit the whole time and two landers to get down onto Duna and then back up again with the 8 Kerbals (I say take two in case you land in the wrong place or crash). Fly out to Duna at the next transfer window, park the propulsion bit in a low Duna orbit then send a lander down to land near the stranded Kerbals, insert Kerbals into lander, return to orbit, dock with transfer stage, fly back to Kerbin at the next available transfer window, then send up a craft to bring the Kerbals down from Kerbin orbit. It\u2019s more practical to build a high efficiency interplanetary stage/ship and short range landers than it is to make the landers able to go down to Duna\u2019s surface then all the at back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need to get the ship back to Kerbin, you\u2019ll need to do some considerable surgery to get it pointing the right way (roll it around until it\u2019s pointing up the hill then use some Vernor thrusters and/or big reaction wheels to get it vertical again) then fuel it up before flying back into Duna orbit and from there back to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
