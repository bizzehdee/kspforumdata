Secondly I have never used heat shields. I also am unsure of how the new radiators are supposed to work, presumably you would really really not want a radiator when reentering, since it would suck up the heat and transfer it to your ship.\n\nSo far I have only survived by having loads of chutes and deploying a few that were destroyed but slowed be down enough to not burn up.\n\nI was also trying out realchutes, but it is really complicated.\n\nAlso, is there a way to delay deployment on detached parts. I am having a lot of problems with detached boosters smacking into the main ship or themselves even with loads of sepitrons (I think they are bobing back and forth)."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:00:57Z","Content":"Regarding chutes: There\u0027s a UI on the chute that indicates whether it\u0027s safe to deploy.

Wait until it says \u0022Safe\u0022.\n\nRegular chutes will need to be under ~250ish m/s before they\u0027re safe to activate. Drogue chutes are about double that.\n\nI generally don\u0027t have a problem with detached boosters smacking into the main ship, and I rarely use sepratrons (generally only use them for really huge monsters, like Eve landers). One thing that can help: when you\u0027re attaching a fuel tank (or SRB) to a radial decoupler, slide it down as low as it can go and still be attached to the decoupler. That is, you want the decoupler\u0027s attachment point to the radial-thing-being-decoupled to be as high as possible.\n\nDoing it that way means that the separation force from the decoupler will be applied above the decoupled thing\u0027s center of mass, which will tend to make it rotate *away* from the central craft, which provides a nice natural separation. (I\u0027ll sometimes get a message that my radial boosters collided into each *other* after separation, but I\u0027ve already discarded them so I don\u0027t care.)\n\nAlso, if your central rocket isn\u0027t already activated (i.e. if you\u0027re not asparagus), make sure that your central rocket is put together in the same stage as your radial decouplers. In other words, when you hit the space bar, you want your central ship\u0027s engine to ignite at the same time that your radial decouplers fire. Don\u0027t put it in two stages (i.e. you don\u0027t want \u0022separate decouplers, pause, light engine\u0022). Reason: you want that central ship accelerating hard away from the decoupled boosters, to minimize their chance of bumping into it."},{"CreatedByName":"wisnoskij","CreatedById":143705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:50:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Regarding chutes: There\u0027s a UI on the chute that indicates whether it\u0027s safe to deploy.

How does it go away?\n\nThe heat is coming from friction (1). Friction is converting your speed into heat. Your craft is absorbing (2) the heat of that friction. In other words, the faster you are de-accelerating (3), the faster you accumulate heat\n\nYour craft also radiates (4) heat. This heat radiation is based on the difference between the ambient temperature and the heat of your craft. In other words, the hotter you are, the faster you dump heat. Radiators increase that rate of transfer, but it\u0027s still a factor of temperature difference. As long as your radiators are hotter than the air around them, they will be dumping heat. Hint: Keep them out of the airstream, since the friction heats the air at the point of contact.\n\nSo, to keep from exploding because of heat, you want to slow down your heat accumulation, by reducing your rate of de-acceleration. \n\nHow do you slow down slower, over a longer period of time? Shallow re-entry, where most of your speed is horizontal, rather than vertical. You want to go round and round Kerbin until you are going slowly, rather than plunging straight towards the center of the world.\n\nSimple way of doing that is have your perapsis between 28k and 32k meters above the surface when you hit the atmosphere.

When your speed is below 250 m/s. With the shallow re-entry profile, most of my craft get below 250 m/s by 6000m off the ground. Depends on how aerodynamic your craft is.
