A lighter vehicle can be going faster when the chute deploys, since it doesn\u0027t yank on the parachute so hard.

The most simple answer is: the more mass you have per parachute, the slower you need to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can counteract this by using struts to anchor the parachute to the ship better and spread the force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khiro","CreatedById":52209,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T06:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the above things seem to be correct. The mass it is trying to slow down X the speed you\u0027re going at = the force of your momentum. That is countered by the drag value of the chute, the thickness of the atmosphere, and the shear strength of the parachute part. You can reduce the force of your momentum by aerobraking and retro-thrusting, and burning off fuel reduces your mass as well. On the other side of the equation you can reinforce your chutes with struts, or you can add additional chutes to distribute the force.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m developing vehicles, at some point I\u0027ll inevitably launch the re-entry portion up about 100K, let it fall back to Kerbin, and see what the chutes do. You get used to the needed values for the command pods pretty quickly, but if you\u0027re trying to chute-land a lander vehicle, testing is in order. As far as the atmospheres of other planets, napkin calculations based on their relative densities is probably your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T07:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on mass. they will genereally rip off at 100 m/s at 500m, however in the \u0022drag chute\u0022 mode, they should not rip offf.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghery88","CreatedById":32827,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T08:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experiences 8 smaller parachutes (which are stronger than the big one) can be safely deployed on a 60-ton craft between 100 and 120 m/s.
