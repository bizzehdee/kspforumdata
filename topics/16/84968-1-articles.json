Also i calculated the \u0027splashed down\u0027 values (they have different multipliers) for Kerbin, Eve and Laythe and added them to the total value. And with that changes the table stated 25080 for Jools SOI which was exactly the same number i calculated per hand in my Jool 5 Preparation and which is close to my practical achieved number during actual \u0027doing\u0027 of my Jool 5 Mission.
