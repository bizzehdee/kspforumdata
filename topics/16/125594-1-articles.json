Whenever I use the OX-4W 2x3 or the OX-4L 1x6 solar panels on satellites, I open them, and am not able to close them. Action groups to close don\u0026#39;t work. I haven\u0026#39;t observed if this is the same for the solar panels with the white casing, or if it works on manned craft, but the fact that I cannot retract these solar panels has ruined several missions of mine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0022retract panels\u0022 option simply vanishes from the menu when I right click on the panel. Reloading the save and restarting the game doesn\u0026#39;t work. Once it\u0026#39;s deployed, it\u0026#39;s stuck.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this normal?

Well I didn\u0026#39;t know that. Guess I\u0026#39;m going to have to change what panels I use for basically... all my missions. Thanks for telling me\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy first mission to Eve could theoretically have been ruined by the panels not retracting. They would have broken during aerobraking. However, that didn\u0026#39;t happen, because the ship was incinerated five seconds after it entered the atmosphere.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T02:33:32Z","Content":"\nIf you put your cursor on the part in the parts list in the VAB and right-click for the expanded description, it says \u0022Panels cannot be retracted\u0022.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T16:27:05Z","Content":"\nYou can edit the .cfg file for the solar panels if you wish. \u003Cbr\u003E\n(eg; C:\u0026#092;Program Files\u0026#092;KSP_Stock\u0026#092;GameData\u0026#092;Squad\u0026#092;Parts\u0026#092;Electrical\u0026#092;1x6SolarPanels\u0026#092;1x6SolarPanels.cfg)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust before the end of the file is the line \u0022retractable = false\u0022.

The description of the parts used to suggest that the casing on the heavier parts is there to protect the panels during re-entry so I\u0026#39;d still be keen to have both sets retractable but with lower aerodynamic and heat tolerance on the unshielded ones.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T16:30:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
