Does he just need to be in the vessel when you transmit or recover? Does he need to be the one that conducts the EVA, take the surface sample, or take data from a goo or science jr? Does he only need to be present for a crew report? Can this be exploited by just swapping out the crew at re-entry? I am not looking to game the system, just wanting to understand it."},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T17:24:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Let\u0027s say you have a maneuver node that is a prograde burn with a duration of 3 minutes.

Technically you should start the burn slightly ***after*** 1m30s, even pressing shift to throttle gradually. This is because your TWR increases as you burn fuel, whereas maneuver node burn times are calculated using current weight and do not account for the increase in acceleration. So a 3 minute burn for 720m/s actually becomes something like 2m40s because at the start of the burn you might be able to accelerate at 4m/s^2 but by the end of the burn you might be up to 5m/s^2"}]}
