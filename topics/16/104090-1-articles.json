I have made designes which get a single kerbal into orbit, onto a space station if desired, and then bring the plane home with remote control. But I have had trouble getting a passenger section up, so I can use one trip to get a handful of kerbals up there at once. \n\nI finally worked out a good ratio of jet engines to rocket power on these larger craft, but I find on re-entry the center of gravity on the craft has massively shifted, due to the lack of fuel on the way home. So the center of lift is now way in front of my center of gravity, causing me to flip out of control once I hit the atmosphere. \n\nMy solution, which has had only limited success, (its still pretty unstable in general, but better) is to have a wing section on the front of the craft detach on re-entry. Sense I don\u0027t need that much lift in front of the craft on the way home, I just get rid of it. somewhat wasteful, but I am having a really hard time balancing the center of gravity/lift on a full/empty craft. \n\nAny tips on how to keep a craft stable once its way lighter than when it went up?\n\n(I\u0027d post images of my plane, but the forum wont allow it?)\n\nEDIT: Ah, its because I\u0027m new.

It is possibly to build a plane where the CoL will shift, but not too far.

My solution is: One big tank at the COM, smaller ones at the front and rear. Put all the non-fueled stuff to the front and all parts which produce drag to the rear. You want to reentry like a dart or shuttle, it will stabilise itself. COM to the front, Drag to the rear. I\u0027ve heard of a rumor that some are using rcs tanks around the COM for pumping, but tbh if well designed, there is no need for them. If I need Monopropellant for docking maneuvers the tanks are placed in front of the COM. Be sure COL is always behind COM. If COM is to far in front of COL sometimes you will need to redsign your ship. Use FAR stability calculation for different ascent profiles as well as for hypersonic flight around mach 6-8 for an empty plane at high altitudes (simulating reentry). \n\nIn flight: Assuming COL is way behind COM especially in thin air, you will need to shift COM back. Use fuel pumping to the back or you\u0027ll need an high AoA for flight around 25-35km. When switching to rocket mode close all intakes. \n\nFor reentry open intakes, toggle air breaks and pump the rest of the fuel to the front. \n\nUse TAC fuelbalancer and or Goodspeed fuel pump RCS BuildAid.\n\nMy universal CrewCarrier:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

They add drag to your aircraft, so it\u0027s best to put them at the back of your craft for stability (especially during re-entry).\n\nI have a stupid SSTO design method to reduce CoM shifting that I will try to explain clearly (don\u0027t have access to my KSP right now, so no pictures, sorry). It works in stock aero, not sure about FAR...\n\n1. I start with everything which weight doesn\u0027t change : cockpit, sas, cargo bay, crew bay, etc. and build what I\u0027d call a \u0022naked fuselage\u0022\n2. If I use a cargo bay to lift a payload into orbit, I rearrange the above pieces until the CoM is right in the middle of the bay : that way, CoM shifting will be minimized after releasing my payload.\n3. Now, time to add fuel : I abuse the stock aero system and add fuel (and rcs) tanks on the sides of the craft while making sure that their center match the CoM of the naked fuselage, like this : (CoM in red, naked fuselage in green, tanks in orange) \n\n![gb7if9e.png](http://i.imgur.com/gb7if9e.png)\n\n     The goal is trying to minimize CoM shifting due to fuel consumption\n4. I then deal with wing surfaces, basically using Slashy\u0027s advices, checking the CoL / CoM placement, etc.\n5. I try to make sure that I have more intakes behind the CoL than in front in hopes that the back of the craft has more drag than the front, helping with stability during reentry.\n\nIt\u0027s a cheap way to deal with the CoM shifting problems, has some big engineering constraint but works fine for me, especially when building huge SSTOs...\n\nOnly thing is, after a while, I tend to get bored with building SSTOs that way (they tend to look the same), and sometimes go for the good old \u0022tanks in front, tanks in the back, move fuel around to keep it balanced\u0022 solution.\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T13:02:57Z","Content":"el\\_coyoto\u0027s method of fuselage construction works in FAR, incidentally. You just don\u0027t need quite as much junk out on the sides (you still need *some* as a rule - but it\u0027s mostly fuel, and that\u0027s because of the way KSP handles fuel drain).\n\nWhich aero model are you using, anyway?\n\n[Here\u0027s my general advice for stock aero spaceplanes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100334-SSTO-Why-u-no-fly?p=1546536\u0026viewfull=1#post1546536). I\u0027m good at those, and if you\u0027re using stock DocMoriarty\u0027s guide will be of great help to you. Plan for a 25% payload fraction - for a Mk3 Cockpit and a Mk3 Passenger Module (i.e. 19 Kerbal capacity craft), your paywad is just shy of 10 tonnes, so plan on building a 40 tonne plane. You\u0027ll need 4 RAPIER engines or 3 Turbojets (and you can couple each Turbojet with three or four 24-77s), 2080 units of LF, 1300 of Oxidizer, 12 Ram Intakes, 13 pairs of Delta Wings/Wing Connector A/Wing Connector B, plus all that other extra spaceplaney goodness...\n\n[And here\u0027s my advice for FAR spaceplane design](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115347-FAR-spaceplane-questions-%28amount-of-motors-and-wings%29?p=1834155#post1834155). I suck at those, so take the advice there with a grain of salt...(you can read about [my FAR plane woes here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111541-Thinking-about-making-the-switch-to-FAR); start with page 4).\n\nI can\u0027t get away without recommending a couple of mods for spaceplane jockeys; these are useful regardless of aero model - RCS Build Aid, and Intake Build Aid. RCS Build Aid, among other things, shows you how far and in what direction your mass will shift as you drain fuel. It also shows you if your engine placement relative to your CoM is going to generate any torque and how much it will add, which becomes important as you get higher up in the atmosphere and your control surfaces start to lose their effectiveness - I\u0027ve had a couple of spaceplanes fail because of that particular phenomenon. Intake Build Aid corrects for a known issue regarding how Intake Air resources are allocated to the jets, which you can correct manually by placing each intake and jet on your plane individually - that mod lets you build as you will and then fix everything with the push of a single button - your Turbojets and RAPIERs can be operated at full power higher into the atmosphere as a result. Both mods are extraordinarily useful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T13:15:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T17:39:24Z","Content":"@GoSlash27 Tiny SSTO is my new favorite!"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingPete","CreatedById":127384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T20:01:45Z","Content":"I try to keep the radial docking port or cargo bay close to the COM if possible, but it\u0027s simple enough to position fuel tanks forward and aft of this.
