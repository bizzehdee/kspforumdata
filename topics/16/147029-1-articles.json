No problem. The catch is that i have no yaw or pitch control and it flies in circles until crashing into the ground. I need a tail fin that was held on to the craft but did not rotate at the ridiculous speeds. So i attempted to create one using struts and girders. That, unfortunately, spun with it and exploded. Is there any way i can create a pivot that allows for yaw control?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbtw, this is what i\u0027m trying to fly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/photo/107029110591918995788/6326213376081052914?icm=false\u0026amp;sqid=109488336238758153845\u0026amp;ssid=3e35f011-b7cb-4b88-ae1b-217b3803b3ee\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/photo/107029110591918995788/6326213376081052914?icm=false\u0026amp;sqid=109488336238758153845\u0026amp;ssid=3e35f011-b7cb-4b88-ae1b-217b3803b3ee\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T23:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved over to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T23:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168361-nuclearsheep/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022168361\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/168361-nuclearsheep/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nuclearsheep\u003C/a\u003E, what you\u0027re building there is essentially an electric-turbine.
