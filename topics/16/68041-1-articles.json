The station consists of a collection of fuel tanks. It has a dedicated SSTO science lander assigned to it that can go down to the surface and come back to the station to refuel without dropping any boosters. And it has a place for some Kerbals to live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo this assembly you dock a Mobile Lab that\u0027s got its own probe core, power, and parachutes. The lander goes down to a biome on the moon and comes back with Science! You load the Science! in the Mobile Lab and use the Mobile Lab to rearm the lander\u0027s Goos and Materials. Then you refuel the lander and send it down to another biome.
