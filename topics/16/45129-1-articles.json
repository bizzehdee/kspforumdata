The 6-way hub (can\u0027t remember its name) as such is just a connection part weighing 1.5 tons, you need to attach docking ports to it to be able to use it as a real docking hub (or other bits to make it useful). As such it\u0027s less useful than just another \u0022structural fuselage\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, fuel tank but no engine nor docking ports, it\u0027s meaningless (apart from looks). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo launch it into orbit wouldn\u0027t be too hard, it doesn\u0027t look too heavy masswise. As a \u0027benchmark\u0027 two orange tanks \u002B \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD orange tank (double white tank - 32) with a mainsail can get a small payload to orbit, so you\u0027d need to attach enough tanks/thrust to lift it, with about 4500 m/s delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can look at Kerbal X, a stock craft, to find a launcher. It\u0027s asparagus staged and somewhat ok.

For starters, Johnno\u0027s already pointed out the problem with the hubmax; if you\u0027re going to use it to dock things, you still have to add ports. Also, having both the large ASAS and the Reaction Wheel is redundant; the way new SAS is written in the game, they both do the same thing (so you can ditch one and save some weight). And I should point out that those RCS blocks aren\u0027t going to do you a lick of good without some monopropellant tanks. I\u0027m also curious as to why you have a fuel tank down on the bottom; it\u0027d make a little bit of sense if you were using that bit as a booster to get the rest of it into the orbit you want but by itself it\u0027s not going to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your desired orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T22:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ESometimes I like to build things for people, just as a project.
