You\u0027ll need an all purpose craft which is capable of landing and launching from the different bodies you\u0027ll be visiting. I would have a mix of engines - nukes for low gravity to save on the fuel ratios and powerful engines for helping getting off high gravity wells - the powerful engines can then be toggled in an action group - I find they are also handy if you mess up an approach and heading too fast in to a moon! The lander will have at least two sets of instruments so you can at least get two good readings in different biomes before having to redock with the lab.

It is possible, though, to have a high Isp engine consume more fuel than a lower Isp one, if its thrust is high enough. For example an LV-N will consume fuel faster than an LV-1 Ant engine even though it has much higher Isp (the LV-N delivers more acceleration per unit of fuel though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-Ns are the most efficient orbital rocket engines, but their low thrust can make them a pain to use sometimes as the burn times get long pretty easily.
