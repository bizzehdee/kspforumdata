This is a known issue. However, if the chutes are only partially deployed, you can still save. They will appear invisible/tiny after loading, but they will properly transition into their fully opened state at the correct altitude and land you safely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T16:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a bug that sometimes comes up, even without DRE.

If you notice the textures are not loaded for what you are landing on.. quick-save at that moment and restart.. things will work fine after the restart. And to date I\u0027ve seen this 3 times. And note that I\u0027ve only got one MOD loaded.. the docking UI mod. And I had seen this bug two times before installing that mod.. so its not related to the mod (although I could see the mod aggravating it if its a memory issue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd an FYI to StreetWind: It happened to me in pure stock twice.. =(\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T22:18:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by weezl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T19:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the texture bug you guys are talking about, it\u0027s some problem with Unity not loading all the resources, and it also happens from time to time in vKSP. It happens when you come back to Kerbin from a distance away and the higher resolution textures don\u0027t get loaded. It might be worse with mods, but it might not. I don\u0027t think that has been sorted out at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s the problem you ran into, but it\u0027s a possibility. As Streetwind said, the fix is to quicksave and quickload. You can do this high in the atmosphere or just outside of it (as a preventative), as well as down low when you see a problem. I\u0027d say it you could quicksave/load below 160km (because that\u0027s where textures are supposed to load), but that hasn\u0027t been confirmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as Streetwind said, you need to be aware of your parachute state. However, if you must quickload/quicksave when it\u0027s already fully deployed, you can find a savefile fix that will allow you to quickload to a restored chute in this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77327-20May-0-23-5-Issues-Fix-Crashes-Decoupler-EVA-Career-Save-Won-t-Start-more\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77327-20May-0-23-5-Issues-Fix-Crashes-Decoupler-EVA-Career-Save-Won-t-Start-more\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T00:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture of the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sGThAvl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sGThAvl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand in the water and you will be OK.
