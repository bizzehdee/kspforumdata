All satellites are to be in the same circular orbit (altitude, velocity, inclination). However, I want them to be equally spaced in orbit That is, assume one is at 0 degrees, the next are at 90, 180, and 270.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you accomplish this? My plan was to place the first. Then, set a rendezvous node for it. However, I would then slide the node 90 degrees along the orbit path and launch to \u0022rendezvous\u0022 with this ghost spot. I would then repeat the process for the remaining two satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite frankly, that plan just doesn\u0027t sound accurate enough.

So when you are placing your satellites in orbit, you want to get the periods as close to each other as possible. I mean within seconds, if not within a second of each other. The closer the periods are to each other, the less often you\u0027ll have to visit the constellation to make corrections. (Unless you don\u0027t care if they drift.) Period is much more important (precise/easier) than trying to get AP/PEs matching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people will use RCS or ION engines to do the last bit of perfecting the orbital timing. With an ION, you can even tweak the thrust way down so that you can really control the orbital period. If you burn slowly so that it \u003Cem\u003Ejust \u003C/em\u003Eticks over to your desired time, you can get your periods within a fraction of a second from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T15:25:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany people set up a resonant orbit with a mother ship that drops probes.\u003Cp\u003ESo you setup a mothership that is in an orbit that is 3/4 of the period of the orbit that you want, you can drop a probe each time you reach apoapsis.
