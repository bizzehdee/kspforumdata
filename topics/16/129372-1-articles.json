Where it does matter in KSP is when you want to use the jet engine for VTOL and you want to have precise control over the hovering. For this I use panthers as my hovering engine and set it so that on dry mode the panther engines give about 0.9 TWR, so if i stay on dry mode the VTOL will slowly start falling.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPanther can switch between dry and wet mode instantly, so by rapidly toggling between 0.9 TWR dry mode and some TWR higher than 1 in wet mode you can fairly precisely control vertical ascent and descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T06:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222350429\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129372\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452059799\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022148129\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murdox\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Murdox said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaha never thought this before and really interesting point of view actually!\u00A0I just wonder if there should be\u00A0delay after you disconnect fuel source, because its different than shutting off engine completely.
