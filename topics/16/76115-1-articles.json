I got it into a circular orbit at 374,000m but I don\u0027t think it is transmitting to my satellite on the ground. Isn\u0027t there a red line on the map to show when it is transmitting? Also I now have a yellow circle outside my orbit that has two red markers on it that say target position 1 \u0026amp; 2. I have the antenna opened and the solar panels/batteries are working fine. Am I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlimeCrusher","CreatedById":105427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T20:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm sorry to say, but satellites are useless right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou were probably watching some youtubers launch communication satellites, right? Well, if you saw a red line in the video, they were using the mod \u0022RemoteTech2\u0022, and if you\u0027re new to the game, i don\u0027t suggest installing it, it just makes thing harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"velve","CreatedById":112979,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T21:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Average PC Gamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Average PC Gamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Also I now have a yellow circle outside my orbit that has two red markers on it that say target position 1 \u0026amp; 2.

I have been playing kerbal for just over a week too, and was confident enough to install it, and I\u0027m having a great time and challenge. But if you\u0027re still not comfortable with the game then rather don\u0027t use it. If you are you could always give it a go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fr3Runn3r","CreatedById":73353,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T21:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour question has been answered already but I\u0027ll expand on it anyway. The functionality you\u0027re referring to comes from the RemoteTech 2 mod.

Of course as always the choice is yours and if you feel competent feel free to give it a try\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T09:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative to RemoteTech 2 is AntennaRange \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-0-23-5-AntennaRange-1-3-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-0-23-5-AntennaRange-1-3-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt requires less management (and does not draw lines on the map).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
