This is a recovery vehicle (unnecessary for the challenge itself), so I made it very minimalist. You can see in the upper right how the two kerbals fit in. I recommend placing command chairs inside to prevent the kerbals from bouncing around, slipping out during time warp, and generally summoning the kraken. On occasion, it still quivers when the doors are closed, but in general works well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can place two command chairs with radial symmetry and rotate them so the head end of the seat points inward to the bay. They will naturally snap the the vertical midpoint of the bay opening with some fiddling, but you\u0027ll have to use the offset gizmo to sink them inward slightly horizontal to prevent the kerbals/chairs from clipping through the doors (which invites bad things for service bays).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oC7zvrq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oC7zvrq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
