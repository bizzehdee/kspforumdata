Jool\u0027s atmosphere is simply too dense at higher altitudes: even at reasonable speeds, you\u0027ll heat way too much than expected. Your ship will almost always blow up if you\u0027re not prepared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd by the way, in RSS, for a pressure of 1 atm asl, the Earth\u0027s atmospheric height is 130km, almost twice as high as Kerbin. This is why you explode when reentring at 3.5 km/s at Kerbin, while you survive Earth reentry at 7.5 km/s, 11 km/s from the Moon or further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a too steep reentry is equivalent to hitting denser layers of the atmosphere too fast: this increases the heat flux maximum. During reentry, most of the energy goes into skin temperature, and as soon as you hit the maximum skin temperature of a part, it will blow up, end of story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, real life doesn\u0027t happen this way: your heatshield will not magically explode as soon as you reach the temperature is was made for. Actually, the peak reentry temperatures experienced by heatshields are often significantly higher than the ablator\u0027s boiloff point (often around 3000\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C) and that is what makes it actually ablate, and protect the craft by creating a boundary layer and insulating the craft better than any solid material could. In KSP, ablators start to ablate whenever they want to (800K IIRC) and blow up when actual heatshields only start to ablate. This is another reason why, past a certain speed in KSP, your heatshield won\u0027t help you anymore: the heat flux is stronger than what the heatshield can withstand, it heats and explodes, even if the boundary layer would insulate your ship otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad could always add a multiplier to the reentry heat factor to make it hazardous at Kerbin but that won\u0027t solve the problem at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u0027t have the magic answer, I think that reworking the atmospheres and heatshield mechanics is a good start.

This is a known issue with KSP 1.0.3/4, and said to be fixed in 1.0.5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Atmospheric height for Kerbin is already much greater than realistic, for Kerbin\u0027s size. Our Earth has a far thinner sheath of air around it than you realize; if Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere was sized to scale to Earth\u0027s atmosphere for its diameter, then we\u0027d be looking at roughly 20-30 kilometers worth of air, not 70 as we currently have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The KSP solar system is not scaled down to 1/7th. In fact it doesn\u0027t have an overall scaling factor at all; each planet does it differently. They are meant to be only vague analogues to real bodies, not scaled representations. For the main bodies, the size comparison to their realworld analogues yields: Sun 1/3, Moho 1/10, Eve 1/8.5, Kerbin 1/11, Duna 1/10.5, Dres 1/3.5, Jool 1/11.5, Eeloo 1/12.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Heating effects are not scaled down compared to real life. The opposite is true - heating effects are scaled \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E, and quite a lot, too! Orbital velocity in low Earth orbit is ~8 km/s, compared to Kerbin\u0027s 2.2 km/s; returning from the Moon is ~11.5 km/s, compared to 3 km/s for a Mun return. As such, with a realistic heat simulation, you wouldn\u0027t even get any noticable heat or beautiful reentry effects at all, because you are traveling so much slower! So in order to force these things to appear anyway, at the speeds appropriate for KSP, the devs had to fudge various physical constants to completely unrealistic values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As a side effect of this, you can also configure these values yourself if you like, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123268-1-0-2-Kerbol-3-7-Stock-system-re-scaled-x3-7-%28A-Kopernicus-based-mod%29/page4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eit\u0027s complicated\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T07:44:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
