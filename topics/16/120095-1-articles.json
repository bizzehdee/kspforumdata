I\u0027m making a slingshot off the Mun to change trajectory to reenter kerbin along equator, but that slingshot isn\u0027t efficient at all, because I didn\u0027t care about fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the point you have to understand is slingshot doesn\u0027t give you new energy, but it does change your vector. So you can create a comfortable situation to make a necessary burn, when without slingshot you\u0027d have to create such situation with your engines, wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, the slingshot better be planned before entering Duna SoI. Play with maneuver editor until you get an encounter with Ike, then adjust your encounter so your escape trajectory would create an intercept of your target planet. Your phase around the Kerbol in respect to target will matter how efficient your approach will be, but it\u0027ll be up to you to decide efficiency againt time. Even in bad current situation you can slingshot burn to a trajectory, that will intercept target not on this, but next orbit around Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not for rookies, but I assume you aren\u0027t one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and have fun.

This is tricky because Duna is not massive enough to alter your path much. To go Kerbin-Duna-Eve you will need to leave Kerbin and get into a Solar orbit that already has a perihelion close to Eve\u0027s orbit and an aphelion close to Duna\u0027s orbit. An orbit like that will cross Kerbin\u0027s orbit at a sharp angle, and as such when you leave Kerbin you will be at a high angle to Kerbin\u0027s direction of motion around the Sun, which means it will take a lot of dV to leave Kerbin and get into this orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But it is possible! Here is the first window I could find (Using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlyby Finder\u003C/a\u003E, Earth time):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeave Kerbin Y1 day 97 12H (Earth time, From a 75x75km orbit an 1883m/s boost will be required, start orbit inclination is 0.1 degrees).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlyby Duna Y1 day 193 at about a 45 km periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrive Eve Y1 day 242. (It would cost about 1950m/s to brake into a circular 100km orbit at Eve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe windows are pretty tight. Arriving at Duna even 6 hours after the target time will cost about 50m/s, increasing rapidly after that. You can\u0027t leave Kerbin before day 97, 6H, or after day 100. If you search this using FF, raise the V at SOI max to at least 3000m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the start boost is almost what it would take to get to Jool. You could knock maybe 40m/s off of this by using a flyby of Mun at the start, but it would be nasty tricky. Since you fly by Duna lower than Ike\u0027s orbit, and your window is more than 1 Ike day wide, you can work an Ike flyby into the Duna flyby by adjusting your start time a bit. Note that tiny Ike will add almost nothing to your energy since you will be flying by it very fast. Flying a Kerbin-Mun-Duna-Ike-Eve path would be quite cool, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you go the other way, Kerbin-Eve-Duna, you can start with a much smaller start boost because heavy Eve can alter you orbit a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have a version of FF that uses both Earth and Kerbin time released in about 2 weeks if you prefer to work in Kerbin time. I\u0027m debugging it now, this problem was a fine test case!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
