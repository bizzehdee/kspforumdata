But can you connect the mk3 cargo ramp to any of the mk3 cargo bays?

I\u0027ve experienced issues due to the fact that the wheels were spanning a little too large, so it wasn\u0027t easy entering straight in and docking it back in place properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWolf83","CreatedById":141199,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T21:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll attemp this tonight and if any issues I\u0027ll take a screen shot in hanger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T23:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically, it should connect to any part with an open node, which should include Mk3 bays. Dont forget to use the slider to adjust the height of the ramp so it just hits the ground. Also, If you have clearance problems, you could mount wheels off of a singular I-beam undernearth the cargo, instead of on the outside of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T00:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a pad test of essentially that same concept from November.
