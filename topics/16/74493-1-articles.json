So, it finally made me come across the idea that actually performing a real gravity assisted ascent the very same way it is done for more then fifty years in the real world would be the best way of getting my kerbals into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to calculate what should my rocket look like, how should it be balanced, what performance should it have to take me where I need it to be after the ascent? Is it possible to get into a circular orbit just with a gravity turn without the circularization? I guess many real rockets do the job this way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should I fly the thing after it leaves the dense atmosphere and does not go prgrade automatically any more?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are my thrust to weight ratios and g forces much lower than I would expect in real world on a realistic looking launch? Is it all about the size of the planet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do my rockets always tend to have their center of lift before their center of gravity even if they generally look like working rockets? To get around this without adding unrealistically looking fins that also add way too much stability and wobbling I would have to add payloads that the rockets would not lift of the ground at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do they do with this in the real world?

There is Mechjeb which does have an autopilot feature which can turn it into a very automated process but it is a bit clunky at times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is KOS, which is a fair bit more complex to use but can give you a bit more accurate feel to the automation process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why are my thrust to weight rations and g forces much lower than I would expect in real world on a realistic looking launch?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuite simply, it is a game. Kerbin is roughly 1/3rd the size of the Real Earth atmosphere, so rocket launches in KSP are closer to bottle rocket launches. The ideal thrust to weight ratio for a launch is a round 1.2-1.4:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as performing a gravity turn in FAR with stock sized Kerbin, generally I start my gravity turn at 100m/s or 1km altitude, which ever happens first. I tilt the rocket 5deg in the direction I want it to go, and gravity will gradually pull it over till you hit the higher atmosphere.

In a way it\u0027s much like T.C. described above. After launch and reaching 75 m/s switch off SAS and give a small nudge in the direction you want to proceed. In the mean time depending on the TWR throttle back so your speed just increases slightly from 145 m/s at approx 3000m. Now use the throttle to control the speed at which the rocket tips over, lower- if it doesn\u0027t drop enough, more throttle if the tipping over goes too fast.
