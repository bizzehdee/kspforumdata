So if you drop a satellite there on the same spot every 2 hours (or 4h, aka dropping every 2/3rds) , they should align perfectly. So your carriers orbit has to pass the geosynchronous orbit while also requiring exactly 2 (or 4) hours to make a turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T05:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EResonant orbits like Faark mentions is the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T05:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI typically deploy four comm sats at a time.

The major axis of an ellipse is the line that passes through both foci of the ellipse and it\u0027s center. The semi-major axis is half that. In a circular orbit, it\u0027s just the orbital radius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re going for a circular orbit, either decide the orbital period or altitude you want. The altitude (in a circular orbit) is the semi-major axis minus the radius of the planet. Then find the other value you don\u0027t have using the formula above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince you want to put 4 satellites equally spaced, you can divide the orbital period either by 1/4 or 3/4. Chances are you won\u0027t be able to get an orbit with the apoapsis you want that is 1/4 the period, so 3/4 works better. Taking that 3/4 period value, determine the semi major axis with the formula above (you\u0027ll have to do some algebra to solve for a). Now, you know the new semi-major axis you need for your shorter period orbit. Double it, then subtract your desired orbit radius from that value (ie your desired altitude plus the radius of the planet). Then, subtract the radius of the planet from that value, and that tells you the new periapsis you want. Get yourself into a circular orbit at that altitude. Then, expand the orbit so the apoapsis is at your final desired altitude. Release a craft every time you reach apoapsis and have it boost itself into a circular orbit. Your other craft will come around again on its own to do this again, but 90 degrees away from the first craft, because the orbital period is 3/4 the desired orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that explanation was clear enough for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T09:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod available that allows you to attach a small part to your craft that will give you the orbital period readout in real time.
