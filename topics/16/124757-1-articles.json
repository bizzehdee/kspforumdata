I\u0027d put the station at a fairly low altitude around Duna- you can use aerobraking to help when bringing the mining lander from Ike to the station, and Ike\u0027s relatively large SOI combined with the empty mining ship will limit the fuel used in getting back to Ike. A low orbit also reduces the dV needed by landers headed for Duna\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I tend to forget: Batteries, power generation, monopropellant storage, antenna.

I tend to use either the flat \u0027trashcan lid\u0027 with differently-sized ports on either side, or the rockomax adapter with two types of docking port for when more clearance is needed. I usually build stations using the larger 2.5m ports to connect modules, and the small ports for docking spacecraft, so the adapters are useful for when you only have the \u0027wrong\u0027 size available. My big stations to date have had a little RCS-powered minitug present for moving parts around, so no real need to give them their own thrusters and probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
