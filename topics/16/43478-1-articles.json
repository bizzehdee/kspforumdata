The problem lies in the combination of both jet and rocket engines. With just the jet engines (6, from B9 mod) i can get it up to about 22k before the air runs out. So, at 21k i want to use my rocket engine (any) to get the speed up, this is where i see a huge drop of about 50% in thrust output by the jet engines, this starts the second i turn on my rocket engine. As you can see the stats are (very) similar when taking the screenshots, so theoretically speaking my jet engines should keep on going, does anyone have any idea if this is a mod related thing or that im doing something wrong?

Though that, if you look at the pictures, is not the case. I could change the thrust output at will by switching the rocket engine on and off, no other variable changed and only the toggling of the rocket engine did this. The turbojet engine has no issues as the one you see above, hence, by the power of elimination *looks to the skies*, it is focused at the engines shown above. I can post a million pictures showing exactly this, with exactly the same altitude, speed setting and intake air, just ignore the slight differences seen in the pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoboray, I got it into space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T19:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose particular engines have poor performance at altitude.
