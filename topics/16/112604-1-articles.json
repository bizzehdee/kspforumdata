However, every time I send an aircraft, its engines start to overheat about 15 minutes into the flight. Turning the engines off and even landing don\u0027t seem to have much effect. Is heat not convecting properly, or am I doing something wrong?\n\n(This occurs with both the basic and turbojet airbreathing engines for me)"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:49:46Z","Content":"How hot are they getting?

For engines to overheat enough to explode you must be going really fast and with an angle that allows the airflow to hit the engine side.

Throttle down. Slow down.\n\n2. Precooler. Attach the engine to it.\n\n3. Make sure they are attached near (in terms of number of parts between) some control surfaces or wings/winglets.

Yes the engine generates its own heat but that is hardly a problem. For an engine to overheat enough to explode before the parts at the tip of the plane you would need the tiniest plane you can ever build. Even my 1 seat long range jet doesn\u0027t have a problem with its engine while going 1550m/s at 25k\u002B altitude. Intakes on the other hand are a whole different matter."},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Ronald","CreatedById":98308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T16:12:48Z","Content":"I encountered the same problem with the basic jet-engine; there is only a certain amount of time or distance it will fly before overheating.\n\nI have tried \n\n- flying at lower throttle: no effect (only slows heating)\n\n- mounting radiators: no effect (only dissipates heat from skin of parts, not internal heat from engine)\n\n- cooling engine nacelle: no effect at all (none that I could notice)\n\n- landing the aircraft, wait and/or fly something else and come back later: engines were as hot as I when left them ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWhat Does help:\n\nLand and put your plane on parking brake, set time-warp to 1000x for just an instant, and all is back to nominal ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIm sorry its not a realistic solution, but it works!

Once you get over Mach 2.5 (~850 m/s) the parts will start to overheat. When you use the basic jet engine this is not a problem because the engine doesn\u0027t have enough power to cause trouble. When you use the Turbo ramjet engine, you will start to see problems because the engines grow more powerful at higher speeds. (There are examples of this in real life: when the MiG-25 exceeded about Mach 2.83 it would tend to run away and overheat.)\n\nAlso, pay close attention to the maximum temperature of the parts. Some parts, like batteries and photovoltaic panels have a maximum temperature of 1200K. A Mk1 cockpit can stand 2000K, a Mk2 2500K and a Mk3 2700K. Once you get above Mach 3, things will start to explode unless you have been very careful in your aircraft design. You want parts that have a high maximum heat, especially the root part. You also want to be able to get rid of the heat quickly. Parts that are good for that are wings, engines, radiators and the engine precooler. With the right construction you can get up to a sustained speed of Mach 4.5. I\u0027ve even managed an air-breathing jet capable of an apoapsis of over 120km.\n\nYou can find out more if you read the wiki on the Turbojet."},{"CreatedByName":"cjones","CreatedById":63857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:27:03Z","Content":"My jet engines always overheat, no matter what speed or altitude I fly at.
