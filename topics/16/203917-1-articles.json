I\u0027m really baffled by this - the engine should be light enough for Bill to lift (0.08t), and it isn\u0027t obstructed by other parts, and Bill is certainly close enough to attach it to the lander, right? I\u0027m not sure why the game isn\u0027t letting me do this. If anyone has any guess, I\u0027d be really grateful.
