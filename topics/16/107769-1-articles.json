After a long break, I started over in 1.0 and had a great time. Now in 1.0.2, I can\u0027t even get a Mk1 with a Mk16 and the smallest possible booster rocket to land without something exploding. There is also no way to stage off the booster in a new game when no parts are unlocked, let alone hope to return with some science equipment. I love accuracy and realism, but I also don\u0027t like taking all the fun out of it either.\n\nWas this the intended change and is it going to remain like this? How do we even get started in a new game now? I have always loved the game, and I want to continue to play, but I\u0027ve stopped playing for now because of this. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:20:02Z","Content":"You stopped playing because the very first ship you can possibly build isn\u0027t very good?\n\nJust walk around the KSC a little bit and you will get enough science to unlock decouplers. As for returning science equipment, by the time you even have science equipment you also get more and better parachutes, and as soon as you can do EVA\u0027s you don\u0027t ever need to bring the equipment back anyway, just collect the data with a scientist. \n\nAlso, I have no idea what you are talking about when you say something explodes. I just tested a Mk1 with a M16 and a Flea booster and nothing exploded when they landed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T00:22:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aerindel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:23:09Z","Content":"You just described exactly how the first flight in Career mode is supposed to go.

Orbit is followed by Mun orbit as soon as you have eva, I recommend an minmus landing next after unlocking surface samples. Rover to mun east farside crater/ canyon as soon as you have them, do contracts for funds."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:45:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You just described exactly how the first flight in Career mode is supposed to go.

I just tested a Mk1 with a M16 and a Flea booster and nothing exploded when they landed.\n\nOP is probably using an RT10, but this is actually a pretty common problem now. Starting in 1.0.2 parachute opening takes a bit longer to reach full drag, and the default values are tuned to the mass of the mk1 capsule. Landing anything heavier, like a capsule with an engine still attached (not unreasonably so if you\u0027re early career and want maximum recovery value) takes a little more than 500 m to bring the craft down to terminal velocity. My first flight in 1.0.2, I lost a doubled up capsule into the ocean that way! \n\nSince then I set all my chutes to deploy at 1500 m or so, haven\u0027t had any incidents since."},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T12:08:16Z","Content":"So reccomendation would be to change the default value of parachutes to open to at least 1000 metres or 1500 of the ground. solve the early game problem."}]}
