The regular time rate is one game second for every two seconds in real life.

If you go into settings and change it from 0.04 back to the original 0.1 you should see an improvement (you can see if the system is bogging down if the mission time changes to yellow or red). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I think the reason for the change was to try and reduce the number of physics glitches (when things seem to explode or come apart for no reason) by trading time for accuracy when the physics system was under high load and making time move slower instead of the game becoming really laggy. If you change it back to 0.1 you will face the same risk of glitches that you did in .22. If you build big rockets that seem to explode at lot you might want to leave it at 0.04.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T16:37:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigh debris?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sneezedr424","CreatedById":33670,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T18:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDave: I think that\u0027s exactly what s going on.
