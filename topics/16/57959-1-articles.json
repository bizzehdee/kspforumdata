Unfortunately I am unable to build this spacecraft. I\u0027ve gotten to the point where it has become very difficult to keep my ship symmetrical while also adding more thrust.

You want to be going at 100m/s on launch (impossible but worth getting near) So bottom most stage can have very little thrust but LOTS of thrust to weight. In your ship I would suggest more small SRB\u0027s on the bottom stage. They should burn fast get you to 90-120m/s then the trust should fall so that its only accelerating a bit and hitting about 120m/s @ 2K 140m/s@5k or something near that (I forget the exact numbers). It is strange but it will greatly help with efficiency and save fuel and therefore size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Easy enough to do make sure space engines are the little ones, though I think I can just see in the picture this is right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.You have some stages that are the same size as the one below, this does mean you get to drop their engine weight and empty tanks but the bottom one is trying to lift the full tanks and an extra engine.

I am reading up gravity turns right now. I think I was doing it wrong by going 0 degrees then 90 degrees. Instead, I need to curve my corner?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ISmokeThis","CreatedById":98831,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T04:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had always imagined that the air drag would be too strong to make slowly tilting your rocket early on worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T04:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenerally you want to begin your gravity turn about 7km up, then just pitch over slightly (towards heading 090) and gradually turn until your apoapsis gets to your desired parking orbit (I use about 80km) then circularize and plot a maneuver that intercepts the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T04:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ISmokeThis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ISmokeThis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had always imagined that the air drag would be too strong to make slowly tilting your rocket early on worthwhile.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, the drag slows you down under 20-30 km, but above that it\u0027s not too problematic.
