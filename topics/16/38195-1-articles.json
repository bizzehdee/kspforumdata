Can\u0027t put em too low or they\u0027ll be on the runway and if they are too high like on my current one or it\u0027ll backflip at about 15km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really a fan of SSTO\u0027s since I prefer doing having as much delta-v as possible once in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s something I\u0027ve tried making recently, the two turbos are just enough really but eventually it does spin out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/3J46d.png\u0022 alt=\u00223J46d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, can I strap kerbals on those external seats and have them survive reentry?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hyperformer","CreatedById":58481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T19:30:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t always use drop tanks but when I do I usually add a launcher to get the plane off the runway to avoid having to do crazy landing gear pylons. As for placement of the tanks I typically put the on the center of mass and have them drain first the there is no balance changes. Finally, yes kerbals will survive in external seats, and even on ladders,during reentry\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T19:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to put drop tanks on the wing tips. You can rotate them up or down for trim purposes, and they\u0027re not likely to impact anything during release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I notice about your plane is the two small rocket fuel tanks will mess with your trim. When full, they will make it pitch up more and more as speed increases. But when empty, they will make it pitch down (or at least, less up). I think you could simply remove them, and use the reduced weight to get higher/faster before ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ashzo","CreatedById":75410,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T20:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETried taking off the drop tanks and it\u0027s still not really getting anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone could have a look at it that\u0027d be fantastic, there\u0027s 4 different versions I played around with in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/479ycz39cv20v5l/DerpyPlane.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
