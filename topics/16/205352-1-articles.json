Maybe there are tricks that aren\u0027t documented or hinted at anywhere, but if so I haven\u0027t stumbled across them yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMajor problem: anytime I try to do any construction, sooner or later (almost always sooner) I move something a wrong way or across a bad spot or something, and suddenly everything explodes without warning. So, now I don\u0027t dare try to use it on anything I care at all about. Not useful. (I do have KJR installed, if that could be a factor.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinor problem: the engineer\u0027s effective range is too short. This becomes the sort of challenge that is 100% hassle, 0% fun. Would still use for emergencies, except for the point above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood idea. Needs a lot of fixing and adjustment before it\u0027s usable though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this just me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-26T23:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfirst, the bug with stuff randomly exploding can easily be fixed by saving the game before performing eva construction. i believe even the more purists of \u0022play it as it goes\u0022 would agree that reverting a bug is a legitimate use of the reload function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsecond, i often forget to add some minor details. parachutes, solar panels, those kind of things. eva construction allows fixing that without having to launch the whole big ship again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthird, eva construction allows overcoming limitations. There\u0027s a guy who went to eve cavemen style, with 30 part limit on every launch, and he was able to do it by eva construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit can also be useful to add parts that would create aerodinamic problems during launch, like a big antenna that would stick out of the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt enables multipurposing your vehicles on the spot. There was a time i sent a spaceplane to land on atmospheric planets, and then i realized I could also fly in the atmosphere of neidon; I wouldn\u0027t land, and so I removed the wheels. I had tight margins on that mission, removing 750 kg made a difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe major bonus of eva construction, though, is when coupled with kerbalism or other mods with part breaking. because it allows fixing malfunctions along the way. The first large mission i played with kerbalism, months before that new release, i had to make sure to have multiple redundant wheels and engines on everything. After eva construction, I could get away with just two, and if a part breaks i can easily swap it; it saves hassle and complexity. and it feels very good to be able to fix stuff. also, i can discard the broken parts, reducing weight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can also keep parts protected from malfunctions in inventory; instead of bringing 6 parachutes for the reentry capsule because some may get broken along the way, pack just one, inside the inventory, where it is protected from aging. Only install it as you approach atmosphere. Finally, I can move around docking ports and dock my ships in ways I didn\u0027t think to enable originally. This actually saved my first kerbalims mission, because at some point I realized i needed to protect myself from radiation by moving a shuttle in front of a cupola, and it was only possible because i could move a docking port in front of said cupola.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of the more complex stuff I do that wouldn\u0027t be possible without eva construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neva construction simply doesn\u0027t fit your playstyle, but it\u0027s extremely useful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-31T00:35:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve not had any issues with things exploding yet, but as far as I can tell, it\u0027s not really made for \u0022construction\u0022 per se, more augmentation?
