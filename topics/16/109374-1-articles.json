Build your craft placing the fairing base at either the top or bottom of your intended stage and then build the fairing and when you get to the top, close down around the bottom of the next part above the stage (or the inverse if the base is at the top, however make sure your base is upside down if that is the case). You can close an interstage fairing to a decoupler, a command pod, or really just about anything that is handy depending on how you want to access your cargo (decouplers are logical choices).\n\nWhat you can not do currently is making a static interstage shell. These are fairings that do not decouple themselves and instead are designed to have their cargo extracted in space (called [TD\u0026E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition,_docking,_and_extraction)). This is how Apollo extracted the lander from below the command module engine (technically Apollo had half and half, part of the shell staged away, the bottom of the lander had to be extracted). Unfortunately the only way to do this in KSP is to have a docking port attached to a decoupler (because undocking from an engine does not remove it\u0027s fairing, known bug) and the only thing you can close the interstage fairings on is the decoupler itself. However closing the interstage on the decoupler will cause the decoupler to [rip apart the fairing even if it isn\u0027t staged](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437133762). The simple remedy is always stage away your fairing, but that kind of ruins the whole immersion. I\u0027m hoping Squad can fix this, in the meantime [you can do this with the Procedural Fairings mod](http://i.imgur.com/jF1EesN.jpg).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T17:22:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T18:24:41Z","Content":"Hm okay thanks for the tips, I succeeded. The fairing generation seems to be a little finicky, need to click back and forth a bit to get it to close the fairing on an above part for some reason, such as here, it just *wouldn\u0027t*.\n\n![screenshot4.png](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8tUSiom5VQA/VVY5q4NcmbI/AAAAAAAAGfQ/YvAbBMFXUaI/w1476-h903-no/screenshot4.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T19:52:00Z","Content":"Here are a couple examples of interstage fairing - for my Apollike rocket:\n\nVAB - Fairings \u0022closed\u0022:\n\n![Fi6WSTQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/Fi6WSTQ.png)\n\nVAB - Fairings \u0022exploded\u0022:\n\n![EIB5RCW.png](http://i.imgur.com/EIB5RCW.png)"}]}
