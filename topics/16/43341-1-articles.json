When you\u0027re launching your ship, the game will attempt to select a command pod to orient the navball to, sometimes it will choose not what you wanted, sometimes, like in your case, it simply can\u0027t choose what you wanted because you\u0027ve not given it an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace a docking port or an extra probe core onto the ship pointing upwards, and right click on it when you launch.

Also be aware that navball orientation is completely independent of the direction of thrust, which is only determined by where the currently enabled engines are pointing and nothing else. Autopilots like MechJeb will attempt to follow the node marker with the currently active command pod/docking port, but will assume the thrust vector is parallel the orientation, which is not necessarily the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T08:26:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 08:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mihara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lewille","CreatedById":76348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T08:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t knew it was that easy to fix\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T12:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that if an kerbal sits down in an command seat this tend to change the control from here to the seat. if you have the seat on top of an lander it will then be placed sideway.
