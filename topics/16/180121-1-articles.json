it can go directly from the drill to the Kerbals\u0027 mouths.\u00A0 Water is also needed to make oxygen if you don\u0027t have another source; this also produces hydrogen which you can partially recycle with a Sabatier converter, if you like.\u00A0 Water is also part of the greenhouse food conversion process--perhaps you should bring two water drills, after all.\u00A0 If you have a source of water, then you probably don\u0027t need to recycle wastewater to get the water back.\u00A0 However, you may need to recycle the wastewater for the \u003Cem\u003Ewaste\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsider:\u00A0 ore ultimately becomes food (as fertiliser in the greenhouse via the algae farm), so your Kerbal capacity is influenced by the greenhouse\u0027s ability to produce food from fertiliser, water, and carbon dioxide.\u00A0 The Kerbals produce more carbon dioxide than the greenhouse needs, and you\u00A0are producing water directly, so the main check on the greenhouse\u0027s efficiency is the fertiliser production rate.\u00A0 Add enough algae farms to produce the fertiliser you need, and then you\u0027ll have to see what the farms need.\u00A0 They take in ore\u00A0(not a problem) and waste.\u00A0 Do they take in enough waste?\u00A0 Your Kerbals produce waste directly from their food, but they also put small amounts of extractable waste in the wastewater and carbon dioxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all stuff that you\u0027ll need to consider, so my advice is to figure out the major idea of your base, build it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E (not the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E; the launchpad is too small), and try it on the runway.\u00A0 Especially try it after emptying half of the support tanks and filling half of the waste tanks and seeing whether the resources are lost or gained, on average.\u00A0 If you have to provide a temporary ore and water supply (I don\u0027t know whether there\u0027s ore in the runway, but I always thought drilling for it was rude), then see how many drills you\u0027ll need to offset the net consumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-27T18:02:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2018 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaximumThrust","CreatedById":185090,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-27T17:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried TAC-LS and didn\u0027t liked, the 3 resources and 3 wastes are used and produced at the same ratio, so there ins\u0027t much point in a gameplay perspective and generate a lot of clutter.
