Any idea why it\u0027s doing this? Am I forgetting to turn something off or something, or is something else?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T07:14:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 07:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Kingdom**"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:52:54Z","Content":"Try disabling the front control surfaces from pitch.
