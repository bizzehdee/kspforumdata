And the fact that you have already done a Moho flyby is impressive. Even without capturing at Moho (which requires a boatload of dV), getting to Moho, with its inclination and distance, is still an accomplishment.\n\nTWR does not really matter in vacuum, although in practice having a TWR lower than 0.2 tends to be agonizing since burns take 5\u002B minutes of time. If your TWR is lower than 0.2 (or whatever you\u0027re comfortable with), slap on a few more engines in the VAB. \n\nAnd no, your dV is your dV. It is, by definition, the end result of the change in your velocity. Usually, because nukes are so efficient, most medium-to-large interplanetary crafts will have low TWR, typically around 0.2 (again, see above on why going below 0.2 starts to get annoying)."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T14:58:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve got a ship in a 100km Orbit round Kerbin where is the easiest place to go\n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Oh and does the TWR matter in vacuum does a TWR of below 1 use more dv from the potential in the tank than is actually given in velocity\n\nWell, with nearly 9000m/s in the tank, you can do a round trip to just about anywhere so take your pick. It\u0027s all pretty much the same, just wait for the window, point in the right direction, and burn. Interplanetary isn\u0027t nearly as hard as many think. So go tour all the moons of Jool, as that\u0027s the most interesting visuals we got ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nThe TWR thing, however, might require a bit of tinkering during the departure burn. TWR depends on the planet you\u0027re orbiting but at Kerbin, a TWR of about 0.75 means about a 5-6minute burn. This is about the lower limit on TWR for doing an efficient burn in 1 shot. With a TWR of only 0.26 or so, expect a 15-20 minute burn. This is NOT the way to go because it only takes 20 minutes to orbit Kerbin at 100km, meaning that most of the time you\u0027re nowhere near your node if you try to burn all at once.\n\nSo instead, break the burn up into however many 3-5 minute chunks you can live with, each done on successive orbits. Note, however, that once you reach 1000m/s of the burn, your Ap will be out around Minmus, meaning an orbit back to your Pe burn point will take several days to complete, which can screw up your window slightly. However, this is nothing a minor mid-course tweak can\u0027t fix en route."},{"CreatedByName":"Good_Cat","CreatedById":137286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:36:38Z","Content":"Cheers gents, i\u0027ll wait for Duna and maybe land on Ike, next time i\u0027ll adjust my e\n\nscape stage TWR so its higher i see wait you mean about the low TWR for escaping a SOI.\n\nNot going to Moho again that crew of 7 managed to return on the sheer luck of a half decent encounter i was lucky to find.

It\u0027s not about vacuum or atmo. It\u0027s about gravity or no gravity.

Not my brightest but all the other transfer windows were ages way and all the others came and went while i was still on my way there :S. However I managed to orbit, land, plant the flags, re-orbit, re-docked to the transfer, and returned to Kerbin\u0027s SOI with 700m/s dv still in the transfer tank, still came into atmo a little on the hot side of 3200m/s but still successful.
