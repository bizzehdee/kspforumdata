Well, kind of. Valentina\u0027s capsule found itself out of fuel and in an orbit about 125km by 67.5km, so I\u0027ve been patiently waiting for gradual aerobraking to bring her back down to Kerbin. On this current orbit, I noticed something whilst watching the apoapsis and periapsis figures on MechJeb - whilst out of the atnmosphere, the periapsis was rising and the apoapsis dropping!\n\nThe peripasis rose from 67.127km to 67.285m, and the apoapsis dropped from just over 111km to just under. Then, when the atmosphere was entered again, the orbit started decaying as normal. \n\nAt first I wondered whether the fact that I have MechJeb keeping the ship pointed retrograde might have had something to do with it, but even with that turned off, the same thing was happening. Odd.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T20:39:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T19:30:24Z","Content":"Were you by chance rotating the ship or anything? I believe that as the vessel rotates about the center of mass, the command part (capsule/probe core) is some meters away, thus reading a change in Ap/Pe height, while the true orbit (in regards to the center of mass) remains unchanged. Thus, this may just be a \u0022data reading oversight\u0022 by the mechanics of the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Aladran","CreatedById":2055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T19:32:20Z","Content":"RCS on?

Nothing like large enough for changing centre of mass to be causing over a hundred metres of lift of periapsis. I did think of that - which is why I tested with Mechjeb turned off (so that the ship remained pointing teh same direction) as well as with it on (so that the ship remained pointing retrograde).\n\nA rounding error is possible, but it seems odd that it\u0027s consistently raising the periapsis whilst the ship is above the atmosphere. Periapsis is at about the 9am position (erm, ok, about midway between dawn and midday, anyway) - did wonder whether it might be due to Kerbin orbiting Kerbol, but that\u0027d seem more likely if the periapsis wsa on the evening side of Kerbin. Or whether the fact that part of the orbit is in the upper atmosphere might be confusing things a tad. It\u0027s ciontinuing to occur in subsequent orbits, incidentally - just seen it creep up from 67.0km.. currently at 67.028km (and close to the 9pm position) by 108.934km\n\nAnyway, it\u0027s not large enough to bother me, and the ship IS still, overall, coming down, just thought I\u0027d mention it in case it\u0027s of interest. When I manage to get a ship into an orbit fully outside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, I\u0027ll look to see if it still happens.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T20:06:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Esme**"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T20:10:43Z","Content":"This has been reported before: [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3939](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3939)"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T20:39:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This has been reported before: [http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3939](http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/3939)\n\nAh, I wasn;t aware of that section of things.

I\u0027ll also recomend Navhud ([here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-1-0-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-2-1)) so you have some sort of navball while on eva. Send Val out of the ship while near periapsis and have her use the thrusters in her suit to push the module into a retrograde direction. You should be able to lower your Pe that way. Otherwise, it will take forever for that orbit to decay."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T17:08:16Z","Content":"Well, in Science she can.
