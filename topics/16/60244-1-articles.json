Send 1 crew to the other ship pod that was empty so I can use the propane left to help manouvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lost ship didnt have detach rings to separate from the main body, so I ram the fuel containers and just destroyed them when i had a trajectory close enough to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea was to fall on the rescue ship back using the 2 parachutes instaled on each arm, then detach the other ship pod and use its own... but it wont allow me to change ships on atmosphere flight \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I had to launch the ship in collision trajectory and burn prograde the rescue ship to stay in orbit, change to the other ship (had to reload several times to make sure I land on sea) wait for atmospheric decelaration release parachute and burn all the propane left to slow down the impact to the water (The canister is really heavy it was destroyed several times until I managed to get a slow enough landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovered the ship with the ocupant still alive and take back the rescue ship was easy pie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried the separatrons thing too, but thouse ladders are just undestructible. I could hit the can up to 20.1 m/s with 0 damage to the ladders. Hitting it faster than 20.2 m/s just blew the hole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the advice.
