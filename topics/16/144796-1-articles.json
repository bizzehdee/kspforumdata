Hello everybody.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat methods do you guys use to decide how many solar panels (or fuel cells) and batteries you need on your craft? I have been playing for a few weeks, and it appears that my decisions on the number of solar panels on my crafts are determined more by the available space on the hull than on its needs in terms of consumption of charge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I will be doing stuff in the dark, I stack more batteries onto the craft, but again, no actual method to choose how many... the number is generally chosen by the space in the service bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only actual thought (trick) that I use is to always disable one battery (I typically use 8 Z-100\u0027s of which I disable one, rather than 1 Z-k1), so that I can activate that to have some charge in case of an emergency (like when I forgot to extend the solar panels again, and only find out when I arrive at my destination).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T11:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Z100\u0027s are a much better deal for cost of course -- just so long as they are inside a bay, so they don\u0027t get exposed to drag and heat. For a krewed ship at the beginning of the game, your main electric use (when you get to that point) is going to be transmitting science back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. A big science transmission can use up 330 zaps. And you often have to do three or four transmissions at a time\u00A0when you get to a new biome. So 800 zaps worth of battery is a minimum, but a nice minimum. Maybe you have to wait a few minutes for the batteries to recharge before you can do the final transmission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you get to the point where you don\u0027t really want to have service bays on your rockets anymore, then the Z1k\u0027s start to be nice. Another point in their favor is when part counts start to matter in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you have a 30 part limit, and you need some electrical storage, then one big battery is the way to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Z200\u0027s are sometimes nice on spaceplanes\u00A0that also have a\u00A0small reaction wheel, for reentry. Holding an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E during reentry\u00A0often takes a little over 100 zaps. So storing 200 is a convenient amount\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two real scenarios where you need huge batteries are drilling for ore/converting ore to fuel -- and vessels with multiple ion drives. When you are drilling and converting, 5000 zaps of battery is perfectly reasonable. A multi-ion drive ship with 10000 zaps of storage is also perfectly reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main issue with solar is more one of \u0022if you do something to drain your batteries way down, what\u0027s an acceptable time to charge them back up again?\u0022 And usually that time is fairly long. 5 minutes? So you often don\u0027t need much in the way of solar. A bigger consideration with solar is arranging enough of them so that at least one is always in the light (when there is light). Another is leaving enough room so you can dock without breaking your panels off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again -- drilling/converting and ion drives require a handful of gigantors. You may need 50 zaps per second of continuous power for drilling \u0026amp; converting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T11:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned the hard way to always put a few ox-stats around to ensure some minimal power.

some parts are listed in EC/minute, others in EC/second). \u00A0I find it easier to convert everything to EC/second\u00A0because the solar panels are rated that way. \u00A0This value is your baseline and it\u00A0includes things such as probe cores, but it also includes drills,\u00A0ISRU, and science labs--anything that will come on and stay on for a long time. \u00A0If it has to run\u00A0longer than an orbit (or on the surface, run overnight), then it\u0027s part of the baseline for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, find your orbital darkness time. \u00A0The formula is not easy, so\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~bnichols8/projects/kspdarkness/main.shtml\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere: have a calculator\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0Multiply your darkness time by the\u00A0power drain to get some number in EC: \u00A0this the minimum amount of battery you need to cover the dark part of the orbit. \u00A0If you\u0027re landing instead, then\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Euse the wiki\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0or the in-game Knowledge Base (find it\u00A0in the Tracking Station) to find the rotation period of whatever you\u0027re landing on and use that to figure the rest. \u00A0If you want to add a\u00A0safety margin, this is when\u00A0to do so. \u00A0In your case, this is when\u00A0to add the battery that you lock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, you\u0027ll want to figure the power generation you need to charge the\u00A0batteries in one orbit. \u00A0For that, you need to know\u00A0(roughly) your orbital period. \u00A0You can figure it out by going to map mode, finding the difference between time to periapsis and time to apoapsis, and doubling that value.\u00A0 Subtract orbital darkness time from orbital period to get orbital light time. \u00A0Divide the battery EC you figured out earlier by the orbital light time to get some number in EC/second;

you get much less power near sunrise than at noon because at sunrise, the light has to go through more air. \u00A0For this reason, you may not want to use solar panels on the surface of Eve--Eve\u0027s atmosphere is both hot and thick. \u00A0But solar panels are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in Eve\u0027s orbit; they work nearly twice as well as at Kerbin. \u00A0Orientation is tricky with static panels; one solution is to put at least one facing each of the\u00A0six directions from your rocket. \u00A0The tracking panels are nice, but the funny thing about them is that if they ever do run out of power, they don\u0027t track. \u00A0That can be a problem if you run out of power behind a moon and have your panels facing the wrong way when you see the sun again. \u00A0Another thing to keep in mind that rotation in one axis only lets the panel face in directions\u00A0perpendicular to that axis--in other words, if you point the axis of rotation at the sun, your panel will never receive power no matter how it turns. \u00A0This happens to me frequently,\u00A0so\u00A0I always add at least one solar panel at right angles to the rest. \u00A0It looks odd, but it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFuel cells work well, but they obviously only work for so long as you have fuel for them. \u00A0One key advantage to them is that they produce power at a constant rate, so it\u0027s a simple calculation to determine how much fuel you need to bring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRTGs work well, also, especially since they don\u0027t require fuel, but they produce less power for the mass. \u00A0Each one takes .75 EC/second off the drain rate; but they generally are not suited to be a primary power supply for any except the smallest science probes. \u00A0Their advantage comes from the fact that they provide power all the time without your needing to do anything about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, sorry for the wall of text, but that\u0027s how I do it. \u00A0It may be overthinking, but I\u0027ve never had power problems after doing it this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T16:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222696129\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144796\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469806028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n38 minutes ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you take (say) a gravity reading and bring it back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, let\u0027s say you get 50 points for that.
