Diameter of port compared to diameter of station/ship module. The latter includes radial tanks, BTW, which increase the effective diameter of the module. In general, if the port is the same diameter as the module, it won\u0027t wobble unless the modules on either side (including any extra modules attached on the ends) is too massive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As mentioned above, the amount of mass on each side of the port. Even with ports the same diameter as the module, the strength of the joint does have an upper limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Distance of docking port joint from CoM of assembly. Ships rotate about their CoM so the further the joint is from the CoM, the more torque applied to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Conflicting torque from reaction wheels in several modules. This usually is only a problem if the modules aren\u0027t all facing the same direction when docked. IOW, the modules are docked nose-to-nose instead of nose-to-tail or, even worse, perpendicular to each other. Here you can disable the torque of selected SAS units and command pods and leave just those oriented in the direction of travel. This is really only an issue, however, if all torque values are about equal. A 2.5m reaction wheel unit will overpower a 1.25m unit in most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The presence of struts reinforcing the joint by connecting the modules to each other directly. Obviously, using struts will either eliminate wobble or reduce it to a manageable minimum. Here you have several options. If the modules only need rigidity en route to a destination but won\u0027t move together ever again once there, you can use normal struts installed in the VAB. Undocking the 1st time will break them, and thereafter you don\u0027t need them. Or you can use the Quantum Strut mod, which magically creates and breaks struts every time you dock and undock. Or, if that\u0027s too gamey for you, you can use KAS struts installed and removed by EVA Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the ship in your pic is doomed to wobble because 1) you\u0027re using 1.25m ports on 2.5m modules, and those modules are relatively massive anyway. However, a 2.5m port at the joint will probably solve the problem for you. I\u0027ve used many ships of that general configuration with 2.5m ports and haven\u0027t found the need for any strutting. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/jHings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3776/12281786604_fb9df69cda_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212281786604_fb9df69cda_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ship was made of 3 modules: The engines on the back, the orange tank in the middle, and the Mobile Lab and 4-way hub on the front. The 2 joints were simply 2.5m ports without any struts. The masses of the modules were within the capabilities of these ports, all the SAS modules (1 in each module) pointed the same way so there was no need to disable any of them, and there wasn\u0027t too much radial mass even with 4x LVNs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, despite being a pusher, not a puller, and not having any struts reinforcing the docking ports, it had essentially zero wobble, was perfectly controllable both thrusting and rotating, and was strong enough to survive aerocapture at both Duna (shown here) and back at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo like I said, you\u0027re entire problem is using a 1.25m port to connect 2.5m modules.
