KSP doesn\u0027t have that option.\n\nMy basic recommendation is to start watching Scott Manley (although I\u0027m pretty sure he doesn\u0027t encounter the parachute problem). [https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg)\n\nWarning: this may take awhile. He has several series. The most obvious would be \u0022career mode for beginners\u0022 which is just hitting spaceplanes and sending a probe to Duna. It is 7 hours (so far) of video. He has another 20\u002B tutorial videos (at ~20 minutes a pop) that detail particular issues (orbit, docking, planetary transfer), but don\u0027t expect them to be remotely current for 1.0.3. (but the basics of rocket science don\u0027t really change).\n\nThe basics piloting a rocket are blindingly simple once you understand them (but first you have to understand Keplerian mechanics), and largely consist of firing pro/retrograde to move the radius on the opposite side of your elliptical trajectory. Rocket building is mostly understanding delta-V, looking up the handy subway chart [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet) and breaking your rocket into a reasonable amount of stages of roughly equal delta-V (which adds up to at least the magic delta-V figure you need).\n\nThe details keep us playing the game and take awhile to learn (the bit about docking was literally Buzz Aldrin\u0027s doctoral dissertation: [http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12652](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12652) ). Squad also keeps changing every things release (some because of nerfing parts similar to a WoW nerf. Others because things like the aerodynamic upgrade make things closer to real rocket science)."},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:02:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At the risk of flames of doom, I\u0027ll bring up World of Warcraft.

Just something to think about.\n\nIf there are any hardcore WOW players who don\u0027t use outside references I\u0027ll be shocked. WOW may be casually playable without them, but outside references will always provide an advantage to the player who uses them.\n\nIMO, KSP\u0027s whole reason for existing is to give us a fun way to learn hard things about aerospace and orbital mechanics. Much of why I\u0027m still playing it two years and a thousand hours later is because while I\u0027m looking up something I need for my game I learn other fascinating things I\u0027d never have known to look for. It happened just last night when I was having trouble with a transfer orbit to geosync in my Realism Overhaul game. A casual mention of how some other transfer orbits use Lagrange points to save dV sucked me in, and KSP doesn\u0027t even have Lagrange points. But now I understand them better than I ever have before, and that makes me happy.\n\nVery few games have that kind of staying power. But I\u0027ve never thought of KSP as a \u0022game\u0022, anyway. It\u0027s a set of digital rocket Legos to play with. The gameplay parts, like career mode, are basically bolted on. There aren\u0027t even any victory conditions. In career, you play until you get bored or a new release breaks your save. How many games can\u0027t be won? Minecraft\u0027s a better comparison than WOW.

As the speed of an object increases, the drag force acting on the object, resultant of the substance it is passing through, increases. At some speed, the drag or force of resistance will equal the gravitational pull on the object At this point the object ceases to accelerate and continues falling at a constant speed called terminal velocity (also called settling velocity). An object moving downward with greater than terminal velocity (for example because it was thrown downwards or it fell from a thinner part of the atmosphere or it changed shape) will slow down until it reaches terminal velocity. Drag depends on the projected area, and this is why objects with a large projected area relative to mass, such as parachutes, have a lower terminal velocity than objects with a small projected area relative to mass, such as bullets."},{"CreatedByName":"TheSoundOfTrees","CreatedById":146842,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T04:06:29Z","Content":"I am quite new to the game.

The drag flips the pod the right way up and the blunt end kills the terminal velocity down to a parachute friendly speed.\n\nThat design is interesting. So by putting my goo canisters further down, hoping the weight would keep the fat part pointing at the angry atmo atoms that I am assaulting with my craft, I am actually creating more drag than the mass is worth and making it want to tip around? Interesting.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I am quite new to the game. For me, this patch just means that I have to restart my Science save and re-learn how things work now : more dangerous re-entry and descents even for basic level 1 rockets, different behaviour in the atmosphere ( for instance, one of my very basic rockets, who before always deviated a little to the west, now deviates a LOT to the east : free gravity turn ) , formerly safe designs becoming unsafe...\n\u003E I am not complaining : I like testing basic rockets, or I would not be playing Science. But other players may find this a little hard, especially just after a big sale.\n\u003E \n\u003E I wonder how my \u0022homemade landing pad and science lab protector\u0022 will do now. Back to testing.\n\nI\u0027m feeling you man. I got a C\u002B in Astrophysics when I went to university, so alot of the posts in this topic are about curves, or nodes, or points, or something that I have no idea what they are but am now rather curious about. Yeah okay, I have a Bachelor\u0027s of Arts. I\u0027m artsy. So it\u0027s going to take me a while. I\u0027ve managed to figure out what \u0022prograde\u0022 and \u0022retrograde\u0022 are, mostly from Scot Manley\u0027s wonderfully awesome videos. I\u0027m american so the accent amuses me. I was actually following along with his beginner tutorials in a different career save before 1.0.3 hit, but then things started blowing up that didn\u0027t before. As you and some other people have pointed out, now his videos have gotten dangerously outdated so I will have to just revert-revert-revert-OMG WHAT WAS THAT REVERT!-revert some more until I figure it out.\n\nI enjoyed the \u0022flames\u0022 about WoW (I\u0027m not offended don\u0027t worry). I wonder what would happen if I said something else, like... Eve Online? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) No, I\u0027m just kidding. This thread isn\u0027t about that!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T14:28:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bendyn**\n  \ntypos"}]}
