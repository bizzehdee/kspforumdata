Then you just drift around for five orbits, until you have a close encounter with Kerbin two Kerbin years later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to cut the drifting down to around one year: just burn prograde at the periapsis until you get an encounter.

You need to raise your apoapsis above Jool orbit in order to be able to slingshot in any useful direction. Returning to Kerbin is then matter of fiddling with the orbit to get a Kerbin intercept after you have returned to apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most straighforward approach is exiting Kerbin SOI retrograde to its orbital motion fast enough to get the desired periapsis altitude, then again fiddling with the orbit from apoapsis after you return there to get another Kerbin intercept in reasonable time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also save some dv compared with the second case if you burn for Eve intercept and use powered slingshot to get low Sun apoapsis (Eve Oberth effect is stronger than Kerbin\u0027s and you save some more dv by inverting your orbit by the slingshot). You need another Eve slingshot to return to Kerbin after that, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FREEFALL1984","CreatedById":104993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T16:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKasuha made a good point, if you\u0027re just aiming for a close kerbol approach you could try to slingshot your way down the planets, personally I would try and time it so the mun is 45 degrees to kerbins prograde and minmus is approaching almost 45 degrees past prograde (sorry my orbital terminology is slightly rust) then slingshot around the mun into a close encounter with minmus and burn at minmus peri to slow your kerbol orbital speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T17:57:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FREEFALL1984\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKasuha made a good point, if you\u0027re just aiming for a close kerbol approach you could try to slingshot your way down the planets, personally I would try and time it so the mun is 45 degrees to kerbins prograde and minmus is approaching almost 45 degrees past prograde (sorry my orbital terminology is slightly rust) then slingshot around the mun into a close encounter with minmus and burn at minmus peri to slow your kerbol orbital speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure you are wrong. Minmus is too light for oberth effect (so, why would you burn at minmus peri ?), and even Mun is too light for gravity assist. I really think jool would be the best bet.
