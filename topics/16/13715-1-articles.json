Burning toward 90\u00C2\u00B0 is much easier, since it gives you a bigger window to get into M\u00C3\u00BCnar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\\\u0027ve gotten that far, it\\\u0027s easiest to first get into a stable orbit around the M\u00C3\u00BCn (I like to use one around 30-50km). To do that, start retroburning once you get close to the Periapsis of your m\u00C3\u00BCnar orbit to get the AP down to approx. the same height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you\\\u0027ve achieved a stable orbit, you can retroburn once you\\\u0027re above a good landing spot to get a trajectory that is perpendicular to the Surface. Once you\\\u0027ve got that, you can go into powered descent, it might take a few tries to figure out when to start braking, but if you\\\u0027ve got some fuel to spare just make sure you don\\\u0027t get too fast and don\\\u0027t hit the Surface at more than ~7m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get rid of your lateral movement, make sure the X-ed green indicator on the navball is exactly on the zenith, this gets harder the slower you are but you can also use the RCS to keep it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helped,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lukas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: First post, yay =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knyght","CreatedById":22035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T21:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, basically that. Remember that you can kill your momentum, land, and get back safely with only a half tank of fuel and the small engine. You can probably also make your Munar orbit burn with only this tank, but this is pushing it if you\\\u0027re a bit new to landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust always point your craft at the green retrograde marker when descending, after a while it should point roughly upwards. Then you can let go until you need to burn to land. Some lateral movement is okay, but try to keep it as low as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I prefer to keep my orbit low, around 10K max. The lower your orbit, the less speed you have to kill, which is nice because you can choose your landing spot a bit more accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso 7m/s is still pretty fast.
