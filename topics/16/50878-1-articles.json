Also, if you switch to Docking mode, and then hit space to switch to Linear mode that will eliminate the roll you are going to get with the reaction wheels, but will still maintain control. If you are using anything other than RCS for propulsion you run the risk of going to fast and causing your wheels to break.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deepspacecreeper","CreatedById":84329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T01:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edo i have to use some sort of propulsion to move a rover? do the wheels move the rover on itself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw im using the stock rover\u002Bskycrane\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T03:36:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by deepspacecreeper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T06:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you turn off the parking brake?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T07:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stock rover is \u0022rover \u002B skycrane\u0022, you\u0027ll want to get rid of the rockety part before you drive it, the rockets are just for landing the rover.
