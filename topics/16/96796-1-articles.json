I always use Earth time, 365/24.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the official KSP wiki you can find the orbital parameters for all the KSP bodies. For Moho we find that its Longitude of Ascending Node (LAN) is 70 degrees. (We don\u0027t know what direction 0 degrees is yet but we\u0027ll get to that.) Moho\u0027s orbit crosses the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit twice, once going up and once going down. These two must be exactly 180 degrees apart, so we now deduce that Moho\u0027s descending node is at 250 degrees. This means if you leave Kerbin when it is at 70 degrees or 250 degrees you will be exactly in the plane of Moho\u0027s orbit. We determine these times by noting that the wiki says Kerbin\u0027s Mean Anomoly at 0s UT is 3.14 radians. This equals about 179.9 degrees, so now we know where Kerbin starts. Since Kerbin\u0027s orbit is circular it moves the same speed at all times, which is 360 degrees every 9,203,545 seconds, or 106.52251 Earth days. This is 3.3795673 degrees per day. Therefore Kerbin first crosses Moho\u0027s descending node at (250-179.9)/3.3795673 = 20.7423 days after game start and crosses Moho\u0027s ascending node at (360\u002B70-179.9)/3.3795673= 74.003556 days after game start. Since the game starts at day 1 (and not day 0!) that means you can first launch from Kerbin into the plane of Moho\u0027s orbit on day 21.7423 and day 75.0036, and every 106.5225 days after those two dates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The reverse question is trickier, when is Moho in the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit? We know it will be when Moho is at 70 or 250 degrees, but because Moho\u0027s orbit is not circular it does not move the same distance every day. You have to use a Kepler algorithm to get the exact times. Moho first crosses Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane on days 13.128 and 25.09, and every 25.6453 days after those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E An even more interesting challenge is determining when, for instance, Eve crosses the plane of Moho\u0027s orbit. Now you have to cross-multiply the normal vectors of the two orbit planes (which you find by cross-multiplying the radius and velocity vectors at a chosen time) to get the angle of the nodes, then use a Kepler algorithm to find when the planets are first at those points.
