My current solution is controling\u00A0the ailerons\u0027 deploy angle by\u00A0Kal-1000, and link the kal-1000\u0027s play position to yaw input. I ran into the\u00A0problem of can\u0027t find a way to make Aileron Airbreak automaticlly return to 0 after i finish pressing the yaw input (in this case A or D), it\u0027s stuck on whatever the KAL play position is. Is there a way to play the KAL-1000\u0027s play positon only when pressing a button and reset automaticlly when that button is releaset?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-16T16:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, not that I\u0027m aware of.
