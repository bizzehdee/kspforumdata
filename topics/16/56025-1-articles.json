I have build a plane that will fly me to the Arctic poles of the Kerbin, so here is the question, I am having a problem landing on the arctic surface, and I need some ideas on how to land, even if they are crazy. Whenever I land my plane freaks out and crashes, and it is a 30 min flight on 4x speed. Plz help lol trial and error is not working so well for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E thanks! PS. When I land i did make sure that the setting 1x was on but I will post pictures of my plane on here, I am about mid-campaign with beginner planes!

Consider ctrl-clicking your tanks to transfer remaining fuel from the back to the front of the plane before landing to bring it\u0027s balance back (and consider changes to your design to draw from tanks evenly or to arrange the center of mass when dry to be closer to the center of mass when full).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
