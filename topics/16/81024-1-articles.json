I Aerobroke (braked?) and have an orbit with the 100 km periapsis and an apoapsis around the orbit of the furthest moon (~170,000 km). I have 2100 m/s to burn but my orbit is inclined ~5-7 degrees wrt the plane of the Jool system. I think if I\u0027m going to swing by all the moons (orbits aren\u0027t going to be possible) I will need gravity assist? What do I do, set up the encounter with Pol and then arrange it so it points me at the next moon? How do I arrange that? Any systematic way or do I just try things?

I won\u0027t say it\u0027s impossible, but suggest you try something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re content with very eccentric orbits around the moons, you can get from moon to moon at about 300-500m/s each time. You\u0027ll have to bide your time before you can move on, but it isn\u0027t difficult. I can\u0027t gurantee that you can make it to all five moons, but the four that are about on the same plane are certainly possible. Skip Bop at first -- if you have enough dV left in the end, you may as well reach it from Pol; and the plane change will be much cheaper, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking about plane change, you can use every encounter to effect a plane change as well. You may try to meet the plane of the moons during your first encounter; alternatively, try to make it so that after your encounter, the AN/DN sit as close to the apses (apsises?) as possible. Doing a plane change near a far-out apoapsis is quite cheap. And there\u0027s always the possibilty of not doing a plane change at all. You\u0027ll have to wait much longer for a good encounter.... but if you don\u0027t mind spending a few years in timewarp, something is bound to come around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, nothing prevents you from combining all of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T11:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, go to your config file and increase number of conic patches visible if you have not done it yet.
