For Ease, I am showing 3 pictures. First is the entire rocket on the pad, no UI showing, 2nd is the Orbital Ops stage in the VAB as I did not wish to dig through my imageshack to find it in orbit operations, 3rd well below the other 2 is the full rocket again on the pad THIS time with its vital stats showing. also, this is not even the largest thing or the most awkward thing to be launched in my version of the game. Below all of this is THE MOST painful thing I have launched and I barely even manged it with MechJeb fighting it all the way into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/6/7hr6.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/large/6/7hr6.png\u0022 alt=\u00227hr6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/11/jvra.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/scaled/large/11/jvra.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jvra.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me to get THIS nasty into orbit, I had to have MechJeb, there was no other way short of an edit into orbit, which was tempting.
