With that kind of part assault it could be that it\\\u0027s not even hung, just taking 24 hours or so to load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\\\u0027ve misunderstood or it still hangs after reducing to a reasonable number of parts, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

I don\\\u0027t have any failures to work with; presumably there will either be an error message within the loading method, or the next part after the last successful one is the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsoramaki","CreatedById":9322,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-17T06:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah KSP takes longer to load the more you install add on parts.
