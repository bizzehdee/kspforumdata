The fairing blows off when you decouple under it. Besides that, you can attach anything you want, really. Any fuel crossfeed capable part can provide fuel to the rocket, so you could have a rocket on a wing and attach a fuel line to it and it would work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T12:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECommand pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, you just got to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dave4002000","CreatedById":41394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T13:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA decoupler is really going to be the only logical part to connect to the bottom of any rocket motor.
