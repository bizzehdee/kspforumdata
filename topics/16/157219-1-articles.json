I just dropped down to Duna at about 40km. Duna\u0027s atmosphere is pretty thin that high up so it won\u0027t help all that much, but you won\u0027t need a shield either (and it counts as \u0022atmospheric flight on Duna\u0022 for the tourists).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there, just hit the brakes at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0like normal or, if your timing\u0027s right, head straight to Ike for a bit of a gravity brake.
