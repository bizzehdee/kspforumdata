For example, you can take an EVA report in orbit and another on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of having two astronauts is that you can split up the ship. For example, take an MK-2 to the Mun. Fit it with a smaller lander, featuring a one kerbal lander can on the top. One kerbal can now stay in the main ship, whilst the other gets transferred to the lander can. Which in turn lands, then comes back into orbit. People will disagree but I feel this is the easiest way to make it to the Mun, and is great practice for larger missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you only took one kerbal, you wouldn\u0027t be able to control the main ship to perform the rendezvous once he left it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T03:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you only took one kerbal, you wouldn\u0027t be able to control the main ship to perform the rendezvous once he left it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm, actually, in career mode you unlock probes pretty early, and solar panels, sooooooooooooo...........\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garek","CreatedById":73214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T12:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo reasons why I, personally, need multi-seat pods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t like to send a kerbal far out into space all alone - that\u0027s pure RP, there is no gameplay reason for this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I can use my regular manned craft for rescue missions - might actually be more difficult than just using an empty pod with probe control, didn\u0027t test it yet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I would conclude that although it offers no real improvement from a gameplay perspective, there are reasons to use it, depending on your play style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T13:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s lonely up there, and Jeb needs someone to hold the controls while he moons mission control or takes a nap.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T13:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoint of each part is variety.
