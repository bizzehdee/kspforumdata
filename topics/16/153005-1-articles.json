If you have a long tail, make sure there\u0027s enough clearance for you to take off and land without banging it into the ground. \u00A0This can be done with longer landing gear, placing the landing gear on the lowest part of the plane, or using a tailpiece that has an upward sloping underside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.

This should be over 1 when reaching the limits of there operating altitude. Most ram jets and turbo ram jets get increased thrust when over mach 1. So to save fuel my flight profile is pretty steep, the quicker you can get to high altitude the less fuel you will burn to get there. so you can keep you craft lighter. around 20-30 degrees until reaching about 8000m, velocity usually starts to decrease at this point so to keep building speed pitch down slowly,\u00A0start pitching down achieving 5-10 degrees of pitch around 10-12km. this is when the drag from the atmosphere really starts to decrease and velocity really starts increasing. Keep a low angle of attack\u00A0here and build as much speed as possible before reaching 20-22km. at this point your engines will have almost no thrust and will barely keep you going 1100m/s to 1300m/s. at this point i switch to a closed cycle engine preferably with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of .7 as a minimum, as you burn fuel it will get higher and thanks to the lift of the wings is sufficient. but the faster you can accelerate the less gravity losses you will experience. When i turn to closed cycle engines i pitch up gradually so that I can get to the thinner atmosphere quicker. reduced drag lossess on d\u0027/v when my plane is about 35-40 km i pitch to almost 0 and start building speed until in orbit. Recently i\u0027ve been launching with space planes exclusively and through lots of testing this is the most efficient way to get to orbit that i have found. Only bring enough jet fuel to carry you to 20-22km, this will save weight and increase the d\u0027v of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines. any other questions id be happy to help. Space planes are infinitely fun to play with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RentedTritium","CreatedById":172096,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-05T17:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait I thought additional intakes helped you keep going as you got higher?
