What most people care about for jets is fuel efficiency for distance. The common approach to that is to fly high and fast. Flying high lowers drag and thus the thrust needed to maintain speed. Flying fast means that you consume less fuel per distance because you cover it faster.\n\nA single turbo jet super cruises at 1 km/s for .15-.25 fuel drain rate. A basic jet does 200 m/s for around .06 fuel drain rate.\n\n0.25/1000 = 0.00025 \u003C 0.0003 = 0.06/200.\n\nUnder those conditions, the turbo is more efficient. Even if my fuel drain for basic jet is off, the speed advantage is it\u0027s own reward. Also flying high gives you massive potential energy. You can glide the last 500 km of flight on no fuel!\n\nUnless you do a lot of low altitude flight, turbo jets tend to be better on whole when you balance all concerns."},{"CreatedByName":"s1l3nt_c0y0t3","CreatedById":83477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T23:45:26Z","Content":"Also, the mk2 tanks you\u0027re using are marked as LFO tanks. Your plane doesn\u0027t appear to have any rockets on it, so you don\u0027t need any oxidizer. Try switching those to just the liquid fuel tanks. They\u0027re lighter and hold more of the fuel you actually need."}]}
