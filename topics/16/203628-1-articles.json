I can right-click on them, and see some information, but that doesn\u0027t give me a control dialog, the way it would for a regular science part. After removing a part from storage the Kerbal, and places that can store the part are outlined in blue. Clicking the part on the Kerbal does nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf go into the EVA build mode, I can\u00A0remove the surface experiments from storage, and drop them on the ground.

Apparently it gets heavier every time it\u0027s picked up! At the same time, I can still pick up other deployed science experiment parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also tried to deploy these parts on the Mun, and see the same behavior. I have tried placing them with an engineer, and a scientist Kerbal. That doesn\u0027t change the observed behavior either, except the scientist can\u0027t use EVA build mode. So the scientist can\u0027t even place the parts on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E mod installed, but I\u0027m not using it to manipulate the deployed science parts.

So you either need to remove them from the craft when you design it, or have extra inventory slots to hold them while you handle the deployable science, or be an engineer so that you can put the chute and EVA rig\u00A0on the ground in build mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAllowing any kerbal to grab a deployable part, put it on the ground, click to bring up the context dialog, and then click deploy would be more intuitive.
