I\u0027m trying to land ships on Duna with DRE. But designing them with heat shields and still landing them is a pain. If I do need a heat shield, can I just use a fairing from Proc fairings instead of the ablatives? I want to land a few of my ships on their sides, so I need to protect the landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T01:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found that landing o Duna from a low orbit (50-75km up) results in little to no re-entry effects (stock, dunno about DRE). I think you can get away with no heat shield. Also, fairings, I believe, do not have higher heat tolerances than anything else (only the ablatives do). Their effectiveness (aside from attractiveness) is only with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plainawesome","CreatedById":76282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T01:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can slow yourself down well enough before or while you re-enter, you might make it, but this is DRE we are talking about so you could quicksave and then YOLO it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T01:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done a few Duna landings with DRE before, and I can confirm that if you\u0027re coming in from a decently low orbit, you don\u0027t really even need a heat shield at all unless you plan on doing some aerobraking as part of your initial orbital capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
