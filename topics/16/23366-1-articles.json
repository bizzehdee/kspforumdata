This makes your life a heck of alot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. start slowing your approach at the 2m mark roughly, low amounts of thrust and work on nulling out your seperation distance. This is achieved by burning a bit \u0022off course\u0022 away from the retro-marker (but on the side of the retro-marker) and getting the retro-marker on the pink bullseye. If your retro-grade is pointing at a pitch of 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, but the bullsye is at a pitch of 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, pitch down to -5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and thrust. This will move your retro-marker towards the bullseye. Once its on the bullsye, cut thrust and point at the retro-marker. start thrusting again, adjust as necessary. Coming in at 50 m/s at 1Km is bad, so make sure you slow down to adjust for it. When within 100m, kill your motion and then move forward at about 2 m/s until roughly 15\u002Bm away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There is no friction, any course corrections will need to be canceled later on. If you translate left, you need to translate right to counteract it. Slow, careful applications of RCS thrust is vital, you cant just mash a button to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
