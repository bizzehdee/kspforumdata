Did the scan and moved back to a high Kerbin orbit. Have a Z-200 battery pack and 4 solar panels. Rather than adjust at AP and shoot into Kerbin reentry quickly, I decided to head to PE and burn retro to gradually bring the orbit and my speed down (I had extra Delta V). So I warp down to PE and I guess I had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on, and the probe was turned away from the sun, and zapped my juice. I realized I should have placed the solar panels better as they are all tilted towards to top of the probe which is pointed away. But to fix this, I warped around for a while, hoping the probe will turn enough to fix the issue, but it just doesn\u0027t seem to turn toward the sun at this orbit. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ESo what do I do?
