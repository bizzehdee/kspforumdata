To be clear, I\u0027m not looking for a listing/spreadsheet of which planet allows what experiment at which altitude. I\u0027m looking for a single number. How many science points can you collect, assuming you were being fairly thorough and complete in visiting every celestial body with every available experiment in tow? I think I remember that last I checked, the stock tech tree takes about 12,500 science to unlock, and you can get that much from just Kerbin and the Mun (and maybe just starting on Minmus). Obviously the other celestials lack biomes and aren\u0027t this rich, but there\u0027s quite a few of them and they have higher multipliers. So how much would we be looking at in total? 25k, 30k, 40k? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing this number - or at least a reasonably accurate estimate, something within a margin of error of a thousand - could be quite useful when designing custom tech trees.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-23T14:18:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2014 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T09:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI read there are about 70k points to collect.
