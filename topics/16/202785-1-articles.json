And my impression was that KSP likes to allocate lots of RAM\u003Csup\u003E(*)\u003C/sup\u003E, but doesn\u0027t really use much of it at any time. I.e. even with a large craft in the physics bubble the machine isn\u0027t swapping, but it is the CPU that is the bottleneck. My guess is that your \u0022CPU\u0022 isn\u0027t at 100% because KSP uses only about 1.5(**) cores of your CPU and the other cores are idle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. (*) It may be that this isn\u0027t really allocated RAM that is actually swapped out, but memory mapped files.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(**) My guess is that only one core is used for the physics simulation, i.e. the big CPU hog of KSP,\u00A0 and tasks around updating the display etc. can happen in another thread (=core).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-30T20:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is limited by CPU more than anything. The reason the game slows down with high part count vessels inside physics range is because it needs to calculate the interactions of all those hundreds of parts, every frame, and it does so using one single processor thread because that\u0027s how the physics engine works. Most modern CPUs have multiple cores to allow lots of stuff to happen at the same time, but KSP can\u0027t use those other cores.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding parts mods, especially those with detailed interiors or high-definition textures, will increase your RAM use considerably, as do planet packs (I think); adding more RAM will give you more room to add more mods, but it won\u0027t make the game run any faster if you\u0027re flying with a multi-hundred part vessel nearby.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
