While constructing a rocket to put the M700 into Kerbin orbit, trying to assign the actions (toggle operation of) of the scanner to an Action Key, I\u0027m finding I\u0027m not allowed to select the M700 scanner... clicking on it (all parts of it) does nothing. I can select the Surface Scanning Module, but not the M700. Any idea of what\u0027s up with that? A bug??\n\nNote: I already have [SCANsat-v12.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369) installed and working.
