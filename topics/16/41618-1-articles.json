This is essentially a measure of delta-V per unit of fuel. The nuclear engines have high ISP in vacuum, but low in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat gives an engine high ISP is a high exhaust velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s more to efficiency than just ISP. For example, one of the little 909\u0027s has very high ISP, but if you stick it at the bottom of a heavy rocket it will use up almost all the fuel without even being able to get you off the pad! In other words, you need enough thrust to have an efficient launch profile. This is why mainsails are not a bad choice for the first stage of a large rocekt despite their low ISP. They give you oodles of thrust, which they provide by throwing huge quantities of exhaust mass out the back of your rocket at an alarming rate, but at relatively low exhaust velocity (compared with a nuclear engine in space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, LVT30\u0027s are fantastic little engines. They weigh less than LVT45s but produce more thrust, and have at least decent ISP even in the atmosphere. The only drawback is that they do not have any vectoring, but that\u0027s OK.. as long as you have at least one engine with vectoring as well, you should be fine. Indeed, having engines on radial stacks that *don\u0027t* vector their thrust can be advantaeous for stability and efficiency. Long story short: LVT30\u0027s are really great engines to stick on booster columns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T15:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T15:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki\u0027s got a pretty good \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts#Liquid_Fuel_Engines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echart\u003C/a\u003E that compares liquid fuel engines to one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten to where I like Skippers a great deal, especially as a middle-stage engine.

The efficiency varies with altitude, and smoothly slides between the \u0027Atmosphere\u0027 and \u0027Vacuum\u0027 numbers as the pressure decreases. Interestingly, the lack of a third point at a higher-than-Kerbin\u0027s-Sealevel pressure means that if you go someplace with a thicker atmosphere, like Jool or Eve, the efficiency flatlines at its \u0027Atmosphere\u0027 level even if you\u0027re at several atm of pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key thing is that burn rate is determined by a combination of the thrust and the Isp. Two engines with the same Isp but different thrust will burn fuel at different rates. The LV-T30 and LV-T45 for example. The LV-T45 burns fuel at a slower rate because it produces less thrust. Crucially, however, because their Isp stats are the same, you\u0027ll get the same effect out of both of them: The T30 just does it a bit faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exception is during ascent, because if you don\u0027t have enough thrust to efficiently overcome atmospheric drag and gravity, the extra efficiency gets wasted while you\u0027re \u0027stuck in the mud\u0027, so to speak. Using larger numbers of the more fuel efficient engines doesn\u0027t always help either, because the extra weight reduces the overall efficiency of the rocket, which can easily end up more than compensating for the more efficient fuel burn of the engines (LV-Ns are especially guilty of this, being so absurdly heavy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space, the thrust level almost doesn\u0027t matter: if your thrust is low you just do a longer burn. In this case higher Isp is almost always better. The sole exception is if your overall thrust to weight ratio ends up being so low that you can\u0027t complete the maneuver during the window you have to do so. This doesn\u0027t happen as often as you\u0027d think, except with Ion powered probes that are way too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T15:58:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T17:04:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Talonsin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Talonsin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I see a mainsail and then another one with half the thrust, does that mean it uses half the fuel as the mainsail?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes it uses half the fuel but because it also produces half the thrust, the efficiency of those engines is the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have pointed out, the measure of engine efficiency is \u0022ISP\u0022, higher is better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T17:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s five main variables:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the mass of the engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the thrust produced by the engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the Isp of the engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- drag of the engine part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- whether the engine has thrust vectoring\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously drag only matters in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you keep the other variables fixed, higher Isp, lower mass, higher thrust, lower drag are the right directions to go.
