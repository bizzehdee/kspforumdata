My starting point is the cupola with the science center next. I then connect an I-beam (200) to the science just below the side hatch. But then I\u0027m unable to connect a hitchhiker module to the end of the i-beam. What gives? I did manage to connect a mk-2 fuel tank. Similarly, I can\u0027t attach a fuel tank onto the BZ-52 radial attachment point in an intelligent manner. It never wants to snap onto the connection point, rather it attempts to attach the tank sideways. Suggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T05:51:33Z","Content":"If you hold the mod key (Alt in Windoze) while attaching, it forces node attachment rather than surface attachment.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T05:55:28Z","Content":"Great! That helps for the radial!\n\nI was able to connect a Rockomax X200-8 Fuel tank to the end of the I-beam and place the hitchhiker on top of it. So it appears to be specific to the hitchhiker.

The difference between fuel tank and hitchhiker is that fuel tanks can be surface attached while hitchhiker cannot. Did you surface attached the fuel tank?"},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T06:16:21Z","Content":"I surfaced attached the tank.

Some parts allow surface-attach, others don\u0027t.\n\nHere\u0027s the config for the hitchhiker:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts/Command/hitchhikerStorageContainer/hitchikerStorageContainer.cfg](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts/Command/hitchhikerStorageContainer/hitchikerStorageContainer.cfg)\n\n...note the line that says:\n\nattachRules = 1,**0**,1,1,0\n\nPer the [config file documentation](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Attachment_rules), it\u0027s that 0 in the second slot that\u0027s the smoking gun here-- it says \u0022do not allow surface attach.\u0022\n\nSharpy has pointed out a way to do this with a cubic octagonal strut.\n\nAnother approach would be to attach something that *is* surface-attachable, and then attach your hitchhiker vertically above or below that."}]}
