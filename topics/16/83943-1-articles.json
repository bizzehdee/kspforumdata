Just after I loaded him up and started aiming for the de-orbit vector, I saw a gray dot appear. It was moving some ~200m/s relative to me and I was like \u0022woot, what could possibly be around here?\u0022. I moved my mouse over the dot and it red \u0022Jebbediah Kerman\u0022. A chill went up my spine as I watched him get closer and closer, the thing is - Jebbediah died around a week ago on a botched landing on a return mission from Pol, WTF! As he got to be within 1km of my craft, I tried to hit the - button to switch to him, \u0022maybe the game didn\u0027t save right or something?\u0022 I thought. Just as I pressed the button, a massive, bloodied, green head covered my screen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was Jebbediah. His helmet was smashed in, one of his eyes was missing and so was most of his jaw. There was torn skin everywhere and strange crystalline structures protruding out of his skull. He was moving what was left of his jaw, almost as if trying to crack a smile. The whine from his eva suits air tank suddenly stopped and turned into a loud gurgle as he grabbed a hold on my little shuttle. BANG BANG, he was smashing his arm against the airlock with unnatural force. Dudeman was flipping the fk out as the shuttle rumbled and the gurgle spelled out \u0022WAI U LEAVE ME? I AM COME HOME\u0022. I maxed the throttle, the kick from the acceleration left me breathless for a moment, but just for a moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was out of fuel! I checked the tracking screen and spotted Jebbediah Kerman a few kilometers away. Initially he was moving ~100m/s away from me but gradually he was closing the dV between us. I ordered dudeman to get out there and push the craft with his suit, we needed just some 15dV to drop out of orbit. The screens flickered as Jebbediah stopped moving away from us and started approaching. 4km and closing. Dudeman was doing a good job with the pushing though and the craft was light. I counted down the remaining dV.. 4.. 3.. 2.. thump. I was glad to see that we were now on route to land on Kerbin but wait, where is Jebbediah on the tracking screen? Dudeman, come in! Dudeman, whats going on, can you see anything? Silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was nothing else to do but to strap in and wait, it would be 14 minutes before my shuttle actually reaches any significant atmosphere. Gradually the familiar gurgling sound builds up and is shaking the craft once more. \u0022I WAS HUNGRY, SORRY, SO SORRY\u0022 echoes in the pod. I can only imagine what happened to dudeman. The banging on the airlock starts up again, 8 minutes. The metal door won\u0027t hold for much longer, I realized as I stared at the bumps appearing on the inside. I suited up as a counter measure to the inevitable leak. As the air rushes out, I can see a bloody stump trying to force its way in through the bent edge of the airlock door. Inhumane screams fill whats left of the air inside as I realize that we just hit the atmosphere. There was smoke and fire blasting in through the damaged door, I couldn\u0027t see anything as the pod tumbled through re-entry at terrible speeds. I heard the parachutes deploy and g force involved knocked my head against the seat and it was lights out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a crackly voice, I couldn\u0027t make out what it was saying as I came to. Hissss... I suddenly realized that that would be the radio, It was KSP ground control inquiring what happened. The smoke had mostly cleared out and moonlight was shining through the airlock doorhole, the door had apparently been blown away during re-entry. Still disoriented, I climbed out of the pod. There was nearly nothing left of the shuttle, burning pieces of metal illuminated the desert I appeared to have landed on. There was a twinkle of light in the distance, as it got closer I heard it to be a helicopter. I was trying to radio KSP mission control to tell them what happened but I realized.. I couldn\u0027t speak. I lifted my hand to touch my face, only to realize that my hand was gone, it was but a bloody stump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPanicking, I looked for the first aid kit, the shock must have numbed my senses because I couldn\u0027t feel anything. Realizing it had been destroyed in the crash, I watched the copter land and desperately rushed towards it. The first responders jumped out of the copter and ran towards me, I was out of breath so I fell on my knees. As they got within 10 feet from me they suddenly stopped and slowly started backing away. I reached for them, why wouldn\u0027t they help me? One of them got on the radio and said \u0022this can\u0027t be real.. its.. Jebbediah.\u0022 I was confused, I looked behind me, there was nobody there. As I looked back towards them, they were now running back towards the copter at full speed. I got up and followed them. Just as the copter took off, I wrapped myself around the landing struts.
