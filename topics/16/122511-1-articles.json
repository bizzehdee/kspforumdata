Flied pretty well on the first test, to be honest. The only issue was that I was getting an awful lot of wobble on the pitch-axis whenever I manually pitched up - especially while turning. Is this just an inevitable feature of flying a big plane without using a joystick (I do realise there are on-screen joystick mods) or are there some features and design tricks I\u0027m missing for increased pitch-axis (longitudinal ?) stability?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can upload some screenshots of the plane later, but it basically looks like a C-160, or any two-engine turboprop cargo plane, but with a relatively small and probably poorly designed tail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Champ","CreatedById":96425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T14:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would guess you need more rigidity.

If your craft is heavy, it only starts turning after this 1 second. But then it has built up momentum! And you overshoot your desired pitch.

Canards are bad for stable flight--once the nose starts pitching up, the canard surface gains angle of attack, which makes more nose lift, so you can get large oscillations. OTOH, when the nose pitches up, the tail surface gains lift which makes the nose drop, which decreases the size of oscillations. A longer tail lever will give you more stability also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
