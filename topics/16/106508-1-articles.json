Real space programs do this for weight reasons, KSP does it for performance reasons. \n\nYour contract sounds reasonable, but you\u0027ve put about 150 extra parts in there that weren\u0027t asked for ^^; Unfortunately KSP is often a balance of part count vs the look you actually want. Some players accept 2 fps and magnificent creations, some (like myself) keep everything below 80 parts and have a green clock all the way. In the end you\u0027ll just have to choose for yourself which way you want to go ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"OtakuD","CreatedById":116561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:21:35Z","Content":"Ok cool thanks, are there easy ways to see part count?
