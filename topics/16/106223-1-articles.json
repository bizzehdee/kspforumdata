I used KER to check, and the dV values are the same between the two (~1500dV), so I have to wonder what the culprit is here. It could be the engine power nerf (it\u0027s a Rockomax 48-7S, which took a massive hit in thrust), but I\u0027m wondering if anyone else has had issues like this."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:31:01Z","Content":"Engines were nerfed, the Mun\u0027s gravity did not change.\n\nLower thrust means more losses to gravity drag.\n\nOthers have lower Isp, which also means less dV."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:53:39Z","Content":"That\u0027s the thing, though: the losses due to gravity on an airless body should be minimal with an efficient landing sequence, even with lower TWR. Indeed, the best fuel margins I managed were around 2% with that lander in 1.0, slowing down horizontally at periapsis and only having to fight gravity for 1.5km. That doesn\u0027t really add up, particularly since a similar level of fuel use with the previous version of that engine handled over 5km vertical speed killed. The ISP was not changed for the engine at all, as I noted with the dV rating for the craft being identical between the two versions. A TWR drop from ~5 to ~2.5 should not result in a 15% increase in dV required to land. That pretty much just leaves the Mun\u0027s gravity as the culprit."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:00:45Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure the 48-7S got a hefty hit to Isp as well... 300s now instead of 350s.\n\nBetter check the stats in the VAB - Kerbal Engineer may simply be calculating it wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:00:49Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably the engine still.
