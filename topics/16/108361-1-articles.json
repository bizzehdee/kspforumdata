Anyway I\u0027ve made a simple Rover but when I test it on the Runway it drives in reverse by itself. I.e. without any keyboard input, it just reverses. Brakes do not even stop it. ITs basically just a frame with wheels! \n\nAny ideas, I\u0027ve attached a pic.\n\n![25zm4n5.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/25zm4n5.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T06:13:15Z","Content":"Most likely your trim is set to non zero.\n\nAlt \u002B X should clear that up."},{"CreatedByName":"funkcanna","CreatedById":138944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T06:30:20Z","Content":"Hey, didn\u0027t even know about trim!

This is happening with all rovers I try to make but rockets handle perfectly (i.e. they don\u0027t move by themselves!)\n\nEDIT: This is also happening with the Stock Rover which I loaded up in the VAB indicating this is a fault and not something I\u0027m doing wrong! Maybe someone can move this thread to the support forum?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T09:06:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 09:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funkcanna**"},{"CreatedByName":"TopGull","CreatedById":83617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:53:02Z","Content":"Are you playing with a joystick?

In other words, landing with the brakes on doesn\u0027t work, but once I command the rover to move, then the brakes will have a proper grip. Weird, but as long as there\u0027s a circumvention I\u0027ll cope. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T00:13:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beowolf**"}]}
