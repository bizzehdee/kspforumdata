I\u0027m hauling a separate lander around for Duna/Ike, as I like to have a reusable cruising stage for my landers.\n\nThe big Kerbodyne engine has better ISP and thrust than the Skipper, however, so that was my choice for this mission. And I want to try it out.\n\nAt the moment, it looks like I\u0027m going to be sending both, though. I realised that I can\u0027t fit a survey scanner on the Kerbodyne rocket because not enough ports, and the LV-N system will be ideal for sending the lab, refinery, miner, and fuel tanks over to set up a station.\n\nAnd since I have two stages UP there, why not reuse?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T10:56:40Z","Content":"It also has a much higher mass. \n\nISp converts to delta-V only with connection of dry to wet weight ratio. If you attach an Oscar-B to a Reliant (ISp 300), you\u0027ll get much more delta-V than from Oscar-B attached to Rhino - simply because burning 80kg of fuel can get 1.25 tons of the engine moving way, way faster than the same 80kg accelerating nine tons of metal.\n\nThe effect only changes when the wet-dry ratios change. When you are pushing 300 tons of fuel ahead of you, whether you use a 9 ton engine or a 1 ton engine doesn\u0027t matter much - but how the engine utilizes that fuel matters a lot.\n\nThat, amongst all, makes both LV-N and Skipper not particularly good for short flights, as they both weight 3 tons. Additionally, LV-N \\*must\\* be used with LF-only fuel tanks, or all the benefits of the high ISp are totally nullified by abysmal dry-to-wet weight ratio of LF\u002BOx tanks with oxidizer removed."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:45:49Z","Content":"I always go with whichever is lightest to put into orbit. \n\n The LV-N doesn\u0027t outperform chemical rockets for the same mass until you get out towards Jool, so I\u0027d recommend looking at the LV-909 or Poodle depending on how much payload you\u0027re moving.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:49:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Since LV-N\u0027s are useless in atmosphere, I think it\u0027ll depend on whether you want to stop by Ike.
