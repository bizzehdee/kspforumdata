Basically had a command mod\u00A0in a very low orbit and had a small lander undock and head for the surface, thinking a very low orbit would mean an easier meet up later. The lander landed\u00A07k from\u00A0target so had to EVA BoB to his new craft, as this was a rescue mission\u00A0(nightmare!). By this time it was dark and the lander had no power so I time accelerated. When the sun rose the future didn\u0027t look so bright as the command mod was missing.
