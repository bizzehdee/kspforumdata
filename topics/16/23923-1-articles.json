I know of a few good mods for that, though, but you will probably need to land a third vehicle to make them work. First off, there is the \u0022quantum resource transfer\u0022 and \u0022Merlin\u0027s magic resource transfer\u0022 (names are not exact). both work by placing a part on your ship and then allowing you to transfer resources to other nearby ships. I think that both only require one ship to have the special part. Personally, I like the quantum one better because it seems to feel more realistic. Then, there is also the buran manipulator mod, which has a roboot arm that creates a dockin connection to non-docking ports. I think you can transfer resources through it, but I\u0027m not sure. With stock parts, you need to dock things together before you can transfer resources, which is very difficult to do on the surface of the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T21:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot within the confines of the game. If either vehicle is mobile, then you could drive one to the other; 35km isn\u0027t terribly far. This assumes that both have docking ports that are at compatible positions on the vehicles, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only option for direct transfer is persistence file editing. Back up your persistence file, open it in a text editor, then find the relevant missions and the relevant fuel tanks in those missions and do the swap manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if you\u0027re going to finagle the fuel from one to the other in a way that defies physics, you might as well just assume that the fuel transfer was done and was sufficient for the return mission and turn on infinite fuel in the debug menu (press alt-F12.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcbmaestro","CreatedById":59577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T22:53:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to show how I set up my refueling system at my Laythe outpost.
