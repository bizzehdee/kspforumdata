I\u0027ve only recently joined the Kerbal forums yet have been a frequent player of the game since 0.19.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, on my new career playthrough, I seem to have been getting ahead of myself. I landed on the Mun, then Minmus and as I was preparing a trip to Duna I got a contract to go to the Mun. After landing on Duna, Ike and returning I then got a contract to visit Minmus. I\u0027ve been thoroughly enjoying all aspects of the update but would like to know if there is anything I can do or if I just have to launch a new vessel to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T18:03:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, to take full advantage of contracts, in the KSC view click on the Mission Control building, which is the small, low bldg. trying to hide behind the VAB. This brings the contract screen. On the left you\u0027ll see a list of contracts with tabs across the top: Available, Active, and Archive. Click on a contract on the list and its details will appear on the right 1/2 of the screen. These details will show what you need to do (test a part under specific conditions, get science from some planet, plant a flag on some planet, etc. and the time you have to get it done by). You pick the contracts you want (and turn down those you don\u0027t) on the Available tab, review those you\u0027ve accepted but haven\u0027t completed on the Active tab, and review what you\u0027ve done on the Archive tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to check the MC building frequently as you go along, either accepting or declining contracts, so new contracts get generated to match what you\u0027ve accomplished in the game so far. Sounds like you\u0027re not doing this so the contracts are behind what you\u0027ve already done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"95tiger59","CreatedById":92346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T18:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! an awesome tip is that you will regularly gain contracts to get science from certain places so what you can do is just put satelites/stations and bases/rovers/can\u0027t return landers on bodies and orbit and get the science then quick and easy\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
