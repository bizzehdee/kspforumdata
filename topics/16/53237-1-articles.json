Build a rocket of not-too-high TWR (about two-ish) and point it at (say) 85\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 right after liftoff. You will see your prograde marker wander to the side even though the rocket remains in the 85\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 position. That\u0027s because gravity eats a good part of your upwards motion, but the sideways component adds up over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, a more useful example: later in the ascent you may well be pointing at the horizon; no up at all. Yet the apoapsis is rising. You\u0027re pushing the apoapsis over the edge of the world, while gravity is pulling downward, turning it into something circular-like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the OP: My actual gravity turn starts sometime around 15-20km when I turn my attention towards time-to-apoapsis and climb rate: the former should increase steadily but not too quickly; the latter should be \u0022high enough\u0022. If both conditions are met, I pitch down. If I\u0027m already looking at the horizon, I throttle down. However, I start turning much sooner: the atmosphere gets thinner quickly, and pointing towards 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0@10km doesn\u0027t significantly increase the time it takes me to get there. But it means that my later turn will be not half as abrupt and sudden as it would be if I went straight to 10km and only started turning there.
