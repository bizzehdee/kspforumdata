First of all, I\u0027ve made action groups to deploy the probes properly. They decouple, open the parachute, and lower the landing gear at the same time, for some reason, the landing gear never actually deploys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when I land and check the Space Center they do not appear anywhere.
