Like you, I did experiment with tugs with more or fewer RCS thrusters, but no amount of reaction wheels can keep an orange tank straight when you only have RCS on one end, in my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way, if you can do it, is to use the last stage to deliver the fuel tank to the station, so that the fuel tank stage is exactly the same weight as it was when you designed it in the VAB. That way your balanced thrusters will still be balanced and you don\u0027t need to move fuel around. You can then use RCS for the approach. When I do this, I also like to put a probe body on the last stage, so that I can move it away from the station and deorbit it safely when I\u0027m done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what the deal is with the reaction wheels. I normally put one on the last engined stage, to help it turn for orbital maneuvers, but the tank bit doesn\u0027t need reaction wheels as long as the thrusters are put on symmetrically and no fuel is used.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-30T20:50:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2014 08:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rickenbacker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WafflesToo","CreatedById":71736,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T21:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was going to suggest something similar to Rickenbacker and use a robot with a quad of RCS thrusters to balance it front-to-rear.

They\u0027re just a problem waiting to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used 2 different approaches. One is to put a pair of girders on the delivery stage that give me a mounting point for the RCS. I use a short girder to come out from the hull of the delivery vehicle then a long one running parallel to the module I\u0027m delivering. This way you can mount the RCS in line with the COM and strut the payload to the girders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou dock with the station, separate the delivery vehicle and back away from the station. The delivery vehicle takes the girders and RCS thrusters with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I\u0027ve done is to put radial decouplers in line with the COM and mount the RCS thrusters on those. Once you dock you decouple them and let the space junk float away. Of course then you\u0027ve got the decoupler mounting hardware left on your station.

Looks much cleaner than the girders at 90\u0027 I was using. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your station is built you can just refuel those tanks rather than swapping them out. Your refueler would be pretty much the same ship minus the I beams. You probably should add some lights though. Sooner or later you\u0027ll find yourself wishing for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also want to add a marker so you can tell which is the top of your ship.

I\u0027ve never tried the docking autopilot in MJ, but the attitude holding features make manual docking much easier. It\u0027s also easy to make custom windows to show you info like closest approach distance and relative velocity at closest approach. Some of it\u0027s default windows can be a bit cluttered with info so its nice to make your own with just the info you want to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing that took me a while to learn is that the distance readout to your target is to it\u0027s COM.
