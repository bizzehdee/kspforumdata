You\u0026#39;re moving faster, so you require more thrust to change direction. However, if you timed your burn such that you could adjust your orbital inclination near Minmus\u0026#39;s orbit, it will cost you considerably less. That far away from Kerbin you\u0026#39;re barely moving, so a change in orbital inclination requires very little thrust. Of course, the catch in this situation is that you must time your transfer burn to place you at the ascending or descending node of Minmus\u0026#39;s orbit so it could take you far longer to maneuver for an intercept, but that\u0026#39;s a general rule of orbital mechanics: if you want to minimize maneuvering costs, you\u0026#39;ll usually need more time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso...very first forum post.

Imagine you are the only object in the universe. No other object exists but you. In that universe, speed/velocity has no meaning.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpeed, and velocity, is always relative to something. What that something is, is your choice but your choice will affect the answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA car on a highly trafficed highway is travelling with all the other cars at say, 100 km/h, the speedometer tells you. The car\u0026#39;s speed relative to the other cars going in the same direction is 0 km/h and the kinetic energy relative to the other cars is also zero. The cars coming the other direction are also going at 100 km/h and relative to them, your car is going 200 km/h and your kinetic energy will reflect that. Relative to the road/surface, you are going at 100 km/h and your kinetic energy, should you veer off the road and hit a garden gnome, will reflect that speed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor speed/velocity to have any meaning at all, you need to choose a frame of reference. For the car, you might even have to juggle several frames of reference simultaneously. You need to mind the distance to the car in front of you, you need to mind the speed relative to the surface as you approach that curve with a mean garden gnome standing there watching you and you know it\u0026#39;s better to bump into the car in front of you denting the bumper than meeting the oncoming car.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe frame you choose, should be chosen out of relevance to what you need to know, or accomplish.

The Oberth effect means that pro/retrograde burns are most effective when you are low in a gravity well. Now the sun generates a large gravity well spanning the whole system, and Kerbin causes a local dip in this potential (the SOI model in KSP is a close-enough approximation of this). So when you want to do a burn somewhere around Kerbin, you\u0026#39;d look for the local potential minimum, which is \u0022as close to the planet as you can get away with\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit (overtaken by other posts): I agree that the Oberth effect does not need gravity wells, however they can avoid confusion about reference frames because you can formulate your kinetic energy in a handy way. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027GoSlash27\u0027]exponential relationship between velocity and energy[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nquadratic (just nitpicking, of course that does not invalidate your point)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T00:20:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T00:21:00Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Tatonf\u0027]Thanks for all the replies, but I still don\u0026#39;t understand why I gain more \u0022kinetic energy\u0022 from burning in LKO rather than in Sun\u0026#39;s orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou say that I can\u0026#39;t compare my velocity from LKO and the velocity from my Sun orbit, but what does matter at the end ?

If you perform this transfer from solar orbit near Kerbin, it takes a \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u009Dv of about 920 m/s. But to get into that solar orbit you must escape Kerbin orbit, which takes about 950 m/s. That\u0026#39;s a total of 1870 m/s. Suppose now that instead of performing two burns, you just give yourself enough extra velocity during your escape from Kerbin that you have some velocity left over after escaping. You can do it so that you are already traveling 920 m/s relative to Kerbin after escaping so you don\u0026#39;t have to perform the second burn. The extra velocity that you need to provide when close to Kerbin is much smaller than the amount you retain after escaping. To retain 920 m/s requires an ejection burn of only 1080 m/s. This is far less than the 1870 m/s that it took to perform the two-burn strategy.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T00:26:29Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Red Iron Crown\u0027]=I would stay away from car analogies, they don\u0026#39;t work very well for explaining the Oberth Effect.

So these vehicles are adding energy at a constant rate, but each m/s of additional speed costs more energy (because KE=0.5mv[sup]2[/sup]). This means that each additional m/s takes longer to add, i.e. acceleration decreases with increasing speed.
