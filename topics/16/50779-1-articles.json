The only thing you need to do is to throttle up (shift) and activate the engine by staging (space). Doing so is part of the Flight Basics in-game training mission, you should try them if you didn\u0027t yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyrunner27","CreatedById":64031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T11:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to check out the tutorial section.
