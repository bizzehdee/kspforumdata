I see all the basic stuff I should already have, but there\u0027s an option to re-research the command pod for 0 points, so I do so, go back to the VAB/SPH and still cannot select or place the command pod. What the heck am I doing wrong? I even did a fresh reinstall and still no joy, am I missing something, is my copy bugged all to hell? Really can\u0027t figure it out on my own, quick reply would be greatly appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neopunches","CreatedById":85838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T13:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm having the same problem, do you have mods installed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Philoman","CreatedById":88477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T17:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem but have just managed to fix it!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had deleted all mods prior to the update so everything would run smoothly (or so was the plan). I had forgot, however, to delete the pods in my KSP/parts folder. I don\u0027t know if I was supposed to put them in that folder back when i got MechJeb, but it worked.
