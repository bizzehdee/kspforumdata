Don\u0027t have Hyperedit at hand so I can\u0027t give perfect instructions, but you select \u0022rendezvous\u0022 mode, pick the already-in-place satellite as target, and enter a lead time as it suits you. The default 0.5 seconds is generous for collision avoidance. You can set up constellations by entering the right lead time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-12T15:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to give the other satellite time to move on. You don\u0027t want them all bunched up on each other anyways; kind of defeats the whole point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso; not to judge but...maybe you should try doing it without Hyperedit? Not much point in \u0022cheating\u0022 satellites into place, you might as well just turn off the signal requirement in your game options, cheat the ship where it\u0027s going and call it a day if that\u0027s what you are gonna do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is about precision; don\u0027t worry about it; KSP is just a game, you don\u0027t need pixel perfect satellite set ups. I literally just toss mine into a roughly geo-synchronous orbit and call it good enough.
