Im trying to build a real \u0027space ship\u0027 with Ion engines for in-space maneuvering, essentially i want to be able to get anywhere, no matter how far it is. Im also at work and cant provide screenies,sorry :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is not in the deep space/lander stage itself,but in how the hell am i going to get something so incredibly huge and bulky in space ;D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a standard RCS/SAS/small liquid engine landing (or emergency) stage, and already found a problem there. Heavy decouplers,no matter how awesome they are, will not hold hull segments,so i had to attach (large) boosters on them in a 6-star configuration (very weighty stuff already), because the spaceplane fuselage couldnt seem to act like a solid hull and fell apart. I had to use 2 heavy decouplers to get the boosters far enough from each other for the next stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next stage was attached by hollow decouplers with 30 ejection strenght and retro-boosters, contained only a SAS module (i had to put something there) and then a adapter with 4 slots of the same size. These held the ion engine tank and the engine itself,with solar panels. The same \u0027ion drive module\u0027 belonging to this stage was also attached to the bottom of the lander stage engine. This gave me 28 ion thrusters, which was supposed to be enough to get anywhere really fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere i ran into a problem... this contraption was,surprisingly enough,almost stable without having to use too much duct tape, but is surprisingly heavy and HUGE. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no inverted 4-to-1 adapters to the 1-to-4 like i used to attach the ion engines,or i could not find any,i had no way of strapping on big enough ascent stage(s?) to get the crazy machine off ground. The thing i \u0027did\u0027 try however was attaching 6 incredibly huge (3-part) cone-shaped fuel tanks to the outer ion engines (im not sure how they are called atm,4-meters diameter on the bottom of the last one i think) and slapped on the biggest freaking engine ever (1100 thrust per one), and hoped for the best. When it DID work im pretty sure the lightly sideways push wasnt good for the parts either.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now i think you have an idea what kind of a abomination it was... I used fairly large amounts of duct tape and wire to stabilize the fuel tanks and the separate stages, and i did actually manage to get it off the ground stabilized (cant duplicate it for some reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ), but the tanks tend to break off from each other or snap off, and if i put too much extra weight on it or put struts in wrong places, the whole thing buckles and explodes in a huge ball of death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... my question would be i guess... do you have any idea how to make a stable ion drive spaceship and get it into space? A different shape than a star maybe, or where can i get parts to put the whole thing together better? The 4-1 adapter would allow me to put it together more sturdily i think,or atleast attach a proper fuel tank instead of the cone one...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always seem to have structural problems of the weirdest kind :\\\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: i also tried attaching a Project Firelark instead of the first stage to test it,but that didnt even light off for some reason (tested it separately and it worked)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-26T19:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots would be helpful.
