So im already 400m/s behind!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some magic trick that I\u0027m missing here. Is it worth actually attaining a munar orbit or should i just aim to crash on the mun and skip the whole orbit thing? would this be more efficient?

From a munar orbit it should cost me 640 ms to land on the mun. However it costs me closer to 1000. So i was wondering the best way to go about landing. Do i do a retrograde burn from a higher orbit and drop straight down onto the surface and kill off my speed at the last possible moment? Do i do a gentle burn until touch down. I just cant seem to land on the mun using less than 1000dv and its really bugging me as it makes planning ahead difficult. I dont want any unessesary weight. Im trying to make it as efficient as possible so i dont want to take more than i need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:Now that i read my own post back...the title of the thread isnt exactly relevant -.-\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-30T17:36:27Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2013 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by vetrox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moon Goddess","CreatedById":57446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T17:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1710 is optimal best case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s assuming you never translate horizontally you land perfectly always burning exactly the right amount to be exactly at the right speed you need to be at the right altitude at the right time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, always round up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T17:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm pretty spot on at getting to the mun with that deltav map.

Thus, I\u0027d say pack enough delta-v that you have about half again the amount the charts tell you. Fortunately, you can generally take off again with a delta-v amount much closer to what the chart tells you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAiming for a direct impact is actually \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E efficient in the long run for the same reason that trying to launch straight up from Kerbin is, only in reverse -- you\u0027re fighting against gravity the whole way down. What you really want to do is aim for a trajectory that gives you a low (10-20 km) periapsis, then circularize there and begin your descent from that orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
