I placed the CoL near the CoM, as is the norm, and they flew fine. Now when I make spaceplanes, placing the CoL near the CoM, they refuse to leave the runway until my velocity is 190 m/s or greater, and then they faceplant. I know it\u0027s not as simple as lining up the CoL and the CoT with the CoM, but there must be something fundamental I\u0027m missing. After looking at the Kerbalife spaceplane line and Zokesia Skunkworks (and after \u003Cem\u003Eextensive\u003C/em\u003E independent testing) I\u0027ve determined there\u0027s little to no correlation with where the CoL is in relation to the CoM in terms of getting the spaceplane off the ground and stable.

The further behind the CoM the CoL is, the more stable your plane will be; conversely, the further in front of the CoM the CoL is, the more unstable the plane will be; putting the CoL on the CoM will make the plane neutrally stable. The more stable your plane is the more control surfaces you need to change its direction, which is why the general rule is to put the CoL just behind the CoM: the plane is stable, but only a few control surfaces are needed to control it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also want to make sure to put the landing gear directly underneath the CoM; if you don\u0027t do that you can have a lot of trouble rotating the plane on the runway to create lift and take off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varyon","CreatedById":60423,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T03:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s the basics, straight from the expert.

If you have a single radial intake on top of your fuselage without a matching one below then the drag from that intake will cause you to pitch upwards uncontrollably. Naturally, the opposite is true, one on the bottom means nose down at high altitudes. Disabling the intake will momentarily correct the issue; however for the end all solution remove them all together and use the ram air intakes. I\u0027m not sure if the description is accurate on the item, but Ram Air intakes are for use at high altitudes so I deploy them as such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T09:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Varyon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Varyon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, that\u0027s the basics, straight from the expert.

I was planning to do some data collection around the globe (bad idea taking into account low time warp values) so I placed all scientific parts I had just behind cockpit. And also added 3 fuel fuselages. No matter what I tried with wings, control surfaces, etc, problem was solved only when I made plane shorter (-1 fuel fuselage) and moved most of scientific stuff backwards. That way CoM moved slightly backwards and I adjusted CoL to be right behind it.
