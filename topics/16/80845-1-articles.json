I am still pretty new to this game but it has been more addictive than crack (so I\u0027ve heard). Recently however I have found myself for the first time wanting to rage quit. This is over my attempts to build my first manned rover. I have built some small unmanned rovers fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this isn\u0027t necessarily about designing the rover. I mean literally building it. For example I was considering starting with one of the 2x2 flat panels as a floor. Use I beams underneath as an attachment point for the wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is I cannot for the life of me get this stuff to snap together properly to even get a decent rover base started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo any hints or tips would be appreciated. First, should I be building Rovers in the Spaceplane hangar (since rovers are built \u0022horizontally\u0022 like a plane) or in the rocket hangar?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T21:30:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely SPH!

If you want to launch it on a rocket, make your first part a docking port or decoupler, then save the whole rover as a subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild your rovers wide, long, and low to keep them from flipping too easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T21:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah SPH is right, and rover building can be a pain... But if you are using a simple beam on the underside to attach the wheels on, that might give some problems. For as far as i\u0027ve discovered you want to keep them low and wide to prevent them from tipping over (you don\u0027t want a kar krash do you?). Manned rovers do have the intention of growing pretty large when i build them. Also add an sas unit to it so you can flip it back when it topples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope i said anything usefull. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPanzerknoef\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T21:48:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edefinitely 2 parallel beams at each side for the wheels. But heck I\u0027d be happy getting the beams to connect. I have been mostly using the rocket hangar tho so I will try the SPH (I just thought of that as I had typed the post)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T22:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found it to be a nightmare however you do it. Tiny mouse movements end up causing massive swings in the angle of a part you\u0027re attaching, making for a frustrating time. Editor Extensions helps, you can switch between VAB and SPH style building and enable/disable vertical snapping amongst other things, but it\u0027s still a hassle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGreatSkeeve","CreatedById":81406,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T02:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to launch a rover on a rocket, try making a subassembly of everything except the starting part and just taking it over to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for building rovers, try using 2 radially attached girder segments to the Rovemax part and putting the rover wheels on the girder segments. It works like a charm for small 1-Kerbal rovers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
