To my understanding this is because of my incompetence in planning \u0026amp; designing vessels that are efficient with fuel but actually work . Due to this, I have only be able to travel to and land on the Mun , and even that was a challenge! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want to get better on designing rockets thus meaning that I can travel to other celestial bodies in the Kerbol universe, so I was wondering if perhaps any of you lovely people have any tips on how i can design rockets and manage fuel in said rockets. Or if anyone can further diagnose my issue that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be really really appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tsotha","CreatedById":120361,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T23:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you feel like you need mainsails and orange tanks to get anywhere it\u0027s likely either you\u0027re not staging your rockets or your payload is too heavy. Normally you would use at least three stages for a moon shot. More common is seven or eight, if you\u0027re just counting the stages as the UI presents them. If your goal is just to land on the Mun and go home the lander should be no more than about seven tons, depending on how much you\u0027re expecting it to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing for you to do is get Kerbal Engineer and try to maximize your dv. Often adding more fuel in the wrong place makes your rocket less capable instead of more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T23:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that once you\u0027re up to altitude and speed your needed TWR goes down, and in orbit it goes WAY down.
