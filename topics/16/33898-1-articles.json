When 2 ships are docked together, they make one ship, so is it right to say that a Tac fuel balancer can be used for transfer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/i put a small clamp o tron jr directly on top and bottom of the 3m tank of my space tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dock a 40T lander with ORDA and the whole thing explodes just after contact was made. It looks like bottom or top dock on tanks are more fragiles than side docks. Can somebody confirm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to put a fairing on top and the docking port on the fairing, but it explodes also on contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3/I made a 4 side engines lander with a central tank. I put a docking port on the bottom of the center tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPurpose is to dock the lander on top of a pusher for interplanetary travel, but I am a little afraid with my previous experiences about docking port on top and bottom of tank.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T10:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. There\u0027s no difference between docking port functionality, they all work the same way. I don\u0027t know how your mod in specific functions, try asking in the mod thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You\u0027re using the smallest dockingport to dock big things, physics dictates that you\u0027re getting more force on a weaker component... Try using bigger ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use bigger ports. There\u0027s no reason to use the Jr docking port on anything larger than its mounting surface. All ports function the same so take mass and size of your ships into consideration. I\u0027ve been using Sr docking ports on my biggest stuff and they work without issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T10:31:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thank\u0027s for tips\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"willow","CreatedById":13072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T10:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the fuel balanced will work with the docking ports, I do this all the time, send up a refueller to a depot, dock it, empty it via fuel balancer, undock and deorbit the craft.
