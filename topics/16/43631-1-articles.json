I like building big and complicated (looking) things to the point where I end up with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of parts. It gets to the point where even if I build, the game would freeze of quit to desktop and I am not even talking about launching or reverting back to VAB. Generally I would crash 7-8 out of 10 times. FPS was pretty annoying at launch, and I am not even talking about docking with that thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is definitely the current limitations of the game. It uses only 1 core and 4 gigs of ram (I have 16 of ddr3) due to it being 32-bit like Keome said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game will definitely be optimized as it currently only in Alpha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sincerely hope it will be able to go beyond 4 gigs but that would require to make the game 64bit. As for CPU, I am sure it will get more efficient with the physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now I am trying to limit my self to only maybe 100-250 parts per vessel. It is actually a good practice because you will get more efficient and figure out what you actually NEED on that ship and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E add all the bells and whistles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust an imo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T15:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t already turn the delta time physics slider all the way down to .03 and disable any and all vsync options. Other then that.. get yourself some part packs. It sounds counter intuitive I know. But with a pack like NovaPunch/American/Soviet you can put 300 tons into orbit and keep the lifter well under 300 parts. That\u0027s the true advantage of mods imo. By all means keep the payload stock if you wish.
