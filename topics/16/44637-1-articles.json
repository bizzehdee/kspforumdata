I\u0027m thinking about using a Lunokhod-style delivery system (of course scaled up to fit this monstrosity), but have absolutely no idea how to create a deployable ramp to allow the vehicle to drive down to the surface once landed.

Wheels can at least survive a small drop, especially on the Mun.

I ran into two main problems during the ground tests:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If the decoupler between the lander and rover was too low, the wheels would clip through the lander\u0027s surface, causing the rover to do some interesting gymnastics once the rover decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the decoupler was too high (elevated by the octagonal or square truss pieces), the rover would just sit on top of the decoupled structure without a way to drive down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there were also a few problems getting the game to recognize the ramp as a ramp and not as a static object to be collided with or clipped through. Not saying it can\u0027t be done or that you shouldn\u0027t try, but it\u0027s very difficult to get it done right with the parts currently used in the stock game, and other landing configurations might be more convenient in the long run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T04:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor rovers in the 20\u002B ton range you might want to consider integrated landing equipment - either small rocket motors (R24-77 and its brother is a good one) and fuel tanks built directly into the rover or small rockets strapped to the side of the rover to be jettisoned once the rover is on the ground. The first solution also gives the rover sub-orbital hop capability in case you need to jump over rough terrain ala that scene from Armageddon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you were going for a Lunokhod style ramp I have a suggestion: instead of attaching the rover to the ramp by bottom mounted decoupler use horizontal mounted decoupler (so attach point at front, back or side of the rover) instead. I find that horizontal attachment suffers a lot less from \u0022wheel clipping through ramp\u0022 type issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
