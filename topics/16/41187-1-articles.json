I accidently released four of my engines, but they stayed in place and it got me to go in trajectory to the mun. Once I was in the correct trojectory, I started my other engines and let the nuclear engines just keep going as they went around in circles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to see if they would stay as space debris, so I looked around at em looking at their orbits. BUT I got too far away from the mun base which is flying towards the mun and now I cant select the mun base to control. The stupid excuse is \u0022can\u0027t change ship while throttled up\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t let me change to the mun base because my completetly bare and empty seperated engine which I am viewing is still technically \u0022throttled up\u0022 despite not having any fuel left or electricity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I throttle down this engine so I can control my mun base? It is heading straight for the mun with 5 kerbals I don\u0027t want to do this all over again just because of a stupid limitation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked in the cheat menu, I can\u0027t find any with electricity or whatever so I cant throttle down. Besides there are nobatteries on that engine. I can\u0027t go to space center, because it will revert the flight to launch. There is no end flight so I cant even get rid of the damn thing. The kerbal wrecking ball does not work in space, the balls are just appearing far away and just fall slowly to earth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehow do I get back in control of my mun base\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-05T19:24:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2013 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gunnar123abc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHit X to cut the throttle (this works on debris) and the go to the space center and access your base from the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gunnar123abc","CreatedById":73897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022minerman30\u0022 data-cite=\u0022minerman30\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHit X to cut the throttle (this works on debris) and the go to the space center and access your base from the tracking station.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh hey it worked thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gunnar123abc","CreatedById":73897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:35:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh, one more question if i may, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes a base a base?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first mun base on the mun is labeled a \u0022ship\u0022 on the space center but I noticed there is an icon for \u0022bases\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I make it so my mun base is labeled as a base rather than a ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zixxogi","CreatedById":77017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou right-click the command module and press change name =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholas4132","CreatedById":30242,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile controlling your base in flight mode, right click on the command pod or probe core, and select \u0027Rename Vessel\u0027.
