Using turbojets and rocket engines design I can usually hit around 20k, with speeds around 1000. However as soon as I cut the engines and switch to rockets the whole plane drops out of the sky and my speed drops off dramatically. By the time I manage to start climbing again I have burnt most of my rocket fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing sabres I can just switch modes and avoid the speed decrease, but my designs usually don\u0027t have enough fuel left to do anything useful once I attain orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I can\u0027t seem to get above 1000 mph or so at 20km , without the plane becoming very hard to control.

The idea is to climb to 10 km as quickly as possible, and then turn closer to horizontal, so that by 20 km, your climb rate is around 30 m/s. With more intakes per engine, you can afford a higher climb rate during acceleration. When you are about to reach the altitude where flameout occurs (you may need some experience with that particular design to find the altitude), ignite rockets, pitch up to 30-40 degrees, and shut down jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your spaceplane becomes hard to control, you may have center of lift ahead of center of mass.

Then start gradually levelling off your ascent through 15,000 or so - you want your rate of climb to be not much more than 10 m/s (use the gauge to the side of the altimeter) at that point, and especially so once you\u0027re up to 20k. Keep it level and continue to ascend. You\u0027ll be able to maintain full throttle up until you\u0027ve got about 0.03-0.04 Intake Air per engine; after that, if you\u0027ve got more than one jet, you\u0027ll want to start throttling back if your plane begins to yaw and you\u0027re not telling it to. A few notches will do the trick. Continue throttling back as needed until a) you\u0027re no longer accelerating, or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E you run out of gas.

If not, or once you\u0027ve throttled back almost all the way to zero, kill the jets and throttle up. You shouldn\u0027t have to burn the rockets for very long at all if you\u0027ve done things correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T04:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the answers, there are many different ways to build spaceplanes. I personally prefer to use more engines than capi3101, maybe something like 1 turbojet for every 7-10 tonnes of total mass. If something doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to climb vertically, it belongs to the local gliding club, not to my space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying crew or cargo to LKO, that extra thrust pays off, as ascent is quicker and easier. On longer trips, jet engines are just dead weight, so ultimately capi3101\u0027s approach becomes more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went to test how much faster a spaceplane can safely climb with intake-to-engine ratio 3:1, so I put some extra intakes to my 7.5-tonne light spaceplane with one turbojet. Thrust was at 100% all the time, because this is my space program, not a gliding club. At 20 km, my climb rate was 200 m/s. That felt a bit too much, so I started turning towards horizontal flight. At 26 km, the rate was still 100 m/s, getting down to 50 m/s at 28 km and 30 m/s at 28.5 km. After that point, the climb rate was steady for about a minute, until the plane started approaching orbital velocity. At around 30 km, the climb rate started rising again, even though the nose was pointing horizontal. The rate became 50 m/s at 34 km and 80 m/s at 39 km, at which point the turbojet flamed out. After a few short burns from the rocket engines, the plane was at a 120 km orbit, having spent 130 fuel and 38 oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1bdI","CreatedById":85881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T16:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving some altitude and speed data points will help me out alot.
