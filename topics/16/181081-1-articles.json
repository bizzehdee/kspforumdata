However, if it is not re-rooted to the second stage, then as soon as it detach, the 4 terriers start to occilate and/or thrust into the second stage fuel tank. (An\u00A0earlier solution is to strut\u00A0the terriers onto the fuel tank, but this become impossible with the bare/framed terrier - plus 4 extra parts.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-03T17:30:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2019 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Jestersage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-03T05:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried your craft, using two boosters, and had no problems. \u00A0(I never do, it seems the Kraken is afraid of me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like a problem with autostruts.\u00A0 I hate autostruts. \u00A0When you decouple they automaticaly lock rigidly to a different part that might be flexed, preventing it from flexing back to neutral. \u00A0This can over-stress other joints, or over-stress the physics simulation while two auto-strut constraints argue with each other and exert large forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HbJI7by.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 height=\u0022763\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HbJI7by.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022width:369px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003EThe new engine-plates force everything attached to them to auto-strut to their grandparent. \u00A0The identity of the grandparent depends on the root (image). \u00A0If you turn on the option alt-F12:Physics:visualize-autostruts, I bet you can find what is causing you trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I have seen the orange lines disagree with the autostrut settings while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0They make sense, though after\u00A0re-loading the craft file or going to the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-03T05:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2019 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by OHara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
