I\u0027ve been trying to do things like cycle all the Kerbals to the space station, and Mun base do do their various jobs but I seem to be capping out at level 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have rescued quite a few Kerbals, and they are all very low level, so I\u0027m about to launch a few missions specifically to earn some experience and get them to a useful level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy space program is about to launch it\u0027s first Duna probe, so interplanetary Kerbals aren\u0027t happening yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter looking at some videos on how to accomplish this, I have a couple questions;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Do Kerbals gain experience for doing job specific tasks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Do all Kerbals on a Mission have to EVA and plant flags on the Mun and Minmus? Or will one flag be enough for the group?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-If I orbit the Mun or Minmus, do I have to come back on a different mission to get the experience for doing a landing? It \u0022seems\u0022 that they will only get experience for one thing per celestial body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Do my Kerbals all have to orbit Kerbal and then on a different mission plant flags on Kerbal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny tips or suggestions would be appreciated...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-14T23:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooky here:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Experience\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, thread moved to Gameplay Questions, since it\u0027s seeking help rather than offering.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
