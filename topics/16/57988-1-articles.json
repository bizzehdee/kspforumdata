The concept: I\u0027d go to Eve for 1km/s and then fly from there for about 500 m/s. A few people have done this. I thought I understood how to put this into action -- I have before. But this time I was going to be extra clever: I\u0027d string up the Kerbin-Eve-Jool trip so that my Kerbals wouldn\u0027t have to while away the years waiting for the next encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fired up \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealexmoon\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E calculator.

Upon arrival, I was surprised at how low the unpowered boost would send my apoapsis -- only a bit higher than Kerbin. When put a node near Eve periapsis (at an escape angle about 120 degrees to prograde like you\u0027re supposed to), to get my heliapsis up to Jool\u0027s orbit costs me 1km/s due prograde -- which gets me an encounter.
