Slight issues with the twist axis acting all wonky that I\u0027ve managed to fix but that\u0027s it. They key thing is that Unity can only recognize \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E joystick axis at a time. So if you have Device 1, Axis 0 and Device 2, Axis 0 - Unity will use them both to control the 0 Axis. So if you assign Device 1 to throttle and Device 2 to pitch, moving either axis will move both throttle and pitch :/ The Logitech has the throttle built into the base I think, and the X52 is the only separate throttle/stick combo I know that combines them both into a single USB plug, hence all axis have unique numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RW-1","CreatedById":107278,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T19:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used my CH setup with no issues - fighterstick, pro throttle and pro pedals, they are programmed into one device through software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne bug though, if you have joystick parameters set, it seems that when switching back to staging from docking, your throttle may go to 1/4. I had stopped using my setup but still had the values in the program, once removed I no longer had that issue, and it\u0027s int he bug tracking website. Your mileage may vary with that, test first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
