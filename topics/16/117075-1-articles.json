I think I see one 1.25m reaction wheel on there.\n\nIf you\u0027re not out of power (which you aren\u0027t) I\u0027m guessing the craft has an offset center of mass and doesn\u0027t have enough control authority to counteract it."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T16:59:28Z","Content":"I\u0027d agree there\u0027s a good chance the offset Center of Mass could be causing you problems. It might not have been happening earlier because you\u0027ve reached a fuel state where the CoM has shifted enough that the engine gimbal and torque wheel can\u0027t compensate anymore. Now that some fuel is burned off, the CoM might be moved enough that firing the engines causes too much torque.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:00:54Z","Content":"Is it actually the rocket flipping all over the place, or the camera? When you enter an orbit your camera mode automatically changes; the same happens when you go from orbital to sub-orbital flight."},{"CreatedByName":"fabiofonsv","CreatedById":148954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:07:33Z","Content":"That should be it, when I emptied the fuel, than the CoM got a little hard to control.\n\nThank you, guys."}]}
