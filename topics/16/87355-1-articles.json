I\u0027ve been playing KSP since open Alpha and been strapping into rockets ever since! This is my first post here and it\u0027s only because I have a very direct question: Do Aerodynamic forces take effect with Nose Cones yet??? I have been deployed (Active Duty Military) for the last 6 months and just got back, the last update I was a part of was the Meteor/Comet/Arm Grabber update for like 1 day before I had to leave... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I was very sad and without a gaming laptop to take with me on deployment!
