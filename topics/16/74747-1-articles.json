They don\u0027t like it and it can cause problems (especially if things are clipped). In addition to making sure the port is facing the right way, make sure you didn\u0027t accidentally connect the wrong node to the ship. Again, with the Sr ports, it is sometimes easy to accidentally connect the top node to a ship, even though it\u0027s facing the right way and you meant to connect the bottom node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther people have said to make sure the SAS is off.
