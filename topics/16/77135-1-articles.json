I picked up an F310 over the weekend and mapped everything (both sticks, D-Pad and all but two of the buttons) through the Settings interface. Haven\u0027t downloaded any Logitech software yet. Worked flawlessly after I tuned the sensitivity on the analog axes. Unhelpful, I\u0027ll admit, but at least it\u0027s another data point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ll note is that I waited until Windows had done it\u0027s whole song and dance about installing drivers before I even started KSP. Also, I\u0027ve only tried it with the mode switch on the back in the default position --- however it came out of the box. I did test that the Settings interface would recognize the sticks in the other position (and it did), but immediately put the switch back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
