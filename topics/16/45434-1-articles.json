I have three kerbals in a lander, stuck in an elliptical kerbin orbit after a failed return from the Mun. No power, no fuel, but they have a capsule and their jetpacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I go about pointing the thing retrograde and using their packs to push it? It only needs a little more delta-V to get into aerobraking altitude when applied properly. However, trying to swing it around to use up the last of the fuel found that it\u0027s hard to push a flat-bottomed craft. Especially if there\u0027s a strut in the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to leave them out there until I can rendezvous, either, because it also has no docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T16:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to dock a rescue craft, just get it close enough so that you can EVA your stranded guys over. A hitchiker can has enough capacity to rescue all 3 in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T16:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like a bit of a trick question. You turn the craft either by using its reaction wheels, if you have power, or by pushing it with a kerbal to rotate it. You go on an EVA, activate the rocket pack, manouver the kerbal to the opposite side of where you want to turn and move the kerbal against the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor directions you\u0027d need to understand the navball or navigate by checking mapmode of what direction you\u0027re heading and using the sun/kerbin to get a heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there\u0027s not even a need to point the craft any specific way, pushing the craft with a kerbal would be like using RCS. You can point the nose of the ship prograde and push retrograde by going in front of the nose and pushing... which kills any difficulty of direction you had...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all I don\u0027t quite understand what the difficulty is. You get out, you push, quite literally. Everything beyond that is simple navigation/directions which I\u0027d think you knew just from flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T16:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t get them to sit properly against the craft to push it, that\u0027s the difficulty. Also, the thing rotates whenever I try and board to see the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no power at all; I forgot to add solar panels to the design, and flattened the batteries on the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T18:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, building a rescue craft is probably the best of your available options. Like Scarecrow 88 mentioned, you don\u0027t have to actually dock it so long as you can just get it in close enough to the stranded capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
