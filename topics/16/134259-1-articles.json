is that it reduces gravity losses.\u00A0 While sitting on the launch pad, it takes a TWR of 1 just to counteract the force of gravity.\u00A0 If you have a TWR of 2, then 50% of your thrust is used to cancel out gravity.\u00A0 However, if your TWR is 1.2, then 83% of your thrust is used to cancel out gravity.\u00A0 With a high TWR, far more of your thrust is used in gaining velocity than when you have a low TWR.\u00A0 One of the disadvantages of high TWR is that you\u0027ll be moving faster in the low atmosphere, therefore you\u0027ll have higher drag losses.\u00A0 However, drag losses are less than gravity losses, so it is a good trade to accept higher drag losses in exchange for lower gravity losses.\u00A0 With a high TWR it might be possible to get to orbit using only 3200 m/s

that a rocket\u0027s most expensive part is its engine.\u00A0 To get a high TWR a rocket requires a large and expensive engine.\u00A0 Your cost per ton of payload delivered to orbit is generally least when using as small an engine as possible, i.e. a low TWR.\u00A0 To see this, let\u0027s consider an example.\u00A0 Let\u0027s say we have a 100 ton launch vehicle powered by a Twin-Boar engine.\u00A0 This rocket will have a liftoff TWR of about 1.9.\u00A0 Suppose it can deliver a 23-ton payload (a payload fraction of 0.23) using 3200 m/s \u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022

keeping the same engine.\u00A0 Suppose we bring\u00A0the total mass\u00A0up to 136 tons, which lowers the liftoff\u00A0TWR\u00A0to 1.4.\u00A0 Because of the lower TWR, we\u0027ll experience greater

However, since we\u0027ve packed on all that extra propellant, we can lift a larger payload.\u00A0 Suppose we can now deliver a 29-ton payload (a payload fraction of 0.21).\u00A0 The low TWR rocket is less efficient in terms of both \u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Calibri\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E\u0394\u003C/font\u003Ev and payload fraction.\u00A0 However, since we gained the extra 6 tons of payload at the cost of adding\u00A0only relatively cheap fuel tanks, our cost per ton of payload is actually less.\u00A0 The moral of the story is, be careful about what metrics you look at when determining what the most efficient rocket is.\u00A0 If your goal is cost efficiency, then don\u0027t be wooed by\u00A0things like low\u00A0\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022

be expected.\u00A0 I\u0027ve found that maximum cost\u00A0efficiency is generally gained, in theory,\u00A0with a liftoff TWR of about 1.2.\u00A0 However, I find that rockets with such a low TWR require so many fuel tanks to be stacked on top of one another that the rocket becomes very slender, wobbly, and difficult to steer.\u00A0 I generally\u00A0target a TWR in the 1.3-1.5 range, which I think is a good compromise.\u00A0 For the second stage I generally try to have\u00A0an initial TWR of about 1.0-1.3.\u00A0 These are just my personal guidelines (other people are bound to disagree), but I\u0027ve\u00A0found them to work rather well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing my\u00A0TWR guidelines, I generally like to be pitched over\u00A0about 45\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E at\u00A010-12 km, and nearly horizontal by about 35 km.\u00A0 One metric\u00A0I use to determine the\u00A0efficiency of\u00A0my ascent\u00A0is the magnitude of my apoapsis circularization burn.\u00A0 If I have to make a large burn, say \u0026gt;200 m/s, then my ascent was too highly lofted.\u00A0 My trajectory reached the target apoapsis before I gained enough horizontal velocity.\u00A0 I\u0027m

right around 3400 m/s.\u00A0 However, when building a small rocket using 1.25 m parts, I generally figure about 3600 m/s.\u00A0 Also, early in a career game before the discovery of fairings, payloads may not be very streamlined.\u00A0 When launching a draggy payload on a small rocket, I generally figure about 3800 m/s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

Drag is really not a problem up there. So much so that I recommend taking off all your nose cones, at least on the upper stage: you\u0027re paying more to accelerate their mass than they\u0027re saving you in drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EIn an ascent, any thrust you produce that is above the horizon is wasted; only the horizontal speed matters. The only reasons to thrust upwards at all are to avoid hitting the ground, to reduce drag losses by going higher above the atmosphere, and to reduce your peak skin temperature (atmospheric heating falls linearly with density, and grows with the cube of speed, which puts certain limits on your altitude).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-19T03:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNose cones only cost 1 dv from what I have seen from in KER.
