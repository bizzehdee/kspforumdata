Nobody on board.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s probably it. SAS on during reentry isn\u0027t usually too big of a deal. In fact, you might need it initially to prevent the ship from flipping around. But if you leave SAS on after chutes are out (like you said in the OP), then it\u0027s going to drain the batteries very quickly. Same thing after you land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is because reaction wheels (or pod torque) use more electricity when they are active. They don\u0027t use any electricity if SAS (or you) isn\u0027t providing input. Unlike lights or probe cores (not the torque part) which draw a steady amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the chutes are deployed and SAS is on, the SAS tries to turn the craft against the pull of the chutes back to the orientation before chutes were deployed. Hence the rapid battery drain. If you think you need SAS for landing, turn it off after chute deployment to let the craft settle, then turn it back on right before you need it. Turn it off again after you land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T18:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thank\u0027s for advise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T20:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gilflo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gilflo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuestion: Is there an add on to see the needs for electricity?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod you want for that is Fusebox.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T22:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOJ thank\u0027s, mission was a success, I shut down SAS and torque once chutes were opened\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee here:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72103-Rescue-mission-to-Eve?p=1022393#post1022393\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72103-Rescue-mission-to-Eve?p=1022393#post1022393\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T17:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeverytime I just put 2 RTGs and that\u0027s it!
