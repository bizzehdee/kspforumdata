The frame/ main body of the station goes up first, and the tanks will be brought up one or two at a time, I need to figure that out, and also docking lol. I figure a main ship brings them close enough then I detach them and they are set up like in the image, to remote control in with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a full set up of bi directional fuel lines for the station, however, I can\u0027t put one on the clamp-o-tron senior to connect backwards. I can connect to it from the station but not vice verca. How can I do this? Is it possible to edit the save file to switch those ones around? Even if somehow the girders magically transfer fuel, same with the nodes, I want the fuel lines, it looks cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I still need to add the engines it will use to adjust orbit if needed, and maybe a capsule for a guy to sit in, but it is made to be unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure this thing will be handy getting larger ships to other parts of the solar system, by letting them use fuel from their engines to get into orbit, same with some probes, I end up eating into my LN-N reserves and being low some.
