I\u0027ve been playing ksp for over a week now and i\u0027m enjoying every second of it. Everything was running smoothly until today when i ran into an interesting problem.So i\u0027ve created recently a spaceplane, which has a drogue chute in the back, just to brake when the plane lands. However the chute when deployed, it gets cut(?) and a red parachute icon replaces the one on the left. I thought at first it was because of the exhaust gases of the engines, but after retrying landing and shutting down the engines, the chute still gets cut.Screenshots:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/903253720479054640/6DFF8267BD6832029D34EF557D12DE022900E8E9/\u0022 alt=\u00226DFF8267BD6832029D34EF557D12DE022900E8E9\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFront view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/903253720479072898/58D786576A8A135EF24F5CE225210BEBA9ECA78D/\u0022 alt=\u002258D786576A8A135EF24F5CE225210BEBA9ECA78D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/903253720479066105/2BF7B7FE44AD99348754E70AE877FFA7749F6FBC/\u0022 alt=\u00222BF7B7FE44AD99348754E70AE877FFA7749F6FBC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/903253720479047576/9FC78C903C15F3B33A0D077F251B5401FBC0847E/\u0022 alt=\u00229FC78C903C15F3B33A0D077F251B5401FBC0847E\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding and deploying the chute.

It doesn\u0027t matter, they still cut when on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see a seperate braking chute in game, for use on the ground, depending on horizontal speed (when lower than e.g. 2-3 m/s cut) instead of vertical. Could be useful for improving safety on heavy spaceplanes - while runway at KSC is always long enough, crap may hit the fan and you may end up having 1/3 of runway to stop. That\u0027s why IRL shuttles had braking chutes - they could wheelbrake at 4.5 km long runway at SLF without any problem but lower roll is always safier if you can perform it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
