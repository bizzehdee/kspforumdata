It\u0027ll look ugly as hell and you\u0027ll need to be sure to strut the girder, but it should work and even be somewhat lighter than the Mk2 Can. In place of the Apollo tutorial\u0027s Stack Seperator, you should be able to add a TR-18A; you\u0027ll just need to decouple it from the LM docking port when the time comes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you throw on a suite of science instruments onto the lander for good measure, you\u0027re only looking at a craft with a payload mass of about 35 tonnes.
