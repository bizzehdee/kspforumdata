My procedure for getting to orbit is much like Aphobius\u0027s, though I tend to follow the prograde vector as long as my time to Apoapsis is between 35-55 seconds. I burn along the horizon once the Ap is above a minute and keep burning until the Ap is where I want it in order to account for what I\u0027ll lose to atmospheric drag based on alititude (\u002B10k for 50,000, \u002B30k for 40,000). Might have to try out his method my own self to see if it saves fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually an orbital insertion burn after a good gravity-turn ascent takes 4-5 seconds, and maybe 50-100 m/s of delta-V, at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to another planet on that data is another matter. KER is generally helpful for making orbital plane changes; I\u0027ll admit that I don\u0027t understand the rest of the rendezvous data it provides. I rely on other mods (KAC, Protractor) to make interplanetary burns as a rule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
