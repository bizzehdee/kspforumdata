Two of these probes, creatively named Eve-1 and Eve-2, are designed to use Eve\u0027s atmosphere to capture into its SOI. I really don\u0027t know the perfect altitude for aerobraking on atmospheric planets, but all I know is that if you go too high, you won\u0027t get captured and if you go too low, you will have unplanned lithobraking. Info is advised for all atmospheric bodies.

Combine that with the fact that drag depends on the shape and orientation of your craft, and you end up will something like trial and error being your best bet (F5 to save/F9 to load). If you want to avoid save-load you will want a mod that can predict your trajectory in atmosphere, like Trajectories or MechJeb. Even those mods only give estimates, but they are close enough to plan things around."},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T02:56:28Z","Content":"If in doubt, aim high and just skim the atmosphere. If your orbit doesn\u0027t close and you\u0027ve passed PE, just do a bit of a retro burn. Note that it only takes about 80 m/s to capture into an elliptical orbit, and at that point, you can bring your AP down slowly with multiple passes."},{"CreatedByName":"Crikeycrapper","CreatedById":116365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T03:45:46Z","Content":"Thanks for the help guys! Just aerocaptured into Eve at 65km periapsis, and apart from fried comms, the probes remained intact!

I also sometimes include a backup antenna inside a service bay for craft that need extreme aerobraking."},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T03:57:32Z","Content":"Mechjeb\u0027s Landing Guidance can be used as an aerocapture aid. Just open LG and click \u0027show landing predictions\u0027, there are a few options you can play with but basically you can adjust your Pe and if you are entering the atmosphere and not hitting rock it will tell you what orbit you will end up in.
