It\u0027s lighter, allows a MK2 rocket fuel adapter to be fitted in front and allows the use of a shielded dock instead of the Mk2\n\n- try using smaller winglets in an X configuration (4 of them) to improve heading stability. [instead of 2 tails]\n\n- while you don\u0027t want control surfaces (elevons, winglets) anywhere near the mid/front of the plane, you may get away with using some strakes or small wings. Just wings, no control surfaces. They are displayed in a neutral state in the SPH but they can violently alter your CoL during actual flight.\n\n- don\u0027t be too keen to eliminate drag by using fewer wings. They are not that draggy and you do need lift. Try using swept wings because they can move the CoL further back. Maybe try using 2 pairs, one attached higher and the other lower.\n\n- try a cockpit \u002B 1 passenger module first, then if you\u0027re succesful, try adding room for 4 more kerbals.\n\n- you\u0027re not using the rearmost node. Consider 2 TurboJets \u002B 1 Aerospike as it provides serious thrust and good Isp with all three engines firing. The extra speed might give you a higher initial Ap.\n\n- keep the cargo bay and put it where it least interferes with CoM moving about as fuel is burned. You might want to try placing it next to the cockpit and stuff it full of heatsink-like parts because re-entry heat will be an issue for long, thin planes.\n\n- Ramjet intakes have a slightly higher heat tolerance, though i haven\u0027t used the shock ones so idk. Ramjets are good though. And you won\u0027t get any extra mileage out of airhogging so don\u0027t bother.\n\nThe main issue is to check where you CoM is when the plane is fully loaded and empty then aim for a build that keeps the damn thing almost in place or moving slightly forward as fuel is spent. In my experience an empty plane copes easily with a difference between CoM and CoL pictured above, though take off would be difficult. Once you\u0027re happy with the CoM, Find a good spot for wings then worry about elevons. An SSTO during ascent should fly more like a rocket than a plane, hence keeping control surfaces further back is usefull.\n\nTo be frank, i don\u0027t know how usefull this advice is, i will say i have had dozens of failures with the Mk2 spaceplanes and am seriously hating almost all of them. Plus it cost me 10 dead kerbals in career mode. You are not alone in suffering. I currently have only 2 that work. And one of them is the one that killed so many kerbals...\n\n[oh and LOL is me, since i haven\u0027t unlocked the Aerospike in career mode i have no safe Mk2s afterall.

I would say you want about 6.5 total lift coefficient.\n\nTo lift off from the runway, either angle the wings slightly upwards at the front, or angle the whole plane by setting the rear landing gear much higher up on the fuselage than the front gear. Either approach will give you a built-in angle of attack on the runway.\n\nThe precoolers do have significant thermal mass, but they also add drag and you don\u0027t need the extra air intake ability they offer, so they may not be worth it.\n\nIt may be worth a try to place a single rudder on the central core rather than two rudders on the radially attached tanks.

I found that one RAM intake per engine is enough, no additional air intaces required (as it used to be in 0.9).\n\nInstability, i.e. plane veering left and right, happens to me often, too. Usually this is when thrust is not strong enough, so more engines should partially solve this, too. The other matter would be the way your control surfaces are arranged and work. Sometimes you can remedy problems by blocking yaw, pitch or roll for certain surfaces. I always have slight imperfections remaining, though.

Also, try putting all your crew cabins right behind your cockpit, and your fuel tanks towards the rear.
