They give you a lot of control about where you will eventually land (Kerbin is a small world, give and take 10km means a lot). But during ascent they were, at best, not much of a burden. Standard rules for CoM/CoL placement apply, so you need to balance the finished rocket with more fins at the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were kinda useful early in my first career, when I tried to splash down in a mountain lake; but eventually I gave up on the concept as too much trouble to design (esp. at a stage when the design changes after every launch due to newly-accessible parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWing orientation matters, though. IIRC you need to build the craft in SPH, as VAB-attached wings will cancel each other out / make you go corkscrew.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T01:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile not much in lift, the fins on this turbojet design allowed me to accelerate the payload section to nearly 2,400 m/sec at over 38,000 meters at flameout.
