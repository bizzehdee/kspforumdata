Time-optimal transfers are dead simple, just burn at full speed halfway towards the point of encounter, retrograde the other half, straight ahead. But they have prohibitively high delta-V requirements. You need a hybrid - shorter time on a fixed delta-V budget, and it will be hybrid between the two - a transfer that is not entirely tangential to both orbits, but also not entirely perpendicular. This is what you get from the planner if you click near the bottom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-16T12:13:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- to anywhere\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- from anywhere\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- -at any time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas long as you are willing to pay through the nose in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I\u0027m currently in the process of designing a heavily-modded Duna-Kerbin mothership that can be placed into a cycler orbit and stay there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cycler orbit, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept, is an orbit that passes by two celestial bodies (e.g. Earth and Mars) for a high-energy transfer window\u00A0in both directions, and is an exact multiple of the synodic period between both destinations (time it takes for both bodies to be in the same position relative to each other) so that they are in the same place relative to each other at the same point on the cycler\u0027s orbit. Usually a vessel in a cycler orbit will stay beyond the Hill Sphere (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) of each body to minimize changes to the orbit (though some corrections have to be made, usually to account for orbital eccentricity in the destinations\u0027 orbits). This is a good choice of mission profile for multiple repeated crew missions, as it can help to minimize the crew\u0027s time in microgravity as well as meaning that an incredibly massive mothership can be placed in the cycler orbit and then never need to expend large amounts of propellant on entering or exiting orbit around either Earth or its destination. Most cycler orbits will have an apoapsis above the orbit of the higher planet, and a periapsis below the orbit of the lower planet. An ideal cycler orbit has an orbital period exactly equivalent to the synodic period between its destinations, so that both transfer windows occur every orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plan I have for my college project (which I will be replicating to some degree in KSP)\u00A0involves the MCV (Mars Cycler Vehicle) which will be assembled in Earth orbit and then transferred using an autonomous nuclear thermal propulsion module which will be moved into a graveyard orbit once no longer needed. The MCV will have all necessary life support and habitation capabilities for the crew, and will pass by both Earth and Mars at a specific high-energy transfer window in both directions. For every orbit the MCV makes (for the duration of the Mars exploration program) it will be resupplied and be able to facilitate a new mission. The resupply vehicle will be fully autonomous, but will need to have the same reliability rating as a crew-rated vehicle because the crew would not survive without the success of the resupply mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be a HTV (High-energy Transfer Vehicle) to take the crew to/from the cycler. This will consist of a reusable crew module, and a high-efficiency propulsion module that will be replaced with every mission. The HTV will stay in HEO (High Earth Orbit) between the magnetic fields for the duration of its stay at Earth (where it will be refurbished and the propulsion module replaced) and in LMO (Low Mars Orbit) for the duration of the crew\u0027s time at Mars. There will also be a replacement HTV ready for launch each time so that in the event of the HTV returning and being unable to be reused, the Mars exploration program can still continue. I will aim to have it spend no longer than 4 weeks travelling between the MCV and either planet. This means that the propulsion module will need rather high efficiency, and will probably involve the use of either magnetoplasma thrusters or a high-efficiency chemical engine (such as a tri-propellant engine). I also want to ensure that it is capable of supporting the crew in LMO for the entire time period between the arrival at Mars and the departure for Earth, in case there is any issue that would mean that the surface mission cannot be conducted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor each mission, there will be a new MDV (Mars Descent Vehicle), MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) and MSH (Martian Surface Habitat). They will each be transported to LMO before the mission that will use them (much like in The Martian) and the MAV and MSH will be landed at whichever landing site is chosen for that particular mission. The MSH will be sent with all necessary surface equipment, and a pressurized\u00A0rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the missions (I will be proposing four out of the ten total) will also involve landing on both Deimos and Phobos using the DPEV (Deimos/Phobos Exploration Vehicle). This will be transported to LMO in the preparation phase of each relevant mission. The Deimos and Phobos landings will occur at the end of\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore any of the crewed equipment, there will be a satellite network set up. A constellation of MPS (Martian Positioning System) satellites will be deployed in Mars orbit along with three larger satellites to serve as relay links back to Earth (there are three\u00A0for redundancy). There will also be a relay satellite positioned at Mars\u0027s L4 point, and another at its L5 point, and two relay receiver satellites in Earth orbit. This will ensure a continuous communication link to all vehicles involved in the Mars exploration program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for launch systems, I will mainly try to limit all modules to Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy payload capacities (22.8 tonnes and 54.4 tonnes respectively), in an attempt to prioritize reusable launch systems (and at the same time help to test out and therefore improve the Falcon systems). For larger payloads I have allowed myself the option to use NASA\u0027s SLS rockets, for payloads of 70, 105, 130, and possibly 150 tonnes if development of the Pyrios LRBs goes ahead. The crew will be transported to the HTV on a Dragon 2 (possibly launched on a Falcon Heavy if it can\u0027t reach the necessary orbit altitude from launch on a Falcon 9).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an incredibly complicated method as far as KSP goes, but it\u0027s definitely interesting and will be quite fun to execute (I just have to figure out the synodic period between Kerbin and Duna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-16T18:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222760134\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147840\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474050145\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160814\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eloquentJane\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, eloquentJane said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an incredibly complicated method as far as KSP goes, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut it\u0027s definitely interesting and will be quite fun to execute\u003C/strong\u003E (I just have to figure out the synodic period between Kerbin and Duna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are definitely the main reason to build a cycler in KSP.

It has to conduct high-energy transfers to rendezvous with the MCV, and also to transport the crew from the MCV to Mars and later back to Earth. It will dock to the MCV and stay with it for as much of the transfer as possible. Because of this mission profile, the HTV has to keep the astronauts in a cramped microgravity environment (the MCV has centrifuges and reasonable living space as well as a lab) and I want to minimize the time spent in such an environment (which unfortunately means that the HTV requires a huge amount of delta-v and therefore will probably use low-thrust electric propulsion).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe alternative is a mission profile like in The Martian, where the Mars transfer vehicle will get into an orbit around both destinations. I chose to avoid this because the MCV is enormous due to the need to store 7 astronauts in deep space for several years in total\u00A0(I\u0027m not sure quite how large it will be yet but I anticipate it being significantly more massive than the ISS (largely due to the centrifuge modules)) and therefore the propellant costs for transferring it between SOIs would seriously add up even with high-I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0thrusters. I also would anticipate that ethics councils would not allow the use of nuclear thermal propulsion on a crewed spacecraft, so the most effective method of transporting the MCV into its required orbit is not really an option for use when the crew are on board (hence why that transfer stage has to move into a graveyard orbit once the MCV is positioned safely). The other reason why I chose to use the cycler method is because it is rather interesting and doesn\u0027t require calculations on the same level of complexity as the spiral orbits of electronically-propelled vessels (which was the other propulsion option for the MCV and is its method of making course corrections).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso,\u00A0no, I am not in that video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
