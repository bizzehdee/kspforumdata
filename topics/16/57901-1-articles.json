A perfect burn would be a one second burn at exactly you PE, any time longer than this is technically inefficient but if you can use a nuke with TWICE the ISP of the next best engine (I ignore Ions) then it is probably better in most cases but not all. I once had a ship that Kept its second to last skipper stage even after circularising its orbit (it was over designed). It had Nukes that were far enough out to also fire. I sent a few of these ships to the Mun, first one without firing the skipper (I would have had to drop about 3000 fuel if I dropped the engine). The second I fired suing the skipper.
