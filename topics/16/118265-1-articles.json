Then I realized they were actually spawning in the floor of the VAB every time I clicked them, with a solid texture as if attached. I could grab them from there and attach them to my build and move them around but only with 1x symmetry. if I tried with any other symmetry they wouldn\u0027t attach but strangely leave a silhouette imprint on the parent part wherever I moved them over it, resulting in tens of \u0022unattached\u0022 landing legs covering my whole craft. The same thing happened no mater what type of landing legs I tried to use. There was nothing wrong with the landing gear or any other parts that I could tell. Only the landing legs. \n\nHas anyone seen this before or have any idea why this could be happening?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T15:26:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 03:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A\\_name**"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T03:55:26Z","Content":"I\u0027ve never seen it, but you may want to backup saves and re-install.
