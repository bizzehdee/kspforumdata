I wont be giving out any advice as I am the one who needs it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve built many ships in KSP but I am always stopped from being 100% satisfied by my hopeless attempts at fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For larger ships we seem to be stuck choosing between the structural panels or Ibeams. Ive tried both and have had (since yesterday) more luck with the Ibeams. They do add a lot of weight and extra parts but look great if done well. The structural panels are lighter on parts and weight but I always seem to have the issue with the panels at the top, they overlap leaving unsightly edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, if us stock purists want good looking fairings are we stuck with Ibeams and structural panels? If so, lets get some ideas going for better stock fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T13:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have faced the same problems, (i\u0027m making structural panel based fairings which splits in halves) and i ended up adding cubic struts and the aerodynamic nosecone to one of the halves, to cap the fairings.
