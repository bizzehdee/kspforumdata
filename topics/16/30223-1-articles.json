As a new-ish player I\u0027d like to have a clue of what to expect when I prepare to launch towards another world - like approximate mass/size/gravity, does it have an atmosphere, or is it even solid... Does this already exist in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a campaign idea I\u0027d love to see only very crude information in mission center, which would then be improved if I had let\u0027s just say built a telescope, or had a craft (with suitable science equipment) orbit or impact the body, even better data if kerbals have landed there... you get the picture.

If you go into map mode, and tab your way to or double mouse click on a planet, it will bring you to it\u0027s view. From this, on the right side of your screen, there will be two small buttons. One being a planet with a sort of ring around it, and the other just being a sphere. The top one will give you a \u0022In-character\u0022 sort of description, some info about the planet put into Kerbal wordsense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The bottom one, however, lists very useful information about the planet itself such as equatorial gravity, atmospheric height(if it has an atmosphere) and SOI distance and escape velocity. There are much more, but I can\u0027t list them off the top of my head. Though before you look at that, you may actually want to do some science yourself, it\u0027s a ton of fun as it gives you a small feel of what campaign mode will be like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pursuedtank","CreatedById":50078,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T13:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can switch through planets using the tab key which will cycle through all the planets or you can double click on them which will focus the camera on them. you can then use the info bar on the right side of the screen to find out about them, like with Kerbin.
