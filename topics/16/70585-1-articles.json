It\u0027s very easy. In fact, it\u0027s probably already been explained before, but I\u0027ll share it, just in case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Close the game program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Open you file explorer and browse to your KSP root folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Open the Saves folder and open the name of the game you were playing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Open the file called \u0022persistent\u0022. If you are on a windows computer it will tell you that it doesn\u0027t recognize the file type. Click, \u0022pick program from list\u0022, and select notepad and un-check the box that says \u0022make this the default program\u0022. (No idea how to do that part on a Mac....) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Press CTRL\u002BF (opens the find menu) and search for the name of your kerbal (just the first name, in my case I searched for Bill). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When you find him in the file his Status line will be 3. Change it to 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Save the file and re-open the program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETa-da!
