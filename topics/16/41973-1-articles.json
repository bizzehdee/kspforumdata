Im getting ready to send a large craft to Jool and I want to perform the ejection burn as efficiently as humanly possible. The ejection stage is going to have a lot of power. No nukes so the burn time will be short and accurate ( if I can manage that ) Id LIKE to head out on a direct trajectory. No mid course correction. ( Unless you\u0027d recommend otherwise. ) Only a burn to adjust the Jool periapsis so that I get a flat, eq orbit. This site gives a lot of nice information. But sadly I don\u0027t really know how to apply it. I use Engineer redux and Id like to figure out a way to utilize this information with it. Now..im guessing the ballistic option is what I want for a straight shot to Jool, yes? So theres a few values that id like some explanation on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eejection angle ( 110 degrees to prograde in my instance. I know what this is, but does ER give me this value? ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eejection inclination ( -3.61 degrees - How do I apply that value? Not sure ER gives me the current angle of the craft )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd.. as far as the transfer plot graph goes... w..tf am I even looking at? lol I swear stuff like this makes me feel dyslexic. Some of the Dv readouts on it scare the hell out of me \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that most of the information is pretty clear. Id just like a little more insight so I can absolutely NAIL this ejection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T23:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow..im guessing the ballistic option is what I want for a straight shot to Jool, yes?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eejection angle ( 110 degrees to prograde in my instance.
