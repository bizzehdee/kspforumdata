At first glance, it seems like an easy thing to do, considering how notoriously strong reaction wheels\u00A0are in KSP. I made a few designs that had a few \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules, a probe core, and a set of two wheels. It works just fine if you make one and say, roll it down a hill; it stays upright and moves forwards without issue. But for some odd reason, reaction wheels seem to always react to player control, even when they\u0027re set to \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E only\u0022; attempting to actually engage the rover wheels by pressing any of the directional keys causes it to fall over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to troubleshoot using highly simplified designs that only used three parts, a probe core, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E module, and a set of wheels. Despite ensuring that all reaction wheels (including the ones in the command modules) were set to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E only, it would always suffer the exact same problem. Attempting to engage the wheels causes it to stop directing itself and fall down.
