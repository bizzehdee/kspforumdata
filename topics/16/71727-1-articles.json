According to KER, the lander has about 3,100m/s left (when physics load, 2,800).

Without going into the math, Laythe\u0027s atmo starts out a little bit thinner and thins out a little more quickly than Kerbin\u0027s does. The ~8-11km bracket on Kerbin (where I typically start most of my gravity turns myself) is roughly within the same pressure range as the ~5-8km bracket on Laythe. Other than that, if your launch profile works for Kerbin, it\u0027ll probably work well for Laythe (barring piloting errors, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T20:58:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry I cannot give advice on a rocket powered descent other then plan by landing one that can take off of Kerbin :/. If you want my opinion for future missions read on!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy real suggestion is building a lander wit jet engines and detaching them when they burn out. I have a video of my Laythe descent in my most recent streams if you want an example lander. Try going sideways much more than I did. I practiced descent from Kerbin and tried taking off from Laythe the same general way on the assumption that it\u0027s atmosphere was only 8/10 of kerbin and not much different (though it is pretty different). I made it back to my return station fine but I raised out of atmo much faster than I planned and used a considerably smaller amount of jet fuel than I planned (I emptied the tanks to 30 of 150 units when launching and I only used like 7 units when leaving atmo. Just meant more rocket fuel needed).
