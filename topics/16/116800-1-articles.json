Seriously, bad form :/ If you have new questions, simply post a new question without removing the previous one, that\u0027s a disservice to everyone.\n\nWhat\u0027s a \u0022spacecenter map\u0022 anyway? 550 AU would be somewhere far beyond kuiper belt, in the oort cloud I think. Or if this is about the ksp map view / tracking center in kerbal space center, 550 astronomical units would be simply somewhere insanely far beyond any in-game object\u0027s orbit; Kerbin\u0027s orbit is ~13.6 million kilometers from the Sun, so 550 AU would be ~7.5 billion kilometers from the sun. *Very* far away."}]}
