rocket or spacecraft is capable of producing.\u00A0 It can also refer to how much of a change in velocity is required to perform certain maneuvers or tasks.\u00A0 For example, it might take 3400

in low orbit a spacecraft is traveling only about 2300 m/s.\u00A0 So what happened to the other 1100 m/s?\u00A0 It was lost in overcoming gravity and atmospheric

term used in Calculus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason calculus comes into play here is because you are trying to determine the behavior of things that are always in motion.\u00A0 Moreso, you are trying to do so to an object that changes as it performs an action.\u00A0 Calculus is thus known as the \u0027mathematics of change\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut we\u0027re going to ignore that.\u00A0 You don\u0027t need to know calculus to know Delta-V.\u00A0 It\u0027s just useful to know that Calculus is not as intimidating as it may look.\u00A0 In fact, it\u0027s a shortcut.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Delta-V, we\u0027re going to imagine we\u0027re in a car.\u00A0 But we\u0027re going to make some assumptions.\u00A0 For example, the car never slows down when you coast, and the brakes don\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you put your foot on the gas, you accellerate from zero to say, 100 miles per hour.\u00A0 Then you take your foot off the gas, and the car remains at 100 MPH.\u00A0 If I phrase this in plain english, you have had a \u0027change in velocity\u0027 of 100 MPH.\u00A0 Or, you have executed a Delta-V of 100 MPH.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s say you only have enough gas in the tank to accellerate from zero, to 70 MPH.\u00A0 (Not a lot of fuel, but work with me here).\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The Delta-V \u003Cem\u003Eavailable\u003C/em\u003E to you is 70 MPH.\u00A0 Once you accellerate your car to 70, it stays at 70, and you can\u0027t do anything else but coast at 70, forever.\u00A0 Your Delta-V \u0027Budget\u0027 was 70 MPH.\u00A0 If you wanted to say, accellerate to speed, then slow to a stop, you need to find how much you can put your foot on the gas, and then pop the car into reverse and put the foot on the gas again.\u00A0 In this scenario, you can speed up to 35 MPH, then you have to put it in reverse and slow down 35 MPH back to zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple enough, right?\u00A0 Let\u0027s move to rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst and foremost, the notion of \u0027fixed speed\u0027 like in a car on the highway is almost pointless to use as a metric once you\u0027re in orbit.\u00A0 That\u0027s because an orbit is simply you falling AROUND an object as gravity pulls on you.\u00A0 At any given moment, your speed changes depending on where you are.\u00A0 A low orbit around earth, for example, tends to be faster than a high orbit.\u00A0 Or, in an elongated orbit, you\u0027re REALLY fast at the lowest point, and slow as molasses up at the highest point.\u00A0 You still need to know your speed relative to the object your orbiting, but that\u0027s only so you can do the math needed to figure out what your orbit is supposed to look like.\u00A0 We have computers doing that for us here, so we don\u0027t care beyond understanding that it is happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s say we want to execute a change in orbit, going from a low orbit, to a higher orbit.\u00A0 We need to perform several \u0027burns\u0027 of specific length and power.\u00A0 The lower the power, the longer the burn, and the higher the power, the shorter the burn.\u00A0 Either way, in order to get into the higher orbit, you need to think about what you\u0027re actually doing.\u00A0 Since an orbit is simply glorified falling, you need to \u0027fling\u0027 yourself faster so that you\u0027ll \u0027fall\u0027 farther up to the higher orbit.\u00A0 Flinging yourself is a change in velocity.\u00A0 No matter how big your engine is, or how long you have to burn, the change in velocity is your fixed value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get up to the higher orbit, you have to burn again, or speed yourself up more, so that your new velocity keeps you up high as you fall around the parent body.\u00A0 Once you have done so, the only way to come back down is to slow yourself down in that high orbit with another burn, usually, a change in velocity equal to the burn that stabilized your high orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery move you do from one orbit to another in this manner requires this to happen, and thus you have to burn fuel for any change you make.\u00A0 Now, the reason you use \u0027Delta-V\u0027 instead of say, \u0027gallons\u0027 or \u0027liters\u0027 when talking about rockets is simple.\u00A0 No two burns use the same amount of fuel.\u00A0 If a rocket weighs 10 tons, you need to burn MORE fuel to change its velocity than a rocket that weighs 5 tons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut wait!\u00A0 There\u0027s more.\u00A0 As you burn fuel to change velocity, your rocket becomes significantly lighter, really fast.\u00A0 That 10 ton rocket BECOMES the 5 ton rocket in a hurry.\u00A0 That means the math you need to do to find how long and how powerful a burn you need changes by the second.\u00A0 This is where the \u0027calculus\u0027 part actually comes into the picture.\u00A0 Regular algebraic math cannot easily solve this problem without making you rewrite the problem over and over again dozens of times a second.\u00A0 A computer can do that, but a rocket scientist with a slide rule back in the apollo days can\u0027t.\u00A0 Calculus, while more abstract a math system, has the tools needed to solve these \u0027changing\u0027 equations in real time.\u00A0 Again, we\u0027re going to skip over it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, because you can\u0027t base your ability to go places based on blind fuel capacity and a \u0027gas mileage\u0027 like a car, you have to determine your range through a different method.\u00A0 Luckily, rocket science does allow you to find out how much total change in velocity your rocket will have.\u00A0 As long as you know the total mass of your rocket, and the mass of your fuel, you can determine how much it can change in velocity.\u00A0 Likewise, orbital changes are all based on velocity changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, the Delta-V budget can almost instantly tell you where you can go, and whether or not you can come back.\u00A0 It is the single most important number out of all the statistics on your spacecraft.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EEven above the Thrust to Weight Ratio\u003C/em\u003E of launch.\u00A0 If you pull up one of the \u0027Delta V Maps of the Kerbol System\u0027 that are on the internet, you can chain the paths to determine how much Delta you need to get to say, low Duna orbit from Low Kerbin orbit.\u00A0 Then, you can look at your rocket and go \u0027I don\u0027t have enough, need a bigger rocket\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t as \u0027simple\u0027 an explanation as others might be putting out.\u00A0 But I feel that making the explanation TOO simple may become a bit misinforming, and understanding the background usually makes the knowledge more solid.\u00A0 But amazingly enough, the end point of all this is pretty simple, even if the journey to get there is filled with complexity.\u00A0 Then again, the point of these kinds of systems is to simplify the complicated into something nice and bite-size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-30T22:40:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

We know that energy is a function of mass and position (potential energy) or mass and velocity (kinetic energy). However, because the mass of an object doesn\u0027t change throughout an orbit, and because of how gravity works, the mass terms actually \u0022fall out\u0022 of the orbital math and we\u0027re left with position and velocity being the only important variables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen we describe orbits in KSP, we usually use orbial elements to do that job, since they\u0027re easier to digest. But an orbit is equally a set of positions and the velocity vectors at each point. And we don\u0027t need the whole set - it is sufficient to use only a single location and the associated velocity vector to uniquely describe an orbit. KSP, in fact, \u003Cem\u003Edoes \u003C/em\u003Ehave to use this formulation - in order to do patched conics, you find your xyz position and xyz velocity vectors at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary, transform them into the new reference frame, and then derive the new orbital elements from that information. And if you\u0027re doing N-body physics, you don\u0027t have true orbits, you \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E have position and velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll right, this is getting long, but stay with me here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo when we compare two different orbits, we need to compare both the position vector and the velocity vector for each. However, when we\u0027re trying to describe a \u003Cem\u003Emaneuver,\u003C/em\u003E we\u0027re not describing any two old orbits - we\u0027re describing \u003Cem\u003Eintersecting\u003C/em\u003E ones. We\u0027re moving from one orbit to another \u003Cem\u003Ewhere the position is the same in each orbit.\u003C/em\u003E Since the positions are the same, the only difference between the orbits is their respective velocity vectors. And the math you need to do those comparisons isn\u0027t calculus, you only need arithmetic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of describing these maneuvers, delta-V (change in velocity) is exactly that - the \u003Cem\u003Evector \u003C/em\u003Edifference between the two \u003Cem\u003Evelocity vectors.\u003C/em\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRb5PSxJerM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENote that I didn\u0027t say speed, but I emphasized vector and velocity,\u003C/a\u003E because that\u0027s important. Most maneuvers are of the increase/decrease speed variety, but if you\u0027ve ever done a pure plane change, you\u0027ll notice your starting and ending speeds are the same. The velocity change is due entirely to direction change. We normally assume that pointing your vessel in the correct direction is a free action.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to make things more confusing, this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that you\u0027ll be moving at different speeds at different times during an orbit (fast at periapsis, slow at apoapsis). That\u0027s a whole different thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the delta-V \u003Cem\u003Eof a manuever\u003C/em\u003E is the cost of doing that maneuver - how much do I need to be able to change my speed and direction to get to that new path. The delta-V \u003Cem\u003Eof your rocket\u003C/em\u003E (described by the other posters) is a measure of how-much-maneuver-can-my-rocket-do-before-I\u0027m-out-of-gas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-09-01T15:29:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2018 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by pincushionman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
