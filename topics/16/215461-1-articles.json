Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere will do that for you. I\u0027ve survived as high as 8km/s with an Mk1 Command Pod and shield. Just set your PE on Kerbin at around 35km. Quicksave along the way, cuz you may need to make adjustments. You may land on the first try, or you might pass through and swing around again. As long as you get captured by Kerbin, you\u0027re good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may need to reload and adjust your PE up or down. You may be coming in too hot and blow up, or too high and not capture. Also, any fuel you have left, burn retrograde just before or just after you hit the atmosphere and stage your engine off. Any speed you can shed will help.

If you\u0027re at 4000 m/s at 100 km, this kind of speed is actually quite reasonable and expected when returning from Jool via a direct transfer.
