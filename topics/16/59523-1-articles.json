Thus your rocket has a dV of 2,000 m/s, regardless of which configuration you choose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- However, every second spent ascending, you lose 5 m/s of your gain to gravity pulling downwards on your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In case 1, you spend 200 seconds ascending, thus you lose 200 * 5 = 1,000 m/s to gravity, leaving you with 1,000 m/s final velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In case 2, you spend 100 seconds ascending, thus you lose 100 * 5 = 500 m/s to gravity, leaving you with 1,500 m/s final velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly, the high thrust option is better. It produces 50% more speed out of the same dV. In fact, even if the specific impulse of the high thrust engines was worse, and thus there was less dV available to the high thrust option, it would probably \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E end up with more final velocity. That is why the Mainsail engine is great despite its poor Isp rating. It simply catapults you out of the gravity well so much faster than other engines that you save more fuel than you lose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this comes with two caveats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you launch out of an atmosphere, then you will incur atmospheric drag, which grows exponentially with speed. Ostensibly the fastest launch is the best launch, but go too fast in an atmosphere and you spend more fuel fighting air resistance than you would spend fighting gravity while going slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If there is less gravity, then there is less to be gained by leaving it behind fast. And in orbit, there is no gravity at all (because the orbit itself counteracts it). So for orbital maneuvers, TWR is almost entirely irrelevant, and Isp is everything that matters. Of course, you might still want \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E thrust in order to avoid having half-hour burns for your maneuver nodes, and to be able to slingshot effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe takeaway is that you want to optimize your launch stages for TWR (and potential landers as well, especially if they need to relaunch), and your orbital/transit stages for dV. Just don\u0027t optimize them too much, or you end up with a rocket that burns itself up in the atmosphere and later can\u0027t maneuver accurately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smallish","CreatedById":99709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T13:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the answers.

I put together a tool here \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61659-Wolfram-Web-App-Optimal-Single-stage-Lander-Design-Tool\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61659-Wolfram-Web-App-Optimal-Single-stage-Lander-Design-Tool\u003C/a\u003E to do this analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen there\u0027s an atmosphere, drag makes the calculation more complicated, and the optimal gravity turn trajectory to get out of the atmosphere is also TWR-dependent. In a purely vertical ascent it\u0027s well-established that you don\u0027t want to exceed terminal velocity, and anecdotally I\u0027ve seen with some designs you can actually reduce the delta-V cost of Kerbin ascent by imposing an acceleration limit of 22 m/s^2 through the entire gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR influences the design tradeoffs of which engine is most efficient for any combination of delta-V and payload.

You can see how clusters of 48-7S engines outperform almost everything else right now, a sign of poor part balance in 0.22 and 0.23. Check the interactive spreadsheet version I linked to in that thread if you want a few more numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally what I do when optimizing a design for ascent from a planet with an atmosphere is run experiments using MechJeb\u0027s ascent autopilot. Running the same ascent settings with slight changes to the design tells me whether the delta-V left once in orbit improves or not. It\u0027s the only repeatable way to make scientific conclusions for small design tweaks - with manual piloting, there\u0027s always uncertainty in how much of your performance was due to any changes you make to a design, versus flight-to-flight differences in your trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T13:48:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 01:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T13:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post346702\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28248-Is-asparagus-the-best-staging-system-%28might-contain-science%29?p=346702\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post346702\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand on a related note, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33381-0-20-2-Zenith-rocket-family-%28modernised-for-0-20-x-with-perfect-subassembly%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33381-0-20-2-Zenith-rocket-family-%28modernised-for-0-20-x-with-perfect-subassembly%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still like to design my own boosters despite having this particular resource available.

With FAR installed, terminal velocity for any sanely built rocket (looking at you Whackjob), is about 400 m/s at the surface. So you would think going with a higher TWR would be good, but as dreath mentioned, the aerodynamics tend to make you less stable. Because of this Ferram often suggests a lower TWR of about 1.3 to keep you stable at the thicker part of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo this I say, add MOAR FINS! I just have a bunch of vertical stabilizers on my heavy lifter boosters (with a few on my core stage). By the time they\u0027re gone, I\u0027m passed the thicker part of the atmosphere and can really speed up. With this strategy, I keep my TWR at about 1.8-2, so I don\u0027t lose too much to gravity drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keldor","CreatedById":58650,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T18:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as stability in FAR is concerned, you just want to keep your center of drag below/behind your center of mass. Think of the CoM as a pivot, which the rocket swings around. Then the end with more drag wants to go around to the back. Adding tail fins, as you said, adds more drag to the end of the rocket, thus pulling it around to the back as it moves through the atmosphere. Conversely, having a big fat payload at the top of the rocket adds drag up there, which will make it want to flip over so the center of drag goes behind the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T18:47:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Keldor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T18:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt high speeds in atmosphere, it will actually resist turning against the airflow.
