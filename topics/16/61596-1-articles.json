I usually set them up so that one intake per engine always stays open and the rest are roughly divided into 3-4 action groups along the #3-6 keys. Jets on #1, Rockets on #2. I usually incorporate an escape system which activates on Backspace and a seperate key for toggling chutes on #0. Solar Panels on #9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the runway, I throttle up, set the brake and activate the jets. I then close the intakes and let off the brake. Once airborne, I go 60 degrees to 10k (that part\u0027s like a rocket flight - fastest way out of the troposphere is as straight up as you can manage), then hit 45 when I reach 10k, down to about 20-25 at 15k. I\u0027ll watch my intake air after 10k and open up a set of intakes once the intake air gets to about 0.06 units per engine. I also watch my vertical speed indicator the whole time - I want it between 10-100 m/s; more than that and I lower my pitch, less than that and I raise it. By 25k, I\u0027m usually at the 10-15 degree mark picking up serious horizontal velocity. You don\u0027t want your vertical velocity particularly high after 25k - your priority needs to be horizontal. Keep opening intake groups as necessary. When the last group is open, begin monitoring the thrust levels out of your engines, especially if you\u0027ve got more than one Turbojet. Throttle back to 2/3 when the difference gets particularly high; this will save you from flaming out. Continue to monitor it, though, and be ready to reduce again when another differential shows up. Once you\u0027re down to about 1/3 thrust and/or no longer accelerating, kick in the rockets but keep the jets lit - you want to keep them running for as long as you can manage. If you get to the point where you have to kill the jets completely, do so and treat it as a rocket launch from there. Hopefully before that happens you\u0027ll have an orbital apopasis and a speed above 2000 m/s. Note that later in the flight (after 1500 m/s or so), you\u0027ll need to be adjusting pitch to maintain your desired elevation; this is natural, a function of the planet turning underneath you - don\u0027t worry about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Typed up that post, got ninja\u0027d and the forums logged me out for some reason; figured I\u0027d post it anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign-wise: I\u0027d recommend Swept Wings over Deltas.

Go into a shallow descent if you need to and/or, as capi has also said, add some rocket-thrust to the throttled-back jets. Generally, 2km/s\u002B is the target, not 30km altitude.
