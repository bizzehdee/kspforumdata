You guys were right, its because i had switched focus and had a kerbal on EVA. Herein lies my next problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I\u0027m trying to collect soil samples around Kerbin. Seems simple enough, i\u0027ve got kerbals on the moon i can scrap some ice from our own planet right? Wrong. I built a long range plane and got there. I found that easier than trying to land a sub orbital rocket there, but also because i just researched lots of plane related stuff so its new and fun. What my problem is that when my kerbal is on EVA, he will sometimes just poof and disappear. He\u0027s standing there, i can sometimes walk around a bit, and then in a cloud of dust, as if he\u0027s just impacted the ground from free fall, he\u0027s gone. Can\u0027t revert my flight because i\u0027ve switched focus to the kerbal on EVA, even though i still have a pilot on board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first i thought it was a trick of the polar caps, but it happens on grass too. Anyone have any ideas? I really want to knock these mission out because i\u0027m tired of their little icons cluttering up the map and i could go for the science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) My second problem is the damn powered, unmanned satellite mission. I\u0027ve done it three times and its still not checked off. First time i had i used a radial decoupler and i think launched my satellite out of the designated orbit. The second time i used a docking decouple for a softer launch but i had an adapter piece also attached to stayputnik where i threw some solar panels and so when that didn\u0027t satisfy the requirement i thought that extra piece meant it didn\u0027t qualify as a \u0022satellite\u0022. Third time it was just a stayputnik, and antenna, battery, solar panels. Released it \u0022perfectly\u0022 into their orbital path and i still haven\u0027t gotten the science from it. All the other boxes are checked, the meet orbit and be stable for 10 seconds, but the \u0022Launch an unmanned satellite\u0022 one evades me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?
