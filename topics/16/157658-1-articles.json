For example if you mouse over a point in your predicted orbit after a manoeuvre node it shows where the target would be including distance and maybe (but not essential) relative velocity?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027closest encounter\u0027 marker seems to be a bit weird. It can go from\u00A0a few 100,000km to nothing (disappears)\u00A0in 0.01dV in one direction but go to several million km in another. Also it won\u0027t show second encounter like a ship to ship intercept orbit does.Trying to get an encounter with Moho from Kerbin for example can be a trial and error nightmare as once those little grey triangles disappear you\u0027ve no idea how close you are even if potentially you\u0027ll pass within a few hundred thousand km. Even if you get an encounter if you\u0027re using nukes and a multi-orbit burn finding a correction intercept once you\u0027ve escaped Kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E can be impossible. In a sandbox single mission game it\u0027s\u00A0a little frustrating but in career where you\u0027ve 10s of missions on the go at once you can\u0027t just keep reloading if an adjustment goes wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould appreciate any pointers!

That makes them incredibly sticky. They won\u0027t even go away after you already have an encounter, because it\u0027ll even start showing them for your next crossing of the target orbit after performing a flyby. That way, you should be able to avoid losing them while finetuning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor what it\u0027s worth, though: even without that toggle, KSP is usually pretty good at showing them. If they disappear really quickly in one direction but stay a long while in another, that usually means you are passing a significant distance above or below the target, so that a small change in the wrong direction will put you out of range entirely. An inclination correction should fix that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pie82","CreatedById":175223,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-13T20:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks - that does seem to make them stick around a lot longer. It still doesn\u0027t seem to make complete sense at least to me - after\u00A0a 0.01 adjustment in Precise Node they jumped from ~120,000km to\u00A0millions (i.e other side of orbit) but it does seem to be a bit more sticky than before! I still rekon if I did the burn with the massive encounter distance I\u0027d still pass less than an orbit away but I probably don\u0027t fully understand the behaviour of the predictions as a newbie to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to clarify - the option is under graphics and not gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grounder","CreatedById":175867,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-10T11:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would strongly recommend watching, \u0022How to use the Navball\u0022 by Buckeyemonkey. \u00A0You can find it on the whiteboard tutorials, point being, during one of these videos he is struggling with the maneuver nodes-working all the handles until he finally gets a proper encounter. \u00A0Frustrating? \u00A0You bet. \u00A0I liked the video because he\u0027s clearly an advanced player yet he is struggling like the rest of us. \u00A0You know, sometimes it\u0027s just game mechanics and not the gamer. \u00A0Nice to know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
