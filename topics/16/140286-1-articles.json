I agree with you -- the 2x3 are totally worthless. IRL, you want the panels to stick out as far as possible from the ship, so they do not get occluded as often. Also, the narrower panels are less likely to interfere with anything when they rotate. I\u0027d be perfectly happy if Squad were to do away with the 2x3 to make room for some more interesting part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Provisional Name 12","CreatedById":158174,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T06:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nspecific designs aside where the 2x3s fit into a design better (uncommon) it is possible 2x3s might have more surface area and may be more resistant to being bumped from on the end. I could also see ship designs where if you wanted to include a lot you might want to put 2x3s on the top so that they wouldn\u0027t block lower panels. I don\u0027t think this is currently how light is calculated though. That said, more often than not they aren\u0027t as good, are more likely to break and in my last career mode that I restarted on normal I never bought them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T15:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood question! \u00A0Something I\u0027ve often asked myself. \u00A0In general I prefer the 1x6 but there have been a few space-station builds where the more compact 3x2 format made them easier to keep out of the way of everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tr1gg3r","CreatedById":161427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T17:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer the 3x2\u0027s rather than 1x6\u0027s on my rovers and other strange craft \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0less obtrusive and less snappy-offy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T18:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin real life, they should be more robust as the maximum distance from the anchor point is less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, because they stick out less, I sometimes use them on landers or things that need to dock with a \u0022crowded station\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- particularly the lighter non-retractable versions.
