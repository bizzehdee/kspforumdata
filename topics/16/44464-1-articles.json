You can definitely line it up with a drogue (MK-25) parachute at the back, and that will partially inflate as high as 25km IIRC. But the partially inflated drag is small and really just good for keeping it smooth. The most important thing will be to put the density forward. You want the craft to have its center of thrust furthest back, with the center of mass furthest forward, and center of lift anywhere in between, for launching or any time you are running the engines, especially in atmosphere. So if you are able to move the center of mass far enough forward, you should be able to both have a steady launch and a steady re-entry. The real trick is dealing with the high density of engines, fairly high density of fuel tanks, and low density of most every other in-line part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T10:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T13:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip.

This is because 1) there is zero in-game instrumentation to help you and 2) every single one you do is different, even with the same ship at the same planet aiming for the same final apoapsis, because you\u0027ll always at least have a different speed. Thus, it\u0027s always trial and error, meaning you\u0027ll have to go back to your quicksave, put the periapsis in a different place, and try again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe charts and tables Specialist290 mentions are very helpful for giving you a rough idea of what sort of periapsis to start with, but you\u0027ll almost certainly have to tweak things from there to end up with what you want. Also, you really can\u0027t use these tables until you enter the target\u0027s SOI and know what your orbital stats are, and for everything except Jool itself with its huge SOI, this is also about the same place you want to quicksave before tweaking your periapsis. So that means save, exit to stop time, read the chart, then restart the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note: When you set your periapsis while you\u0027re out near the edge of the SOI, you have to consider that just an estimate. It will certainly change the closer you get to the planet. So, when you\u0027re fairly close to the planet, like say 2-3x the height of the atmosphere to give yourself some time, make a final tweak of the periapsis to put it exactly where you want it. But also understand that as soon as you hit the atmosphere, you\u0027ll start slowing down as intended, so the periapsis you set will get lower as you approach it. Don\u0027t freak out about that, just roll with it. It\u0027s the apoapsis you need to keep an eye on. If it ends up being to high or too low, remember you have a quicksave to go back to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, the single greatest problem with aerobraking is that because it\u0027s trial-and-error, you have to spend most of the time in the map view watching what\u0027s happening to your apoapsis. Thus, you can\u0027t watch much of the pretty fireworks and will probably miss any spectacular fail that occurs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
