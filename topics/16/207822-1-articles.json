(This plane,\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796094084\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796094084\u003C/a\u003E and yes I know you can see a hinge, the rotation servo is underneath that.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I want a single servo to respond to a direct input - press one key it goes fully one way, press another key it goes fully the other, let go and it goes back to the neutral position - \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E to be able to set the \u0022neutral\u0022 position incrementally. Is there a way to do this in stock? If not, is there a mod that can provide this functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe servo is set to range from -20 to \u002B20, with 0 being the position that puts the canard flat. I have tried all the following and they didn\u0027t do what I want:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBinding the servo\u0027s Target Angle to Pitch in absolute mode. This gives me direct pitch control but no trim. As previous forum threads have discussed, trim and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E ignore axis assignments.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBinding the servo to Pitch in absolute mode and to Custom01 in (inverted) incremental mode. The absolute mode \u0022wins\u0022 forcing the servo to 0 when W or S aren\u0027t pressed regardless of what I do with the custom axis.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n(Binding the servo only to Custom01 in incremental mode. This provides trim functionality, but no direct pitch control, and therefore no way to do sharp manouvres. I mention this to show that Custom01 and incremental mode do work by themselves.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBinding the servo to a single KAL controller (with position -20 at the start and \u002B20 at the end), and binding play position of that KAL to Pitch in absolute and to Custom01 in incremental. Same result, absolute wins. I see this in the play position of the KAL controller, inputs on Custom01 don\u0027t move it from the 2.5s (midpoint) position.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBinding the servo to two KAL controllers, \u0022Canard Pitch\u0022 and \u0022Canard Trim\u0022, with the same track set. Then binding the Canard Pitch controller to Pitch in absolute and the Canard Trim controller to Custom01 in incremental. Setting priorities:\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEqual: When I am changing the Custom01 axis the canard moves, but as soon as I let go the Canard Pitch controller \u0022takes over\u0022 and forces it back to zero if there\u0027s no pitch input or full down/up if there is pitch input, regardless of the play position on the Canard Trim controller.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCanard Pitch higher number: Only Pitch takes effect, Trim does nothing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCanard Trim higher number: Same as when they were equal.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOK so I\u0027m adding a third KAL controller, call it Canard Pitch 2. This one is set to control the play position of, enable, and disable Canard Pitch. Play position track from 0 to 1, Enable controller track at start and end, disable controller track in the middle. Canard Pitch 2, and not Canard Pitch, is bound to the Pitch axis. That doesn\u0027t work either! It turns out that when the Play Position on a KAL controller \u0022jumps\u0022, whether that\u0027s by an axis (either absolute or incremental) or by clicking the slider in the part window, \u0027instantaneous\u0027 actions in the KAL tracks such as enable, disable, toggle, etc do not trigger. Those actions can only be triggered by Playing the KAL track.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s where I\u0027m at. All these things that don\u0027t work and I\u0027m just about out of ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
