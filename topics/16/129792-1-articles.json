I find it amusing, perhaps they need to spend their budget doing space things, and testing what is clearly actually just a fancy automobile wouldn\u0027t fit into that, thus needing a pod at the very least to be included in the whole shebang. Loopholes, you know? So SpaceM Automotive (our cheekily-named rover division) has a single, old, defective size-1 pod they drag out each round of testing to appease the government paper-pushers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
