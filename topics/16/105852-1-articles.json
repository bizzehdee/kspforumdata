Only it\u0027s not remembering my mode settings. For example if I click on \u0022steer left\u0022 and then select different values for \u0022use in modes\u0022 when I click accept it doesn\u0027t remember my changes. It does however remember if I change which key is bound. \n\nSo I can change which key is bound to an action, can\u0027t seem to change which modes that applies to. Any I doing something wrong, or is this a bug?\n\nSo for example I want \u0022steer left\u0022 as A (which it is) but have it apply to \u0022Docking (Translation)\u0022 but I can\u0027t make that setting stick. \n\nI\u0027ve had a look in the settings.cfg file to see if I could manually change it there. But I don\u0027t understand the values for the modeMask attribute (which is what I\u0027d guess I need to change). Any ideas what the different modeMask values mean?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T13:11:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:28:20Z","Content":"Update, so what I\u0027ve found is that by manually editing the settings.cfg I can manually set the modes that keys apply to.
