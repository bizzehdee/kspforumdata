So I put together three rockets with one of those 1-to-3 thingymajigs at the top. I used those long solid fuel ones. Then I put on some separator thingies, and another set of long rockets. Then I put on a bunch of smaller solid fuel rockets, and sidemounted them with three more. So my takeoff is with 6 small solid fuel rockets, then I jettison those and start three long ones, and then a final stage with three more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, this thing is falling apart. On the starting platform, it\u0027s all jiggly. And once in the air, there is sort of a pendulum effect and the rockets aren\u0027t attached to eachother so usually there\u0027s just a large BOOM at some point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with my structural instability, I did at one point manage to get so high speed that my nose cone started glowing red from atmospheric friction. Just what I wanted! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E But it is currently more based on luck than anything else. Also, it\u0027s nigh impossible to steer this long thing, but I guess I can figure out the steering myself eventually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need to know is how to tie those long rockets together. I want to keep them tight together like that, 3 of them, but so that they don\u0027t jiggle away from eachother. I want one single really long rocket, that acts as if it\u0027s solid. How do I add that structural integrity?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T08:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry strut setups like this one below, its extremely strong, you use symmetry on 6X and the small cubic struts(or two cubits/large ones if you need to get past overhanging edges). Use this kind of setup to really strengthen wobbly bits. Also use cross struts when dealing with all struts, makes them much more than twice as strong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ksp.sjwt.org/2013-01-26/screenshot1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T13:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEAS-4 Strut Connectors: The most useful part in the entire game for keeping the whole stack from coming apart.
