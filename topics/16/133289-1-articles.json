As expected\u00A0due to the lack of a periapsis on the map, it is on a collision-course with Kerbin. Lucky as I am, it is crashing almost at the center of the North pole. This allows me to fly\u00A0in an expedition towards the North pole that can do their thing as soon as the asteroid lands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, here\u0027s the question: if an uncontrolled asteroid enters the atmosphere, will it make its way to the ground or will it disappear before that? I remember hearing things about\u00A0parts, flying in the atmosphere, disappearing if they move more than 2500m away from the camera, but I\u0027ve also seen debries of\u00A0spacecraft fly more than 10km away from the command module during reentry, and not disappearing. I\u0027m playing on the latest version of the game, if that\u0027s of importance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother important question is, will the asteroid survive the heat of the reentry? Will it need parachutes to come down safely or does smashing it into the ground work too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T23:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfocused craft (including asteroids) that dip below ~25km get deleted.
