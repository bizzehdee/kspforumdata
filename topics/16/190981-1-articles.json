I still have some challenges with the in-atmosphere performance of some of my rockets that have been pernicious and I was hoping some of you experienced designers could enlighten me on some more theory.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference, I am playing vanilla KSP current release career mode and have all the 90 science parts unlocked except the aircraft tree with a few 180 science parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith some help from the forums I\u0027ve basically solved my \u0022flippy rocket\u0022 problem. What has helped me as far as design principles\u00A0are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRockets fly in atmo like a badminton shuttlecock. You want mass in the front, drag in the back and for stability you want some distance between them. So for solving flippy rockets you can:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) Move your center of mass forward. This seems to be difficult as generally your payload is your payload and the basic layout of the booster rocket is often driven by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of the engines\u00A0you have access to. The main helpful tip here for some rockets has been turning off fuel consumption in my most anterior second stage fuel tank and releasing the fuel only after the after tanks have been nearly exhausted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Don\u0027t fly too fast. Throttling my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E engines to keep \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E around 1.5 has worked well for me. Knowing that I can throttle down SRBs in the vehicle assembly\u00A0has also been helpful when working with lighter payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Add drag to the back. For me this has been the most helpful (though still feels like the least elegant solution). Sometimes you just need MOAR fins at the back of the rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love any other tips to help with this problem that are more elegant than MOAR fins, but in general, my problem with rockets taking a nosedive mid gravity turn have disappeared.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately another trickier problem has cropped up. I\u0027ve managed to solve it eventually for my various rockets, but I haven\u0027t been able to figure out the principles behind why it is happening and how to prevent/fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe basic probably is that mid gravity turn, the rocket suddenly swings like a pendulum and points straight up. I feel like this may be related to the \u0022flippy rocket\u0022 problem, the two solutions I\u0027ve found on specific rockets have been adding MOAR fins on one rocket and using a fairing to cover a very draggy payload on another rocket (to much drag on the anterior part of the craft??). Like I said, I would love some help understanding the \u0022why\u0022 this happens so I can avoid it in my designs and fix it without so much trial and error (I admit, I play hardcore once I get my flights into space, but I do use the revert flight option if I have problems in atmo and consider it the roleplay equivalent of the simulations and wind tunnel testing one would be able to do in real life).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is an example of the rocket where I solved the problem by adding the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Can\u0027t figure out how to upload images, hopefully can access through the links).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/k15dmv4ysbaruzq/screenshot8.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOriginal design without fairing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/azyaloo4i0nsp21/screenshot7.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOriginal Design penduluming during gravity turn\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/82fmdqb1altwi7o/screenshot6.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESuccessful design with fairing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference if needed, my typical flight profile is launching 90 degrees eastward with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled.

Looking at my screenshot, it looks like my \u0022flip out\u0022 happens right as I approach the sound barrier. The fairing solving the problem does suggest that the underlying problem was drag at the front of the spacecraft.
