Try to move your wings or add fins to make the two as close as possible, also keep in mind that, as fuel is consumed, your CoM will most likely move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- not enough control surfaces: for pitch, try adding fins, elevons... at the back or at the front of you plane, the further they are from your CoM, the more they will act on your plane (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etorque\u003C/a\u003E definition)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T02:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mole55\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mole55\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you make planes pull up sharper and stay in a climb?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More lift.

Maintaining a steep angle of ascent requires the thrust to accomplish that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More control surfaces up to a point. Shortage of elevons may make your plane unresponsive, but more of them won\u0027t make you able to ascend any better assuming you can attain the correct AoA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More intake. Assuming you use jet engines, as you ascend your intake will tend to decrease due to thinning atmosphere. This is countered by either having more intakes or by going fast enough that sufficient air is forced into the ones you have. See thrust - too steep an ascent = stalling out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Less mass. More crap, less fly, simple formula. Cut some extra weight to see better results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Wing placement. As mentioned above, putting wings all the way the back can be a big mistake. It\u0027s best to design your wings as a single movable structure (i.e. everything attaches to innermost wing panel) so you can test it in different positions to get the desired performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T04:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-Not only do you not want your center of mass behind your center of lift, which makes the plane unstable... you also do not want your center of lift too far behind your center of mass. This makes the plane overly stable and slow to turn or pull up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make sure your pitch control surfaces are as far away from the center of mass as feasible. Pitch on the center of mass does nothing, that\u0027s where roll belongs (unless you are doing elevons instead of ailerons and elevators)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Wheel placement. If getting off the runway before cheating the hill at the end is your problem, move the rear wheels closer to the center of mass. It\u0027s a lever, the wheels are your fulcrum, the pitch is your force, the front of the plane is your load.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T19:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat most people gloss over is that if you can\u0027t pitch-up, your stability is overpowering your control authority. This is why you see the suggestions of both making the craft less stable and increasing control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual answer depends on desired craft behavior. If you want your craft to be more resistant to stalls, you keep the high stability and add/move control surfaces for control authority. If you want your craft to be more efficient, you reduce aerodynamic stability so you need fewer control surfaces (which add drag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy light and medium space planes tend towards less stable craft. Larger planes tend towards more stability since that is more tolerant of control mistakes (due to physics lag)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T19:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that when you post s pic of your plane, make sure its in the SPH with the COM and COL showing.

Another aspect to consider is drag, and the intake mounted just above the jet engine is adding a degree of drag on the tail, contributing to the overall control of the craft. All of these are flown by me with SAS on, your results may vary without it, though it\u0027s considerably easier to do so if you use a flight stick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also trim craft in flight with Modifier Key \u002B directional control (on PC that\u0027s Alt \u002B W,A,S,D,Q, or E) and reset the trim to \u0022center\u0022 with Modifier \u002B X.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T22:51:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T08:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027ve balanced CoM well etc, yet it\u0027s still maneuvering sluggishly, place a pair of canards near the front of the craft.

This in turn moves the CoM way back. Since the CoM is far back, any forward control surface will have a ton of control authority.
