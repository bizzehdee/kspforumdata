Autostruts can fix that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutostruts are like regular struts- they add rigid reinforcements between parts to hold everything steady- but unlike normal struts an autostrut is free, weighs nothing and can be connected to three parts- the heaviest part on the vessel (which can change in flight especially docking, so use with care); the root part (tends not to change unless you\u2019re docking so pretty safe for general use) and the part\u2019s grandparent (e.g. an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E attached to a radial decoupler attached to a fuel tank, the booster\u2019s grandparent part is the fuel tank) which doesn\u2019t tend to change at all and can be used just about everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen building a launch rocket, I tend to set all the engines to autostrut to the root part to stop the rocket compressing under thrust, radial boosters to grandparent part, most fuel tanks to grandparent part and nose cones on boosters to root part, with the root part itself (usually a probe core or command pod) autostrutted to the heaviest part unless it\u2019s going to dock to something. It\u2019s not a good idea to use autostruts on your payloads if you intend to dock them to something else, unless they\u2019re really floppy; in which case remember to turn them off again before docking. Docking changes the root part and recalculates all part relationships so autostruts can get confused, causing weird vessel warping, parts stuck at odd angles and possibly even a total collapse in the physics system leading to massive disassembly- a.k.a. Kraken attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that rigid attachment is not the same thing and generally not advised for anything in an atmosphere or expected to accelerate rapidly- attaching parts in a rigid way makes them more prone to snapping under stress than if they\u2019re able to move a bit. There\u2019s a reason trees sway in the wind, and planes with rigid wings often end up losing them when you pull some G-forces,\u00A0which is usually a bad thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rynther","CreatedById":192875,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-28T13:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will say after hearing what they are, I have mixed feelings about using them.
