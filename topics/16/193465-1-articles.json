Kerbol is weird). For example, say I did a flyby of the Mun and was on an escape trajectory of Kerbin. While I am in the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) I cannot time warp directly to that of Kerbol. In order to resolve this, you have to warp into the middle \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E first. So for you, if you\u0027re within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, warp to Kerbol\u0027s and then from there to Eve\u0027s. Also, if you have extra deltaV, it\u0027s good to get down your periapsis a bit so that if it moves during warp, it will stay within the planet\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
