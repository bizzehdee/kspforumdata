I also want efficiency, gotta have a reasonable rocket too.

Make them as aerodynamic as possible. Stubby rockets are inefficient. Also go below terminal velocity it saves fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:11:09Z","Content":"I had a pre-1.0 lander model weighing ~60 tons achieving 9k vacuum delta-v that used 3 BACC SRBs and 3 LV-T30 for taking off, hopefully even with thrust downgraded in atmosphere it should be a good start."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:19:39Z","Content":"Kaboom,\n\n I\u0027m not certain at this point that a launch from Eve is possible at all at this point. At least from sea level.\n\n The only engines you have to work with are the aerospike and the Mammoth. Either can produce a theoretical max of 2000 to 2300 m/sec, but I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s possible to break 7300 m/sec no matter how you stage it.\n\n We\u0027ll be looking at it more closely as we learn new stuff.\n\n Best,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Sneaky Bstard Sword","CreatedById":106377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:53:57Z","Content":"One of the biggest issues here is making something that can be shipped out to eve with relative convenience that\u0027s still aerodynamic\n\ntesting some concepts using KER now.\n\nEDIT: managed 6895 atmo dV; should come out to around 7.3k since you\u0027re doing things like circularization in vac (unless Slashy\u0027s estimates included that).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T20:15:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sneaky Bstard Sword**"}]}
