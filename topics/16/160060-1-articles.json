It requires 10,000 units of LiquidFuel to Low Moho orbit, so I\u0027m using a large Mk3 fuel tank. My plan was to land the tanker near a mining base, and move it using a rover. The problem is, the tanker is so heavy, even when empty, that the rover can barely move, and goes at 0.5 m/s up slightly inclined hills on Moho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how I could do this better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ag6H0m7Hg8jmgrJ26CD_EbCQaWxvQA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://1drv.ms/i/s!Ag6H0m7Hg8jmgrJ26CD_EbCQaWxvQA\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ag6H0m7Hg8jmgrJ44EK5T1iLzQVsag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://1drv.ms/i/s!Ag6H0m7Hg8jmgrJ44EK5T1iLzQVsag\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ag6H0m7Hg8jmgrJ44EK5T1iLzQVsag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://1drv.ms/i/s!Ag6H0m7Hg8jmgrJ44EK5T1iLzQVsag\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T02:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut a fuel tank and a rocket engine on the back of the rover to help it up the hills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T02:32:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you\u0027ve already got your base set up, just wanted to show you what I like to use for dedicated mining/refueling. I wouldn\u0027t say one way is \u0022better\u0022 than another (I think it just depends on how you like to play), but this method works really well for refueling large tankers. Just claw it, drop your drills, and start refueling. Much quicker than shuttling back and forth.
