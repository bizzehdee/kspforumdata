With this version no difference is stated, but\u00A0today I noticed that I can\u0027t perform orbital survey with the survey scanner using a probe with only RemoteTech antennaes. Due to this I think that now already things with the (stock) ore sensors will need both, and maybe the lab as well. Can\u0027t say anything for sure though, Cause I haven\u0027t got 1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T21:25:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having a hell of a time finding what you mean by data transmitters, so I\u0027ll just tell you what I know:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve set up a ring of sats around kerbin, and a ring around moon, without data transmitters, and I\u0027ve transmitted science back to ksc from the farside of the moon with a probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SteveD80","CreatedById":160995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T19:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it is stock functionality and not remote tech that you are having an issue with.\u00A0 The bandwidth is a part of stock and dictates how long you have to transmit for.
