So, I built a small claw equipped recovering unit, docked it into the MK3 cargo bay \u00A0of my shuttle-like medium \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and took off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon reaching the targeted space junk, I opened the cargo bay and undocked the recovering unit, to realize that the the original target (i.e., the equipment to be recovered that, I discovered at that time, was a depleted booster) was not retained by the undocked unit, and that there was apparently no way to target it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed, as far as I know, you can target a unit only in map mode, but when the unit you control is too close (that is, 20 m or less) to the unit you want to target, a correct selection is almost impossible. On the other hand, when in \u0022normal\u0022 view mode, docking ports are the only things that can be selected as target in nearby objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could well be that it\u0027s me that is missing something. Any idea how to efficiently select a nearby object (with \u0022nearby\u0022, I mean so close that cannot be distinguished by my craft on the map) without the agonizing pain of sub-pixel-precision clicking in map mode?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPS: for those who might be interested, I ended up redocking the recovering unit in the cargo bay, and then maneuvered the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to get the damn piece of junk into the cargo bay too, and eventually had the docked claw capturing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-14T20:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried double-clicking on the craft that you want to target?
