Repacking parachutes it possible however many times a parachute is deployed. Well, here is the story...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUpon launching my Dart Mk I Single person crew spaceplane to Duna, I activate the parachutes to land safely on the mars-like planet. I repack them through EVA, begin the half year trip back to Kerbin. Upon reentering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, I activate the parachutes once more (hotkeyed them last time).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the whole problem is that that right there is supposed to work perfectly. Flawlessly. Without error. Instead, whenever I get low enough in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere that the parachutes are supposed to deploy (high altitude, no fuill drag yet), they tear my ship in half. Like they deployed at the 500 meter mark.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first, I thought this was an error on my part, and isntead of traveling at 2.7 km/s, I pulled it down to 1.9km/s in early atmosphere thanks to a simple retrograde burn. Ship still torn in half at high altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parachutes, I have no idea whats going on, but it seems they are deploying fully at the max altitude they are supposed to deploy, and the results tears apart my ship, and leaves it to crash into Kerbin. I have lost the flight twice due to this, ahving sent the Dart Mk I to Duna four times, and made it back twice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMade it there first time, crash landed on Duna, trying to land it like a spaceplane should be landed.\u003Cp\u003EMade it there second time, landed via parachutes, left the breaks on, flipped it over, and it got destroyed. (extremely powerful engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade it there third time, Landed well enough, made it back to Kerbin, died upon impact, ship torn apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade it there and back fourth time, but lost both port side and starboard side wing engines. Not intentional.

If it\u0027s the basic, little ones, then deploying at high altitude at 1900 m/s is a bit rough on them. You\u0027ll want to aerobrake for a while and wait till your speed is down around 500 m/s or less (depends on number of chutes and weight). Full deployment around 100-200 m/s (again cutes and weight dependent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the initial deployment altitude isn\u0027t what you want, you can right click on the chute and change the atmosphere pressure number. It might still be low if you changed it for Duna. In which case the streamer portion will come out at very high altitude on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a parachute planner online, but I don\u0027t have the link with me at the moment. I\u0027m sure someone will post it before I do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, make sure you aren\u0027t entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere too steep. Your ship won\u0027t have time to bleed off speed in the atmosphere before the chute wants to deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, you can also quicksave (F5) and quickload (F9) if you make a mistake.
