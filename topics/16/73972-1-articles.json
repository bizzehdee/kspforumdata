After flipping over several times, Neldon ragdolled in his seat. And when he got up again, he was lodged into the command seat, as you can see below. He\u0027s not frozen in the T-arms model position, as I could still move him around with WASD, and even jump with the spacebar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yOUjf73.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yOUjf73.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also activate his RCS pack, and after wiggling around a bit he finally fell forward off of the rover. But then the vehicle flipped again and continued down the Munar slope without him. From that moment on he was, according to the vessel labels, a piece of debris from his rover. As expected with a piece of debris, no controls worked. You can see him just standing there in the first photo with his pack still active. Is there some sort of fix for this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there isn\u0027t then I plan on just leaving him for dead and chalking up the loss to \u0022Mun dust induced paralysis\u0022 (that\u0027s me using the videogame cruelty potential there)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-04T09:25:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2014 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spark Plug\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecase closed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T07:15:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to take a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77327-20May-0-23-5-Issues-Fix-Crashes-Decoupler-EVA-Career-Save-Won-t-Start-more\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E, a lot of info about bugs and fixes for them is collected in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluding help with uncontrollable Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T11:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, there is a fix for your frozen kerbal in my thread that Kasuha posted.
