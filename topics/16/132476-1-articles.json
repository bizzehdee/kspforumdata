Though I\u0027m not really a math guy to tell if Mun can slow you down in itself to remain in Kerbin\u0027s SoI. Probably not. Though doing a slingshot also make your burns more effective.

you can get by with less dV if you\u0027re willing to come home slowly.\u00A0 For example, if the spaceplane is going past Kerbin at 5 km/s:\u00A0 you\u0027ll need 5 km/s to match speed with it, then after the kerbals have transferred, you\u0027ll need another 5 km/s to stop fleeing home and kill your Kerbin-relative velocity;
