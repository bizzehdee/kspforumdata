It may be much of an overkill for some of them delta-v wise (you might start from suborbital trajectory in this case and test some hops around the landing site), but still you have to have at least this level TWR for comfortable piloting. Ensure that you have means to secure your craft on the surface - it\u0027s too easy to tip over in light gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Mun-grade (Eeloo, Dres, Ike) - test it on the Mun! Dres and Ike are actually easier targets, but it\u0027s better to have some extra. Again, you may use suborbital tests with starting at already reduced speed and at least getting the same value when starting back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Double-Mun-Grade (Moho, Vall, Duna) - try double Mun landing at half throttle (a bit overkill, but still) or direct landing from Kerbin-Mun transfer trajectory and going directly back to Kerbin. For Duna landing with aerobraking try starting at couple km above the Mun with minimal velocity, and also run some chute tests in Kerbin atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Laythe - land it on Kerbin and get back to orbit (or at least 2 km/s). Ensure it\u0027s capable of landing on a slope and in water (there\u0027re almost no good even spots)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Tylo - try simulating \u0022landing\u0022 from 100 km Kerbin orbit to 70 km altitude and returning back to 100 km orbit (and better ensure it can get to orbit - you\u0027ll need that extra delta-v for the actual landing). Also note the fuel levels during the \u0022landing\u0022 and try dropping the craft with these fuel levels on Kerbin\u0027s surface to test touchdown sequence.
