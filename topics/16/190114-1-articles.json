Do you want to do a bi-elliptical transfer to save \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E? Or do you want to do a transfer outside a transfer window to not to have to wait for a window? If so, then why are you talking about bi-elliptical transfers? Saving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E with a bi-elliptical transfer - compared to a Hohmann transfer - is only possible if you change your orbit (around the sun in this case) by a large fraction anyhow, so it isn\u0027t applicable to a transfer to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my games I often do interplanetary transfers outside of a transfer window. AFAIK doing a standard transfer from Kerbin to Duna or the other way at a transfer window is the fastest and cheapest transfer. But when I don\u0027t want to wait for a window I can spend somewhat more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and somewhat more time underway, to arrive at the destination earlier than waiting for the window would have meant. Depending on the actual situation sometimes the cost in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E becomes prohibitive, or the trajectory for \u0022leaving right now\u0022 becomes so long that it is better to wait for a window (actually: be closer to a window), but often it works well enough. I set up these transfers by: first setting up a maneuver node as for a Hohmann transfer. Then checking where my target is when I reach it\u0027s orbit: if it is in front of me, then I need to reach the intercept point earlier - compared to the target - to get an intercept, so I need to get closer to the sun to be \u0022faster\u0022 than my target. So I change my ejection angle (i.e. time when I do the burn) to get closer to the sun, which means I need more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E on the burn to get to the target\u0027s orbit. If the target is behind me, then I need to be \u0022slower\u0022, so I need to get farther away from the sun. (I.e. spend some time hanging around in solar orbit outside the orbits of my start and destination.) Then I fiddle around with the ejection angle and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E until I get an intercept. If a plane change is needed I include a midway plane-change burn into the fiddling process. Finally I think about whether this transfer is worth the effort, i.e. compare the arrival time at the destination - compared to waiting for a transfer window - to the cost in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, keeping in mind the increased cost of the capture burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere a quick example for a transfer of my gateway station in 500km Kerbin orbit to Duna. As you can see from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E window the next transfer window is in 175 days, together with the 300 days for the transfer itself this means I\u0027d be at Duna in about 475 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.33\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 style=\u0022width:600px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 alt=\u0022KAiLN4c.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/KAiLN4c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome quick and dirty fiddling later I have an encounter in 345 days, at a large-ish cost in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (2400 m/s vs. 870 m/s).\u00A0 I could probably fine-tune this somewhat to shave off some more time and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it\u0027s not going to be a fundamental change.

Do you have an example where you save \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E by doing a second transfer burn? Also 5 km/s for going from Duna orbit to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E seems a bit excessive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[.... *boot up KSP*, *open sandbox*, *time-warp 500 days*, *cheat to orbit* ...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm...

But the initial 2 km/s burn to get to Kerbin (and a small plane change \u0026amp; correction burn halfway in) is essentially what I regularly do, with the difference that I then slam the capsule into Kerbins atmosphere and make fun of Bill and Bob for passing out.
