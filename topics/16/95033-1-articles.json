Its not the aerodynamics, it appears to be timing between keyboard and the stability control unit of the pod. The problem is more noticible if you increase your screen resolution. Apparently as program demands increase the keyboard commands are read as different length intervals and stability control decrease. I had to change my screen resolution because 0.90 flattened everything in the resolution that I was previously using. This meant more video demand and thus more clock cycles to update. Ironically, The longer and heavier the ship was the easier it was to control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue you might investigate, SAS does not work without a titled Pilot (see astronaut complex for new astronaut classifications). Basically before any flight you need to select your nauts from the crew tab in the VAB. Pilots appear to get more skilled as they progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue I found annoying is that KSC eats grounded nauts in physics warp mode.

Basic upgrades for KSC facilities are too expensive, how expensive can it be to have a launch pad that holds more than 18tons when the current launch pad is made of unleveled compressed aggregate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToggle off the torque unit before leaving the craft.
