VERY steep learning curve. Embrace it and Joy will be yours. Learn to crawl, take baby steps, they will eventually lead to orbit. I\u0027ve only ever played the vanilla stock version of KSP. I\u0027ve gone from barely getting a rocket into the air to doing some pretty amazing (IMO) stuff: Namely, I\u0027ve crashed tons of rockets and stranded dozens of Kerbals in Kerbolcentric orbit just learning to get to the Mun. I\u0027ve made an ion drive lander that seats 2 for minmus and minmus-like worlds, I\u0027ve built an nuclear powered SSTO that can (all in the same flight) a:park over 2000 fuel and accompanying oxidizer on my fuel station in a 350km orbit b:launch a small probe that can land on the Mun or Minmus or hit a contract orbit (or several) c:transfer up to 6 crew up to said 350km orbit and d:make a dead-stick (or near dead-stick: \u0026lt;90 liquidfuel) landing right next to the spaceplane hanger. I\u0027ve flown kerbals to Duna only have them miss Duna, and never see another planet again.

Always crash your rocket/spaceplane. That\u0027s how you learn to build rockets/spaceplanes that work. I personally spent over $20 MILLION designing and crashing my first SSTO which cost between $20,000 and $30,000 per test flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Always slap in an extra battery and switch it off, it will save you grief when your engines are pointed at the sun and your solar panels are lost in shadow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Always slap in a probe core that has SAS. This will let you test your new designs without killing off all your favorite or experienced Kerbals. This will also let you send that Scientist or Engineer solo to the Mun and elsewhere. It will also let you send said Engineer/Scientist on a proper, potentially suicidal test flight. It will also let you retrieve expensive hardware that gets left behind when your Kerbal tries to do something awesome like make minmus orbit with just the jetpack and fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Having a tinfoil and cardboard spaceship and calling out items and saying \u0022check!\u0022 was fun right? It is essential in KSP. A couple of important items to say \u0022check!\u0022 to are a:Your Navball Mode, you will waste a lot of fuel trying to do that orbital maneuver with your navball in target mode. b:Engines and Vessel \u0022Command from Here\u0022 again, you will waste a ton of fuel burning your nose to nose docked lander/command module without first turning off one set of engines and designating the correct command seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.
