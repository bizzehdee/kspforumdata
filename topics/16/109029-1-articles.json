I am playing the career mode. I have not orbited the Mun yet and turned into a tourist ferrying pimp for cash and reputation while trying to steal some science on the side. Building a rocket to carry two more passengers is expensive. I am trying to get more science to reach that next best part in the science tree to be able to reach the Mun, but I don\u0027t get science points from the environment any more, only from the amount of money spent due to a strategy I selected in the Admin Building. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) Is this because I discovered everything there is to discover by flying around Kerbal? Is there a limit to science in each planet? I have hauled that ill smelling jug of goo for free once to many times for my liking just to land and not get any science. I have that mod installed which tells you when you have science available. Does the goo jug have to be attached to the Science Jr to yield more science? Is Science Jr. required to get more science points?"},{"CreatedByName":"iVG","CreatedById":58021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:37:23Z","Content":"Yes, there is a limit of science, once experiment is done, it won\u0027t yield more science.

Also, every building at KSC is different biome, so you can do every science experiment at every building and you will receive science. Quite early in tech tree you can build a small rover for one Kerbal (science guy preferably) with one of every experiment.

When you first leave Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and enter your first orbit, you\u0027re in Kerbin\u0027s low space regime.\n\nHowever, if you can get into orbit, then you can easily also get into the high space regime. That is because you don\u0027t actually need to be in orbit for that, you just need to be significantly further away from the planet. More than 250 kilometers away, to be precise. Any orbit capable rocket can easily take you there with fuel to spare if you just launch straight up and fall back down in a classic suborbital hop. And you can do everything in high space that you could in low space - EVA reports, crew reports, thermometer, mystery goo, science jr., the entire works.\n\nWhile there are many biomes on Kerbin with small amounts of science, a single short hop into high space can give you a huge amount of science if you can return everything safely to the surface. (Which is harder than on a 70km suborbital hop but by no means impossible. Just don\u0027t go too far beyond 250 - just enough to do your science. If your rocket has fuel to spare, you can instead try to use it to slow your fall on the way down.)\n\nP.S.: Welcome to the forums! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T14:27:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the responses.

After upgrading the R\u0026D facility to lvl2 you can also take surface samples.\n\nNo, you can attach thermometer (and any other instrument) to wherever you like, no specific requirements exist.\n\nThe science returns of the experiments depend only on biome you are currently within. Apart from the surface biomes (see [http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Biome](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Biome)) distinct experiments can be made \u0027over\u0027 them (flying low, flying high, in space low, in space high).
