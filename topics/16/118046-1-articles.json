And I really don\u0027t want to forget anything.\n\nThere are the living quarters. There\u0027s a science lab and basic scientific experiments. A range of docking ports in all sizes. Antennas. A probe core. Some xenon for visityng ion crafts. There\u0027s the whole refinery size: ore tanks, fuel tanks, drills, ISRUs. There\u0027s a separate tower with a bunch of gigantors, kept away from landing ships.\n\nDo you have a checklist of what a good orbital base should have? Or maybe thoughts about things often forgotten?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T18:04:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Zais","CreatedById":149366,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T16:34:18Z","Content":"For me, this is all I need in a base."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T16:36:26Z","Content":"Sharpy,\n\n I like to keep a couple \u0022hands\u0022 around.

A Jr on one end, and a regular one on the other, with the small grey adapter between. Same with a Sr to a regular docking port. That way, you can mix and match in any way you want with docking ports and you never end up with the problem where you want to dock 2 things together and don\u0027t have a port of the correct type.\n\nI tend to ignore anything extraneous though. Once you\u0027ve emptied the asteroid of ore, I\u0027d send the drills, isru converter, and now empty ore tanks away, perhaps to a new asteroid or just deorbit them. I\u0027d also lose all the solar panels. Part count and frailty are your enemies when refueling behemoths."},{"CreatedByName":"jackboy900","CreatedById":113949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T12:14:54Z","Content":"Maybe phase out the drills for a small drilling craft you can send to the mun/minmus for harvesting?"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T16:52:52Z","Content":"I just have normal docking ports and a senior.
