Despite its low fuel capacity for its weight, this particular intake is really well-suited for the role of a secondary intake that gets you where you need to be for your primary intakes to do their job, kinda like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E to the high-speed intakes\u0027 nuke/ion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, I recently discovered that if you aren\u0027t trying to go hypersonic/suborbital\u00A0and are simply trying to reduce drag, low-drag inline intakes (I only tested the Engine Nacelle but the\u00A0Engine Pre-cooler should work too) with a nosecone are your best bet. You may not get as much high-speed mileage out of them as from a Shock Cone, true, but the major drag reduction from having a nosecone instead of a front intake more than offsets the added weight of having to include another intake to keep the engines fed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
