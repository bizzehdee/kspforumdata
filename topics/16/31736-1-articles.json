Am I clipping which is stopping KSP from connecting the mounting points together or is this a limitation of KSP which prevents parts from simultaneously connecting to multiple places?

Docking ports are the key here.

Each part can have multiple parts attached to it (Children or branches), but it can ever only have one parent (Don\u0027t ask how Nodes reproduce, just don\u0027t) So when you\u0027re trying to build a box or something you can start on one side, attaching child after child all the way around, but you can\u0027t have the last great great great grandchild part become it\u0027s own great great great great grandparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m crossing fingers that it will change one day...making all the multi-node hubs far more utilitarian.
