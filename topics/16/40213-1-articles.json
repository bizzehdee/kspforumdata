The orange path has no bearing on your current trajectory (the blue line) though, and that\u0027s the one you want to change for your Mun landing. Once you get orbit, the orange lines should disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gus","CreatedById":68154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T06:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you do nothing as you fly past the Mun, you will eventually end up on the orange path/orbit. Although the blue and orange paths don\u0027t meet now, as time passes, the moon will drag your blue trajectory along with it to the right. Just as you reach the end of the blue line, you will also be on the orange line and will proceed along it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T08:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do to get rid of the yellow trajectory (and land on the Mun) is to burn retrograde at the periapse of your current Mun orbit. This will cause your current orbit to elongate and eventually form a normal oval as your speed drops.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
