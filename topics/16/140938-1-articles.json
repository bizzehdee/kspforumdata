Many of them are hard/tricky to find. Have you found the flagpole biome, and extracted all the science from it? Do you understand that upgrading some KSC buildings gets you more biomes to take data from? Do you understand that the VAB South Complex biome appears and then goes away? Do you understand that all nine natural biomes can be accessed both from land and while you are \u0022splashed\u0022, and the science points you get from that are all completely independent -- so in some sense there are 18 of them? Have you gotten the science from the mountain biome when you are splashed? Do you know where the Badlands are? Do you understand the trick for getting \u0022EVA in flight over biome X\u0022 science points?

With 32 tons in orbit, you could push like six fully featured landers to the Mun at the same time! Of course, the rocket as shown is a bit contrived because it requires a tier 2 VAB and a tier 3 launchpad due to its sheer size and mass, and by the time you can pay for those upgrades, you will definitely have more than 70 science... but it is still an example of what you can do with a very limited selection of parts.
