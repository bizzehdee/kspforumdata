Sure the RAPIER doesn\u0027t have the ISP of the Aerospike but it is simpler to use, and is far more forgiving. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have built a LOT of SSTOs, some with turbojets, aerospikes, LV-45T, SABREs, and RAPIERs. If it is in the B9, KSPX, or KSP engines I have probably tried to build a SSTO with it. I use SABREs most of the time due to parts count and looks it looks better. I will probably use the RAPIER the same way, mainly because it looks better, and parts count.

It only weighs in at 15.5t, and the way the fuel drains it stays fairly well balanced. There is no right way for someone to play this game, if you feel that way you might have other issues other than an item in game.

Mostly what it comes down to is how you fly it really, it might not be working for just due to how you like to fly and that is fine. Just like with me I fly a certain way that I think is right.
