Ok, that\u0027s fine. I often used to have one of each on my ships pre 0.21 because they each had a slightly different function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre the functions of those two parts exactly the same now? According to their stats descriptions in game in the VAB/SPH, they are both EXACTLY the same EXCEPT in terms of dry weight, where the \u003Cstrong\u003EInline Advanced Stabilizer\u003C/strong\u003E is 0.2 tonnes heavier than the \u003Cstrong\u003EInline Reaction Wheel\u003C/strong\u003E......but if they both do the exact same thing now, why do we need BOTH of them in the game still....?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could understand them both staying because they each use a different part model and it provides players with choice on the looks for their ships, but as they are both 1.25m parts that seemingly provide the exact same function now, shouldn\u0027t they have the same weight then? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI COULD also understand the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced SAS Module - Large\u003C/strong\u003E weighing more as it\u0027s a larger part...however...why the heck does it weigh 0.2 tonnes when the smaller 1.25m \u003Cstrong\u003EInline Reaction Wheel\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EInline Advanced Stabilizer\u003C/strong\u003E weigh 0.3 tonnes and 0.5 tonnes respectively...? I notice the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced SAS Module - Large\u003C/strong\u003E description and name hasn\u0027t changed at all with this update even though \u0022SAS\u0022 parts don\u0027t control \u0022SAS\u0022 anymore, so basically isn\u0027t it just an \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EInline Advanced Stabilizer - Large\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 now...? And if that is the case, why do its stats in the VAB/SPH say it has the exact same amount of torque/electricity requirements as the 1.25m parts when it\u0027s larger...? Shouldn\u0027t it have more torque/require more electricity...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope at least some of you were able to understand my confusion above! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T11:46:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 11:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by darkstrike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T11:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved this in the gameplay questions forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to address your question, yes, both parts serve exactly the same purporse, the only difference, is that the old SAS module is now only a reaction wheel, while the old ASAS modules are both reaction wheels and also give your craft the ability to use the new SAS module. That last feature is a tad bit redundant since all command pods and probe cores already have that system included, but in the case you would use a seat, those don\u0027t and you can add it with those parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkstrike","CreatedById":60004,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T12:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, thanks stupid_chris!
