While still in the atmosphere you\u0027ll want some more of that TWR so you can get out of it quicker... Ofc during the initial ascent (before the gravity turn) you must maintain \u0026gt;1 TWR to keep accelerating so you can get out of the gravity well at all, after your gravity turn and having reached an apoapsis above the atmosphere it\u0027s possible to circularize with a lower TWR. I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s all there is to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lheim","CreatedById":62665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T06:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust for shizzes I decided to see what would happen if I launched my interplanetary nuclear tug stage - TWR .31, with itself as the final boost stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy skipper engines were staged aside at about well inside the atmosphere - maybe about 37 klicks up, with my AP at about 60 klicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to throttle up nearly to overheating and point near vertical, but my time-to-apoapsis was still slowly ticking down. Finally it seemed to turn a corner and the time to my apoapsis stopped decreasing.. and started increasing, slowly. I nudged the nuke more horizontal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, it was a harrowing approximate 5 minutes and I ended 146 kilometers up once I had achieved an orbit that wouldn\u0027t dip into the atmosphere. It felt horribly inefficient. If you\u0027re going to go that route I suggest trying to get your AP as high as possible before you start relying on such a low-twr stage in atmosphere.

This makes manoeuvre planning much, much easier, and often more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a very low TWR, then you will usually *not* be able to complete transfer burns in one go, you will need to do multiple burns at periapsis. This retains the efficiency, but means your predicted intercept will be less accurate, which means you will need to do more burns to line things up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, having said all that, it\u0027s quite common to have a very low TWR on interplanetary craft, because the efficiency gained by using nuclear engines easily outweighs the low TWR provided.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deepspacecreeper","CreatedById":84329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T00:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eam i burning radially out or prograde after starting gravity turn?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T00:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDesign your orbital vehicle with enough power to get your apoapsis over 100 k and about 1,500m/sec orbital speed before those engines are staged. Your smaller one will then have sufficient power to get to orbital speed using the momentum from the initial launch to reach the apoapsis. This is the idea behind this small probe launcher which can also place the same probe into Mun or Minmus orbit. That will work with any design that has insufficient power to lift off from Kerban by itself. Even monopropellant thrusters will work as long as you have enough burn time to get to orbiting speed as you reach apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TD8RZk9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TD8RZk9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T00:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deepspacecreeper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deepspacecreeper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eam i burning radially out or prograde after starting gravity turn?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s more radially out than prograde, but you\u0027re doing a bit of both, actually.

Many of the things you can do to increase one in a design will end up decreasing the other, by virtue of the fact that you\u0027re altering the craft\u0027s mass ratio with every part you add or remove.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T18:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit.
