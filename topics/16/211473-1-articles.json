Still new, but cannot complete this stupid mission and I don\u0027t understand why! It says to test the decouplers at launch site, but even though my \u0022Kerbin, Launch Site\u0022 notes are all green, only testing needed to complete. But when I stage the decoupler, it goes flying but it doesn\u0027t complete the mission. I tried using a scientist instead, right clicking on the decoupler instead of staging with spacebar, and there\u0027s no option to \u0022TEST\u0022 anywhere. what DO I DO!!!

Maybe you just mistyped \u0022TT-38\u0022 but the stock radial decoupler is \u0022TT-38\u003Cstrong\u003EK\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022.\u00A0 If you installed mods maybe you have some similarly named parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorst case, you can give up and cheat the contract complete. Open the debug window (alt-f12), click to active contracts on the left side, then click the button to complete the desired contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clayel","CreatedById":223206,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-13T21:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake sure you have a probe or capsule on the craft so you can control it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
