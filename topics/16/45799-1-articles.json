Here is my pathetic attempt at a space station. I finally got to of the big Rockomax tanks bolted to it and have gotten my first space plane up there as well. The space plane is not my design I came upon it on youtube and duplicated it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now experiencing lag so here is a question I have seen asked before on another forum when I first tried to search for it. How do I know what frames per second I have? The only advice I have seen given is to download some software, I think it was called FRAMS or something. My frames per second are obviously bad as the game is almost impossible to play now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the weird question. I have noticed people talking about how many parts they have on their stations and that it\u0027s all the parts that are making the lag problem. I have been controlling a lot of my launches remotely and staging off the propulsion part (or most of it in the case of the two big orange rockomaxes) and deorbiting them into the planet and saving after that. I like clean space but don\u0027t care about polluting the planet, so sue me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo the parts on the ground from crashed ships add to the lag problem. If so I may be kinda screwed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/c10YkDh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c10YkDh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c10YkDh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Tramalot","CreatedById":62713,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T10:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think so, if they have not been destroyed, but I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Henno","CreatedById":80664,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T10:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that pic looks crap for a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I have done to try and stop lag was change some rendering settings in the settings.cfg file at the advice of this clip \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/_gqKiPo_3RE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/_gqKiPo_3RE\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guy that posted it was running v18.something and I\u0027m running the latest version so my config file didn\u0027t look like his and my Graphics page under settings is a bit different as well but I have turned most of it way down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T11:14:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, stuff on the ground does not contribute to lag. In stock KSP everything that moves further than around 2.5 km from the ship you are controlling gets unloaded and put on rails. The Lazor mod lets you increase that range and that can cause a lot of lag tho...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T12:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can go to the Control Center and check to see how much debre has been left in orbit.

You haven\u0027t provided this information, so nobody can really tell whether or not a station like that should be lagging your game or not. I imagine the lights you have on the station are not helping; lights are bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Knowing your FPS rate does not help increase it.

Debris out of physics range will only contribute to decreased performance if you have a ridiculous amount of it (i.e. Kerbin has Saturn-like rings). Even then, only objects within 2.5km really have any impact on performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- F2 to hide HUD, F1 to take a screenshot.

I also have lag issues somewhat, but, I try things in and out of the game to help the situation. I run an outside game booster program that starts up when I launch KSP, with specific settings to shut off unnecessary background apps and services. The program finds those by scanning what\u0027s running and what\u0027s needed. Once it does that first time, it keeps the shut down settings active anytime I start KSP again. I use one from Razer, download free on their web site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also done things like clearing my DNS cache once a week or so to help KSP / Steam combo run smoother, helps somewhat. Inside KSP, bout all I can do is keep things minimized, dropping stages, leaving lighting in general to built in illumination except maybe a single light to help at a docking port, Only adding a single item (Like sensors) if I really want it on there, that sort of thing. It\u0027s going to happen, I just build things and plan, knowing that, to keep it simplistic and still get the job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Kerbinverse...I have received more help right here than anywhere else when I haven\u0027t taken the time to go through some of the excellent tutorials...I have in some cases done that too, but, the genuine help here is invaluable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I don\u0027t see anything wrong with the pic...I\u0027m sure there are experts everywhere though and you can\u0027t make \u0027em all happy all the time...back to topic now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T15:47:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpace stations lag alot.
