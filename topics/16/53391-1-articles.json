Having said that, it\u0027d be pretty complicated due to the fact that the file keeps track of every part of the ship, along with all of it\u0027s co-ordinates and data about where and how it is connected to other parts. In short, it\u0027s a lot of data to sort through. If you choose to do this, I\u0027d advise backing the persistent file up somewhere in case you accidentally break something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027ve heard of, and what I\u0027d recommend looking into before trying to edit the persistent file, is something called Hyperedit. I\u0027ve never used it and so I\u0027m not sure on it\u0027s scope, but it\u0027s probably worth looking into. Hopefully someone who has used it sees this and can better explain what it does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User Unrelated","CreatedById":74021,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T06:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if I could edit the saved ship to what I want (just the station part), toss it on the launch pad, save\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then edit the persistent file, and just copy the new ship over the old ship?...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr would the persistent file contain one conglomeration of data for the whole docked bunch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, definitely would back everything up twice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T06:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHyperedit let\u0027s you instantly change a ship\u0027s position.

As always, Save the persistent file as backup. If it errors, mess up you can paste it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have done this a few times. It is easiest in space but even works for minor changes on landed vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Set up your vessel on the launch pad/ground exactly how you want it to be in new location with a different vessel name. Note that docked vessels count as part. Easist thing to do is undock and move them just slightly away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Save and leave game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Find the original orbiting vessel in your persistent file. Copy the location/rotation/velocity portion and any crew over to the new vessel. I cannot remember header name top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rename replacement to original\u0027s name and delete the original vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Reload and cross your fingers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I personally do when I make something really dumb for an error on a complex mission.

Back up your sfs file. If you make even a tiny mistake it can corrupt the entire save.

Keep the original location and orbit information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a third option that is probably easier than either of these. Relaunch with your new model.
