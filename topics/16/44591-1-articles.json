After doing it for all the lights you want, save and launch. Now the number of the group you added them will do these actions when pressed(the number keys on top of your keyboard, not the numpad, 0 means 10th group). Sometimes you need to hold that key for a moment if your craft is so big everything lags. But for lights, you can simply use \u0022U\u0022 or the yellowish button next to your altimeter to toggle all the lights at once, they get automatically assigned to this group during construction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kodemunkey","CreatedById":41146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T12:25:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, didn\u0027t know about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T13:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso you may find it useful if you develop a \u0027standard\u0027 for your group action keys.
