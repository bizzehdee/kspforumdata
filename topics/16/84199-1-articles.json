I guess most folks don\u0027t notice it because when they\u0027re rotating their ships, they\u0027re looking at the navball markers instead of their trajectory on the map. To see it in action, mouse over or click on your Ap or Pe so you can see its altitude, then rotate your ship and watch the numbers change. It\u0027s especially noticeable if your future path crosses and SOI boundary, in which case watch what happens to your Pe in the new SOI in conics mode 0. And it also affects any nodes you have set out in the future: the delta-v required, the position of the blue marker on the navball, and the resulting future trajectory after the burn, presumably because the node is on your future path already, and that path is changing due to the ship\u0027s rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it seems to happen whether the ship is on rails or not, and whether you\u0027re warping or not. Naturally you see it most when the ship isn\u0027t on rails and you\u0027re maneuvering, but it appears that on-rails ships suffer from trajectory drift more significant that the expected long-term accumulation of rounding errors. Such as in the OP\u0027s case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe effect isn\u0027t crippling, especially for short trips to Mun and Minmus, but it becomes rather bothersome for interplanetary and asteroid-catching missions. Still, the bottom line is that you just need a little extra delta-V for more correction burns than you used to need. The most damaging part is the impact on Remote Tech. There, you require high precision in the placement of satellites, and then rely on them staying where you put them. Sure, you expect to have to tweak them periodically because total perfection is impossible and rounding errors do occur, but you also expect not to have to do this very often or do relatively large corrections. I mean, they\u0027re not crossing SOI boundaries and aren\u0027t in really huge orbits, so you\u0027d expect them to be pretty well-behaved. The problem with the maneuver system, however, makes precision very hard to obtain, impossible to keep, and the resulting corrections are both frequent and large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to asteroids.... It appears that any wobble in the ship counts as rotation as far as the bug is concerned. I suspect this is because the wobble makes the ship\u0027s CoM move relative to whatever physical part of the ship is the reference point for its position in space. Moving the CoM results in moving the whole ship, as shown by the classic example of \u0022thrusting\u0022 a rotating ship by pumping fuel back and forth between its ends. And asteroid tugs are extremely wobbly due to the huge mass on at least 1 side (and usually both) of what is just a 1.25m docking port, even if you add struts somehow. So the problem is usually very manifest when maneuvering one, and the residual wobble after orienting the tug can throw the future trajectory way off while you\u0027re not looking, before you change focus away from it. You\u0027d think the wobble would go away when you leave the tug on rails, and maybe it does, but it\u0027s still going to rotate relative to its direction of motion, which also seems to count as far as the bug is concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T17:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm. I notice this a lot but chalked it up to the inherent lack of precision in determining long course trajectories in space flight. Another thought in reference to this : as a craft is translated about its\u0027 center of mass, whichever probe/port the craft is being controlled from ( probably the furthest one from the COM ) has a slightly different trajectory at different times during the maneuver as the craft yaws and pitches, add in wobble ( and SAS anti-wobble correction ) and I can see how these projected trajectories can change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maximillian","CreatedById":114230,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T17:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve marked this Answered.
