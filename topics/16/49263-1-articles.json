Carrying the weight of most of your launch vehicle into space is going to use up most of your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage needs to get you off the ground and moving. Because it has to lift everything else it\u0027s going to need a lot of power and so it will weigh a lot by itself. You\u0027ll want to get rid of this stage pretty quickly to lighten things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that this \u0027launch\u0027 stage should get you to between 3000-5000m altitude and moving at 150-200m/s. Solid boosters are a good choice unless you are experienced with fuel lines and drop tanks. Your third screenshot, Munar I, looks like it has a good solid booster stage (probably more power then you need, but if it\u0027s the first thing you get rid of that\u0027s not a problem unless your ship goes out of control).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage and third stage are two parts of the same thing. I suggest 5 strong liquid engines (LV-T45 are very good for keeping stability) to maintain the thrust/weight ratio needed to keep gaining speed in the low atmosphere. I would set it up so that you can drop the 4 outer engines as you reach higher altitudes (the center engine becomes the third stage), make sure the middle engine has more then twice the fuel if you are running without fuel lines. If you have access to fuel lines I would run a line from each of the outer engine tanks to the center engine\u0027s tank, and instead give the outer engines about 25-50% more fuel then the center, since the center engine will be able to draw from those outer tanks first. With fuel lines used you might setup the center engine with a T800 fuel tank, and each of the outer engines with a T800 and a T400. Drop the outer engines when their fuel supply is used up, which reduces the weight you need to carry substantially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the 3rd stage single engine has burned all its fuel you should be close to the edge of the atmosphere (with an AP above it) and within reach of a stable orbit. The 4th stage should be a high efficiency orbital engine (LV-909) with a fuel tank like the T800, maybe a bit more if you didn\u0027t have fuel lines used in the previous stage. This orbital stage should stabilize your Kerbin orbit and then be enough to send you to the Mun and circulize your orbit there. Use any fuel left to assist your descent burn with the final stage, your lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall my suggestion is that if you feel you are running out of fuel, add more fuel to the earlier stages, not the later ones. If you are not gaining speed in the atmosphere you need more engines (watch your m/s speed, if it starts to go down for part of the burn instead of up it means you don\u0027t have enough thrust and are wasting fuel), but try to shed as many engines as soon as you can, they weigh a lot and need extra fuel just to keep them along.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T16:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe above thread has good advice about multiple staging but careful staging vertical or you\u0027ll get wobbly fast, go horizontal.

Let\u0027s assume we have a rocket composed of 5 engines and 5 fuel tanks - one engine\u002Btank is in the center, the 4 others are attached to the sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0027flat\u0027 staging (I don\u0027t know if there is a proper term for this) you would burn all 5 engines and then they would all be released at once, letting the whatever stage is above them start. This kind of staging means you need to carry new engines for each stage, and until that stage is reached the engine is dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0027Onion\u0027 staging the 4 outer engines are dropped first. To accomplish this there are fuel lines leading from the outer fuel tanks to the inner ones. This means that the 5 rockets are initially using fuel from the 4 outer tanks only. The inner tank remains full. When the outer tanks are empty they and the outer engines are dropped and the inner engines continues on with the full center fuel tank. You can also make a poor man\u0027s version of onion staging by just giving the center rocket a bigger fuel tank if you don\u0027t have fuel lines yet. In this type of staging we effectively reuse the center engine for 2 stages, saving weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn \u0027Asparagus\u0027 staging the fuel lines are more complex. Assume that the 4 outer tanks are labeled \u0027left\u0027 and \u0027right\u0027, \u0027forward\u0027 and \u0027rear\u0027. The left tank has a fuel line leading to the forward tank, and the right tank has a fuel line leading to the rear tank. The forward and rear tanks then have fuel lines leading to the center tank. When it takes off all 5 engines will be drawing fuel from the left and right tanks. When those tanks are empty they and the left/right engine are dropped and the ship begins using the fuel in the forward/rear tanks. When those are empty they are dropped too and we have with the center engine and the full center tank. This kind of staging is obviously more complex - bigger asparagus rockets can have dozens of seperately released tanks and a maze of fuel lines to contend with. The complex draining and dropping of tanks also leads to potential balance issues - if the tanks are not all placed at the same height, or don\u0027t drain uniformly the rocket\u0027s center of mass can shift, which means the rockets are now pushing it up and into a turn at the same time, causing it to spin rapidly or flip over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T22:09:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP, I misread your post that indicated your current tech level - sorry about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s one more option: try to get your payload up in one go, without staging. This is a kind of booster I specialize in for light payloads like what you have here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so two goo containers, a science junior and a Command Pod for a munar flyby. 4550 to orbit and 860 for an intercept with a free return. I\u0027ll give a little extra in case you need to maneuver - say another 25%, so 1075. 5,625 m/s of delta-V is all you need. 1.15 tonnes just for the stuff you want to bring. Let\u0027s then go with twelve batteries (.06) and two radial chutes (.3). So that\u0027s 1.51 tonnes of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the transfer stage - you\u0027re light enough that a 909 will do the trick easy (.5), and you need a stack decoupler of course (.05). 2.06 tonnes deadweight, and a 909 has an Isp of 390 in space, so all you need is an FL-T200; that will give you 1,441 m/s of delta-V, more than what you need to get to the Mun and back. Hell...that 1075 figure already included a buffer; this gives you almost twice what you need. So consider trying it with an FL-T100 if you think you can get away with it; you\u0027ll save some weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, scratch that - half a tonne isn\u0027t that big of a deal with such a small rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat leaves the booster, which is doable with the parts you have available. Your payload and transfer stages are 3.185 tonnes combined - so you\u0027ll want a centerstack with four outboard stacks; LV-T30s outboard and an LV-T45 in the center (the -45 gives you steering authority). That\u0027s 1060 kN of thrust total, sufficient for your needs. 6.5 tonnes of engines plus another stack decoupler (.05) and your deadweight is up to 9.735 tonnes. Ground Isp of your engines is 320. So you need a little over twelve tonnes of fuel in each stack. Two FL-T800s, one FL-T400 and one FL-T200 in each stack should do the trick. Your total mass is 71.61 tonnes; launch TWR is 1.51. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m glossing over all the math here; I apologize and \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E elaborate more on the process if anyone is curious).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got struts, so use them. String the centerpoints of each of the outboard fuel tanks to the next adjacent stack, and then add one going to the center stack. Attach an additional strut from the top of the outboard stacks to the FL-T200 in the transfer stage. That should be all the strutting you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an SSTO booster, so you have to follow some guidelines for the flight - first, you start at full throttle but you cannot leave it there; watch the gee meter as you go and throttle back a little if you climb out of the green zone; towards the end of the ascent, you may only be burning at 1/3 throttle or so, which is totally normal. Straight up to 10,000 m, 090 at 45 degrees to about 25,000, then follow the navball. Burn along the horizon after 50,000 until you\u0027ve got your apoapsis where you want it (usually at 100,000 m). Stop burning, plan an orbital insertion burn once your ship\u0027s altitude is over 70,000, and burn at about 1/3 thrust (it\u0027ll take three times as long to complete as the node will indicate). Once your periapsis is over 70,000, you\u0027re in orbit. After you\u0027ve circularized, cut loose the booster and activate the transfer stage engine. Burn for the Mun when ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I\u0027ve given you enough juice to make it there and back without problems; follow the type of flight path that SRV Ron was kind enough to provide a screenshot for earlier in this thread - in particular you want to watch the altitude of your Kerbin periapsis on the return - you want that to be 30,000 or so. Make the burn and shut off your reaction wheels in the pod, no SAS either. You should have enough juice then to make the flight. Do your science in Mun\u0027s SOI, drop the transfer stage before opening the chutes when you get back, and you should be golden. I\u0027ve designed this with more delta-V than it needs, so if it turns out there isn\u0027t enough electrical power, add another quad of batteries. The extra mass won\u0027t shave that much off your stage delta-Vs, and 1600 should be more than enough for just a Munar flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get OX-STATs, ditch all but four of the batteries and add four OX-STAT panels; this design will still work and you could even consider sticking around in orbit for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T14:26:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 02:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T00:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, my Orbiter Jeb not only makes it easily to Mun and back, it was placed into 25K Mun orbit and returned to an aerobraking landing with fuel to spare.

It was originally designed in 0.19 so it\u0027s in need of an update at this point, but I bet the same design principles apply.
