If you look at the porkchop plot (the colorful chart at the bottom), you\u0027ll see that there are clear vertical strips of color, red morphing into blue morphing into red, back and forth. The X axis of that chart is the departure date; the Y axis is the travel time. Mousing over the chart will show you a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost for that specific combination of departure date and travel time. You can also click the chart to get directions for executing that particular transfer, but the calculator will have the best one pre-selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thick, even vertical bands, and the huge differences in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E costs between red and blue areas, show a \u003Cem\u003Estrong\u003C/em\u003E dependance on transfer windows. If you pick a departure date (X axis) within a red area, then no matter where you move the mouse on the Y axis, it\u0027ll always be in a red area, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E costs are always going to be high. Leaving at that date is a bad idea. You have to wait for the right time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you took that transfer and arrived on year 6, day 161, the most convenient window back would then be on year 6, day 365, expending some 2930 m/s. You can compute that transfer by swapping origin and destination, and adjusting the earliest possible departure time to the time of your arrival from the first transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look at the plot of that calculation, however, you\u0027ll see a completely different picture: the colored bands are not nice and thick and vertical, they\u0027re extremely slanted and pretty thin. The difference in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E costs between red and blue areas still exists, but it\u0027s much smaller than it was with the Kerbin-\u0026gt;Jool trip. This shows a \u003Cem\u003Eweak\u003C/em\u003E dependance on transfer windows. Each point on the X axis is going to have at least one blue band \u003Cem\u003Esomewhere\u003C/em\u003E, possibly even multiple ones. Meaning no matter when you want to leave, there\u0027s a cheap transfer you can find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the same applies to the red bands. Each point on the X axis is going to have at least one red band somewhere, possibly multiple ones. Meaning no matter when you want to leave, there\u0027s room for finding a terrible transfer that has you paying way more than you should. And though the differences between the best and worst transfers are not as bad as they could be, they might well be enough to make or break a mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re sitting ingame without any such handy tools available, just pulling the handles of a maneuver node until you get an encounter, then it\u0027s quite possible to accidentally find a pretty bad one. An experienced player might be able to tell that they\u0027re being overcharged, and will continue looking for a different route, but someone on their first trip to Jool wouldn\u0027t know any better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-30T11:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224192845\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221667084961\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miklkit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, miklkit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull disclosure.\u00A0 The spaceplane took off and went to Minmus, refueled, took off and got into a solar orbit, then went to Jool for a cost of 2800m/s.\u00A0 It had plenty of fuel left as it didn\u0027t take much to get to Bop after arrival.\u00A0 It then refueled on Bop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took off from Bop, circled around and burned for a solar orbit and just sat there.\u00A0 Once it eventually did reach a solar orbit it then set course for Kerbin but didn\u0027t have much fuel left.\u00A0 I hope this doesn\u0027t happen again as it was nerve wracking\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nah, that\u0027s it. you are not making use of oberth effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOberth effect means that making a prograde burn close to a planet is cheaper. making such a burn in solar orbit is a lot more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou spent 2800 m/s to go from kerbin orbit to jool in solar orbit. that\u0027s already a lot more than it should be. from low kerbin orbit, you can spend 2000 m/s and reach jool. it\u0027s much cheaper, even though you have to spend 900 m/s just to get out of kerbin\u0027s gravity. from minmus you are already almost out of it, and you can spend less than 1300 m/s; the best way is from minmus to fall down on kerbin and make the ejection burn close to it, as shown in this picture\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y859eQc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/Y859eQc.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n160 m/s to go from minmus to low kerbin orbit, then it\u0027s only 1150 m/s to jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand the same applies to jool, except you are potentially losing eve more there.

As for how to make the maneuver, I suggest a simple way that\u0027s relatively accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, go to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealexmoon.github.io/ksp\u003C/a\u003E. it\u0027s a very useful tool. So you want to go from kerbin to jool, tell the tool just that. In this case, it will tell you that the best time to start is in year 2:258, but you get a good transfer window also around 1:200. This will let you know the transfer windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you scroll down, there are a bunch of additional informations. most of them I myself don\u0027t know how to use, because they don\u0027t have an easy ksp reference. but one you can use, the ejection deltaV. In this case it says 1987 m/s, so you know you should spend some 2 km/s to get there. you\u0027ll likely spend a bit more because you\u0027re not perfect, but try to stay within 10% of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now it\u0027s the transfer window, time to plan your maneuver. take your ship in kerbin orbit, and plot a prograde maneuver for 2 km/s. Any direction is good, you\u0027ll fix it later. So now your planned trajectory will exit kerbin and go in solar orbit, where it will produce an apoapsis (or periapsis if you\u0027re leaving on the wrong side. Highlight the apoapsis. You want to push apoapsis up as high as possible. So move your maneuver around kerbin\u0027s orbit, you\u0027ll see apoapsis increase, until you hit some point where you get maximum apoapsis and then it decreases. you found the optimal position for your ejection burn. Since this is the transfer window, chances are by now you\u0027ll also be seeing a close approach, because this is jool. now you can make small corrections to turn that into an encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor other, smaller planets you\u0027re unlikely to yet be seeing a close approach. In this case I suggest you also plot a second maneuver, on the planar nodes- they are marked as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ascending Node\u0022\u003EAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Descending Node\u0022\u003EDN\u003C/abbr\u003E, ascending or descending node, meaning that your ship is passing through the plane of the target orbit going up or down. if you maneuver on the descending node, make a burn upward (purple triangle). if you maneuvr on the ascending node, make a burn downward (purple triangle with lines coming out of it). once you match the target inclination, you\u0027ll see a close approach. again, you\u0027ll need small corrections, but they will be

of 2800m/s.\u00A0 It had plenty of fuel left as it didn\u0027t take much to get to Bop after arrival.\u00A0 It then refueled on Bop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took off from Bop, circled around and burned for a solar orbit and just sat there.\u00A0 Once it eventually did reach a solar orbit it then set course for Kerbin but didn\u0027t have much fuel left.\u00A0 I hope this doesn\u0027t happen again as it was nerve wracking\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027ll do it.\u00A0 In both cases, being already out at a distant moon, it\u0027s tempting to think that since you\u0027re already\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eclose\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to solar orbit, you ought to go the rest of the way there and uncomplicate the manoeuvre.\u00A0 Maybe that\u0027s not your reasoning, specifically, but either way, it doesn\u0027t work very well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the main reason why this wastes propellant and delta-V:\u00A0 once you get to solar orbit, as in the instant you leave the local sphere of influence (whether Kerbin or Jool), your vessel still has an orbit that looks a lot like that of the planet that you just left.\u00A0 Burning for solar orbit does change it just enough that you become separate entities, but only barely just enough.\u00A0 In other words, with the way that you\u0027re doing it, most of the burn for solar orbit is wasted propellant because once you\u0027re done, you\u0027re effectively only marginally different from where you started.\u00A0 One may imagine launching a rocket by burning until the engines are absolutely spent ... and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0releasing the launch clamps.\u00A0 That\u0027s not a perfect analogy, but it\u0027s illustrative of the idea:\u00A0 you move, but the way that you\u0027re using the propellant isn\u0027t helping you much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how you run your Minmus missions, so this is an honest enquiry:\u00A0 when you do a mission to and from Minmus, do you return to Kerbin by burning to break Minmus orbit into Kerbin orbit, and only then burn to drop your periapsis and actually get to Kerbin?\u00A0 Or do you arrange the Minmus return by burning such that your Minmus escape also happens to throw you back along Minmus\u0027s own retrograde so that you both break Minmus orbit and return to Kerbin with one burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do the latter, then that (or something similar) is what you need to do, albeit on a larger scale, for interplanetary transfers.\u00A0 The reason is backed up with a lot of mathematics, but the short version is that there is a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of energy bound up in a high orbit of a planet, whether or not you happen to also orbit a moon.\u00A0 This is because high orbits have a lot of potential energy, which is actually a circular definition because these orbits get potential energy by virtue of being high:\u00A0 in an important way, potential energy refers to how far something has to fall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that when you burn to break from high orbit without first using that potential energy in some way, then it ends up literally being wasted potential.\u00A0 The thing to do is to burn to dive for a low pass of Kerbin, and when you\u0027re at that periapsis, \u003Ci\u003Ethat\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0is where you complete your burn for Jool.\u00A0 The reverse applies for returning to Kerbin from Jool.\u00A0 There\u0027s a lot that goes into the timing for a burn like that, and I won\u0027t get into it because \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

this is that high orbits have a lot of potential energy, and that you can save yourself a lot of propellant if you make the effort to realise that potential by first diving into the lower planetary system from these high-orbiting moons.\u00A0 If potential energy is a measure of how far your rocket has to fall, then actually falling essentially converts that potential into energy of motion--and energy of motion is what gets your rocket to new and interesting

lot of what it does is done merely using automatic control of features that are already accessible to the player.\u00A0 What I mean is that MechJeb shouldn\u0027t be randomly changing your target, but

MechJeb windows open under other menus while you do other things.\u00A0 One thing that a lot of mods in KSP do not have is click-through opacity (assuming that that is even the correct term), meaning that if you have menus open and overlaid on one another, then clicking on one also registers as clicking on any menu underneath that one, because the mods only register the cursor\u0027s screen position, not the menu \u0027depth\u0027 under the \u0027surface\u0027 of the screen, to coin an analogy.\u00A0 Is it possible that your MechJeb manoeuvre planner is under, say, the resource panel or a part action window that you\u0027re using on your rocket?\u00A0 If so, then you may be accidentally telling MechJeb to plan a manoeuvre and burn for Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king
