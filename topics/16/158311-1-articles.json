It doesn\u0027t sound stock behavior. The closest mod behavior I know\u00A0is from KSP interstellar, where you\u0027ll have to add a precooler after your intake to not overheat the engine. But that limit is way beyond supersonic - e.g. rapier is ~1350m/s. Without interstellar, or with interstellar but precooler properly mounted, should be totally ok to reach 1.4~1.5km/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultraroblox","CreatedById":152136,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T23:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds about right, I have Interstellar Extended and that happens usually with rapiers. Its really a pain with SSTOs, but this time I\u0027m only going 900 m/s and my ram jet starts to overheat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
