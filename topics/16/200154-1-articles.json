There\u0027s probably something very draggy up front, and when you depart a bit from prograde, it turns into a massive lever arm and flips the plane over. The stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator doesn\u0027t show this, which is why I use CorrectCoL (link in my sig).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) You\u0027ve got \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E turned on to stabilize the plane, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
