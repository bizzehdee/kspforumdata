Again...... and AGAIN until there is nothing left but debris, even if you somehow were to survive that ordeal, you would not know exactly where it happened to report it so that it can be charted so others don\u0027t become as unfortunate as you were......... so even TODAY on the sea there is still much unknown dangers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus with current tech..... 20%ish of light speed can be safely traveled into unknown space, once a safe course has been established, much faster speeds can be reached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith current warp tech you can almost instantly reach your cruising speed and slow down, as the warp tech produces a falling effect to propel the ship / pulling the ship and all its contents at the same rate thus no SPLAT against the wall when speeding up or slowing down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship will take about 30 years to reach Alfa Centari, time passage onboard the ship will depend upon configuration of the warp procedure but.......... the warp ring on it\u0027s most outer edge will have a time passage of 100\u0027s of thousands of years, thus it must be constructed using the highest quality materials and engineering techniques to actually last that long without failure or atomic decay, and would have to be inspected, rebuilt and/or replaced once every trip........ until technology in the future allows otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMolten Salt Reactors can be used to power the warp technology using an epoxy type heat generating fuel such as Plutonium or Ameriecium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the passage of time onboard the ship will only be a few months, there is no need for cryogenic or hypersleep will be needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game and/or mod can support or come close to supporting this, please let me know....

I just don\u0027t know if traveling faster will compromise it\u0027s safe operation in theory, basically once 60,000 KMps is reached, speed would have to be adjusted to hit the sweet spot for self
