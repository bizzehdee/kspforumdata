The best way to fix the problem is to try to make the rocket shorter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrange tanks are large single parts. That makes them rigid, which is not a bad thing in itself. In a wobbly rocket, the connections next to large parts often experience the greatest stress, so structural failures tend to happen there. Those structural failures can be sometimes avoided by making the rocket more flexible. By using stacks of smaller fuel tanks instead of large fuel tanks, you create more joints in the rocket. However, that only fixes the problem, but not its root cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the numbers, I assume that you have 7 Skippers in stage 5, and a single Mainsail in stage 4. It might be better to combine those stages: use a Mainsail in the center and 6 Skippers in the boosters, and drop the boosters when their fuel tanks are empty. This makes the lifter stages shorter and more rigid. On the other hand, TWR may grow a bit excessive before booster separation, so it may be wise to reduce throttle at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T03:52:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I made some progress and lost some progress.
