(See below.) In 0.90 this worked fine. I\u0027m wondering if it works with 1.0\u0027s aerodynamic mode? It is, after all, not directly exposed to the slip stream.\n\nI did try putting a fairing around it. I did learn the trick that the fairing has to some out pretty steeply as the start or it is seen as clipping the part above. However, since I\u0027m not bringing it to a point, can I attach it to a part above? How? It didn\u0027t seem to want to.\n\n![GQ9jcZE.png](http://i.imgur.com/GQ9jcZE.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T09:36:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by davidpsummers**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T22:14:34Z","Content":"The struts will still create drag as they are exposed to the airflow.

I have figured out that you have to come out sharply for it to work. But how do you get it to attach to a part above? I can set a section that lines up (at least by eye), but it doesn\u0027t \u0022finish\u0022 it."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T22:23:00Z","Content":"The struts will always create drag when surface mounted, even if you put them in tight to the docking ports.\n\nThe stock fairings can be a bit fiddly at times, it often takes some trial and error to make work. I would make the step out from the bottom, then a straight vertical section, then step back in (less sharply) to the monoprop tank. If you can enclose the RCS thrusters as well you\u0027ll reduce drag even further."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T00:20:59Z","Content":"For whats its worth, I\u0027m still using struts exactly likely you are in 1.0.2, but typically only 4 of them. Struts cause drag but fairings have a larger mass, so its a tradeoff. Also, I think struts parallel to the airstream like this seem to have much lower drag effects than ones at more of an angle."}]}
