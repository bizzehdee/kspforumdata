I figure there\u0027s some critical \u0022lessons\u0022 to get yourself over to achieve competence. Here are the ones I\u0027ve learned, so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: MechJeb. I find KSP to be just about unplayable without it. I know that there are surely some purists who will disagree, but without an autopilot and MechJeb\u0027s VAB calculations, I\u0027d likely still be considering myself lucky to so much as make Kerbin orbit, let alone be gearing up for my second shot at a Munar landing. I\u0027d also likely have no idea of what to do without having seen MechJeb do things, but I\u0027ve watched MechJeb in action enough to have an idea what on Kerbin it\u0027s doing and how to do it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: When in doubt, radialize! I\u0027ve experienced nothing but bitter, hilarious disaster trying to build vertically, barely able to get ridiculous expanding stacks into Kerbin orbit. Instead, I figured out that I have to build \u003Cem\u003Eoutward\u003C/em\u003E; the same fuel tank\u002Bengine design, in a serial decoupler arrangement, is vastly less useful and powerful than two/three/four/six of the same fuel tank \u002B engine design arranged radially around another of that same engine design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: SRBs, and how to use them. Specifically, SRBs are good for an initial bump to get your rocket engines up to speed and to let them carry some or all of the lowest-altitude work alone, with MechJeb on the limit to terminal velocity setting to save fuel, but it\u0027s not really worth it to use them for more than that. Radial liquid fuel engines are so much more useful, I\u0027m pretty sure I could get a radial SSTO going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: The KW RockoMaverick engine, for when you don\u0027t yet have the Mainsail. This \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E work with the LV-T30 stock engine and I think it would still be superior, but KW Rocketry is what really sells it. Get a big old 2.5m Rockomax fuel tank stage going, however much is appropriate to the payload you intend to use, and stick one of those KW LFTA 2-1 conical 1.25-2.5 adapter-fuel tanks on the bottom, inverted. Stick on a tricoupler (or a quadcoupler, if you have it - those will \u003Cem\u003Edefinitely\u003C/em\u003E make it better,) and attach three KW Maverick D-1 engines. Gives you \u003Cem\u003Emassively\u003C/em\u003E more thrust than the Rockomax Skipper (350*3 = 1050 thrust \u0026gt; 600 Thrust,) with better ISP at sea level and no worse ISP in vacuum and far more alternator output, not that that will matter on your ascent stage. It is heavier by 2 tons, true, but the far greater TWR means you\u0027ll ultimately save a lot in getting into orbit, and the RockoMaverick has been consistently lifting payloads into orbit for me that the Skipper can\u0027t. Not to mention it looks boss as heck, especially if you have six or twelve of them radially arranged around a central.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Less is more when it comes to payload, more is more when it comes to engines. If engines \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E your payload, you\u0027re going to have some tricky balancing work to do, and your ascent stage will probably wind up being approximately the radius of the Death Star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Navigation lights. I\u0027m pretty sure they came from B9 Aerospace since they were manufactured by \u0022Tetragon Projects.\u0022 Use the red lights on the left side of the craft and the green on the right, and I like to put the white lights strictly down the \u0022top\u0022 - that is, with the craft as a whole (that is, the first command part) not rotated, the white lights go straight down the middle when facing \u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E of the VAB. This helps \u003Cem\u003Eso much\u003C/em\u003E when you\u0027re in space and looking at your ship trying to work out which side is which.

I haven\u0027t got it installed and don\u0027t intend to. Fairings look boss as all heck and watching them pop in orbit is great, but without FAR, are they just adding mass and (paradoxically,) drag? Or do they actually shield the drag of their payload and replace it all with their own drag in stock, because that would probably justify the weight several times over on the ascent stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T13:52:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowDragon8685\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELesson 7...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WhiteKnuckle","CreatedById":101722,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T13:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ShadowDragon8685\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ShadowDragon8685\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: MechJeb.

Learn how to move indicators on the navball. This is one that saves me a lot of frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets start with the Prograde and Retrograde vectors. When you burn the prograde indicator will move toward the center of where you burn on the navball. The rate it does this depends on your current velocity. The lower your velocity the faster it moves. The retrograde indicator will move away from your thrust location. The rate it moves also depends on velocity. If you keep the velocity indicator within 50m/s you can move the indicators pretty much at will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Making a perfect soft landing with the indicators: while you\u0027re landing you\u0027ll want to line up your retrograde indicator with the zenith indicator on the navball. Make sure you do this in \u0022surface\u0022 mode. Thrust on the opposite side of the retrograde mark to move it towards the zenith. Keep your velocity over 10 m/s as you descend. When the indicator is lined up with the zenith you can thrust towards zenith to keep it there while dropping your velocity to 5 m/s. This gives you a nice straight landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you target something you get new indicators for that. The purple indicators tell the vector to your target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- fast and easy intercepts: This is after you plotted to intercept the target. Once you\u0027re within 50km of your target the navball switches to target mode. You can now intercept the target. Burn retrograde to reduce your velocity to the target to less than 50m/s. Then burn toward the prograde marker of the target to start headin towards it. Burn on the opposite side of the target prograde from your own prograde (remember the green one) to line up your prograde with the target prograde. Keep these markers lined up as you approach the target. When you\u0027re within 2km of the target it loads up. If your velocity is over 50m/s burn your retrograde to reduce it to 10 m/s.
