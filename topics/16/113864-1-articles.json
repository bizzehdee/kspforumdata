Example I have a station in space that I placed additional docking ports to for future growth it has something like enough to house 6 kerbals. My new contract says make a station that can have 9 kerbals. \n\n[the question] If I fly additional modules up and dock to the old station will the contract be complete?"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:43:19Z","Content":"Are you using a station contracts mod, or just stock contracts....\n\nRead the contract carefully, If it says build a new station, I suspect you will need to build a new station.\n\nIf it just says build a station, then you can probably just expand your current station to house more Kerbals."}]}
