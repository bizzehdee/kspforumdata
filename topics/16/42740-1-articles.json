All you have is the latitude and longitude of your landing site. If you plan to rendezvous with something once you\u0027re back in orbit, what you CAN do is set that vehicle as your target and launch at abut a 45 degree angle directly toward it as it passes overhead. Once you reach a trajectory with a good enough apoapsis (I usually use about 40 - 50 km), plan your apoapsis burn with the maneuver node to raise your periapsis to something similar. By that point you\u0027ll also have the ascending and descending nodes of your orbit relative to your target on the map. Circularize your orbit (or at least get the periapsis high enough not to crash), then plan your plane change for the ascending node or descending node as appropriate. If you\u0027ve \u0022followed\u0022 your target during your launch well enough, however, you shouldn\u0027t have much of a plane change to make, with luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T16:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUh......50k still leaves you in atmo.

You can watch the nodes as you\u0027re making your ascent burn, and adjust your flight trajectory slightly north or south of 090 as necessary to minimize the degree of the nodes. I can usually get within .5 degrees or so this way... it\u0027s a tough thing to judge and I\u0027ve never gotten it exactly correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T16:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUh......50k still leaves you in atmo.
