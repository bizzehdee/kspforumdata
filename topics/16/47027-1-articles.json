This is the node that points out where you should burn (fire your rockets) towards in order to decrease your velocity (your speed and direction). The yellow node is the Prograde node, which points out what direction you should fire your rockets towards to increase your velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour node is probably moving because you\u0027re accelerating in a different direction rather than \u0027up\u0027 or \u0027down\u0027. Depending on which side it moves to, if it\u0027s the retrograde node, then that is the direction \u003Cem\u003Eopposite\u003C/em\u003E of your current velocity.

If your retrograde node is in the center of the orange side, then you\u0027re moving upwards, and vise versa with the blue side.

Once I flipped these controls so that pressing the down key (\u0022s\u0022) made my nose go down and pressing the up key (\u0022w\u0022) made my nose go up, I was able to fly 300% better. I was also able to dock once I stayed in staging mode and realized that the translate up and translate down were also inverted... you press down (\u0022k\u0022) to go up and press up (\u0022i\u0022) to go down. That\u0027s just messed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I fly flight sims, and I\u0027m aware that pitching a joystick forward makes your nose go down. But that is a joystick, and a different mind set. With a keyboard, we\u0027re effectively striking \u0022arrow\u0022 keys, so what translates to the \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Eup\u003C/strong\u003E arrow\u0022 should **not** make your nose go \u003Cstrong\u003Edown\u003C/strong\u003E.
