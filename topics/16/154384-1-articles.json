it\u0027s usually best to start from the final stage and work your way back. \u00A0You generally get more efficiency by using the lightest engine you can put up\u00A0for each stage, which means lower thrust-to-weight ratios, but in space you don\u0027t need that much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0(Note the big exception here is nuclear engines, which are heavy but VERY efficient. \u00A0But nukes are usually overkill for sending a light payload to Duna. \u00A0Ions also play by some different rules).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a satellite, if the payload is light enough, you may be able to get a decent top package of delta-v from a couple Oscar-B tanks and an Ant. \u00A0However, the Ant is only very good for teeny tiny stages. \u00A0So if your satellite is on the larger size, you may want to skip the Ant and go with a top stage of a Spark and a few hundred units of fuel. \u00A0 If you do have the Ant, make the Spark your next stage. \u00A0The next stage back could\u00A0be a Terrier, and roughly twice as much fuel as on the Spark stage. \u00A0Depending on the delta-v requirements of a particular mission, you can keep building backwards all the way to enormous lower stages.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as other folks have mentioned, Duna is a pretty easy delta-v destination if you hit your transfer window right. \u00A0So all you probably need is a launch stage to get this thing high enough for the Terrier to be effective. \u00A0For the rocket described above, I might go with a Swivel and a couple radially mounted Thumpers with their thrust turned down to keep your starting \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E reasonable. \u00A0The Swivel is not that great a launch rocket, but options are fairly limited if you have something too small for a 2.5 core stage.

-- I would add a bit more fuel over the Swivel, and bump the thrust on the Thumpers back up a bit --\u00A0since my Terrier stage does not have that much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight
