This usually means a rocket-like design with everything symmetrical around a central axis, except light essential things like the rudder and landing gear. This is preferable but not always possible, if you want to do something with your plane.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake it so you can change the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E in flight. For example, if your craft is pitching up, switch off your lower row of RAPIERs as you switch the others to closed cycle; you can do both in one action by binding this to an action group. You won\u0027t need all that thrust while up there anyway. Fine-tune by adjusting the thrust limiter by hand if necessary.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd something to compensate for the thrust torque. Relatively small torque can be cancelled out by reaction wheels (although in these cases it\u0027s usually possible to tune the engine position to make the problem go away altogether). More powerful alternatives include putting attitude control jets\u00A0(e.g. a pair of vernors pointing up and down) or a rocket engine on a gimbal (e.g. Swivel, Vector) on the tip of the tail. This works very well on designs that have long tails, and the extra fuel expenditure is a rounding error.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jager798","CreatedById":185336,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T06:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys for the help.

My primary crew ferry is a mk 1 fuselage designed for high efficiency single RAPIER use. The low mounted wings and gear result in significant thrust torque when dry.

Fuel acounts for a large percentage of your\u00A0total mass. So if your tanks are not aligned with your overall craft,\u00A0 the center of mass will shift during flight as the fuel drains - sometimes dramaticly!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost rockets have a gimbal angle. In the first stages of the flight the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shift may occur within the scope and limits of your rocket engine\u0027s gimbal,\u00A0 and the compensating gimbal will counter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shift. But if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifts further than the gimbal angle,\u00A0 you will FOR SURE have an uncontrolable plane - one that no control surface is able to counter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA good tool to check both your FULL and EMPTY \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is a mod called \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E helper\u0022,\u00A0 found in spacedock.

Maybe the empty \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is overpassing the gimbal limit of your engine by just a little bit. Did you consider offsetting the angle of the engine UPWARDS,\u00A0just a little bit?\u00A0 Check the historical spaceshuttle: the engines point UPWARD a little bit,\u00A0 just for that reason. Maybe you could twist them upward,\u00A0 test it,\u00A0 and keep twisting until the entire \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shift is within the engine\u0027s total gimbal angle.
