I already had to be more defensive in my approach trajectory than I liked.\n\nThere are two aspects to lander TWR. If you only care about efficiency, initial TWR 1.5 is already good enough, while 2.0 is very good. If you fly manually and want to make your life easier, the absolute value of g\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7(TWR-1) is what you should really care about. During the critical phase of the landing, you\u0027re probably flying almost vertically, and the absolute acceleration is what makes you succeed or fail.\n\nIn low-speed situations, 3-4 m/s is already pretty good, which corresponds to TWR 2.85 to 3.45 for a Mun landing. In high-speed situations, you\u0027ll probably want to double that. In a Tylo touchdown, 6-8 m/s corresponds to TWR 1.75 to 2.0.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T12:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jouni**"},{"CreatedByName":"nekogod","CreatedById":103186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T12:36:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re moving towards the surface a 1500m/s you\u0027re not in the orbit.\n\nSure you are.

Once you know the initial velocity, the mass of the ship, the engine thrust and the body\u0027s gravitational pull, you can work out the maximum acceleration of your ship. The reason acceleration is important is because it tells you how many seconds you need to change your speed from x to y. Any TWR above 1 is capable of stopping the decent completely but only if you have time for it, else the ground will bleed off your remaining speed. So know your max acceleration and you can tell if there is time to come to a safe landing speed."},{"CreatedByName":"Admac","CreatedById":126280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:12:06Z","Content":"Yeah, Theorycrafing aside, take 1.5 \u002B local TWR for vacuum landers.

My prediction is you will have to do a painfully small margin lander like 1.1 or so. \n\nSince landers are tiny and their mass efficiency is less important, I\u0027d recommend making a very wide lander with a big reaction wheel and a TWR of 3-5. Easy and safe landings are worth an extra ton IMO.\n\nUnless you are doing it for the challenge of making a challenging low TWR lander, then light it up!"}]}
