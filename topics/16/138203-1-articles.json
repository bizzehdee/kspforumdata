My design cost 17310 kash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used the rounded 1.25m nosecone on the front -- since it has \u00A0a 2400 degree heat tolerance.

It accelerated in basically level flight to 1300 m/s and the nosecone blew the hell up. But the hammer couldn\u0027t push the remaining heatshield through the air that fast -- so the speed dropped to about 1220 m/s after the nosecone let go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdded 4 small radiators to see if I could keep the nosecone from blowing. They added enough drag that the hammer rocket could only manage 1250 m/s, and it was clear from the nasty little red \u0022overheat\u0022 gauge that\u00A0the nosecone would have blown at 1300 just the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, second try: remove\u00A0the radiators, replace the hammer with a thumper --\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eexpect\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0the nosecone to blow at 1300, but maybe the thumper can accelerate the bare heatshield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in fact it can.

However, I was unable to control the altitude properly at those speeds. And at 1450 m/s it takes very little time for the rocket to go from 9000 meters to 14000 meters altitude (or to 5000 meters, theoretically!). And then the rocket flamed out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I think to make it work\u00A0you\u0027re going to need to light a thumper in a dive from maybe 20km altitude. And you need to get the dive angle right, so that the thumper flames out just after it dives below 9km.
