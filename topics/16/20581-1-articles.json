Two general things that might be wrong. Firstly the centre of lift may be in front of the centre of gravity, which will make the plane spin. Secondly if you have to many fins and control surfaces at the front of the plane the plane will want to fly backwards (like an arrow the feathers always want to be at the back). Either way, try moving the wings back a bit?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T15:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe backflip issue I am narrowing down myself, but still not 100% sure on the issue. A good example is a plane I built for a challenge had heavy flipping. I did 3 things to fix it. I will also point out that lift to c.o.g. were aligned. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I removed some lift from the nose. I was using some wingbits to make a cool landing gear support, but it caused stability issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond was it was a large plane and I decided to use delta wings for the tail fin. This isn\u0027t uncommon for me, but in this plane\u0027s case the tail was mounted well above the central longitudinal axis. I think the higher drag of my tail setup was causing an offbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elast, I actually brought some mass forward a little bit on the plane. I made it longer, but also added more nose mass. The lift to c.o.g. positioning remained the same, but the plane became alot more stable. Wish I could point out exactly what might cause it. Can you post up a screenie of your plane or two?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne theory might be when you get initial pitch, there is some sort of angular drag that throw off your lift and balance. By keeping drag centralized and your mass forward, it prevents a balance tip from occuring. This is probably why the issue is most common on large planes, but I find it rarely on my smaller ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T15:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a note... if centre of lift is too close to centre of gravity, the craft becomes unstable. Ideally, you want the centre of lift to be a little ways behind the centre of gravity. The closer the centre of lift to the centre of gravity, the more maneuverable the craft is, but at the same time it becomes more unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thevegimobil","CreatedById":42804,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T15:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest I\u0027m just trying to build a chase plane for when I launch my rockets....

Have them in the stage after your engines ignite. This will allow you to build thrust before decoupling. In actual space vehicles this is employed since it does take a small bit of time for initial thrust to build. It isn\u0027t instant like in ksp. That is why early rockets failed so much, they fell over while thrust built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.quora.com/Spacecraft/What-holds-a-spacecraft-in-a-vertical-position-during-a-rocket-launch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.quora.com/Spacecraft/What-holds-a-spacecraft-in-a-vertical-position-during-a-rocket-launch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClamping it while thrust builds when using plane engines is a must.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
