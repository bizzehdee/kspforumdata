When you click them they change to look like a red circle with a line through it, but it has no effect on my fuel, even when docked.

You could use it to have a small tank of reserve fuel on a booster so it can use its engines to deorbit itself without micromanaging the timing of staging or spending extra part count on a transfer blocking part.
