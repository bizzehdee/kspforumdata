Or at least over a year ago. I\u0027m guessing the OP bought the game recently.\n\nIf that is the case, you\u0027re out of luck. You can either:\n\n1) Not use Steam, and just run the game.\n\n2) Buy it again through Steam.\n\n3) Use the \u0022Not a steam game, but running in Steam\u0022 option.\n\nI use option 1, personally."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T19:15:53Z","Content":"Option one for me too.

It\u0027s the one game I won\u0027t really play for more than a couple hours without my mods... and if it were up to me, I\u0027d put off updating until my favorite modders caught up (points at Roverdude, stupid\\_chris, and too many other awesome folks to name) So I\u0027m kinda jealous, I wish mine was non-steam. (You\u0027d never hear me say that about my other games.) \n\nI know I could play offline, but that\u0027s just annoying (and keeps other things from updating)."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T22:45:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I use option 1, personally.\n\nI bought through Steam, but now copy the folder and do this because...\n\n- no surprise updates that break all mods/saves\n\n- multiple game folders with multiple mod sets\n\n- launch in opengl mode for some memory saving\n\nMy Steam KSP folder is basically stock and untouched.
