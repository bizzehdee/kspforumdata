You\u0027re running on processor-integrated graphics. Those will indeed make KSP feel sluggish at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, you need to confirm that you are on a real desktop PC. Because, if you have a laptop or other mobile/convertible device, or a so-called \u0022all in one\u0022 PC (a monitor that has a computer built into it), then chances are high that you will not be able to do any upgrading. In that case, you should contact your manufacturer\u0027s support hotline and ask if the device is at all upgradable. In 95% of all cases, the answer will be no, but there are some exceptions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you are indeed on a desktop, then I have good news: there is no such thing as a desktop computer without at least one full-size graphics card expansion slot. They are called PCI Express x16 slots, and are often the \u0022topmost\u0022 slot in a tower PC case standing normally upgright. Some boards may have a tiny slot on top of that, but you want the big, full-size slot. Here\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/190_051.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea useful picture\u003C/a\u003E where the thing is labeled. In you case it will be empty, because outside of professional specialist hardware, there is nothing else besides a graphics card that occupies a PCIe x16 slot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next thing you need to determine is how much power your PC has available to it. Graphics cards exist in a video variety of sizes, and the largest ones can eat more juice than the rest of the computer combined. Even in the price range you are looking at, there are some that want a dedicated power connector. Ideally, your power supply should have its \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bcot1.com/dataplatemustangpowersupplyb.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einfo sticker\u003C/a\u003E visible to you when you look inside the case. This tells you the maximum output of the power supply somewhere on it. As a rule of the thumb, 300W to 350W is good enough for a videocard without a dedicated power connector, and 400W to 450W is good for cards with one dedicated connector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have at least 400W available to you, check that you also have the correct connector. Here\u0027s a picture of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/pcie6index.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe PCIe 6-pin power connector\u003C/a\u003E. This thing is unique, you can\u0027t confuse it with anything else. However, larger power supplies may potentially come with one or more \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img.misco.eu/productmedia/htmlimages/cten/SRH/SRH-1/162146-front2.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPCIe 8-pin connectors\u003C/a\u003E instead, which can look similar to a mainboard connector that you definitely should not mix up. However, in 99% of all cases, the right connectors actually have the word \u0022PCIe\u0022 written on them. Sometimes 8-pin connectors are also split into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/attachments/pcie6-2-jpg.57637/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E6\u002B2-pin configurations\u003C/a\u003E. If you have enough power, but can\u0027t find a connector, you can buy \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kenable.co.uk/images/6-Pin_Power_Adapter_Cable_video_card_kenable.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean adapter\u003C/a\u003E if you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that you know what your PC can support, it\u0027s time to select actual cards. I\u0027m not sure if your $150 price limit includes tax or not, because in the US it is customary to specify prices without tax, which can get confusing to my European self \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E But let\u0027s start with which models are appropriate for you. Generally, you want to focus on the GTX 700 and 900 series for Nvidia, or the R7 300 and RX 400 series for AMD. It is not important for you to worry about which manufacturer you pick, or how much RAM the cards are advertised as having. It is much more important to select a card from the above series, because those are actually up to date. Most shops just love selling you outdated crap for 10% off, which looks equivalent because it has the same amount of memory... Don\u0027t fall for those scams. Among the huge heaps of stuff that manufacturers put into the names of their cards, focus on the \u003Cem\u003Emodel\u003C/em\u003E. That\u0027s what defines what you will get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a PCIe power connector available to you, then you are well served with a Nvidia GTX 950 or an AMD Radeon R7 370 card. You may occasionally find a GTX 950 without a power connector, but almost all models require one. These cards are decently quick - definitely more than enough for KSP by a long shot, and you\u0027ll find yourself able to crank the graphics in CS:GO quite a ways up. Looking at Newegg, you should be able to find them around $125 before taxes, depending on the exact model and what rebates are currently available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have a PCIe power connector and only 350W or less - or if you decide that you don\u0027t need quite as much graphics power - then a GTX 750 Ti is hard to beat. Keep in mind that you want the \u0022Ti\u0022 variant, there are also non-Ti ones which are noticably slower. This should save you about $30 compared to the bigger cards above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, if you feel like waiting, there is a brand new card coming from AMD later this summer which falls right into your price range: The RX 460. However, the thing with waiting for new hardware components to hit the market is that there\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E new hardware components coming soon. At some point you just have to pull the trigger, or you\u0027ll just end up waiting forever. If you want to play now, then buy now. But I wanted to at least mention the option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-18T08:29:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2016 08:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
