(without targeting)","CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T01:49:00Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T01:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I\u0027m trying to do the impossible (or maybe I\u0027m just really bad at this game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw a piece of debris drifting around 40 Km off the side of my space station and I decided to build a rocket specially designed to de-orbit it. I had seen KSP YouTubers do similar contraptions with a cradle on the rocket\u0027s nose so I figured, how hard can it be? (SO HARD!) I can\u0027t seem to target the piece of debris, so I can\u0027t tell what my heading is relative to it\u0027s. I made it around 1.0 kilometer away before I just start to... loop around it endlessly. I know I\u0027m overshooting but I can\u0027t tell in which direction I\u0027m doing the overshooting. I\u0027ve run out of fuel and resorted to infini-fuel cheat, and I still can\u0027t get the little bugger! Closer than 150 m the indicator just vanishes, and at that point I\u0027m completely lost. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027m asking in this thread (maybe just a shoulder to cry on...) I guess I\u0027d like to know if anyone has any tips for doing this?

Set it to the last option so you can see your relative speed and heading.
