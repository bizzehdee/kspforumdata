Unlike, say, French, where the majority of the singular pronouns are gender specific, and the ARTICLES have gender too. Which means, for a start, that every possible object (in the grammatical sense) has to have an assigned gender so you can use the proper set of pronouns and articles with it.

Second is that the atmosphere\u0027s so massively compressed: The air pressure ramps up a lot faster as you descend, so you won\u0027t be getting heated as badly for as long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E That does get irritating, and I am tempted to steal you sig. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d probably just skip over it too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T04:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dangerous_Beans\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dangerous_Beans\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe do have gender neutral pronouns in English (ze), you can use a singular they, or you can use the persons name.
