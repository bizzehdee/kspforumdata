Each part has individual rewards and there is a final reward for the entire mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow clearly one can accomplish all of these in one go - an Apollo-style mission would do that easily. But suppose one can\u0027t - or chooses not to - accomplish all four parts in one mission. Say one wants to take a more leisurely approach, such as putting an object into Munar orbit one mission, doing science a second mission, and so on. (Think of the unmanned path to the Moon in our history, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile all four parts are needed for the final reward, can one accomplish one part only and get the reward for just that part, or does the game hold onto the individual rewards until the entire contract is completed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-07T23:46:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2014 11:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AndrewBCrisp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T01:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, you don\u0027t need to complete each section with a single ship, all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how the payout is distributed if you split it up, I haven\u0027t paid attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science portion does not need to be transmitted right away either.
