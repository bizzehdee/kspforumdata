In onions staging, these tanks would not share their fuel, and would take longer to burn through. They\u0027d drop off at the same\u00A0time but the rocket has to drag this mass for longer, hence why asparagus staging is used on the Kerbal X, and why asparagus staging is better than onion staging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-12T01:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you right click on the fuel tanks you\u0027ll see that the only tanks draining at the start are the first two booster tanks, so you have seven engines feeding from two tanks. Once you drop two engines you have five engines feeding from two booster tanks, then three engines feeding from two booster tanks then the mainsail feeding from full core tanks. The rate at which the tanks drain varies depending on the number of engines using the fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-12T01:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Asparagus_staging\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Asparagus_staging\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MetricKerbalist","CreatedById":211699,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-12T03:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Bej Kerman, Reactordrone, and FleshJeb,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you all for your informative answers.\u00A0 I especially enjoyed the link to the Kerbal Space Program wiki, which nicely tidied up the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am grateful for the help that all of you provided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStanley\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
