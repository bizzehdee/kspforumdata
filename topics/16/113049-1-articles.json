Confused about whether or not they are cumulative....\n\nYeah, the way they\u0027ve modeled it can be a bit confusing.\n\nThe natural assumption that you\u0027re making (I made it myself, and was deeply confused for a while) is that there are all these different \u0022achievements\u0022, and each one gives you points, and to milk all the experience from a particular body, you have to do all the different things.\n\nThat\u0027s not how it works. To expand a bit on RocketPropelledGiraffe\u0027s comment:\n\nEach celestial body is worth a certain total bucket of points. For example, the Mun is worth 5 total points. Any given Kerbal will start with a \u0022Mun score\u0022 of 0, and can get (at most) a maximum \u0022Mun score\u0022 of 5.\n\nThere are a series of different achievements worth different amounts, and your \u0022Mun score\u0022 is the *maximum* of your Mun achievements, not the *sum*.\n\nSo for example, a flyby of the Mun is worth 2; orbit, 3; landing, 4; plant flag, 5.\n\nSay you do a flyby and come home. You now have a \u0022Mun score\u0022 of 2, where it was previously zero. So your experience has gone up by 2 points.\n\nNow you go again, but you orbit. That raises your \u0022Mun score\u0022 to 3. It was previously 2, so you get only one extra point.\n\nNow you go again, but you land. This raises your \u0022Mun score\u0022 to 4. It was previously 3, so you get only one extra point.\n\nSo, what does this mean in practical terms for you?\n\nA Kerbal needs 2 experience points to get to level 1. On Kerbin, flying is worth 1 point, orbiting is worth 2.\n\nSo if you orbit, you have 2 points and will be level 1.\n\nIf you fly (but do not go to orbit), you have 1 point and are therefore still only level 0. If you fly multiple times, doesn\u0027t help, no extra experience. If you launch out of atmosphere on a suborbital trajectory, still no extra points. The only way to reach level 1 is to get to orbit, and if you do that, you don\u0027t need anything else (like flying).\n\n(Well, in principle you could get it by launching straight on a suborbital trajectory that intercepts the Mun\u0027s SoI or something, without ever actually *orbiting* Kerbin, but that\u0027s a kind of odd edge case and I doubt it comes up in practice.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T22:48:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T01:39:30Z","Content":"I wonder if it\u0027s not really \u0022flight\u0022, but suborbital ... should be easy to test, get to 30-50k up, then clear 70k, see if there\u0027s XP gain."}]}
