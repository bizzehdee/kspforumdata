Bear in mind, all of the command pods and probe cores have reaction wheels (except the external seat), but with bigger rockets you may need to add proper in-line reaction wheels, or SAS units, to provide more torque (rotating power). Reaction wheels consume electricity, so adding more of them could be risky if you don\u0027t have any batteries or solar panels.

There\u0027s a significant time during which the rocket climbs using the already slightly underpowered central stack only, after shedding its liftoff boosters. Hence I can\u0027t afford to lose about 25% thrust by dropping down to a skipper. Meanwhile the fuel usage is such that the rocket finishes circularizing a 70km orbit exactly when the fuel on the ascent stage runs out, which leaves the decoupled transfer stage to go wherever it wants with a full tank. A mainsail would guzzle too much. Too bad there\u0027s no 2.5m engine with ~1000 kN thrust in stock or the mods I have... Maybe I can tweak one of KW Rocketry\u0027s some to fill that niche.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe roll happens both while boosters are still present and after they have been shed (but they\u0027re liquid boosters, not SRBs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the thing is strutted all over the place, and there\u0027s some OX-STAT panels that are in 3-part symmetry and not 4/8-part like the rest of the rocket, and two spotlights in a 2-part symmetry on the lander. But, those things clock in at 5 kg each, on a rocket that weighs 150 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWinglets I\u0027ve considered; I usually include them, but in this design they don\u0027t fit well because the bottom of the rocket is surrounded by no less than 8 boosters (I blame Jeb). Because of the way winglets attach to circular surfaces, it\u0027s almost impossible to attach them without having them clip into a booster, and they would definitely be awkwardly offset from the normal axes of symmetry I am using for the rest of the build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I\u0027ve already put a lot of thought into that rocket, and trying to change it pretty much boils down to starting over fresh anyway.
