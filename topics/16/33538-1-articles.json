Will edit shortly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 1: Well I removed the sepratrons, but I think I found the underlying reason, your SRBs aren\u0027t angled out evenly on the top/bottom. Your top ones are angled closer together, putting the outer SRBs further out and creating a pivot point in thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Yep, if you redo your SRBs entirely it\u0027ll fly.
