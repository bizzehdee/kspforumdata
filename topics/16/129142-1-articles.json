The equations of motion are pretty simple to specify in the restricted two body system of KSP:\u00A0 d\u003Cstrong\u003Ev\u003C/strong\u003E/dt = (1/m(t)) (\u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Csub\u003EThrust\u003C/sub\u003E \u002B \u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Csub\u003EGravity\u003C/sub\u003E). You can solve this in two dimensions\u00A0if the thrust is always in the plane of the initial trajectory.\u00A0Bold quantities are vectors. m(t) is mass as a function of time. You need to specify the direction and magnitude of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Csub\u003EThrust\u003C/sub\u003E as a function of time.\u003Csub\u003E\u00A0\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) approximation: Instead of a single impulse burn, approximate the finite burn as a small number of impulse burns. This is a bit hairy, but doable. Instead of the equations of motions, you use the vis-viva equation and equations for the geometry of conic sections.\u00A0In practice, simulation is more accurate, and in fact, easier, than doing the approximate calculation. \u00A0(I have been working on a related calculation in my spare time, and it\u0027s seriously ugly.
