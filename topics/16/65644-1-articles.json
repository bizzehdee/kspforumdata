However, when I set the right trigger as throttle, throttle opens up to 50% at the first touch. Between 50 and 100% I have perfect control back and forth, but it is as if half throttle is the minimum it will do. Pressing X or control on the keyboard resets throttle to zero as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange thing is that the left trigger is set as incremental throttle, and that works fine across the whole range. It is just that I can not use that, as it is not sensitive enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have fiddled around with the deadzone and sensitivity, but that does not seem to change much. What do I need to change to get the (non-incremental) throttle to work from 0 to 100%?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T00:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have fiddled some more with it, no answer yet.

KSP supports analog sticks, so you can control your craft in a very delicate manner. Instead of inputs being on or off (like WASD with a keyboard) you have a full range of control, from minimal input to full rudder. The triggers also do what they are supposed to do; the left one works as it should, and the right one works perfectly past 50%. You can even maintain a hover with only half that trigger range by artificially limiting your TWR to 0,5 or less, but it goes without saying that this is less than ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, it is not a matter of support, that works pretty well actually. I don\u0027t fly craft with the keyboard anymore.

The best candidate for this assignment on the Xbox 360 controller IMO would be the right stick, since it\u0027s closer to X (which you\u0027ve mapped for zero throttle). If you do this, you may wish to consider setting up/down for the throttle and left/right for roll, so that any errant sideways sideways motion won\u0027t pitch or yaw a rocket off course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T06:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, mapping throttle to the joystick sort of works, but is fairly odd since neutral position is also 50%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does leave me with the impression that the triggers are viewed as analog sticks with only one direction (up or down like an analog stick, instead of a trigger). This seems to be confirmed by the observation that checking the \u003Cem\u003Einvert\u003C/em\u003E option gives you control over 0 to 50%, which is pretty much what you would expect in that scenario. Sadly that probably means it is probably something that has to be fixed on the Squad side of thing, unless there are configuration options I do not know about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42525-XBOX-360-controller-trigger-axis-only-has-half-the-range\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E, which confirms my suspicions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoatRider","CreatedById":103681,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T17:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, wonder if I can use my R/C flight sim controller.
