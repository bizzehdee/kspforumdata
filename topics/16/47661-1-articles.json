Just don\u0027t be involved in a turning move at the time. Do use bracing struts on the big SRB or they can cause unwanted spin and handling issues due to twisting on the radical couplers. Bracing onion staging boosters is far easier then bracing asparagus staging. The entire ring slides off cleanly upon staging. Without the cross bracing, this rocket would start spinning out of control. With no braces, the boosters would eventually twist off. There are no braces connecting to the asparagus inner ring. The interconnecting braces stabilized the SRBs so the load transfers evenly to the inner core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o2gytqU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o2gytqU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis photo shows the bracing on a eight engine, four place, asparagus in orbit.
