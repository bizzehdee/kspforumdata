I\u0027ve mentioned this I think before, but I don\u0027t see how one can effectively use the WASD keys, and hit left control/shift and use the mouse to change and reorient your view all at the same time. I also find my ship is constantly tipping over, rotating, listing in various directions even if I apply no thrust at all, and this is (as I said) very much magnified when you\u0027re 10 meters off the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy far my typical failure mode is to reach the ground, hit between 3-6 m/s upon one of my struts, which is enough to push the whole craft on its side.

The new rocket designs I\u0027ve been using have allowed me to reach Mun with a Sizeable reserve of fuel, often 1500L\u002B and a Poodle engine to slow me down. This has been quite effective at putting payloads of 10-15 mass units (tonnes, I guess?) on the surface and often I can cancel out all my velocity above 10 Km height, I\u0027ve found that if I do that and \u0022fall\u0022 towards the ground that the craft tends to right itself due to the gravitational attraction and when it works it\u0027s worked quite well.

I recommend using precision mode (capslock) if that\u0027s what is causing the problem. Also, I remapped the throttle up/down keys over to \u0027p\u0027 and semicolon, so I can use left hand for steering and right for power. Another thing to mention is that once you\u0027ve more or less confirmed that you\u0027re headed for more or less flat ground, all of the flying is done with the nav-ball. You\u0027ll be moving around in all directions, probably rotating as well, so the camera view is pretty useless apart from checking how far it is to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood advice there on switching over to p/semicolon or some equivalent: I\u0027ll need to try that myself. I\u0027ll also agree that the nav-ball is far more useful going down than looking at the ship or the terrain (well at least until the last few meters) - I actually find looking at what\u0027s happening in real time to be a bit confusing, it\u0027s just far easier to maneuver by aligning myself with the ball than trying to figure out 3D spatial orientation on sight. As for Capslock, yeah I use that all the time. I probably wouldn\u0027t be able to land at all without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I see your point about descent from a high orbit, well at least high in KSP terms. I\u0027ll have to see about giving that a shot as well, can\u0027t hurt to try something new. Oh, as for craft weight: I\u0027ve landed three-man capsules on Mun with a lander mass of nearly 15 tonnes - I\u0027ve also done the same with much smaller spacecraft, one of which came in below 4 tonnes. I can say that the heavier versions are much more tolerant of impacting the ground at slightly higher speeds and seem less prone to translating minor mistakes into full-on catastrophic failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corbald","CreatedById":2219,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-13T07:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I find that switching to the IVA view on the properly equipped pods does me a WORLD of good for landings! I haven\u0027t had a hard landing in some time, due to the ease of finding the touchdown point -exactly- with the radar altimeter. Also, I altogether stopped looking at the lander and misjudging my vectors now that I -can\u0027t- see the lander!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
