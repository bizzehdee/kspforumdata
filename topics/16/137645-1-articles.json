Hopefully your technique may work for other folks, who have different play styles, frustration tolerance levels, or hot-button issues than I do!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I snipped the quote a bit just for convenience)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, I get it, you hate wheels on anything but rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever (and I do appreciate your acknowledgement that this is not rational), why don\u0027t you hate having \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elanding legs\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E on bases too? Perhaps because it\u0027s easier to pretend that they\u0027re fixed jacks used to stabilise the base... but then mobile homes have wheels and jacks, and while you might understandably hate \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethem\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, they do form the closest analogy to the sort of thing we\u0027d need to have if we started trying to drop numerous modules onto a distant planet or moon. And yes, it will necessarily be fiddly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the stock game provides huge wheels which seem to have the express purpose of supporting massive constructions... like bases. Though I don\u0027t actually use them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the thing I gave you to land is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elander\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efuel carrier\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. It is not intended to be the main part of a base, but something which can roll up to it and syphon off fluids. From a realism (or rather not-breaking-credulity) standpoint, it is perfectly logical. I doubt a real base would want people pointing large rockets anywhere near their fuel stockpiles, so wheels would be a must for that role anyway. So it\u0027s a temporary attachment to the centre of the base. Wheels are a natural fit for this purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the other point about that lander is that it is simple to build, once you\u0027ve done it once, and does not require numerous attempts to connect just as long as you approach straight on, which is not too difficult to do. That was one of the main points about providing that savegame: to demonstrate that \u003Cem\u003Eit does not have to be fiddly\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that \u0022doing it once\u0022 was also relatively simple. I\u0027ve spent far more time just trying to build something to land and take off from Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E want to get fiddly (and \u0022you\u0022 in this context certainly cannot refer to you personally, I know), that lander also provides that possibility: the wheels can come off, once attached, as long as the tanks aren\u0027t full. Decouple the docking port and they roll out from under the body of the lander. If you want to build a huge base on legs alone, just put a docking port under a central 2.5m part and you can use the wheels waiting on the surface. That, of course, is very fiddly but again, this is probably what we\u0027d need to do for anything other than huge bases - and they will probably be cut directly out of the rock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flatbear","CreatedById":143398,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T02:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\non a side note, is there an easy way cheat mate/dock parts of a mun base?
