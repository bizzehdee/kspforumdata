Still on stock and planning to be for a bit longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a mission in mind, to take a manned rover with an MPL to Duna, visit all the biomes collecting data and samples and then return it all to Kerbin, I have so far landed one Kerbal on Duna and returned him so have some experience with bits of this. My Rover consists of just a Mk2 cockpit, the Mk2 to 2.5 adapter, a hitchiker, an MPL and docking port on the back all horizontal plus the experiments and 2 pairs of the XL wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just spent all evening trying to work out a way to retrieve the MPL from the rover onto something with a rocket but not have to take the whole rover back to orbit. My initial plan was one or more rockets on wheels that would attach to the MPL via docking ports and then detach it from the rest of the rover but this seems at least very difficult if not impossible on Kerbin so I don\u0027t back myself to manage it on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anyone have any ideas? Or has done something similar before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eone thing I just thought of is having another MPL on the ship that goes down and meets the rover at it\u0027s final location, collects all the samples and science and returns to orbit, but it feels \u0022cleaner\u0022 somehow to be able to return the rover MPL to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for any advice in advance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPokethis\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T00:49:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sorry to say I can\u0027t help you there.

Once in orbit I docked with my refueler, filled it back up with monoprop, and headed home. You don\u0027t need much dV if you wait for a transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem you\u0027re going to have, I think, is getting it back onto the surface of Kerbin in one piece. Labs are fragile - you have to be nearly stopped to land them in the water, and on land you need to make sure you have legs or sacrifice parts to absorb the shock. That all has to be designed in from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time I tried a mission like that I got so frustrated with the landing I sent up a bunch of capsules to land the science and sent the empty lab to a fiery death.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T01:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pokethis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pokethis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just spent all evening trying to work out a way to retrieve the MPL from the rover onto something with a rocket but not have to take the whole rover back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can, of course, make it so that all the rover bits (wheels\u0026amp;c) are mounted on decouplers and can be jettisoned when done. But that will require a lot more struts to hold it together while you need it; you may also find that the weight on Kerbin increases by a lot. I suspect that picking up the whole rover will be cheaper and easier than making the wheels detachable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELifting it can be done with a skycrane; if you don\u0027t know what that is, start a sandbox game and check the stock vessels, there is one (small) example. However, docking a skycrane with a lab-rover will be difficult. A contraption that\u0027s large enough will also move considerably when you try to lower it by retracting the legs. Hitting any docking port will be difficult, and you probably need more than one. By the time you\u0027ve solved that problem, the whole thing has again become quite large, heavy, and unwieldy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust storing the result in a pod and leaving all equipment behind will be by far the easiest thing to do. There\u0027s a reason why NASA did it like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next best solution? Put engines on your rover, make it a rover-lander and let it take off under it\u0027s own power.

Never wanted to take them off again, although my first thought would be to make it in two parts, Rover (and lab etc) attached to a landing / takeoff stage via large docking port, try and make the whole thing VTOL capable on Duna. Then you land, disconnect, do your science and then return and reconnect to the lift stage to leave.
