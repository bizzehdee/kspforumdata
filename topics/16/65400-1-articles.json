Its mostly a problem with parts that can be attached both radialy and stacked. I normaly have the best luck with positioning my camera at a right angle to the point I want to attach to and move the part closer till it snaps over to the node. If your mouse pointer gets over a valid radial attachment spot it will try to attach radialy but from a right angle you can hit the node attach before radial becomes valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou prety much need a minimum of 1 intake per engine. The more intakes you have per engine the higher you can go while runing on air breathing mode. If useing more than a single engine keep an eye on your air intake and switch over to rocket mode before it runs out completely. jets will flame out when out of fuel and normaly 1 will go before the other causeing a bad spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESPH has different symmetry than the VAB. It assumes you are trying to make a spaceplane so its rules are optimized for that. It would be very hard to attach wing structures in any configuration other than strait out the centerline of the craft with the VAB\u0027s symmetry. As for the editor trying to apply symmetry onto a part instead of on both sides of the craft hit X agian to fix it. When trying to attach a part symetricly to a part that was already applied with symmetry there are 2 modes, mirrored on the other side and symmetry on that individual part. you can toggle between the mods with the symmetry key. If you really find a need to have a symmetry other than 2 on a spaceplane build the part in the VAB and save it as a sub assembly then return to the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your last issue haveing to do with radial attachment structure parts. Is what your trying to do something like sticking 2 or more hardpoints down the side of your rocket and then straping something like a long tank to the side ancored by all the hardpoints at once? If so sadly that does not work due to the root/tree structure of how craft are handled in KSP. It considers the new part you add a child part of the one you directly attached to. Other parts, even if they appear they should be attached are not considered ancored to the child part. Sadly asthetics are the only use for doing that although you can play games with struting the tank to the additional hardpoints.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vozlov","CreatedById":101189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T23:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers for the replies people.

There are a couple of things you mentioned with the SPH woes that have limited workarounds you might be interested in. Bit of a wall since the SPH handles symmetry differently, but I wanted to be clear, maybe I should make a guide at some point. Hope its useful to someone with similar troubles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetry in the SPH, and Symmetry on symmetry (nested symmetry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, and most obvious, the SPH works up to 2x symmetry and no higher. If you need something like a 4x spacing you could fake it with two 2x placements, but with no vertical snap this is only as balanced as your eye/mouse-hand. If you need true 3x (or more) symmetry in the SPH you must create that piece in the VAB and move it over as a sub-assembly. (you can also physically move .craft files from the VAB to SPH folders in your filesystem to open them in the other hanger/choose your launch point)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly the SPH handles symmetry differently to the VAB, symmetry in SPH is rather like a mirror dropped verticaly along the longitudinal axis of the part, you get only left-right symmetry. In the VAB it acts more like a rod than a surface plane and gives you full circular symmetry around the vertical axis. These inbuilt variations make the VAB infinitely more suited to a vertical lifting rocket and vehicles that operate in vacuum as getting the CoM over CoT is easy here. The SPH is tailored to vehicles operating horizontaly under gravity, planes and rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with the obvious bits out of the way, heres where complex designs get tricky:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say you are building your plane, you slap down a fuselage, then put some wing mounts on, but they are tricky and you end up applying them in 1x symmetry manually. If you then try to attach a wing to those wing roots and use 2x symmetry you will see the wings mounting on either side of a single wingroot, with one of them clipping through the rest of the plane. Its 2x symmetry is relative to its parent, if its parent was 2x too then it would inherit all the way back to the fuselage and plot symmetry around that, but the roots werent so it didnt. You see this also when trying to use girders to construct complex rover wheel-bases consisting of many wheels, trying to get symmetry to put them where you think they should go becomes a nightmare, the front left wheel doesnt pair with front-right, its back-right and that rear wheel comes out inverted. So how do we get round this nightmare?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen building symmetry in the SPH build 1 side only, use no symmetry tool, this goes for wings, rover wheelbases, anything where the part you are placing is just part of a further construction. With 1x on all these parts then where you do want symmetry it will correctly calculate for this side and pick the right part to reflect around. Keep going to the wingtip or last wheel, until its just how you want it. Then activate 2x symmetry and pick up that root part way back on the fuselage/body and let the game clone the other-side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue SPH symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same techniques make nesting symmetry in the VAB simple too. Its how you get say, 4 symmetrical radial engines around each of 4 symmetrical asparagus tanks. Build the asparagus in 1x, get its engines done, then clone that up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: it also occurs to mention upon a quick re-read that symmetry can calculate and plot differently in both hangers depending on whether the piece is standing vertically or horizontaly. Occasionaly to get the effect you want you need to snap off the parent piece and place it somewhere in the other orientation before applying it\u0027s radial pieces, move it back once its ready.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T10:47:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etweak/sp\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vozlov","CreatedById":101189,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T18:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting. Food for thought. I\u0027m chugging along quite happily now, figuring out these damn shuttles one failed launch at a time. I\u0027m starting to enjoy my failures again, which is great. Nothing quite like watching something you\u0027ve spent so long designing start falling out of the sky like a stone in the most horrific way imaginable.
