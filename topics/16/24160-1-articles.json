If you\u0027re far away, you\u0027re going to miss KSC by quite a bit because of this. You could plan ahead the rotation, but doing that accurately is pretty difficult. Also take into account aerobraking and how long it takes to kill your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T20:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI sure I will get rotten tomatoes thrown at me for suggesting this, but if your trying to learn how to do something for the first time I recommend the Suzuki method, which basically means; watch how a master does it and then copy. The master in this case is MechJeb (here come the tomatoes). Slap mechJeb onto your ship, put yourself in typical orbit (100km equatorial) and then kindly ask mechjeb to land your ship at KSP for you and watch closely what it does. Note where it starts to de-orbit, and what point relative to KSP it puts your trajectory. Most of the knack is getting the right over shoot so that atmo breaking brings you right on target (the rest is relatively easy). You could watch a youtube master instead, but using mechjeb means you can do it with your own ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Just to clear my name) I HATE landing with mechjeb, I LOVE landing manually its one of my fav things to do in KSP, but I learnt how to do a targeted atmo landing by watching what mechjeb does. (I learnt how to do non-atmo landing by playing \u0027luna lander in windows 3.1!!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
