The second way is to land every vehicle back\u00A0on the runway, and recover it from there for a 100% refund. This makes airplanes and Kerbin-based contracts especially lucrative. But it still applies to any other rocket, because you can fly all of them down from space and land them on the runway too -- if you design them properly.
