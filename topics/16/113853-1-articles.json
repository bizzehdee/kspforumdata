I can\u0027t seem to get any jet above 15,000 meters, or at least not significantly higher. Every jet I have tried no matter the intakes flames out at somewhere between 15,000 and 15,100 meters. I have been trying to make a U2 and something which I am calling a next gen SR-71 which have ceilings of roughly 21,000 and 24,000 meters. \n\nBoth of them I managed to get reasonably fast, my U2 cruises at just under Mach1 and the SR-X... well it goes over mach 1 before it hits the end of the runway... The problem is I always seem left with a feeling that they should be able to get higher than they are...\n\nMy U2 has 4 intakes, 2x ram intakes and 2 of the structural intakes. SR-X has 5 intakes, 1x ram 4x structural. \n\nI played around with both adding and removing intakes, changing which intakes were used, changing engines (didn\u0027t care for that one) but they all seem to suffer the same problem of flaming out at just over 15,000 meters, the only difference any of it seemed to make was how quickly I reached that altitude.\n\nIs there anything I can do short of switching to LF/O fuel and using a rapier instead to get them any higher?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T16:06:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by annallia**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T14:52:42Z","Content":"You\u0027re getting close to the altitude limit for available intake air [30,000m] It\u0027s no wonder your engines flame out. Ram intakes with a Turbojet can get you higher, provided you can generate sufficient lift and TWR.\n\nYou want to start off fast in the lower atmosphere. Going at full throttle and taking a steep ascent is nothing to be ashamed of, especially with Rams."},{"CreatedByName":"RCgothic","CreatedById":132560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:03:51Z","Content":"As Xannari said, it is possible to build a craft that doesn\u0027t flame out up to 30km with a little difficulty, and Mach 1 (320m/s) is about a fifth of the speed you should be able to achieve on air-breathers alone. Sounds like you\u0027re not going remotely fast enough, which is why you don\u0027t get enough air and flame out.

You\u0027re not trying to go high on Wheesley engines? Because 15k is about as high as you can get on those things. Even the Whiplash these days doesn\u0027t get much above 26k, no matter how many intakes you put on the thing.\n\nSorry - I know this is a type of question up there with \u0022is your computer plugged in\u0022.

A low altitude cruising flight would merit a few structural intakes, as they produce less drag, and take in more air in a denser field. High speed low altitude flight would merit a radial intake, a precooler, or a circular intake, as they have efficiency dependence on velocity. High speed high altitude flight would merit a ram intake, as they have increased intake efficiency at higher velocities.\n\nLow speed high altitude flight is a difficult one. It isn\u0027t that easy to pull off in the first place."},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:31:35Z","Content":"Can\u0027t belive it was as simple as removing all but the ram intake... \n\n![screenshot4_zpszoja77bv.png](http://i1184.photobucket.com/albums/z335/annallia92/screenshot4_zpszoja77bv.png)\n\nNot only did it break mach4 shortly after this its new ceiling is 27,000...
