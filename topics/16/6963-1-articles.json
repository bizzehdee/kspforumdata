In preparation for future missions where crew/part recovery will matter, I\\\u0027ve done some test flights to determine how to land roughly where you want using just a capsule and chute, plus either an RCS or a throttle-capable engine to deorbit you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith meticulous planning and an orbit calculator that included the calculus for atmopheric drag, you could do this perfectly. You also probably wouldn\\\u0027t have fun with it. Instead, you can reliably land NEAR a target area by following these steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. First, get yourself into a roughly 100 km circular orbit that will pass over your target area. In this case, I\\\u0027ll use KSP as the example. This would work for any orbit, but the timing of the deorbit burn would be different and this is the one I figured out the timing for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tXaBr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tXaBr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Switch to map view, hit tab to switch targets to Kerbin, and center your landing target in the view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iQ5kz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iQ5kz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Zoom out until you can see your whole orbit easily. Then, right click and drag straight down on the map until you\\\u0027re looking at your orbit from above. Your landing target should be at the 6 o\\\u0027clock position if the planet were a clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5CnOe.png\u0022 alt=\u00225CnOe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Warp time until your ship reaches about the 10:00 position (120 degrees before it would pass over your target.) Then, repeat step 2 to correct for the planet\\\u0027s rotation, and get your ship lined up for a deorbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Ideally at the 9:30 (105 degrees) point, slow your ship down to have a periapsis of just 100 feet or so. The periapsis should be about at the 3:30 position. If you\\\u0027re not planning a powered landing, jettison anything you like here but don\\\u0027t activate the parachutes yet. Then you can warp time again for 5 minutes until your ship enters the atmosphere. In this example, I made the deorbit burn slightly too early - around 110 degrees/9:40 instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eWcZE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eWcZE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Just let atmospheric drag do its thing for 5 more minutes of the flight. Pop the chute when you get below 3000 feet or if you\\\u0027re going to overshoot your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XWLbH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XWLbH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Your ship should be within sight of your target when you pop the chute/light the engines for landing. Like I said, I was slightly too early. Still - I was within sight. You can see just how much I was off in the final orbit view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vKKim.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vKKim.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7sNM2.png\u0022 alt=\u00227sNM2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour Kerbal\\\u0027s will only take about 2.5 G\\\u0027s of acceleration this way - way less than they probably took during launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use this for pretty much any orbit if you line up to be at about 100 km altitude when you\\\u0027re at that 105 degrees before target location in the orbit; I used a circular example just to simplify things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Really, Really Short Version: if you put yourself into a 100 km x 100 m orbit, you will end up landing about 105 degrees around the orbit from the apoapsis due to atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duckunlimited2","CreatedById":14973,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-23T20:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent!

It would be great if there were a table of de-orbit angles for different starting altitudes. 160km could be a a good circular orbit to start from (for the user) because you can time-warp faster up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And this all assumes prograde equatorial orbits, where your landing spot is moving away as you descend.
