Can you help me with some tips to do it faster\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fulgur","CreatedById":195204,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-20T12:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you are building a space station, you need a rocket, and several different space station modules. I like using the same rocket for all my modules, or you can build individual ones; if you build a very good rocket and save it as a sub-assembly, it will probably work for all the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext you have to design the bits of the space station. Here\u0027s one I made earlier:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nTai6PH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nTai6PH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not all stock; you can see the greenhouses and recyclers, plus it was early career so I used a lot of the small solar panels, which I replaced when I updated the station with larger fuel tanks. You don\u0027t need that many solar panels, unless you\u0027re planning on running an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E operation (extracting fuel from ore, either mined from a nearby planet/moon or an asteroid).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost space stations are made of few modules, because it\u0027s easier. If you are in sandbox or late career, you can have just three or four massive modules with all the fuel you could possibly need. It\u0027s quite easy to fly a rocket to orbit, a skill I assume you have mastered, but the difficult and time-consuming bit is rendezvous and docking. There are many tutorials, and I recommend getting \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/1098/Navball%20Docking%20Alignment%20Indicator%20CE-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ean alignment indicator mod\u003C/a\u003E, to show when you are pointing in the right direction. Basically, you need to be pointing along the axis of the port, so that if you were in front of it, you would be pointing towards it. Then use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to move in front of it, so you are pointing directly at it, and slowly move into dock, slowing down about 10m away to about 0.2m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-20T17:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
