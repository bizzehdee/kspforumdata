I\u0027ve figured out how to get into orbit and I\u0027m working on learning how to get to the Mun and planets that are farther out (I\u0027m discovering just how huge they kerbal solar system is, after seeing the last planet wayyyyyyy out there). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been picking my brain trying to figure out how to successfully use a lot of PB-Ion Electric Propulsion Systems together. Nothing modded or anything...just the stock that is already in the game. I\u0027ve tried the small square space probe blocks...they really don\u0027t work very well. I\u0027ve even tried the large flat structural panel (odd as it may be...just sticking them on there with the tanks above the engine). However, apparently electricity doesn\u0027t pass through the structural panel itself and the engines couldn\u0027t fire. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what could I use to stick these engines on? I know that a single one just goes onto whatever you are building as the next piece that automatically attaches. But say that I want to build a probe with like 5\u002B ion engines (and I\u0027ve been pondering a massive one with like 15 of them). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to large node (HubMax Multi Point Connector) to attach multiple nodes together so that I have room for 5 engines in a square shape (for on the outside and one in the center). However, when you attached more than two of those side by side, you can\u0027t add anything onto the bottom of any of them for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T16:51:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by jmr106\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T16:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can stack them!
