That will get you close (as you are ascending pay attention to your close approach markers and when they get to less than about 5km (It is possible to get closer, I got it down to 1.6km once) at that point stop your engines and coast. then once you near the close approach marker set your navball to target mode (By clicking the speed) and then burn towards the retograde marker when you get close. Once your target velocity is zero not only are you in orbit, but you can now burn towards the pink meatball (Go slow!) and then you can dock to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T23:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis guide covers the basics of orbital rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers#Docking_.2F_Rendezvous\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Basic_maneuvers#Docking_.2F_Rendezvous\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor meeting with LKO space stations, I tend to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch into orbit as normal, no worries about timing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjust so my orbit is tangent to the station\u0027s somewhere.
