I started building up a space-station around the Mun ( very basic one Aeroponix \u002B Kerbitat module from OKS ) each of them need 300 Machinery so in total 600. I noticed that machinery is prity heavy and hard to lift it with some other parts of the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i was thinking what would be the best solution ? :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- build a large heavy lifter and lift it with the module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- build a single route rocket and bring the resource multiple times (launch the same rocket multiple times) .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- lift all the resource to Kerbin orbit and with a ferry carry it to the station with multiple trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking to produce it inside the station but it will be the same story i think , that way i will need to carry other resources. Maybe those resources are not so heavy i don\u0027t know . \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T00:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs that 600 tonnes of machinery? If so, it is indeed a heavy load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing to do is go with the heaviest launch vehicle you\u0027re already comfortable with so you need only do as few launches and rendezvous as necessary. Work out what tonnage your space-tug can take to Mun and assemble the launched components into sections of that size in Kerbin orbit. Ferry them to Mun one at a time and complete assembly there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandi94","CreatedById":33424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T10:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell i assume that is tone it doesn\u0027t specify, only that it needs 300\u002B300. Anyway yes i am building it by components and assembly on Mun\u0027s orbit. I tried to launch the 2 modules with one rocket so it\u0027s 600\u002B tons of weight , but all my tries ended up with fail , the rocket design just couldn\u0027t lift them or it has fuel only for kerbin orbit and not for going to the Mun , re-orbit , rendezvous , etc ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i was thinking to build a bigger rocket that has the power , or just send let\u0027s say only 100t and send it with 6 rocket\u0027s.

Launches that only cost fuel are cool ;-0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETalking of which - if you are launching fuel tanks amongst that 600t, try sending them up empty and refuelling them later. That way your \u0027huge\u0027 lift only has to cope with a smaller mass in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rule, use engines with the best ISP, work out what they can lift and go with that. Bigger payloads (\u0026gt;100t) tend to result in less efficient vehicles because of diminishing returns, but it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"O-Doc","CreatedById":95453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T13:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E600T is not much to lift in one go, especially if you are using stock aero.
