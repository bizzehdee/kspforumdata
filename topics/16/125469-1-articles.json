I have something like 36 different experiments on my lander can. I\u0027ve started lab processing a number of them, but it very quickly filled up the lab to it\u0027s 500 data max. Those experiments that were put in the lab appear to be ready to return to Kerbin, but I don\u0027t seem to have a way to separate them from the other experiments that I want to leave. The remaining experiments are not ready to return, as I still need to run the mobile processing lab on them and they will come back with a later ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas? If I just hit \u0022Take Experiments\u0022 I take all 36 and don\u0027t have any other options to put certain ones back in. Is there a mod that makes this possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Found a mod that does it, Ship Manifest. It will allow you to transfer individual experiments.
