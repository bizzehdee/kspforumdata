My KSP is not stock, but I cannot track a mod that might cause this issue. So it\u0027s not a report, just asking if anyone else has had this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went away with work this week, so I installed KSP onto my laptop so I could cope with leaving my PC for a few days. I spent the free time I had creating a new Apollo-style lander for my upcoming Mun missions. I tested it, tweaked it and everything was dandy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got home (today), I transferred the craft file onto my PC and fired up KSP. I went to test the vehicle on the PC, but the throttle was stuck at 10%. If I throttled up, down or cut it completely, it would fight me and return to 10%. I turned MechJeb on, and it fought that too. I took the vessel back to the VAB and reloaded it. Same thing. Tried another craft. Uh-oh... same thing. Tried an existing craft already in orbit. Oh noes - same damn thing! Deleted the file out of my VAB save folder - guess what, it didn\u0027t cure it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, restarting my computer is the only way to *SOMETIMES* clear the fault. But I\u0027m pretty sure the problem lies with the Mk2 Lander Cabin, for whatever reason. But I have no mod that directly links to that file. And I just re-installed that file, but it didn\u0027t cure the bug. And the problem has now transferred to all the other command vehicles. I\u0027ve had this happen to me in 0.20, but I cannot remember how I cleared it. I\u0027ve tried quick-loading and removing my most recent mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else know of this problem? It makes the game unplayable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod wise, I\u0027m not really using any same mod from the 0.20 version where I encountered the identical problem. It happened as soon as I transferred the file from my laptop to my PC. And, please, no \u0027this is why I play stock\u0027 comments. The only parts I have that are not stock is KAS, MapSat and CommSat. But none of these were fitted to the vehicle (the lander was made on my laptop, which is pure stock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: just tried a new game completely, and the problem exists within that, too\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: I\u0027ve removed all my mods making the game stock, and the problem still persists.

It hit me like a lightening bolt. When I came home today my study was tidy. Which meant the wife had been in here cleaning.

With a shaky hand and sweat beading up on my brow, I moved over and nudged the damn thing back down. When I looked back at my Navball, the throttle was sat steadily at 0. I gingerly held down shift and the needle moved up smoothly, with the jumping-issue gone. I\u0027ve just loaded the file I made on my laptop.
