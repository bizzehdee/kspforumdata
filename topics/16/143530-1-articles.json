For example, first drop a set of 2-4 rover bottoms, then drop the bits that go on top, and finally hook them all together. I like using claws rather than docking ports simply because it simplifies the connection a lot, and it also seems to be a lot less laggy. The contract probably specifies one docking port, but you don\u0027t have to use it for anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T06:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you move the thing into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and click on it, and hit any of the ASDW keys, it will rotate.

Also, add plenty of reaction wheels, vernors and/or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E.

First, I\u0027m not sure how many wheels you\u0027ll need to support such a structure now. Second, Mechjeb had a differential throttle option which helped if the base tilted. But with the latest updates, that option is no longer working. I don\u0027t know if there is a mod that provides differential throttle. Otherwise, you\u0027ll have to be very careful when building the base, you should use TAC-fuel balancer to balance the tanks and you should still have plenty of control authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem is lifting off: bases and rovers are supposed to be short and wide, which is the opposite of a good aerodynamic shape. I\u0027d just pack thrust to force my way through the atmosphere despite the drag. Another option, at least for parts like solar panels and drills, is to use Infernal Robotics (if it\u0027s working with 1.1.3, I haven\u0027t tried yet): put the panels and drills on long girders and use the Infernal Robotics hinges to \u0022store\u0022 them vertically during flight. Once you land, rotate the hinge so the girder becomes horizontal and parallel to the ground: the drills will be able to get to the ground below and the panels will not block each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T22:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually before all these...
