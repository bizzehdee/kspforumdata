Looking for some help please. Yesterday my new Steam Controller arrived. I bought it only after seeing KSP patched a plugin supporting its use. I am using the Squad recommend scheme for the controller and it mostly works great. However I cannot get action groups to work. Harvester\u0026#39;s update notes said left grip \u002B touchpads would access action groups in flight, but mine does not seem to work. Can anyone please explain to me how it works and what I am missing? Or lead me to a post or notes that explains the controls for them in greater detail.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour help would be greatly appreciated as I would like to live stream my initial impressions of playing KSP on the SC tonight, but will be unable to do so if I can not get this figured out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor reference if someone would care to explain to me. My test craft for this has the engines in action group 1, and solar panels in action group 2.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T21:08:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaotic_Daemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaotic_Daemon","CreatedById":153771,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T21:07:22Z","Content":"\nSo after reloading the Squad recommended controls I have action groups working.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWill be doing a Live stream tonight at 9pm Est reviewing the new Steam Controller with KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[SIZE=2]http://www.twitch.tv/chaotic_daemon\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/SIZE]\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T23:26:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chaotic_Daemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
