I took your advice and added two more Big-S Spaceplane Tail Fins. It\u0026#39;s now flyable but it\u0026#39;s still doing it. Enough that it\u0026#39;s thrown me a couple degrees off heading two minutes into the flight. [URL=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/A8Yn6IE.png\u0022]Here\u0026#39;s a screenshot[/URL]. These tail fins have a lift rating of 3.5, 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of deflection. There\u0026#39;s three of them total on a 65 ton craft and they\u0026#39;re as far back as they could possibly be. Surely this should be flying dead on like an arrow. Yet something is causing it to veer to one side.

If it is mounted above CoM (as they normally are), then using the rudder will cause banking in the opposite direction of the yaw direction.
