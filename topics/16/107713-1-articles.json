I know I could hit \u0022space center\u0022 and then go to the tracking station and go back to it, but this removes my option of hitting \u0022Revert flight\u0022 which I prefer to retain.\n\nIs there any workaround that doesn\u0027t limit my options? Is there an unofficial patch mod that fixes this? Because this isn\u0027t just annoying, this is at times a game breaking bug :/"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:37:17Z","Content":"If it is the same problem as the bug from back in beta, back to space center is the only fix.\n\nUse quicksaves instead of revert. It\u0027s better to revert back to just before you crash than all the way back to the start anyway"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:38:25Z","Content":"It\u0027s not ideal, but if you can click -anywhere- on your flight path (usually it\u0027s just a specific area I can\u0027t click on - usually *precisely* where I need to click) you can place a node there, then click on the white inner circle of the node and drag it where you want it to be."},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:40:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not ideal, but if you can click -anywhere- on your flight path (usually it\u0027s just a specific area I can\u0027t click on - usually *precisely* where I need to click) you can place a node there, then click on the white inner circle of the node and drag it where you want it to be.\n\nActually I couldn\u0027t even do that.
