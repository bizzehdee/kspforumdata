(usually by spinning the rocket very fast)\n\nOn a related note, the fairings will destroy undeployed solar panels (the uncased 2x3, 1x6, and gigantor) when the fairing is jettisoned.

Well, with one craft. I couldn\u0027t recreate it with other craft so I\u0027m not sure what exactly caused it. I had a fuel tank below the fairing and a decoupler above it (both the same size), and the fairing (also the same size) came almost straight out for maybe .2 meters before going straight up around my payload.\n\nI\u0027ve made fairings that are essentially the same before and since, and they don\u0027t have the problem.
