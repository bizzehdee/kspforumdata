For example, if I had a rocket with a liquid fuel engine in the center and two SRBs attached to the side. The SRBs would cutoff and detach before the liquid fuel rocket is done burning. What I\u0027ve been doing is calculating the full mass as the entire rocket and the dry mass as the rocket without its fuel and with the SRBs detached from the rocket. The ISP is the average ISP of the three engines. I was just wondering if my calculations were correct or if I should do it another way.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T23:59:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lethalparadox0**"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:38:51Z","Content":"The best way to do it would be to take the average Isp of the two boosters and the main engine, and use the mass minus solid fuel and however much liquid fuel is burned before the boosters burn out. That\u0027ll give you deltaV for that piece, and then you just find the deltaV after boosters detach, using however much liquid fuel remains, and add the two together."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:42:07Z","Content":"You should factor in your staging, since the proper formula is \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV = Stage1(Isp \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 9.8065) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Ln(M1/M0) \u002B Stage2(Isp \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 9.8065) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Ln(M1/M0)\n\nFor the first stage Isp, a very simple method of calculation is to do Isp = (((SRB1 \u002B SRB2)/2) \u002B LFO1)/2\n\nWhen you drop your SRBs, it changes your structural mass, which effectively changes both M1 and M0. \n\nIt\u0027s also true that your end readings can depend on your liquid fueled engine\u0027s thrust while the SRBs are firing. This will determine the amount of fuel left, which will effect your M0; something that changes with staging.\n\nBy using a 1 step calculation, as you suggest, the end result factors in the weight of the SRBs as part of M1 through the whole equation, even though they leave after a certain time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T22:08:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"lethalparadox0","CreatedById":144385,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:49:05Z","Content":"Is there a way to calculate how much liquid fuel will be left after the SRBs burn out?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T22:59:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lethalparadox0**"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T22:52:30Z","Content":"You have to treat each portion of the burn as a separate stage, compute the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv separately for each stage, and then add up the results.
