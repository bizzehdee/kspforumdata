I do it all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS has 2 functions: translating and rotating. Translation is for docking, rotation is for changing orientation. Thus, in such a station, balanced RCS for rotation-free translation is only necessary for each module individually as they are docking to the assembly. Once assembled, the station itself isn\u0027t going to dock with anything but just rotate as needed by solar panels and pointing docking ports towards incoming ships. You don\u0027t need balanced RCS for rotation, so for the station as a whole, it doesn\u0027t matter how the individual modules are arranged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the station probably won\u0027t necessarily require RCS to rotate anyway. Each module will have at least a probe core, probably also an SAS unit, and the juice to power them, for its trip to the station. Thus, the assembly will have scads of torque and the power to run it all automatically, and RCS will merely speed the rotation up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for station-keeping, I\u0027ve never found a need to do that. The thing will stay close enough to where you park it, provided you don\u0027t ram it with another ship. But should this become necessary, hit Caps Lock to get into fine controls. This turns on a stock RCS balancer, with which you can translate without (much) rotation, even with wonky asymmetrical stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo really, the place to worry about RCS balance is in the design of the individual modules in the configuration they\u0027ll be in during the docking operation. So build just that much of the module and then use the RCS Build Aid mod to get it balanced out. The current version of the mod shows the CoM with and without fuel aboard. It\u0027s thus quite possible to build the modules so their CoMs don\u0027t move at all regardless of fuel (including mono usage). Then you can put the RCS thrusters on to get perfect, rotation-free translation and know that will always be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T15:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(...)

And I worry about stationkeeping because of experiences with a station in Minmus orbit, which naturally comes with a very low orbit and a very low orbital energy/velocity. I noticed that the mere act of the docking collars sucking two crafts towards each other in the final coupling moment was enough to modify the opposite apsis by a two-digit amount of meters (depending on the size of the docked craft). And in an orbit of around 10,000m, that number may have been small but not insignificant over time and continued use.

Pure rotation doesn\u0027t move the CoM, so no translation. HOWEVER, if you\u0027ve got modules with RCS thrusters pointing every which way, then using RCS to rotate could conceivably result in some net translation forces. So when rotating stations, use torque or balanced (fine control) RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, due to KSP\u0027s wonky physics, you can created FREE translation from rotation by violating Newton\u0027s 3rd Law. The classic example is to put fuel tanks on opposite ends of a long central structure. One tank is full, the other empty. Start the assembly rotating. It will begin rotating around the CoM, which is off towards the end with the full tank. Now, as the assembly rotates, pump fuel from the full tank to the empty tank. This moves the CoM to the other end of the ship, and the ship will now rotate about that point. Because you have moved the CoM, you have moved the ship as a whole. It is therefore possible to move the ship through space by walking the CoM from the heavy to the light end of the ship at the same point in each rotation. Pumping fuel costs no energy and creates no opposing force, so apart from the energy spent to start the rotation originally, this is all free translation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you\u0027re correct about the effect of fine controls on RCS. With normal controls, the thrusters all fire 100%. With fine controls, they throttle themselves in an attempt to eliminate asymmetrical thrust. The system is not totally effective but it\u0027s pretty good. So, if station-keeping and rotating the station with RCS, I\u0027d always use fine controls, just to be safe. Of course, you\u0027re getting way less than 100% thrust this way, so it will be a slow process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T17:23:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I learned a lot today! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T17:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a number of stations in LKO as well as around the Mun and currently have a long term station in orbit over Minmus.
