I\u0027m planning on doing the Elcano challenge (circumnavigating a planet by ground or by boat), except I plan to do it with a submersible. It\u0027s gonna be a long haul, but before I run off trying to helm some massive sub, I need to plot my course. My problem is, as one could easily see from a\u00A0 map of Kerbin, there is no direct sea route to circumnavigate the globe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is this, then: are the ice caps of Kerbin solid? Would a submersible be able to travel underneath them?
