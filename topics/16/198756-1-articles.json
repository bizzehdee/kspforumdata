For example, you have a wild night, build an enormous rocket and randomly fire it towards Jool ONCE, and then tourists start appearing asking to go to Jool AND RETURN!!! I think there\u0027s a knack of doing easier contracts and simultaneously using their suggestions to guide you towards a bit more exploration. I rather enjoy refining and making as efficient as possible, the easier contracts. For example there will always be a flow of Kerbin tundra and Kerbin Kolniya orbit satellites. They are always going to be similar; so I\u0027ve made one design with a rocket underneath that I know drives nicely and does the job. Also I\u0027ve gotten good at fulfilling 2, 3 or 4 contracts with a single launch - thus, improving my time management and hopefully rate of progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quazarz","CreatedById":208584,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-16T20:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nright, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve noticed too, I\u0027m at a really happy place in my career where I\u0027m comfortable with the difficulty and I want to keep practicing with the equipment that I have in place so I don\u0027t want to venture outside of that quite yet. I\u0027ve actually been doing 8-10 contracts per launch - usually 16 tourists, a few rescues and debris collection, maybe a flag and/or science collection all at once. It took me a long time to set up the infrastructure but now I can launch for ~170k, do the whole tour in 60-90 real time minutes and come home with around 2mil in rewards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-16T21:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8-10 is good.

Only if I have need of a satellite that it asks me to do, like a resource scanning satellite when I needed one anyways. I take all of the tourist contracts that are high prestige until I have 16 tourists total\u00A0(one-star tourist contracts aren\u0027t worth the money for the crew space). Usually about half of the tourists want to land on the Mun, and half of them want to land on Minmus. Take all rescue missions for kerbals that are orbiting Mun or Minmus, with or without their debris. High value debris is good, as long as no more than 3 chunks total.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually before I disembark the tourists I\u0027ll run the science landers around Mun and Minmus to gather the rescued Kerbonauts onto the station. Then I launch a\u00A0rocket with a Mk3 command pod and Mk3 passenger bay (1 pilot, 3 empty seats, and 16 tourists). The rocket also has a cargo bay for each chunk of debris that is on the itenerary. Each cargo bay has a claw, and a cheap disposable drone that goes to fetch the garbage and bring it back. The upper stage of the rocket has enough fuel to rendezvous with the Mun base, then transfer from Mun to Minmus, rendezvous with Minmus base, and then land back on Kerbin. At the Mun base, I transfer all of the passengers that want to land into the passenger lander, take them down, then bring them back to the carrier. Send one of the drones to pick up any garbage (or garbage\u002Brescue) missions. Transfer rescues onto the homebound rocket. Then I transfer to Minmus and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this way, I can do a large number of tourist, debris, rescue missions without having to do a bunch of declines to get them all to line up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-16T22:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience, you get a few tourists that want to do solar trips, but most still want Mun/Minmus.\u00A0 I usually either combine the handful of solar orbit tourists with crew training flights or screen the contracts carefully \u0026amp; avoid those.\u00A0 When you go to any other planet, that\u0027s what really opens up the flood gates of tourists going further away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraktal","CreatedById":184990,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-16T22:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen tourists want to land on a world, do they want X distance within a specific point, or will any landing anywhere on the right world do the trick?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-16T22:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnywhere on it - which is handy.

If you did it before (and it performed well, and you saved it) then a small tweak then a launch is 5 minutes. Similarly, tourist flights - if you have a good design for a returning, pax carrying rocket, then a lot of time can be saved because the criteria aren\u0027t going to vary massively for different contracts. And of course, if you can combine 2\u002B contracts into one launch, then time and money can be saved there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022test at launch site\u0022 or \u0022test splashed down\u0022 are good because you can recover pretty much 100% of the hardware for money (so long as it doesn\u0027t blow up....)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T20:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223894913\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198756\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221608224229\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208584\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022quazarz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, quazarz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnoring the obvious fact that interplanetary contracts are always going to be more valuable than those within the Kerbin system, which contract types would you take to generate the highest return on investment?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll offer some possibilities:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to staff your space program with more than a few Kerbals, then rescue contracts are a good way to go because they give you people and pay you\u00A0for it, instead of the increasing-costs model for hiring in the Astronaut Complex.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t like the Kerbals that you rescue, then you can fire them and rescue others.\u00A0 There is also a refuelling mod called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/119480-19-kethane-plugin-and-parts-0103-now-with-background-scanning/\u0026amp;tab=comments#comment-2146207\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKethane\u003C/a\u003E that uses\u00A0a finite-resource model for refuelling, and\u00A0you can\u00A0stretch your supply with unwanted Kerbals and the KE-WAITNONOSTOP-01 Kerbal Unreconstitutionator\u00A0... though\u00A0I suppose that\u0027s not polite to talk about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart recovery and Kerbal recovery contracts can be made to work with some infrastructure by making use of vessels equipped with independently-controllable grabbing units and reentry gear.\u00A0 Launch the carrier--essentially a rack of decouple-able grabbing unit probes--once, and you have something standing by in orbit to recover however many pieces and Kerbals as you brought Klaws.\u00A0 I\u0027ve personally seen these with the capacity for\u00A0twelve, and\u00A0that is definitely not the limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsteroid capture contracts result in refuelling depots, which extend the service life of whatever existing infrastructure you have--including the vessel that initially performed the capture.\u00A0 Should you perfect your SSTOs and reusable transfer craft (I know that that\u0027s probably some ways off since you\u0027re a new player), your space program can stop\u00A0costing Funds entirely, except for those occasions that you need new rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quazarz","CreatedById":208584,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T21:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI appreciate the advice, but I think my system is better than anything else that others have mentioned here, and I think that the people who are commenting about tourist contracts being weak have not actually run the numbers.

Level 3 mission control says that it allows \u0022unlimited\u0022 contracts open, but not really since it only offers a certain number at a time. So three missions that are worth $500k each are worth much more than ten missions that are worth $150k each, assuming you can do them all at once. And suppose that they were all 10 rescue\u002Bscrap\u00A0missions. That would require at minimum 10 different rendezvous, and a rocket design that can fit 10 different items in cargo (volume wise, my 20 seat passenger rocket is only slightly larger than a 4-item cargo bay would be). And the reward would be significantly lower, extrapolating from the figures above. If the only thing I did was the five tourist quests and no rescues, that is: transfer to Mun, dock with the spaceport, landing, re-dock, transfer to minmus, dock with the spaceport, land, re-dock, and back home. The only extra effort is periodic fuel delivery, one payload of fuel from Minmus to Mun supplies 5 surface landings for the 10-passenger lander, and a fuel delivery to the Minmus station pays for about 12 landings. So, realistically, the most \u0022extra effort\u0022 comes from adding in the scrap recovery and rescue missions, but I find them valuable anyways for the extra kerbals and utilizing my cargo space more effectively.\u00A0I don\u0027t have to decline many contracts to get everything to line up, almost all 10 of those were the first contracts offered after I got back from the previous journey.
