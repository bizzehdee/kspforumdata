Since dV is based on the mass of the fuel (more is better, but with diminishing returns) by the lack of oxidizer (which reduces fuel mass) there is less dV. The exact mechanism by which this happens is the flow rate for LF is much greater now, not because NERVAs were nerfed, but because previously flow rate was split between the LF and the Oxidizer. If the whole tank were just LF (i.e the oxidizer storage converted to LF storage) the performace metrics of the NERVA would be similar to 0.90. Of course they are also heavier, which only compounds the perceived nerfing."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T05:53:23Z","Content":"At the very least they have more potential to become more efficient for super huge vessels."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T07:08:43Z","Content":"Well, not the Mk1 LF fusalages have a 9:1 mass ratio like all the other cylindrical tanks, so if you load up on Mk1 LF tans, you\u0027ll get nearly the same performance as before...\n\nexcept that each engine is heavier...\n\nSo what we really got was a TWR nerf"},{"CreatedByName":"KingPhantom","CreatedById":110881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T09:34:26Z","Content":"i\u0027m looking forward to get liquid fuel only 2.50m tanks. the orange one only with liquid fuel....\n\notherwise i will mod them for me! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CowsAreEvil","CreatedById":149339,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T08:24:35Z","Content":"If you are building a large ship \u0027Fuel tanks plus\u0027 is a mod that has liquid fuel tanks up to orange tank size.
