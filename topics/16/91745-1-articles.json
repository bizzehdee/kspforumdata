The current version is 14.4x so you will want to update it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext your craft has a very short profile and is pretty aerodynamically unstable, especially in the yaw category. I have to suggest you lengthen the craft slightly and add a bit more of a tail to it. Also check your numbers in the FAR tool in the SPH, check your AoA graph, and your speed graph at different mach speeds. Then check the numbers in FAR, if anything is in the red your craft will have some bad handling characteristics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you want numbers all green like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XCcn1lu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XCcn1lu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is at landing and take off speeds, .35mach\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is for mach 5 or near orbital burn speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DOrivBg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DOrivBg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enotice how the numbers are still in the green but they changed slightly? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the sign of a stable craft.
