This was necessary in order to get\u00A064bit support, and because Unity version 4 is becoming an unsupported legacy version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity is created by another company -- not Squad. So Squad has no direct control over that code. They can submit bug reports, but that\u0027s it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new version of Unity does not support the old methods for handling wheel and landing gear calculations. So there was no choice except to rewrite that code in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing you need to understand is that in KSP version 1.0, landing gear was basically indestructible. An LT1 landing leg could safely absorb a 100 m/s landing (I know, because I tested it). You could land\u00A0an LY05 landing gear sideways at 80m/s and there wouldn\u0027t be any problem with that. This was all very unrealistic, to say the least -- but it made playing the game much easier, obviously. Yes, this has changed, and is now much more realistic. Many whiny people say that it is not for the better;\u00A0because they don\u0027t want realism, they want things to always be easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, all landing gear types are affected, but in different ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany people think that rover wheels work better now than in 1.0.5. There are more settings now, and you have to tweak them to suit your needs. In low-G environments, you need to set \u0022Friction Control\u0022 to manual, and turn it up really high, for example. Rover wheels do not tend to flip your rover over nearly so easily now. Rovers tend to spin out now, instead of flipping. This is a good thing. Automatic friction control may have a few bugs, because it\u0027s automatic. Traction control uses the brakes to keep each wheel from sliding. In automatic mode, sometimes all this braking causes your rover to not have enough horsepower to climb hills, and you need to turn it off. We are all testing this stuff out, and nobody can provide you a definitive list on what settings to use for all occasions. One possible issue with rover wheels is that they may pop/break too easily now. Another issue is that people tend to \u0022clip\u0022 rover wheels when they design rovers. That is, they tend to use the \u0022move\u0022 gizmo to attach rover wheels in aesthetic ways.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDoing this will make your wheels not work.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe LY01 and LY05 landing gear are fragile and delicate now. Let me simply say that they are only rated for planes up to maybe 5 tons, and you have to take off and land\u00A0gently and slowly with planes that are designed to have a lot of lift.\u00A0These landing\u00A0gear are no longer indestructible. Treat them with kindness, or your pilot will be dead. Many players don\u0027t seem to be adjusting well to this new reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other retractable landing gear are very nice now, I think. They take big impacts. They hold a lot of weight. If you have a very light\u00A0or very heavy aircraft, then you need to adjust the springs for that. Lower for light, higher for heavy. Maybe the \u0022damper\u0022 settings are still buggy. You may need to adjust them to stop your plane from bouncing all over the place -- but there seems not to be any rhyme or reason to adjusting the settings, you just have to try it and see what stops the jitterbugging. They also have friction settings -- if set lower, you tend to slide. You can adjust friction in realtime. If you want to stop on a slope, you can set the friction really high. During landing and takeoff, you probably want it set fairly low (otherwise, your plane may veer or flip). Generally, you want higher settings for friction and brakes on the back end of your plane. The \u0022disable suspension\u0022 button does not currently do anything except change the visual display.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding legs have serious issues still. If you EVA and walk close to one, it may explode. This is bad -- everyone is in full agreement about that. The impact tolerances are pitiful, except for the very beefiest variety. They slide down hills. They slide UP hills. They cost too much for what they do. They weigh too much for what they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, if you are wise you will not use landing legs\u00A0at all. Use something else to land on instead\u00A0until the bugs have been fixed. I like to use swept wings. Or straight wings. Other people just land on their engine bells.
