The mission is \u0022Rescue Halger Kermin from Kerbal.\u0022 Now I am supposed to rescue this little guy out of orbit from kerbin. I have no problem with the ship, I have 2 capsules one obviously piloted and the other empty however I have gotten up to him multiple times and I can\u0027t take control of the kerbal to EVA him to my ship so there is no way for him to actually board. If there is any information you guys can provide that would be great!!L)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Matt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T22:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce your ship gets close to the Kerbal, press [ or ] to switch to him.

The correct way to do it is to save those missions until you unlock the claw, and bring those Kerbals back to the space center, where the ship can be recovered. The Kerbals should then walk to a waiting landed vessel that would complete the mission. This contract is meant to facilitate the learning of both orbital rendezvous and to help teach people [how] to land at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClaw didn\u0027t tell you this because it would seem like he just wanted you to do an overly complicated procedure so his name would be in your thoughts, but I saw through his veneer of humility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T23:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not nice to tease newbies, NFUN. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case there was any doubt, NFUN was joking.
