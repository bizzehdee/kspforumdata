(Don\u0027t worry, the devs are currently working on fixing that for the 1.1 update.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what you need is to simply adjust your staging sequence so that the parachutes are in their own stage. Do this by hovering over the staging list in either the VAB or while in flight. Tow buttons will pop up next to whatever stage you are hovering over, a \u002B and a -. \u00A0The plus add a new stage at that spot, and the minus deletes a stage, but only if it\u0027s empty. \u00A0So go to the top of the list, press the plus to get a new, empty stage, and then click and drag the parachute icon into the top (empty) stage. Note that if there are more than one of anything in the staging list in symmetry (denoted by the small subscript number on the icon), you have to click once to open the group, then click and drag any one of the group to drag the whole group to another stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s not the problem you\u0027re having, then a few screenshots would help bunches. \u00A0Ideally a few of them, one in the VAB, maybe one in space or on the launch pad, one during reentry when things get all explody on you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: \u00A0Forgot one thing. \u00A0The parachute icons can be a little tricky to interpret. \u00A0White icon in a grey background means that they are ready for staging, and that it is safe to do so. White icon in a red background means that they are ready for staging, but will be destroyed if you do. \u00A0White icon in a yellow background means they are ready for staging, and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be destroyed if you deploy them. \u00A0Cyan icon in a grey background means they have been armed (aka staged) but have not yet deployed (in this case they can be unarmed via the right click menu, placed in a\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Enew\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0stage, and staged again later). \u00A0Yellow icon (I think, can\u0027t remember this one for sure) in a grey background means they are pre-deployed. \u00A0Green icon in a grey background means they are fully deployed. \u00A0Red icon in a (either grey or red background, again can\u0027t remember exactly) means that they have been destroyed by aerodynamic forces. \u00A0At that point, they\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0be repaired by an engineer of sufficient level, provided that you don\u0027t smash into the ground before that happens \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.
