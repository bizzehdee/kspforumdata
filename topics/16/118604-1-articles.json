Quite the opposite. Sounds like your problem is you\u0027re coming in too steep for your reentry. Come in shallower, make multiple passes if necessary instead of doing it all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as to your question....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasic heat stuff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Heat only moves from hotter things to colder things. \u0022Cold\u0022 doesn\u0027t move, it is merely the absence of heat, and a magnet for it. When you put hot beer in a cooler and dump ice on it, the heat from the beer goes into the ice and heats up the ice, causing some of it to melt. Because the beer has lost heat, it is now colder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The rate at which heat moves from hot to cold things is affected by the surface area - to - mass ratio of the objects involved. Thus, a thin, wide, flat object will gain or lose heat faster than if you had the same mass but wadded up into a cube. Radiators use this principle by being thin, wide, and flat, trying to get as much surface area as possible. But for heat to \u0022radiate\u0022 out of a radiator, the radiator still has to be hotter than its surroundings, so the heat moves from the hot radiator to the \u0022cold\u0022 surroundings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Combining these fundamentals, you see that if a ship is hotter than its surroundings, and has a radiator, then the ship will lose heat through the radiator to its surroundings. And because the radiator is losing heat faster than the rest of the ship, it becomes slightly colder than the rest of the ship, so heat from the rest of the ship gets sucked into the radiator and then lost to the surroundings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* This is why radiators should be detrimental during reentry. During reentry, the flames surrounding the ship are hotter than the ship, so a radiator would suck heat up from the surroundings and pump it into the rest of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T16:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose it could be realistic if you only put radiators on the back of the ship or in shielded areas.
