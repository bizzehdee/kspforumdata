For interplanetary flights i usually use the thermonuclear engines, because they are by far more efficient out of atmosphere than any other engine (about 2 - 2.5x as fuel efficient). Therefore i am using a very unusual way when starting: my rockets go up straight at about 15-20km, then going at about 60 degrees east. Then the first stage is empty when at about 50km, but with enough speed to reach 70km easily (usually the rocket will go up to about 100-130km) and all parts from the first stage go back to kerbin surface. From 70km height i start the nuclear engines, which take a LONG time to reach a good orbit, depending on weight. When reaching a mostly circular orbit altitude is at about 160-180km. Therefore 200km is a good height. The usual starting way (turning to east at 5-15km and trying to reach a low orbit as soon as possible) leaves me with a far longer time in the atmosphere, where the nuclear engines are inefficient and sometimes dont have anough thrust to get the rocket out of atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne reason not to go too close to kerbin: max warp speed. Since i usually dont use mechjeb, i often have to wait at the station until the optimal time to start interplanetary travels. Therefore maybe a \u0022waiting station\u0022 at about 600-800km would also be useful - first refuel close to kerbin, then go to about 800km to wait.
