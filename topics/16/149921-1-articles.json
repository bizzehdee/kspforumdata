Kind of how kerbal engineer works? I thought I saw somewhere that 1.2 would have that and that it would be enabled in the debut menu. Not sure if that\u0027s true but its one of those \u0022stock\u0022 things that really should be implemented into the game without mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T00:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, not really. The only new thing there is that you can get the \u0022altitude\u0022 \u00A0of the ground at a specific point, using KerbNet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
