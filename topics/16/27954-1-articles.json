Using these, I can see a potential problem. KW has two different types of fairings: regular and expanded. Regular fairings do not increase the diameter of a rocket. To use these, you need to place a fairing base. These act as decouplers, so there is no need to add another one. The other type is called expanded fairings. These slightly increase the diameter of the fairings, allowing you more space to use. In order to use these, you must first place an expanded fairing base between your payload and your LV. These also act as decouplers. As far as the space issue is concerned, try using the expanded fairings or increase the base size. For example, increase from a 1.25m base to a 2.5m base. If all else fails, you can always design your own fairings using fairing factory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T04:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way is to search for some youtube videos on using these fairings and watch them to learn how to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
