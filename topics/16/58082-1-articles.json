I created a return rocket that would carry two science modules attached to the mk1 pod. Each module of course has parachutes to bring them back. I am also using Realchutes mod and Deadly Reentry, all latest version as of this posting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is multiple recovery of science modules possible in KSP 0.23?

The chutes cause the pod to flip around allowing me to decouple that module which had Science Jr. on it. Once that was decoupled I activated chutes on module with Goo containers module and decoupled after chutes deployed. Finally I deployed chutes on the mk1 pod and waited for it to full open. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I was coming down I still saw all the modules and was watching the chutes. The Science Jr. module was the farthest away but then disappear from view and my game. I check Targetron to see if it was still there but it didn\u0027t show. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pod chute fully opened now and watched the Goo canister modules come down and the chutes fully opened. I recovered pod just as pod hit water and the Goo module part was still coasting down. I went in Space Center and to Tracking Station Facility to hopefully recover that other module that was about to land in water, but it wasn\u0027t there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I do something wrong? And is there special procedure to do, that allows all recovery of those sciences modules that I missed? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had much experience doing this, done it once in KSP 0.22 with just one module part and it seemed to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help you guys can give me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T01:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen an object gets more than ~2.4 km away, it just disappears if it below 20km in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"therealcrow999","CreatedById":19331,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T01:43:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo they disappear from game and can\u0027t be recoverable? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the Goo module part?
