I begin seeing reentry effects, and I am pretty sure that is increasing drag by a ton. What should I do. Ascend higher to get out of the atmosphere?"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T22:23:20Z","Content":"As far as I can tell, the ram heating is just heating. The only real aerodynamic effect that depends upon speed is the sound barrier. I\u0027m pretty sure Mach 1 is slower than 600m/s at that altitude, but don\u0027t quote me on it."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceToad","CreatedById":63992,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T23:32:30Z","Content":"600m/s is Mach 1.763... Roughly Mach 2. I\u0027ll attach pictures of the phenomena I am experiencing soon.\n\nEdit: Mach 1.763 at SEA LEVEL. This would mean that due to the thinner atmosphere, it would be higher, but given the phenomena we would assume I am going faster than Mach 1. Pictures will be added soon.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T23:35:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceToad**"}]}
