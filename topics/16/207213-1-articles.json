There is not enough power. Each of the three consumers requests 1 but receives 0.667, so none of them work. The communotron is offline, the control station is offline, and the science experiment is offline. Ergo, the fact that they show as connected but unpowered is perfectly normal, and the fact that you have no control signal is perfectly normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you say you can undeploy any one of them and the situation doesn\u0027t change? That sounds less normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you undeploy the seismometer and leave the control station, solar panel, and communotron deployed?

Don\u0027t even bother waiting for it. You don\u0027t need a Kerbal present to operate the equipment. Once deployed, it operates by itself. Everytime an experiment collects (I think) 10% worth of progress, it auto-transmits as soon as it can find a valid signal path home.

The only exception is the passive seismometer, which requires you to actively crash stuff into the planet/moon/whatever Dres is to get data; a few well-aimed transfer stages can do that for you without much trouble- this was done by several of the Apollo missions with the third stage of the Saturn V to get readings from seismometers deployed by previous landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-12T17:31:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2022 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by jimmymcgoochie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
