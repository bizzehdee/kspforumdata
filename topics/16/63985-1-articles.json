This gives your landers better control over the rate of descent of your ship which is vital to perform hovering maneuvers and emergency take off in case your landing is not going the way you want it. Also placing your engines at the side lowers your center of mass, if you stick one large engine under your lander it may be too tall which is a problem because you can tip over after landing. With this simmetry you can place your fuel around your lander providing a mor stable low center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very important because descending on planets or moons with at least 1G or roughly the same gravity of Kerbin requires higher thrust/weight ratio. On lower gravity bodies you can get away using less engines, even only one below your center of mass.

A succesfull landing requires that the retrograde marker stays right under your ship center of mass (the bottom of your ship). If you are descending and the retrograde marker is not there you have to point your engines to that marker and fire until the marker moves right under your ship.
