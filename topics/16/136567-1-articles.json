But that \u0022shaking itself apart\u0022 stage would have to happen at some point, and your parts would not just be floating around disconnected like that but flying off in chunks in different directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T14:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was some motion involved - my lander can was spinning at 100 rpm somehow and when I came out of time warp I briefly saw a crew G limit notification from the deadly re-entry mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did transition SOI from Kerbol to Duna - could that cause it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T09:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222505966\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136567\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460284546\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not something that happens.

In the end, one probe was thrown out in an exploded cloud of parts but I managed to release the other two and (eventually) get them back on course to make their own way to Eve orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
