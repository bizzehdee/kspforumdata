Any resource ones?"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:05:15Z","Content":"I notice that you mention \u0022long range scanner\u0022 and \u0022medium range scanner\u0022, but I don\u0027t see you mention \u0022surface scanner\u0022 or \u0022biome lock\u0022.\n\nHave you used the surface scanner? There\u0027s a feature that you can\u0027t get accurate information from the orbital scanners for any given biome until you \u0022unlock\u0022 that biome by taking a surface scan there. (This is by design.) The usual progression looks like this:\n\n1. Put a satellite with the medium-range scanner (the big clamshell thing) into a polar orbit so that you can see the orbital map. This gives a general overview of what the resource density is, but it is only an *average* for each biome, and won\u0027t tell you what the concentration is at any given spot. If this is what you\u0027re working from, you\u0027ll get a rude surprise when you land, because the actual concentration will likely be quite different. (At this stage, using the hi-res scanner is useless.)\n\n2. Use that map to identify which biomes have high average concentration. For any biomes that interest you, land a little lander that has the surface scanner on it, and click the \u0022run analysis\u0022 button. This will \u0022unlock\u0022 that biome, and now the orbital map will give actual concentrations that you can use for planning where to land your miner.\n\n3. Ignore the hi-res scanner, it\u0027s pretty much useless. Yes, it will give you a hi-res piece of information for any given location (after you\u0027ve unlocked the biome), but there\u0027s no way to save that information or do anything useful with it-- for example, it doesn\u0027t update the orbital map, or anything useful like that. Unless it gets redesigned, it\u0027s pointless.\n\nThe other thing to be aware of is that resource mining depends on engineer skill level. Put a high-level engineer on the ship, and it\u0027ll mine ore fairly quickly. Don\u0027t have an engineer (or try to mine unmanned), and it will mine very very slowly."},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:10:15Z","Content":"Also I think areas near the poles tend to be more inaccurate due to pinching effects."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:15:25Z","Content":"I think op is talking about 1k ore in half a second... that should be by no means desired behavior regardless of concentration/engineer.

Maybe I didn\u0027t notice the fast rate on minimus.\n\nI did sometimes use the surface scanner, but I wasn\u0027t sure what it did, and didn\u0027t look at the orbital map after using it.

Maybe I didn\u0027t notice the fast rate on minimus.\n\nOkay, that makes no sense-- it\u0027s not possible to \u0022deplete\u0022 an area of resources in KSP, they\u0027re infinite. Is it possible that you accidentally timewarped or something?\n\n(Also, just a side note, it\u0027s \u0022Minmus\u0022 and not \u0022Min**i**mus\u0022)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E None of these ships were manned.\n\nYeah, that will be a problem. Mining is *super* slow if you don\u0027t have an engineer on board. Put an engineer on those craft. The higher the engineer\u0027s level, the faster it will mine.\n\nAnyway, I think this answers your questions:\n\n- if the problem is \u0022mining is too slow\u0022: put an engineer on board\n\n- if the problem is \u0022mining rate is inconsistent with what the map says, so I can\u0027t find a good place to mine\u0022: use a surface scanner to scan the biome"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T03:27:53Z","Content":"I think it must be one of my mods. I repeated the experiment in several areas on Pol and each place I landed allowed me to extract about 1k to 2k ore almost immediately, and then it dropped down to the near-zero level. Almost like it was designed to do that. \n\nI too thought that vanilla KSP does not deplete areas...\n\nOnly, I don\u0027t think I have installed any mods to change how resources behave, but you never know."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T05:50:08Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen the \u0022instant ore fill\u0022 posted a couple times, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve seen any reproduction steps (which I may have missed).
