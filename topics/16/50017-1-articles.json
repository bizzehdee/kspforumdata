The Isp would be impoved too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E140 tonnes is within the capabilities of Temstar\u0027s Supernova asparagus booster, so yes this is doable. Still going to be tricky, but not as tricky as before. Good suggestion, el_coyoto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Looking at the Supernova, it\u0027s 12 stacks at 4 X200-32 tanks equivalent. 4STOa with three stacks in the center and the outboard boosters released in triplets. There\u0027s a stack of 1.25 meter tanks in the center feeding into the triple stack. Rebuilding it exactly would be tricky but you could set up something similar. It would definitely get you into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange, I\u0027ve had troubles with the lil\u0027 cubic connectors in the past and switched to tail connectors for this kind of tricks because they seemed WAY more stable on my rockets and felt less cheaty (they have a mass). I don\u0027t use part clipping in this instance and simply grab them, rotate so they are correctly aligned and place them. I don\u0027t even strut them to the booster. Rocksteady stable...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used \u0022Editor Extensions\u0022 and vertical snap in this case, but I\u0027ve already used tail connectors without vertical snap and no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only precaution I take is strutting every fuel tank to the tank below to make the booster very stiff. It might be your problem : too much thrust and the fuel tanks start \u0022dancing around\u0022 because of the high thrust\u002Blow stiffness if not strutted, thus messing around with the tail connector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar problem yesterday when I worked on the \u00221000 m/s left in the central booster left when in LKO\u0022 and the added thrust required me to add struts to the tank on which the connector\u002Bengines were connected to avoid engine wobble...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T13:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be how I\u0027m trying to place them. Last night I got them attached to the sides of the X200-32 tank and the game didn\u0027t want to let me put the next tank on top. I had to turn on parts clipping to get it to finally work, and that\u0027s probably what ultimately caused the third stage meltdown I had. I plan to try again and put girders on the central stack this time around, just to get a little more space in between the tanks this time.
