and accuracy.\u00A0 It was made this way to force you to spend a lot of time and effort \u0022ground-truthing\u0022 with the surface scanner.\u00A0 It works like this:\u00A0 As \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/154251-bewing/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022

varies by biome.\u00A0 But the Orbital Scanner doesn\u0027t show biome boundaries and in fact pays them no attention.\u00A0 It instead takes a large region\u00A0of the planet\u0027s surface, usually containing multiple biomes, and averages the overall ore concentration based on the proportional surface areas of the biomes in that region to determine the base color.\u00A0 Then it displays that area of color at like the \u0022center of mass\u0022 of the overall Ore distribution within the region.\u00A0 As a result, small biomes with higher concentrations get averaged down to nothing if surrounded by large areas with no or little ore.\u00A0 And if you see isolated dots of color on the resource map, you can be 100% certain (unless they\u0027re on an island in an\u00A0ocean) that those dots are not where the best ore is.\u00A0 In fact, it\u0027s usually not even the best place to start looking for it.\u00A0 It\u0027s therefore not surprising at all to read of your experience above.\u00A0 It\u0027s fairly typical, although a worse than average.\u00A0 It just goes to show the complete uselessness of the Orbital Scanner and why it\u0027s so much better to use SCANsat instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you stay stock, however, you can help yourself by knowing something about Ore distributions.\u00A0 The system is set up so that biomes with highest elevations have the most ore, those with the lowest above-sea level elevations have the next most, and the biomes in between usually have little or nothing.\u00A0 Within a given biome, the local amount of Ore will also vary from the biome\u0027s average with slight elevation changes within the biome.\u00A0 Driving around with a surface scanner will quickly show if Ore gets better or worse going uphill or downhill, so then you just look around for the highest or lowest acceptably flat spots within the biome.\u00A0 So, you can usually just remember which biomes have best ore on the flattest ground closest to the equator and just send surface scanners there, skipping the useless orbital scanner entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd FWIW, IMHO Vall is a better place to get fuel than Pol.\u00A0 Pol is way far away so the trips down to Laythe take forever (several weeks), especially due to having to wait a fair portion of an orbit to do the plane change, and the transfer windows are infrequent as well.\u00A0 And while landing and launching from Pol doesn\u0027t need much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, the long trip and the capture burns at each end do.\u00A0 Plus, Pol doesn\u0027t have much Ore.\u00A0 But the worst thing about Pol is that its collider is messed up so it\u0027s not uncommon to hit the \u0022ground\u0022 and die during your descent while still 2-3km above the actual surface.\u00A0 Vall, OTOH, is conveniently located between Laythe and Tylo for short, economical trips with very frequent windows and no plane changes, even if landing and launching there are more expensive.\u00A0 And\u00A0Vall\u0027s Lowlands are nice and flat, equatorially located, and have more Ore than Pol does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-20T23:01:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

The first is based on your \u0022resource abundance\u0022 slider. Each biome on every celestial body has a \u00221 minus this percentage\u0022 chance of having no ore at all. If that first chance passes, then there is a second coin flip to determine the average ore concentration in the biome. This second chance is based on your game difficulty level. It is important to understand that this abundance can easily also end up \u0022less than zero\u0022 -- so in a hard game, with a 50% resource abundance setting, you may still only end up with ore in 25% of the biomes on all the celestial bodies together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLocal random variations are also applied to the ore concentrations within a biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223622350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561049015\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nskipping the useless orbital scanner entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides always having found their scans to have been of some value in the past, my orbital scanners are also strong relay sats which, working in tandem with a station, help to provide adequate comm coverage for the surface of a planet/moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223622350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561049015\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd FWIW, IMHO Vall is a better place to get fuel than Pol.\u00A0 Pol is way far away so the trips down to Laythe take forever (several weeks), especially due to having to wait a fair portion of an orbit to do the plane change, and the transfer windows are infrequent as well.\u00A0 And while landing and launching from Pol doesn\u0027t need much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, the long trip and the capture burns at each end do.\u00A0 Plus, Pol doesn\u0027t have much Ore.\u00A0 But the worst thing about Pol is that its collider is messed up so it\u0027s not uncommon to hit the \u0022ground\u0022 and die during your descent while still 2-3km above the actual surface.\u00A0 Vall, OTOH, is conveniently located between Laythe and Tylo for short, economical trips with very frequent windows and no plane changes, even if landing and launching there are more expensive.\u00A0 And\u00A0Vall\u0027s Lowlands are nice and flat, equatorially located, and have more Ore than Pol does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVall always has more ore than Pol??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, in my career games, \u003Cu\u003Eeverywhere\u003C/u\u003E gets a station, a mining base, a base lab, a fuel/ore hauler, a runabout, a rover, a scanner etc. etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth Pol and Bop are used to supply Tylo station and Vall is used to help supply Lathe station.

do the initial orbital scan, you have only a very vague and highly inaccurate picture of the real ore distribution and per-biome values.\u00A0 This is because the Orbital Scanner\u0027s resolution is poor both in terms of geographic area AND in estimating the Ore that\u0027s in each biome of that area.\u00A0 The per-biome estimates can be off by about \u002B/- 10% and, given that very few places in the solar system have even 14% Ore, that\u0027s enough error to make the Orbital Scanner essentially useless.\u00A0 But as you later go in with Surface Scanners and ultimately the NBS, you learn hard, exact data on what\u0027s where.\u00A0 You learn not only the average Ore within the different biomes you look at, but also the specific (and almost always somewhat different due to local elevation) Ore values at the specific points within biomes where you drive a Surface Scanner or point the NBS cursor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as you Surface Scan or NBS, you learn the true average Ore concentration of various biomes.\u00A0 And the heat map algorithm already\u00A0 knows\u00A0where those biomes are so it can do its averaging.\u00A0 But\u00A0now it has true\u00A0average\u00A0biome values to work with instead of the usually inaccurate estimated biome values from the original Orbital Scanner map.\u00A0 Thus, the heat map\u0027s averaging algorithm now uses the known values of the biomes you\u0027ve actually ground-truthed along with the original (and usually highly inaccurate) estimates for biomes you haven\u0027t yet ground-truthed.\u00A0 If the original estimates for the biomes you have ground-truthed were on the low side, and those biomes exist in multiple places (or cover large areas) of the the planet, then suddenly the heat map will show dots where previously there was nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is all totally normal behavior.\u00A0 That\u0027s how \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022

countless times so knew which biomes have the best Ore available in the flattest, most equatorial locations on every planet, but then took a few months off and forgot some of the exact details, doing an Orbital Scan can refresh your memory.\u00A0 So there\u0027s that.\u00A0 But otherwise, it\u0027s only purpose is to enable the heat map.\u00A0 You only learn actionable intel\u00A0from the Ground
