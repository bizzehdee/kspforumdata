I know i can usually just swing around and get another angle on it, but as it stands it seems to be cluttering up my UI more than it\u0027s doing any help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know if there\u0027s a way to toggle this feature off? I\u0027m not against toggling alarm clock off completely on a save temporarily if that\u0027s the only way to fix it. I just can\u0027t seem to find an option or mod for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022X9MRtuX.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002262.83\u0022 height=\u0022644\u0022 width=\u00221025\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/X9MRtuX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
