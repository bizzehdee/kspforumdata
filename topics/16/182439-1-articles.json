As such, when launching due east from said equator, you gain 175 m/sec of bonus velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunching due north, you don\u0027t actually get a 90 degree orbit; you get something like 85-ish degrees inclination. This is because, while you\u0027re adding northwards velocity... you\u0027re not cancelling out the eastwards spin of Kerbin. To actually get a perfectly polar orbit, you have to launch slightly west of north.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunching due west, not only do you lose the 175 m/sec spin advantage, you have to pay it all over again just to hit zero horizontal velocity. As such, it\u0027s a 350 m/sec penalty to launch west.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt a higher-latitude site, you start with less velocity from Kerbin\u0027s spin, all the way down to zero were you to launch from the poles. This can help when launching to polar or retrograde orbits, as you have less eastwards velocity to cancel out... but it is a hindrance if you do want to go for an eastwards or mostly-eastwards orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne other significant advantage of equatorial launch sites is the ability to access low-inclination orbits without plane-change maneuvers. You always return to the last place you made a maneuver. So, if you make your ascent-to-orbit at 40 degrees latitude, even traveling due east, your resulting orbit will have at least one point at \u002B/- 40 degrees latitude, meaning an inclination of at least 40 degrees. While there are multiple tricks to make this less of an issue, it\u0027ll still always be a fundamental limitation: no equatorial orbits without some sort of dog-leg or plane-change maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is part of why the real-world Korou is a fairly attractive launch site; being dead-on at the equator, Korou not only gets a substantial benefit from Earth\u0027s spin, but it also minimizes the plane-change to get to geostationary Earth orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-25T07:18:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for confirming.
