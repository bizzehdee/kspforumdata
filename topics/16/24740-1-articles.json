I\u0027ve set up maneuver points, executed the burn, and suddenly the orbital path indicators go haywire. Everything settles down if I add a bit of \u0022warp\u0022 but when I come out of warp and then try to fire engines, or turn sas on and off...nothing. Engine and sas control stops responding. Happens when I go back to the last save point as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve confirmed that my warp time is 1 as well when I try to make course changes or fire engines/engage sas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a clue as to why? Noticed it happens on Minimus as well when I take a rover out for a test drive to see how it handles.
