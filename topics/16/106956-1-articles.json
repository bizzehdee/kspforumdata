It is near the runway at KSC I\u0027ve tried many planes or rocket designs but the best I could achieve never got higher than 6000m.\n\nDo you have any idea ? I\u0027ve been trying to do that for three weeks but now I\u0027m out of ideas.\n\nI\u0027m using KSP 1.0 with no mods.\n\nThanks !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T21:21:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Irvin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Irvin","CreatedById":142757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:13:18Z","Content":"Ok I finally did it !\n\nI used a rocket, I couldn\u0027t manage to get a plane flying into orbit with such a payload.\n\nMy best plane design was this, the highest altitude it could climb to was only 6000m:\n\n![screenshot3.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-plTFQsT2roA/VUaJ658ma8I/AAAAAAAAKwg/hxjxePZWofY/w768-h480-no/screenshot3.png)\n\nI\u0027m using a small dedicated rover to move the asteroid on the KSC runway and attach it to my planes/rockets:\n\n![screenshot11.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P0jd_9zatFo/VUaJyOkErlI/AAAAAAAAKuE/VbqM0TQJLuY/w768-h480-no/screenshot11.png)\n\nSo I gave up with planes and switched to rockets and it was much easier this way, I used a Kerbodyne S3 14400 as a counterweight, the rocket design is very basic with asparagus staging, it has tons of reaction wheels and RCS thrusters but nothing more:\n\n![screenshot10.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LOrF0AL15fQ/VUaJw4LR6FI/AAAAAAAAKt0/deBVg2nymxQ/w768-h480-no/screenshot10.png)\n\nI launched from the runway as it was easier to move the asteroid on a flat ground. \n\nI had **A LOT** of failed attempts:\n\n![screenshot13.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lCzTwjFCGUI/VUaJyuCNSiI/AAAAAAAAKuU/F3XaNj_CTdc/w768-h480-no/screenshot13.png)\n\nThe most difficult part was to find the right balance of fuel to move in the counterweight to be able to control the rocket at high speed. The rock drags like hell and I was a bit stupid to put an aerodynamic top on the counterweight but finally I found the right amount of fuel to move into the counterweight:\n\n![screenshot55.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-P8jrYbYncKU/VUaKJ9pkIQI/AAAAAAAAKz8/9uOSvyBVCzQ/w768-h480-no/screenshot55.png)\n\nI\u0027m no Scott Manley and it was very difficult to control this thing:\n\n![screenshot59.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AbFxXOpcYi8/VUaKMIgRFOI/AAAAAAAAK0k/SruyUnoNWXg/w768-h480-no/screenshot59.png)\n\n![screenshot62.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-s7OasLdA2lo/VUaKN_HPBoI/AAAAAAAAK00/ExXaHREqG6w/w768-h480-no/screenshot62.png)\n\n I even had to move back some fuel at high altitude as the rocket was pitching down, believe me it\u0027s not easy at all to click on the fuel tanks while keeping this thing on its trajectory !\n\n![screenshot63.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--1vczd0NfGo/VUaKOhVR45I/AAAAAAAAK1I/8wlEhY0Kyu8/w768-h480-no/screenshot63.png)\n\n![screenshot64.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UmBxaf6Rckw/VUaKO111O8I/AAAAAAAAK1Q/BOijWf7_D0I/w768-h480-no/screenshot64.png)\n\nIt starts to look good:\n\n![screenshot67.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tjG0F_Z_tjQ/VUaKQbXK4XI/AAAAAAAAK1g/HZCffBGadcA/w768-h480-no/screenshot67.png)\n\nAnd finally, my orbit sucks but I did it !\n\n![screenshot78.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-V8woiHN5840/VUaKW_awhjI/AAAAAAAAK3E/eunUfE8_EJk/w768-h480-no/screenshot78.png)\n\n![screenshot77.png](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-F8WwSpBOeTk/VUaKWW4978I/AAAAAAAAK3I/2m8vTX63TkY/w768-h480-no/screenshot77.png)\n\nMaybe it\u0027s useless to put an asteroid back in orbit but I\u0027m very proud of what I did ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nDo you think it would be worth to start a challenge about this to see what other people can do ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:21:35Z","Content":"That, I suppose, is the recourse when people refuse to make with the funds for landing an asteroid because you didn\u0027t redirect it.
