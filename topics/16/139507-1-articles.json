What you described and what I describe are BOTH suicide burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT, to do a efficient suicide burn, you need to burn most of your fuel as low as possible from the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou suggested to cancel your orbital speed then fall down vertically* : this is very inefficient, I agree with you\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI suggest to do the lightest reasonable** deorbit burn, then fall down (mostly horizontal)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n* This is even not a good option for new players because it\u0027s quite difficult to escape from a vertical fall when you discover that your landing spot is not great (high slope). If you\u0027re more horizontal, a light radial burn will quickly offer you another spot for a low dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n** If you\u0027re too shallow you have more risk to hit ground features before your targeted landing spot. The most efficient deorbit burn would be when you PE touch ground on the other side of the body you want to land on (180\u00B0). But doing that, your nearly sure to crash into something before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually target ground around 120\u00B0 from my deorbit burn. If terrain is harder, like Bop, it\u0027s more like 60\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
