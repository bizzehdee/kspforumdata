I foolishly forgot to save my screenshots, but it\u0027s a small thing. My motivation was this: I\u0027d put a handful of addons in, including the FusTek station parts, and discovered terrible lag in the VAB when on the \u0027pods\u0027 tab - especially if my camera was facing the door. As long as the pods tab wasn\u0027t selected, the lag wasn\u0027t too bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it got much worse. In orbit, I was getting increasing lag, to the point where it just wasn\u0027t all that fun. I deleted the FusTek parts I wasn\u0027t using, hoping that would somehow help. It didn\u0027t. As I wasn\u0027t sure what was causing all the lag, I decided to start fresh, and find a balance between cool addons and playability. Thus begins my experiment to see how many toys I can put in my toybox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFresh install addon list:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 (Despite it being HUGE, there\u0027s no perceptible lag in the VAB.

Something in the FusTek station pack did for me. If I delete parts I never use from their respective folders, will that reduce resource demand? Or it is unrelated? I\u0027m not sure which the culprit is: plugins associated with addons, part count of a ship, a specific addon, a specific combination of addons, my early 2009 PowerMac, or a combination of them all. I\u0027m really looking for the empirical feedback that might ensure my continued enjoyment of the game until Apple releases the new PowerMacs in the fall. Are there specific things I can do to minimize lag while maximizing use of fun addons and the rich look of the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-28T07:19:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2013 07:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Moencino\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T20:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moencino\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moencino\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think that\u0027s it.
