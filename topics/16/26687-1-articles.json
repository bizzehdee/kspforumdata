So I get the problem with that they won\u0027t even take off.

But I kinda have problem when understanding when to choose the small tanks and when to choose the big tanks with big engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, lets say I calculate my payload to be 10 tons. To get a successfull lift-off I would then need enough thrust in the early stages to be able to lift 10 tons, but I would also need enough fuel to run those engines til I get into orbit. But that means I would have higher mass, and I would need even more thrust to get up - which leads to requirement of more fuel. So the question is, how do I find the point where I have enough thrust and enough fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you start by calculating the thrust required and choose engines accordingly?

For taking off from Kerbin (and landing on / taking off from other worlds), however, you want to make sure \u003Cem\u003Eat a bare minimum\u003C/em\u003E that your engines can provide enough force acting to push the rocket up (\u0022thrust\u0022) to overcome the force that the gravity of the body in question exerts in trying to pull the rocket back down (\u0022weight\u0022). The number that measures this is your \u0022thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022 (often abbreviated \u0022TWR\u0022), and can generally be figured out in a few easy steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Take the maximum power values of all the engines that will be firing on takeoff, and add them together. This will give you the total thrust for your first stage in kilonewtons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Find the total mass of your rocket in tonnes. (It\u0027s assumed that the mass values for all parts in KSP are given in tonnes -- or megagrams, which are exactly the same measure, if you\u0027re anal-retentive about making sure everything is in proper SI notation.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Plugging these in to Newton\u0027s second law (Force = mass * acceleration, or F=ma) and solving for acceleration will give you the initial maximum acceleration your vessel has. (This value will go up in flight, because burning fuel reduces your mass.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Once you have that value, divide it by the surface gravity value for the body in question. (Kerbin\u0027s is 9.8m/s^2, same as Earth). The final value will be your rocket\u0027s TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. If your TWR ends up being less than 1, then you can either reduce the weight, add more engines, or use more powerful engines, or any combination of the three.

I don\u0027t remember the equation for that offhand, but it\u0027s a bit more complex than just dividing the total Isp by the number of engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the two things that tripped me up when I was learning the equations myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can understand your reluctance to use mods, but I\u0027d advise that you use Kerbal Engineer myself while you\u0027re learning, although if you\u0027re adamant about not using it then don\u0027t feel like you have to. Do the math out longhand yourself first, then compare your results with the totals that the Engineer gives you. They probably won\u0027t be perfect matches, but if they\u0027re pretty close, then you can satisfy yourself that you know what\u0027s going on. If they\u0027re way off, then either you probably didn\u0027t account for staging correctly (again, remember that for asparagus staging, each time you drop a set of tanks you need to start the math all over), or you\u0027re getting the order of operations wrong for the equation (which means you should have paid attention to your algebra classes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ). That\u0027s what I did -- I worked out the math myself before I even put the Engineer chip on the rocket, until I was satisfied I understood the equations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
