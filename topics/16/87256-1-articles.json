In the beginning there were only ships (and their wreckage) and the label \u0022flights in progess\u0022 dates to that era. Then a year or so ago we got the ability to plant flags which don\u0027t fit the old label.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still, there are essentially 2 main types of objects in the game. Permanent stuff like planets and transient things, most of which are created by players (ships, debris, flags, Kerbals floating alone in the infinite void, etc.), but now also asteroids randomly spawned and despawned by the game. All these transient things are referred to as \u0022ships\u0022 or \u0022flights\u0022 and the game handles them in more or less the same general way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, whatcha gonna do? If you don\u0027t like everything lumped under \u0022flights in progress\u0022, do you replace it with a more accurate (though uninspiring) but still catch-all label like \u0022stuff in space\u0022? Or do you clutter up the screen with multiple specific labels like \u0022Kerbals, ships, and debris\u0022, \u0022flags\u0022, and \u0022asteroids\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MerlinsMaster","CreatedById":112079,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T08:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYea, the solution is to update.
