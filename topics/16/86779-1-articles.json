Achieving 70km and then Altering your orbit from 70km to 80kim is more efficient than achieving orbit of 80km...technically. However with those numbers it\u0027s minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere it really matters is if your trying to achieve a higher orbit, let\u0027s say 1000km. Pushing your apoapsis from 0 to 1000km and the circularizing is the same as flying straight up to get an orbit. Your fighting gravity. However, circularizing just out of the atmosphere and then burning on the prograde, which will be on the horizon, to raise your orbit is much more efficient because your burning laterally and not fighting gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T13:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the most efficient way to get into an 80 km orbit, is to go into an 80x80 orbit directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr a 80x70km orbit, and then burn at apoapsis to turn it to 80x80.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like any other hohman transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor practical purposes, just split burn pointing at the horizon until your PE is at 70km (use a maneuver node so its half before, and half after apoapsis).
