Sometimes I feel restricted to only use retrograde/prograde - but\u00A0always try the others.

To get a closer flyby, first get an encounter with the planet you are heading to. Then make a maneuver node and focus on your destination. fiddle with the nodes and see how your flyby is changed - then do it with the actual\u00A0engines. If it\u0027s too hard to memorize what you did with the node, then just use the actual engine for it. Tiny burns like the ones you will use barely take and fuel, just remember to quicksave so you don\u0027t accidentally un-encounter and can\u0027t get back to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for getting back to Kerbin from flybys - pretty much the same thing - trial and error. Find out the transfer angles and stuff and then just wing it. Just like I said with the rocket size, don\u0027t try to make things refined or super efficient - there will be time for that later. Just get your Kerbals and their precious science back to Kerbin.
