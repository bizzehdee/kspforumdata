I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve unlocked everything in the Tech tree and I just accepted a mission to perform pressure measurements on and above the surface of Eve. Getting to Eve is no biggy, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m having trouble designing an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cairplane\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s able to reach 4 mission-waypoints/landmarks (on different altitudes) without running out of fuel. The waypoints are relatively close to each other, within a radius of say, 10-20 km.\n\nSo, in my first design I wanted to build something that:\n\nWas Light (less drag)\n\nHad Lots of Delta V (so I have room for errors.. lots of errors)\n\nHad small wings (we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need huge wings in this dense atmosphere) \n\nHad a Low TWR (because we can swim through the dense atmosphere)\n\nI ended up making a small Ion plane, using 2 ion engines, 2 type A wings, some flaps, a small reaction wheel and a drone core. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any pictures of the plane because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m at work. The plane flew perfectly during several tests runs on Kerbin.\n\nWeight, 1t \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 1.5t\n\nDelta v, 10km/s\n\nTWR, 0.2 on Eve (0,34 on Kerbin)\n\nThe results were very disappointing.. due to the high gravity, the plane wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t able to climb to higher altitudes at all! And with a maximum velocity of 30m/s this mission would take many (rather boring) hours to complete! I guess I need more TWR to counter the high gravity of Eve.\n\nHow did you guys design your vessels for these \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cscan missions\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 missions on Eve?I I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very curious!"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T11:55:52Z","Content":"You\u0027re right with the TWR. 0.2 is abysmal. I\u0027d suggest going for about 0.6-0.8 for better performance.\n\nThe Delta-V is good.\n\nI have done these missions by a network of refuelling stations (Parachute dropped orange tanks \u002B Karbonite mining), and a spaceplane to do the job. Except for the stellar costs, it had no drawback at all. The mission would go like LKO =\u003E refuel =\u003E Eve orbit =\u003E land =\u003E refuel =\u003E ascend =\u003E refuel =\u003E go back\n\nI abused the density of eve\u0027s atmosphere to have an aerospike to get the plane moving at .5 TWR\n\nMaking that flight with one craft is badass, but too damn hard.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T12:01:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by InterCity**"},{"CreatedByName":"mckamx","CreatedById":116032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:08:00Z","Content":"If you are open to non-stock, the Firespitter electric engine can allow you to build an infintite delta-V flyer that works on Eve.\n\n![z868PZQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/z868PZQ.png)\n\nThis particular design has a top speed of about 120 m/s, and a ceiling on Eve of about 20km, but can take off and land on a dime."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T12:13:53Z","Content":"That, or you can give [Karbonite](http://bobpalmer.github.io/UmbraSpaceIndustries/) a try. It has intakes and karbonite jets that also work in Eve\u0027s atmosphere. You can refuel with a drill \u0026 converter when landed, so you can use it for all kinds of other contracts there.\n\nKarbonite is also very similar to what will come in KSP 1.0 as a resource system.\n\nOf course you could as well make a classical rocket-based plane, but the dV would be very limited.
