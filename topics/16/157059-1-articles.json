Burning prograde or retrograde is much more effective when you are going fast in the first place. It is hard to launch a ship directly into a very low orbit by hand, but since you are using MechJeb, it should be easier for you. If you leave Kerbin from a 72km x 71km orbit, you will be going nice and fast when you burn, so you will have good Oberth. During your journey, as you make small burns to get to your target planet, make your burns very carefully so that you will have a very low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E when you arrive.
