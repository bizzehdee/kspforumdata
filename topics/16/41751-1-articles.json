There isn\u0027t too much difficulty in making the flyby but returning with no propulsion systems so that it gets close enough that it could enter into a decaying orbit of Kerbin, as the original probe either burned up in the atmosphere after returning from the moon or orbited for a time undetected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions or thoughts on how I might accomplish this, with purely stock parts and no additional mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T09:12:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 09:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by gc1ceo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T09:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry searching for \u0022free return\u0022.
