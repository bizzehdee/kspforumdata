It did NOT state to build a new ship and I have a circular orbit around kerbin (and have sped u p time to go around once). Is there a minimum time limit in game to achieve this? I\u0027ve done other tourist contracts that worked ok. Not sure what the problem is.

I split two kerbals (1 in pod 1 in K\u0026amp;K module) and both had a suborbit/orbit checkmark on their journey. Only the one in the pod checked off. Has anyone else noticed this? I find this weird considering that the contracts to support 11 kerbals in space etc.. check off fine when using K\u0026amp;K.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mrcarrot","CreatedById":176291,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-17T15:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223196073\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166575\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508109228\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179100\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chatyakksp\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/15/2017 at 6:13 PM, chatyakksp said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a minimum time limit in game to achieve this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo minimum time limit.
