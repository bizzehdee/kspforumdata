In the first image, you can see the original. I can simply throttle\u00A0up with no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the craft will get on plane with no more effort from me and it\u00A0will do 24 mps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the second photo, is the exact same craft except I have used autorstrut on all the parts and removed the original struts. It barely gets to 22 mps and will not get on plane without me actively controlling the trim. It also wants to bury its bow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal engineer tells me the autostrut variant is just under 1000 kg lighter. The original is 87767, and the autostrut version is 86867.\u00A0 So thinking the balance was off, I added some temporary weight to the craft, bringing it up 87867 (so only 100 kg difference), but that had no effect.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand in principle that you can strut to a grandfather part, heaviest part or root part, but I don\u0027t understand how that actually affects the physics in KSP. I wonder if my routing, which really had little rhyme or reason, is a factor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: I did not turn on rigid attachment since my experience so far is craft seem to get very brittle, but that is probably lack of experience on my part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nORIGINAL WITH STRUTS:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OeyDkxv.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OeyDkxv.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAUTOSTRUT VERSION:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sjtqygF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sjtqygF.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-29T22:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a wild guess which came into my mind: maybe autostruts will reduce the bendability of your craft more than regular struts (especially since it looks like they connect to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of the parts instead to somewhere on the surface) but your craft may needs some slight bending to operate properly. Just a minimal offset of the thrust vector to lift the body a little bit out of the water. So, you can try to reduce the amount of autostruts to a minimum or slightly rotate the engines (so the thrust will slightly push down the rear end).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-29T22:47:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2018 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 4x4cheesecake\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-29T23:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that in the 2nd version, your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E moved downward vertically.
