I decided that this was the perfect time to design a completely new ship... a two-part lander, something I\u0027ve never done before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually, my landers are a single part, with nothing left in the Mun\u0027s orbit. What I\u0027m trying to do is develop an Apollo-style craft, with an orbiting service module and dockable/detachable lunar module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis always works pretty well until a certain point. Once I\u0027m in orbit, I decouple the service and lunar modules, hoping to turn the service module around and dock it with the lunar module. What keeps happening, however, is that the decoupler stays with the [now detached and freefloating) lunar module... specifically, it stays right on top of the module\u0027s docking port, making it impossible for me to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way around this that I simply haven\u0027t seen yet?
