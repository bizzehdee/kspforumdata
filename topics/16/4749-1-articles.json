Without modifying anything, the first stage would be only using the solid boosters. After pressing space, the solid boosters get detached and after another press of the spacebar, the liquid fuel boosters would do their job. Can I modify this thing to let it use both its fuel boosters and solid boosters at the same time, but let it drop the solid boosters once they are empty?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sordid","CreatedById":535,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-21T17:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClick the engine icon in stage 5 and drag it down to stage 7.
