This is my first post and first question I have not been able to resolve with Google or trial and error. I am hoping someone can shed light on my conundrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP largely with unmanned probes. I\u0027ve sent kerbals to Mun and Minmus and returned them to Kerbin successfully, but in both cases I used a lander that was also its own return vehicle, i.e. it landed with enough fuel to return to Kerbin (barely - but that\u0027s another story \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to start experimenting with a tug/transfer stage from which a lander can detach and then return to, but I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to do this with an unmanned probe. It\u0027s to the point that I wonder if it simply can\u0027t be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI modified one of my standard probes with a docking port on its top, and placed one on the transfer stage as well. I successfully did a flip in orbit, undocking from the launch configuration and redocking for transfer, a la the Apollo LM before TLI. I then headed out to the Mun and undocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I can no longer find my transfer stage. I can see it visually, but I can\u0027t control it, take control of it, or find it in the Mission Tracking screen. Undocking from it pretty much rendered it a spent stage as far as KSP seemed concerned, even though I didn\u0027t actually stage - I undocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy hypothesis is that a decoupled stage is only \u0022active\u0022 or \u0022useable\u0022 if it has a kerbal on it - i.e. leaving a pilot in the command module while Jeb goes down to plant the flag. I haven\u0027t tested this yet as I\u0027m very protective of my kerbals, having not yet lost one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone shed light on this?

I think you\u0027re seeing a combination of two issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When you undock two ships for the first time, KSP tries to figure out what type each section should be. Your stage probably got classified as debris, which isn\u0027t shown on the tracking screen by default. Right-click on the \u0022debris\u0022 button near the top of the tracking screen, and you should see it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You cannot control *any* vehicle unless it has either a manned command pod or a probe core. Did you remember to add a second probe core to the transfer stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that you only need to solve the first issue if you just want to rendezvous and dock with the stage.

For manned vehicles it\u0027s usually useful to have an okto or RGU as well so you can control the ship when/if the Kerbal(s) are on EVA.
