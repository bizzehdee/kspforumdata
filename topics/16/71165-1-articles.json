Ideally the intakes behind the CoM too. KSP\u0027s dumb aerodynamics model has drag increase with the square of velocity, but lift only increases linearly with velocity. At high speeds, \u0022drag parts\u0022 can overpower \u0022lifting surfaces\u0022, even if its skewed in the other direction while at low speed and altitude. It took me a while to realize that my planes weren\u0027t flying well, and were unstable on reentry, because of the massive amount of drag from open intakes mounted ahead of the CoM. For every ram intake you have ahead of the CoM, put a radial equally far behind the CoM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* At least 3 intakes per jet engine.

The biggest factors to consider when building a spaceplane is you need to factor in your TWR ratio at all stages, unlike a rocket which you can get away with slapping the biggest booster you can on it and blowing it into orbit. Ideally you want to be going well above 1000m/s before you switch over to your rockets and be between 22-30km altitude. I prefer to be going in excess of mach 5 before I switch over, so momentum does most of the work. My airbreathing stage is usually a TWR of 1.5-2.5:1 and my rocket stage is rarely more than 1:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start by climbing as fast as possible to 18-20km before leveling off for speed. At that altitude I try and maintain a positive climb rate but nothing to drastic, usually less than 10m/s. And I try and accelerate as fast as possible during this time on the airbreathing engines. Once I hit 25-28km altitude my airbreathers start to run out of air and are going so fast that they start to lose power. At that point I gradually pull up and increase my rate of climb to about 20-30deg, and switch over to rocket engines, and shutdown the airbreathing engines. I also close my intakes at this time to make sure there is as little drag as possible on the airframe. Once I hit my target AP, usually 100-150km I shutdown the rocket engines and wait till I am around 65km before I maneuver into position for the circulization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T21:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, I don\u0027t think 3 intakes is spamming... 12 is though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETriple your intakes, and you triple the air you get, which means you can fly in 1/3 the air, and thus 1/3 the drag - when you have a perapsis while still flying on jets... you\u0027ve done too much intake spamming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the SSTO designs i see that perform really well make heavy use of intake spamming and part clipping, I don\u0027t do either (assuming 4:1 intake ratio is not spaming, and I use more radials than ram intakes, because... as I said, no part clipping for me)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T21:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t consider myself very experienced in building spaceplanes but I have very good experience with making my planes fly higher and faster.

Moving a few parts the tiniest bit can make a huge difference, and with enough screwing around and/or green bodies on the tarmac, you will start to get a handle on how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once you\u0027ve got a plane that works, keep changing the design and going for personal altitude/speed records. Start with a tiny plane and one turbojet so that when it flames out you don\u0027t lose all control, and try to get it as close to flaming out as you can without going over. Then change the design a little and see if you can move that flameout line a little higher. With 3 ram intakes per turbojet you can cruise at minimal throttle at, if you\u0027re super careful, up to 40km and still be picking up speed.

Most rocket engines can be used to build SSTO rockets, and some of them can even carry reasonable payloads to orbit. Jet engines can be used to increase the payload fraction significantly, but reaching orbit becomes harder and takes more time. Wings increase the payload fraction a bit more and make the ship more fun to fly, but designing it becomes much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T10:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Osprey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Osprey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Folks,\u003Cp\u003E... to hit 1000m/s at 20km in horizontal flight, then ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want 1900m/s at 35km, not 1000m/s at 20km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbojet, several highspeed air intakes, and an adequate TWR = win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERapier works, too, but I find Mixx of turbojet and Airspike to be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T11:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Osprey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Osprey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.

Beyond 3 intakes, you need to start doubling them to see much effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fuel: Around 150 unts per TurboJet (or roughly 1 Mk-1 fuselage worth of fuel per TurboJet) - Minimum of usually 100 units per TurboJet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Wings: 0.5-1.0 lift rating per ton - Maximum of 1.0 lift rating per ton. Minimum is a bit misleading because you can build VTOL with 0 lift rating, but generally no less than 0.5 for standard space planes. Less is better if you\u0027re going far with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose aren\u0027t perfect, and as you get better at design and flying you can stretch them a bit.
