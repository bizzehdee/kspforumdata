Too many billions of configurations of spaceplanes that might maybe not be quite right yet still kind of fly to some degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral thoughts after seeing many many people asking why their planes fail:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Instability happens because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is too close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, sometimes happening as fuel drains. Some people seem to think the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E should be aligned; no. No. That is exactly how to MAKE a plane unstable. You do it for fighter jets, not for anything you want to be able to take your hand off the stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Some people seem to like to fly planes without a vertical tailfin... don\u0027t be doing that unless you want flat spins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If you\u0027re stuck in the atmosphere for a very long time, maybe you just don\u0027t have enough thrust and need more jet engines. Or maybe you need more lifting surfaces because you\u0027\u0027re having to pull back 30 degrees to stay level. Again, pictures are vital to getting help with your specific plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Delta wings with no canards. These planes are usually heavy at the back, then people put the control surfaces half a metre behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and wonder why they have no pitch control. Got to give them some leverage and have a good distance between the control surfaces and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IronMaiden","CreatedById":193062,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-03T23:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223713008\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190137\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221575410910\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022127483\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n51 minutes ago, eddiew said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Instability happens because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is too close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E, sometimes happening as fuel drains.

Spaceplanes are very sensitive to drag. The closer you can get your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E to your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E while maintaining stability the better. This requires less angle of attack and less wing area to remain at level flight, resulting in less drag.\u00A0If you have your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E in the center of your fuselage then there\u0027s no problem with having a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E right on top of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, the tail plane will easily dominate pitch torque. In fact, I prefer my space planes have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E in front of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E at low angle of attack, that way it will naturally tend toward nose up and require less control surface deflection to stay at level flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
