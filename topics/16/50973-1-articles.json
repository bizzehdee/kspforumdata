Thing is people are used to landing legs either working 100% and not compressing, or breaking off entirely, thus you could hold a lot of mass on just a few legs. With compression to worry about you\u0027ll have to add more legs to get no noticable compression. In lower gravities however it shouldn\u0027t be very noticable, but it\u0027s something new to get used to and take into consideration during design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy example just on the launchpad was to take a X200-32 fuel tank (18 tons full) with probecore, batteries and RTGs, and then LT-2 Landing Struts. With 4 struts one leg was entirely compressed and the tank tilted over, but no actual damage. With 6 the tilt was noticable, not too bad with 8. Not until I had 12 struts around the tank was it unaffected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, I don\u0027t feel that it\u0027s a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to alter the part files though to potentially remove the functionality alltogether, or strengthen the legs so that they don\u0027t compress as easily.
