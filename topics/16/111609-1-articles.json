With RCS and SAS for stabilization I was able to get it into a high elliptical Kerbin orbit. Once the RCS fuel ran out every time I would turn on thrust the asteroid would just spin. The contract requires I get it to a Mun orbit. I disconnected several times and grabbed the asteroid in a different place but still all I do is spin. Would a bigger ship work? Add tons of RSC fuel? The asteroid is clearly larger than the ship.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T19:20:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Invader Jim**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T13:05:18Z","Content":"That is because you are possibly thrusting aside from the centre of mass wich causes a spin.\n\n To resolve that problem\n\n1) Right click on the asteroid\n\n2) click on \u0027target centre of mass\u0027\n\n(now you sea a purple marker on the navball)\n\n3) right click on the Grabbing Unit\n\n4) Click on free pivot\n\n( you can now change your direction of your vessel without turning the asteriod)\n\n5) move the marker on the navball exactly on the purple prograde target marker\n\n6) when you are exactly on it, right click on your Grabbing Unit\n\n7) Click on lock pivot\n\n8) THRUST!\n\nPrograde target marker:\n\n![90px-Target_prograde.svg.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/1/14/Target_prograde.svg/90px-Target_prograde.svg.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T13:26:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ferdoni**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T13:10:28Z","Content":"Rockets.

I\u0027ve had best success by telling them really tragic stories, like how some poor Kerbal got off his Eve lander to get a surface sample, only to discover the lander had no ladders so he couldn\u0027t get back in it, or how a Ground Tour ship was nearly home after a 10-year voyage only to be eaten by the Kraken within sight of Kerbin. It has to be something like that, and it has to be true, too. They remain unmoved when told about how you forgot to open a probe\u0027s solar panels or install an antenna on it, and they can tell when you\u0027re lying or passing off somebody else\u0027s tragedy as your own ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T15:36:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Always pull the asteroid with free pivot instead of pushing it.
