It consisted of just the following components:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Command Pod Mk1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mk16 Parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. TR-18A Stack Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. FL-T200 Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously with this set up I\u0027m not even trying to get into orbit. I just wanted to predict what the velocity of the rocket would be at the exact instant that the burn ended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used this formula,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evf = (Thrust/m\u0027)*ln((mtotal)/(mtotal-m\u0027(tf)))-g0*tf\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI calculated a tf of 14.6 seconds which is roughly consistent with when the burn ended during the actual launch. Using the above formula I calculated a vf of 963.76 meters per second, whereas my rocket\u0027s actual velocity peaked at about 363 meters per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo was the discrepancy caused by drag, an error in my calculations, or something else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T01:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes....you\u0027ll loose most of it to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~15 sec at 9.8ms-2 will see about 150m/s lost to gravity alone.
