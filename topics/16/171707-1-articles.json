Upon an EVA on Minmus I attempted to do the routine science experiments. All equipment in the craft worked well but when I right clicked Valentina and clicked on surface sample no dialog appeared and the button disappeared entirely. I tried to do my EVA report and got the same result and now the only button left is Plant flag and I can\u0027t get the others to return... I really need help on this one.. Thanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-06T00:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if this is a bug, do you have the appropriate facilities upgraded at the space-port?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-06T14:59:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat OS/Platform are you on, and which version of the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
