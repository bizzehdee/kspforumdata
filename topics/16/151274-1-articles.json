Put them on the fuselage or as close to the fuselage as possible and then use the translation tool to move them outwards to where you want them. You can use struts to make the wings or the whole plane stiffer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example; look at the craft below how I\u0027ve placed the weels; the weels are actually placed on the wings but they appear to have been placed on the engine nacelles (side pods). This thing is rock-solid under take-off (took me 3 iterations and a lot of time to fix the landing gear issues on that plane, but finally I\u0027ve got it right... Wheels are seriously broken (bugged) in KSP right now, but it is possible to get it right if you tweak it alot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/148649-12-compact-mk3-single-stage-to-anywhere-with-mining-rover-update-0211/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the center of gravity is important, so you might want to try shifting them forwards or backwards. Finally, try using bigger / heavier landing gears, each landing gear has a certain maximum load after which they will start sliding around the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-02T09:45:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2016 09:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Chris_2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bdyer","CreatedById":160721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T13:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using the snap to grid to get the wheel perfectly aligned in the front. \u00A0My current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E craft is 48 tons on the runway and is very solid/doesn\u0027t bend. \u00A0I havnt tried a heavier wheel base because thats\u00A0a lot of extra payload. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve experimented with the spring strength and dampen strength and havnt made it work yet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SingABrightSong","CreatedById":158346,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-02T13:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222834755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151274\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478093850\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160721\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bdyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Bdyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using the snap to grid to get the wheel perfectly aligned in the front. \u00A0My current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E craft is 48 tons on the runway and is very solid/doesn\u0027t bend. \u00A0I havnt tried a heavier wheel base because thats\u00A0a lot of extra payload. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve experimented with the spring strength and dampen strength and havnt made it work yet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be able to turn off angle snap while attaching them, but turn it back on to align them using the translation gadget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpring/damper probably won\u0027t help much.
