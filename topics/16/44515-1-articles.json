Making them Kerbin-return capable is a good idea as a \u0022safety measure,\u0022 but isn\u0027t strictly necessary, especially if you have a preexisting space station in orbit. Then you can use your Mun taxis to shuttle kerbonauts between the station and the Mun\u0027s surface (with refueling when necessary) and Orion / Soyuz style capsules moving crew between the station and Kerbin. I\u0027d definitely also include a probe core, so you can fly them manned or unmanned as the mission dictates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy rovers fit nicely under Rockomax tanks, but I want to send out more than one per mission.
