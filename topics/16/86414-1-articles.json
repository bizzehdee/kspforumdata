I have some contracts which say deploy parachute or test rockets etc and give conditions which must be met before completing the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the conditions (for the parachute tests) is to have speed between 380-580m/s...As you meet the various conditions of the contract they get ticked off and untick if the condition is no longer applied, but I can\u0027t get the speed indicator to light up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainly because I have no idea how fast I am travelling. I can\u0027t see an speed/airspeed indicator anywhere in the HUD in either external view or IVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I can see the vertical airspeed indicator next to the altimeter at the top of the screen but, I can\u0027t read any details of it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing...please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T01:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a speed readout at the top of the navball. It\u0027s the small green text, and it should have either \u0027surface\u0027 or \u0027orbit\u0027 displayed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface represents your speed relative to the surface of the body you\u0027re currently orbiting/landed on.

For example, low altitude but high speed. You might have to go past the target altitude, turn around and thrust downward so you can reach the target speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note, while the part must be activate through staging, it doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t use it beforehand. Through action groups or right-click menu, you can use them before the conditions are met as long as you still get to \u0027activate\u0027 the part through the staging when the moment come. Useful for the testing of large engines and Solid Rocket Boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Furthermore, on the navball. Clicking on the speed will cycle trough the available reference points. It always start with Surface and will switch to orbital as you reach a certain altitude. If you have an object or a body targeted, the relative target velocity can also be displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceScott","CreatedById":124906,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T06:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
