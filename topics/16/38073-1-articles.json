Yes there are magical numbers. Those are called limits, and they come from math formulas, they aren\u0027t pulled out from thin air. If you draw curves of efficiency vs. what altitude you start your gravity turn at, and efficiency vs. the angle of your gravity turn and you optimize those functions in a 3D graph, you\u0027ll come to a conjunction point in which the two curves come together in a 3D space, that\u0027s called the most efficient launch profile. Yes, every craft will have a different most efficient launch profile, but it doesn\u0027t move much, and if you round the value, you\u0027ll come up to 10km grav turn at 45deg 95% of the time. So yes, there\u0027s magical numbers, just as terminal velocity is the magical speed to not go faster than if you won\u0027t want to waste fuel. If that displeases you, get angry at maths and make your own 3D graph.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheebsta","CreatedById":74167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T12:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lammatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lammatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enevertheless thinking those value as magical is nonsense.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure NASA just throws them suckers up there all willy nilly like and hopes they make it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJ2yqga7IrI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nasakev","CreatedById":72681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-22T16:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn what part of the launch plan do things go pear shaped?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome thoughts: Consider replacing the LV-T30 with the LV-T45.
