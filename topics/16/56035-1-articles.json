It\u0027s still in the development phases right now I\u0027m tinkering with the actual size of the different parts and screens that will be required for this. I may need some assistance with programing of this device but for now I still need to get the actual components in place before I can do anything else. If you are interested let me know I doubt it will ever be mass produced but I wouldn\u0027t mind making a few dozen of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop View\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=15rk4r9\u0026amp;s=5#.Uqs5wOIemHg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=15rk4r9\u0026amp;s=5#.Uqs5wOIemHg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi39.tinypic.com/15rk4r9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215rk4r9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFront View:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=31291qc\u0026amp;s=5#.Uqs59-IemHg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=31291qc\u0026amp;s=5#.Uqs59-IemHg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi40.tinypic.com/31291qc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002231291qc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-13T21:46:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2013 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mustanger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T18:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to gameplay questions, where you\u0027re more likely to get helpful responses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mustanger","CreatedById":96356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T18:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just had it there because I did it specifically for Kerbalkon \u002713 but thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T18:49:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOOOOOO interesting idea, might I make a suggestion and make the joystick slot circular?
