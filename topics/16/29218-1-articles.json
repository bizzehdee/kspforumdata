Though there is less drag force involved, so hard to tell whether the jolt would overall be milder or worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sturdiness of your lander design is an important variable here. What kind of landing speeds can you withstand? If you need a very low landing speed to survive, it may be best (depending on lander mass, planet and altitude you\u0027re landing at, and Isp of your engines) to do a powered landing, or a combination chutes-and-powered landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd note that aerobraking is a different thing entirely than landing with parachutes. Aerobraking is skimming through the upper atmosphere to reduce your speed from interplanetary velocities into a captured orbit (technically called aerocapture), or to slow down from a high eccentric orbit to a lower more circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-26T05:22:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2013 05:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M5000","CreatedById":57096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T12:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tavert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tavert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour terminal velocity will be higher on Duna than on Kerbin, so you\u0027ll probably actually be moving faster if you deploy the chutes abruptly.
