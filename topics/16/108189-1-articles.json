The problem is in the mechanism used to make experiment results into data. RoverDude didn\u0027t seem to account for multiple labs per vessel when he wrote the interface changes. The \u0022convert to data\u0022 button works no matter where an experiment is stored on a vessel and doesn\u0027t include a way to specify, so it will always send it to the same lab and ignore any others. I don\u0027t see any easy work-arounds in the interface logic, so this is probably how it\u0027s going to be for the forseeable future.\n\nIf you still want to cheese it, this works: Store all the experiment results in one lab with an EVA. Review them and convert them to data. After the conversion they pop up again with the green and blue options for keep and transmit, keep them all. When all the processing is over, use and EVA and take the data back out of the lab. Walk or fly it over to the other lab nearby (but not docked), store the experiments in the lab and repeat. Once all the labs have their data buffers full you can dock them back together if you want and they\u0027ll work.\n\nThat said I don\u0027t see the point. I have several labs on the go on the Mun and on Minmus. Just the science I collected en route and on landing for each was enough to fill the buffers, and I left off the materials bay for engineering reasons. After I converted it to data I just transmitted it all. Once the buffers run down a bit lower I\u0027ll have rovers landed nearby to go get new data from nearby biomes and keep it all running. As it stands I recheck each lab in turn after a typical Mun or Minmus mission and I have 20-40 science per lab to transmit. The downside is all the Kerbals I have on semi-permanent assignment, but they were mostly rescues anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"van_dell","CreatedById":139073,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T18:34:09Z","Content":"I had the same problem, and found another partial workaround: I emptied the lab with the full data storage of kerbals so it became inoperable. This way, I was able to fill the other of 2 labs on a station where I previously had been unable to. However, not all experiments could be researched. The \u0022big\u0022 ones (over 150 Science from Minmus in Minmus orbit) still didn\u0027t register, even if I had plenty of free data memory at the time. I was able to fill up the second lab to 494/500 or something like that. Hope this helps someone for whom undocking the lab is not an option."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:02:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... Once the buffers run down a bit lower I\u0027ll have rovers landed nearby to go get new data from nearby biomes and keep it all running....\n\nI know the output of the lab decreases over time, does the amount of data stored decrease too?\n\nI have a lab in Minmus and, like you said, the lab was full to nearly 500 after collecting science around Minmus and one biome or so. I\u0027ve continued to store experiments from 6-7 other biomes in the command module attached to the lab thinking I could process those experiments into the lab to keep the output up. Is this possible?\n\nIt would be nice to have a way to split the experiments up. I hope I haven\u0027t screwed up by storing numerous biomes worth of experiments in one module because now they\u0027re stuck together - there\u0027s no way to take some of them out and leave the others behind."},{"CreatedByName":"BluetoothThePirate","CreatedById":75760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:33:44Z","Content":"As the lab runs, the stored data goes down and the stored science goes up (five times as fast). The conversion rate is based on the stored data so it slows down over time. Yes, you can hold on to those experiments in the command pod for as long as you like and process them when there\u0027s room.\n\nThe best part is that once you\u0027ve processed the experiments into data, you still have them. So you can take them to another lab or return them to Kerbin or transmit them and get their original science payout. The one thing you can\u0027t do is process the same result in the same lab twice."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:39:02Z","Content":"Making an outpost with more than 1 lab is not pointless. You just need to make them seperate vessels. Do not connect them to each other but just keep them side by side. Then lets say you have a science report on your kerbal and 5 labs. You can just use that same science report on all of the labs before you send it back to kerbin and get maybe 10 times more science out of it in the long run."},{"CreatedByName":"lodger","CreatedById":126565,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T10:20:45Z","Content":"Sorry to bring this topic up again. See, I understand the limit issue. But I have just a single lab in Minmus orbit, there\u0027s no science stored in the lab yet.
