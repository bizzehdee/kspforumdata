Besides, the space is tight; finding these decouplers in there for rightclicking is a pain. A docking port is not an option, because it would obscure the engine; the decouplers stay with the mothership. And if I hit a space - well, I still have fifteen left ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) The whole idea is to scatter them all over Eve to visit as many biomes as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T11:08:03Z","Content":"An one sided docking port will undock, but will bot re dock, you can use them as recoilless decouplers even."}]}
