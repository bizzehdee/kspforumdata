Now I have this cute, beautifully flying, little jet that I want to send to Laythe. I remember the 0.23 features video where they showed sub-assembly loader being able to get aircraft from the SPH to the VAB to be attached to a booster.

I then load it in the VAB, rotate it vertical, strap on whatever boosters and launch clamps I need, save, and I\u0027m good to go.
