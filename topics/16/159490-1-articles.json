To finetune my design, I practice reentries from very low orbits, cca 160x160 km. Until I\u0027m about 80 kms high, everything goes well. Then, in a few seconds, my main engine starts overheating like crazy, and eventualy explodes. Then It\u0027s smooth sailing again. I don\u0027t understand why the engines overheats, It should be properly shielded by the craft and aerodynamic surfaces, and the gauges also don\u0027t show the temperature growing very much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QJ4tdHF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QJ4tdHF.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nengine overheats significantly, while still showing temperature under 300K\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WWo5PKP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WWo5PKP.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven with high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, it overheats and explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm I doing something wrong?

Either because there is some separation between the shielding parts or the engine is clipping through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother points to consider: The internal temperature is low, but how is the skin temperature? Its possible that the overheating is caused by some mod that simulate malfunctions , meaning that you are overstressing the engine in some way? Its this issue affecting only that craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T17:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk being a former \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E player, and a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E/AJE player now...
