Just barely enough for the ends to meet, at the edge of the sphere of influence.\n\n- Go back to your apoaxis.\n\n- Detach your probe. Use its RCS to put it in polar orbit. (seriously, at the edge of SOI you need like 15m/s of dV, and with a lightweight probe that\u0027s nothing. The nice thing is there\u0027s an infinite number of polar orbits, so unless you want to go fancy (with sun-synchronous or the likes) you\u0027ll get any of them from any place, far Apoaxis is just extremely cheap. Burn retrograde for aerobraking (the normal/antinormal burn has raised your periapsis, again, this will be like 0.5m/s.\n\n- Wait for your ship to enter the equator latitude - the farther of the ascending/descending nodes of the equatorial orbit. Burn to put it in equatorial orbit; it should still cost very little if you use the farther node. If both nodes are very close, burn at apoaxis to move one of them far (e.g. enter near-polar orbit as well). Note, these are all radial-anti-radial burns. Burn retrograde for aerobraking (the normal/antinormal burn has raised your periapsis)\n\n- Allow the atmosphere to do it work.

Now where this position is?\n\nActually, for any significant plane change, the larger you\u0027re willing to go with the orbit (without getting to escape velocity, obviously) the more delta-v you save on the plane change. Here is a graph:\n\n![CSZEiHh.png](http://i.imgur.com/CSZEiHh.png)\n\nThis shows the ratio of delta-v of the plane change by expanding the orbit first to the delta-v of doing it without expanding the orbit. The x-axis is the amount of prograde delta-v applied to expand the orbit, and this takes into account having to apply that same delta-v again to shrink the orbit back. This situation is based on starting at a 100km orbit of Kerbin. Since at that orbit, 930 m/s is enough for escape velocity, I ended there.\n\nAs you can see, for plane changes of 60, 75, and 90, the more speed you add to your orbit initially, the better the savings in the end. For a 45 degree plane change, you can save a little delta-v by putting about 300 in to expand the orbit, but it will start to cost more again after that. For changes less than 45, expanding the orbit no longer has any benefit.\n\nSo really, it\u0027s up to how long you want to wait to complete the plane change, as obviously, expanding your orbit a lot will extend your orbital period.\n\nI\u0027ve also checked; these curves don\u0027t change at different starting altitudes, though obviously the range of extra velocity you can add shrinks as your altitude gets higher. I\u0027m also pretty sure these curves stay the same regardless of the central body being discussed.\n\nAnd I find it funny how you managed to spell \u0027periapsis\u0027 correctly, but not \u0027apoapsis\u0027.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T07:53:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 07:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arkalius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T09:46:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can you point me to the proof of this? I believe you, but is there a longer explanation for why this is?\n\nSuppose your initial speed is v. Let\u0027s make an inclination change of angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 only by burning locally. For a pure inclination change, your final speed equals your initial speed, but the velocity vectors differ in direction by angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8.\n\n1) First, a truly horrible method: Burn dv = v retrograde, so that your speed is zero. Then burn dv = v in the inclined plane. The total cost is 2v, independent of \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8. Horrible. Consider this the worst case scenario.\n\n2) The best local, single-burn method is a burn along the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the initial prograde velocity vector and the final inclined plane velocity vector. The triangle has two sides of length v at angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 to each other. Use the law of cosines to find the length of the hypotenuse: c^2^ = a^2^ \u002B b^2^ - 2 a b cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8).\n\ndv^2^ = 2 v^2^ - 2 v^2^ cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8) = 4 v^2^ ((1-cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8))/2) = 4 v^2^ sin^2^(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8/2).\n\nThus dv = 2 v sin(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8/2). For \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 = 90, sin(45) = sqrt(2)/2, and thus dv = sqrt(2) v.\n\n3) Finally, the method of following the normal: Instead of burning along the hypotenuse of a triangle, you are sweeping out the arc of angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 of a circle of radius v. Thus the arc length dv is equal to v \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8. Remember to use radians for arc lengths instead of degrees. 90 degrees = pi/2 radians. So dv = pi/2 v. This method is always costlier than method 2. If this is following the arc of a circle, method 2 is the straight line between two points on a circle.\n\nDerivation of this one is a bit more involved. Solve 2 coupled differential equations:\n\na\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E = d/dt v\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E = - c v\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E\n\na\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E = d/dt v\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E = c v\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nThe vector (-y,x) is normal to the vector (x,y). So the differential equations together describe thrust normal to the current velocity.\n\nThe constant c (assuming constant thrust -- not a great assumption if the burn reduces your mass significantly and you don\u0027t adjust your throttle) is your angular velocity. A solution is: v\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E = v cos(c t), v\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E = v sin(c t). The total burn delta-v is obtained by integrating the acceleration a = sqrt(a\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E^2^ \u002B a\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E^2^) = c\\*v from time t = 0 until time T, the time to get to angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8. The integral of the constant c\\*v from 0 to T is simply dv = c\\*v\\*T. Now looking back at the solution, at what time T is the velocity inclined by angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8? Ans: When c\\*T = \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8, because the velocity points along angle \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8 when v\u003Csub\u003Ex\u003C/sub\u003E = v cos(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8) and v\u003Csub\u003Ey\u003C/sub\u003E = v sin(\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8). Thus dv = c\\*v\\*T = v \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B8.\n\n(What is the angular velocity c anyway? F = m a = thrust, so c = a/v = TWR\\*g\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E/v.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T10:27:41Z","Content":"Yep, I asked [the professionals](http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/9441/optimal-turning-from-equatorial-to-polar-orbit).
