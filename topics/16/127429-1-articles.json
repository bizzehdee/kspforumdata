It has no particular L/D requirements and can be done with high wing loading. That\u0027s what all real life spaceplanes have been designed to do. The second approach is the one originally envisioned for spaceplanes: very low wing loading, high L/D. You keep your descent rate low enough that you radiate heat as fast as you take it in, and only descend below, say, 45km once you\u0027re quite slow (in relative terms). This approach requires you to keep your L/D fairly high and to not have too high an angle of attack (for fear of lowering your periapsis too far).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the Fuji: It\u0027s flat like that more because you get a much high L/D ratio, and they wanted to fly a (comparatively) high-lift descent, which lowers the G forces. A ballistic (zero lift) reentry is always going to have the same peak G no matter the ballistic coefficient, IIRC; what changes the peak G is the entry angle, and/or lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T22:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot edited as nicely as the above post, but here\u0027s my re-entry,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLF64Jfn9iJDEJVIsu50IRcz6g1JAiTgfV\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. landing gear down and cargo bay doors open, for more drag, slows down faster (apparently rubber tyres are more heat resistant than thermally hardened spacecraft parts)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. pitch up to 20-25 degrees above prograde. \u00A0Max lift is at 30, but it falls off quickly past that point and given how hard it is to hold an exact pitch angle, i usually shoot for 20 or so. \u00A0 \u00A0The lift keeps you out of the thick atmo till you\u0027re really slowed down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plane got to 752/1400K on the cockpit, having so much wing helps with 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I think i just won the spot landing competition. \u00A0 That\u0027s a seriously slow touchdown speed my plane has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
