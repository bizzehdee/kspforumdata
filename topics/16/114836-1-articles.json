The most annoying one is that if you\u0027re in a more-or-less equatorial orbit, you can\u0027t warp if you\u0027re below 1 million meters altitude.\n\nAs to the heat for aerobraking, yes, that\u0027s a big problem due at least partially to faulty game mechanics.

So for the time being, I recommend instead that you set up a braking gravity assist off Tylo or one of the other big moons to capture at Jool, then go from there to where you really want to go. The last page or 2 of the \u0022How Do You...?\u0022 thread discusses this a lot."},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T14:13:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As above, use gravity assists instead to turn a low-Pe hyperbolic trajectory into a high-Pe circularish orbit, or use your main engines to slow down.

With aerocapture, you\u0027re coming in on an open, hyperbolic orbit at interplanetary transfer speed and using the atmosphere instead of retro thrust to close your orbit. With aerobraking, you\u0027re already in a closed orbit so are at lower speed, and you\u0027re just using the atmosphere to lower your Ap.\n\nReal spaceships that land on Earth use aerobraking all the time---it\u0027s unavoidably part of the landing process ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). I don\u0027t think there\u0027s been but 1 or 2 real examples of aerocapture, however. The main reason for that, I suppose, is that our real solar system is an order of magnitude than KSP\u0027s, so you need proportionally more dV to go anywhere, and so arrive proportionally more speed. This makes it way more difficult, if not impossible. But if KSP planets have \u0022realistic\u0022 atmospheres, then the speeds involved in KSP shouldn\u0027t preclude aerocapturing even at Jool. Unfortunately, Jool\u0027s air ain\u0027t \u0022realistic\u0022 at the moment (and never has been AFAIK)."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T18:11:18Z","Content":"I managed to aerobrake a probe on Jool.

Especially for something small you can wrap up in fairings and heat shields. But beyond that, it gets problematic. The main issue seems to be that no planet except Kerbin has a thin, wispy upper atmosphere, so even with barely getting into Jool\u0027s air you\u0027re hitting a brick wall, which ain\u0027t realistic.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well as a matter of fact, I am only trying to get to Tylo anyway.
