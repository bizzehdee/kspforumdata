I just want to be able to place the base part without having to disable build fairing on it\u00A0afterwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently when you grab the part from the editor, and then place it, it automatically enters into fairing build mode. I want to disable that until I actually want to begin the process of building a fairing. Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason is that I have designed several lifters where the fairing in the root part, but once I attach it to my payload it immediately enters fairing build mode which is quite annoying, especially if I want to edit the payload further before building a fairing for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-19T21:36:52Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2016 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-19T21:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know of a way to disable it, but you can press escape to exit out of that mode iirc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T05:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if you could patch that in with ModuleManager.
