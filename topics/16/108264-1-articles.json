I\u0027m working on getting a base on the moon right now, but I\u0027m doing some testing on the launchpad first to make sure everything works. I made a rover, and I\u0027m having a lot of trouble getting it to dock with the base --\n\n![efklsx.jpg](http://i58.tinypic.com/efklsx.jpg)\n\nAs you can see on the navball they\u0027re pretty close to lined up. I had it completely lined up before, like they were touching and the target reticule was exactly centered, but I didn\u0027t take a screenshot, and I got a little hasty when I went back to do it again. But anyway, even when it was even more precise, the docking ports just don\u0027t seem to engage. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nHere\u0027s the two docking ports separated... maybe I\u0027ve just built something wrong. This is the first time I\u0027ve ever attempted docking, in any case, lol.

Like the docking magnets don\u0027t turn back on until you are done undocking. Though I can\u0027t really tell from the pictures if this applies or not, as you look pretty far away from the port. \n\nCould it be that the magnets are kicking in, but they aren\u0027t strong enough to move the craft while on Kerbin? Maybe setting the brake torque to 0 would be enough to let the magnet work? Or give the wheels a little jolt to help the magnet do its job? \n\nAlso, that is a very cool rover and the design gives me some ideas for my own attempts at Munar mining/refueling ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: and yes the claw is very handy for docking. I only just found out that you can transfer resources through it once you have something grabbed -- like a fuel tanker. The large \u0022No Fuel Crossfeed\u0022 label in the description might have been what led me to never try it previously...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T21:47:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Krawdad**"},{"CreatedByName":"mr_trousers","CreatedById":135803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:08:08Z","Content":"With a couple design changes and replacing the docking structure on the front with a claw, I\u0027ve managed to get it to dock to the base! Thanks guys! Nothing else was really working, I tried making the docking structure longer and I also installed mechjeb and told it to autopilot dock (though it didn\u0027t do a lot since it has no RCS, but when I got really close the autopilot disengaged as if it believed I had docked). I didn\u0027t do anything with \u0022locked suspension\u0022 as I don\u0027t know what that is, so maybe if I\u0027d figured that out and got the heights really aligned it would have worked, who knows.\n\nBut anyway, since I found a method that worked, I\u0027ll marked this as answered.

Once I made rovers which docked perfectly... Then I mined some karbonite and tried to dock again. I couldn\u0027t because a loaded rover became heavier and the ports were unaligned - the one on a rover lowered a tiny bit but enough for not being able to dock. \n\nTry docking empty and see what happens."},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:11:36Z","Content":"There are a lot of tricks to making docking work with rovers.
