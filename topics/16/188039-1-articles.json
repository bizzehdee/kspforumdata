Build your rover as a crane where the distance between your wheels is at least the same as the height of your rocket so it doesn\u0027t tip over. You\u0027ll want sort of an A-shaped rover that\u0027s very tall. Dock your rocket\u0027s nose to the center of your crane and roll it over to your launch pad until the tail docks to the launcher.
