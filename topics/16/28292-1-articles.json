Any idea how to get it back short of rolling back the computer (which I\u0027d really prefer not to do)? I looked in the Recycle Bin and I saw an output log from yesterday. I clicked restore, but there is still nothing in his saves file. Is there any way to get the data back? Please help. I\u0027d like to have a happy kid again. (And I did see a helpful post here as to how to move 1.9 data into a 2.0 file, but first we have to get the 1.9 data back).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalmonellaDingDong","CreatedById":57168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T02:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope.

I had the same thing happen to me back from 17 to 18. It can really put a lemon in your fishbowl which is something my dear departed Grandmother use to say. Of course Grandma use to sit in trees and yell at birds to not fly so fast too. Shame when she fell and broke her leg...but I digress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, hope your son isn\u0027t too distraught. .20 has some pretty cool features.

You should make your son aware now that because the game is still being developed heavily (it\u0027s in alpha 0.20 right now), he is likely to lose everything at least one or two more times before the full game is actually released. It hurts a lot more when you\u0027ve got 100 missions going and have spent a disturbingly long time getting things to the state that they\u0027re in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a reason to quit playing the game, or to avoid trying ambitious missions, but it\u0027s good to keep in mind that the things we\u0027re doing now are likely not going to last.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
