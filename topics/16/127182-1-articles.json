After being constructed literally in orbit, courtesy of extraplanetary launchpads, it\u0027s ready for the grand tour.\u00A0 Unfortunately, on the way to mars, I found out it that it\u0027s unbalanced, and laggy. So now I want advice as to improve how it looks, reduce part count and reduce rcs usage. Since I have all these mods, anything is possible for me. I can reassemble part by part, or (once I get my mono refueled) move whole modules around. My only limitation is all my crew is tied up, especially engineers. My first step is to refuel, and I have a seed ship ready to land on Ike to build a refueling tanker \u002B refinery. I think I want to convert everything I can into either rocket parts, or shoved inside KIS storage containers. That allows me to have the cleanest ship but with maximal potential since I can just build anything I need out of rocket parts and spare modules inside KIS containers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it easier on my computer if it\u0027s inside KIS storage?
