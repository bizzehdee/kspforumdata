I have a problem landing on the mun and not sure why. I sorta followed Scott Manleys tuts on building a decent rocket(changed it some). I have no problems getting to the mun or getting in orbit around it. My problem is landing. I get myself to a decently low altitude. Slow myself down a lot usually using my 2nd stage. Then i drop it, and here\u0027s where my problem lies. No matter what I do my lv-909 engine cannot slow my speed down. I can literally get to 10m/s using my 2nd stage. But as soon as I drop that one and go to the final landing stage. my speed will continue to increase even at full throttle. This happens all the way to the surface. In which at that point i\u0027m back up to like 200m/s or more. What I am doing wrong? Weight? Has something changed where i need something bigger than the lv909 to properly land? Or am I missing something huge? Thanks for any advice anyone has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy lander is equivalent to the one found in this video.

Only installed Mechjeb and the stats mod. Was having problems even killing my velocity from over 200m meters away. When using mechjeb i go straight at it. Is it just not enough to stop the velocity of flying straight at the mun? Is the decouper blocking it? its on the right way i think. but it still looks like its in the way or something\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Got it :-D not the best landing area but its start. Atleast i know i can do it now. Thanks for the help guys\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe added RCS tanks will make it take longer to reduce velocity, and flying straight at the Mun will mean you have to burn earlier to cut your high descent rate in time. But, it\u0027s all good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you made it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
