If you can time the decoupling of those two stages that are on the ground properly, you might get yourself facing upward enough to not collide with the ground.. Or perhaps you could shut off the uppermost two stages, throttle up, allow the stage on the ground to explode, then decouple the top tanks when your rocket is facing upward. There\u0027s two or three different ways that you might be able to save it. Remember to quicksave before trying anything like this, though. Still, you probably won\u0027t have enough fuel to return to Kerbin afterwards (unless you have some kind of orbiter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember to get all the science you can, though. Duna has low enough gravity to jetpack, so you can get back into the command pod if you get out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the staging on you ship is quite inefficient. The most efficient way to stage the ship would be to have the side tanks pumping fuel into the adjacent tank, then decouple the outer tanks two at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-13T20:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2014 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T20:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dunno, if you can pump all the fuel into the top two tanks and raise/lower the gear while using SAS in the right direction, given Duna\u0027s gravity and the fact your on a hill facing just the right direction, it might just tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the worst that can happen?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T03:38:45Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 03:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T20:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you can probably do is (first quicksave of course, and quickload if it fails.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Start the center/adjacent engines (the ones with fuel from the last step) and eject the empty tanks. Get it onto a suborbital trajectory going east (Just like kerbin). Your apoapsis only needs to be about ~45 km to be out of the atmosphere, so get it to roughly that height. If you still have fuel, circularize with that. If not, use your EVA pack to circularize your orbit. You\u0027ll still need to send a rescue mission, but it\u0027s much easier to rendezvous in space than do a targeted landing on a planet/moon with an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T20:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have RCS?

The rocket will slide for a while but thanks to Duna\u0027s low gravity it might take off before something breaks.

As soon as you get close to vertical shut down the engines, reactivate the two engines, lower the landing gear, and attempt landing again. Try to remove as much horizontal speed as you can before landing again.
