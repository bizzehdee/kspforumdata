My first question regarding the Xenon fuel, Is there at this moment in time anyway to re-fuel a probe or are they generally one way tickets to where ever I wish to send them? I\u0027ve built my first one and I\u0027m looking at launching it to Duna, however I\u0027m concerned with the 700 litres of Xenon fuel I may not be able to get there and orbit sufficiently with the fuel I have. Secondly I was wondering at which stage do you tend to separate the launch stage and the probe? would this be done on an orbit of Kerbin or during an escape trajectory?.
