Staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve covered point 1 already by using LV-Ns, and I\u0027ll assume that point 2 is already handled (though paring anything unnecessary from your payload will certainly yield dV gains).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint 3 is about increasing the proportion of your ship\u0027s mass that is fuel (mass ratio). More fuel is more dV, though the dV gains diminish the more you add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint 4 is about shedding dry mass. Losing the mass of empty tanks has a similar effect to reducing your payload. Rather than one big fuel tank, consider breaking it up into several smaller tanks with decouplers and fuel lines. As the tanks empty, stage them away. If you combine this approach with Point 3, make sure the tanks you add can be dropped when empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun in the Jool system, it has some of the best views in the game (I love watching Jool rise from orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T23:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScareCake,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In addition to the above, you could consider reducing your payload, splitting it among multiple transfer vehicles, and eliminating one of the LV-Ns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially the \u0022reduce payload\u0022 part. Designing your surface payload and launch vehicle to be as mass- efficient as possible reduces your lander\u0027s mass. Reducing your lander\u0027s mass has a dramatic effect on your payload mass.
