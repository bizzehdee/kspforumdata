I\u0027m sure i saw Scott Manley do it in one of his vids - He did something that made the PE altitude stay open, as if he was hovering all the time while adjusting the maneuver node. Is there a feature that i\u0027m missing, or is he using a mod to achieve this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T14:59:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"viktor19","CreatedById":111560,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T14:19:49Z","Content":"I think you have to left or right click on the PE marker, I\u0027m not really sure.

Zoom in real close to the PE marker and right-click it at the top of the PE marker. Looking at it from the orbital plane makes it a little easier."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T14:39:33Z","Content":"This is one of the problems with the UI. It\u0027s often difficult to select the Pe/Ap marker rather than the orbit line.

Word of caution, double-click very slowly. Double-clicking will work to keep the info up, no matter how much time passes between clicks (just as long as you don\u0027t click anywhere else between the first and second click).
