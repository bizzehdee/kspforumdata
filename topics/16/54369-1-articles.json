You can just eject yourself backwards from Eeloo\u0027s SOI by driving your ejection clockwise instead of counterclockwise. The velocities will remain the same, you just need to adjust your ejection angles accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly the inclination may or may not be relevant....depending on how inclined, and where the An/Dn axis is. If the An/Dn axis is pretty much inline with the direction of Eeloo\u0027s orbit when you want to escape, you\u0027re golden. Otherwise you may suffer some inefficiencies, and that will be dependent on how much the inclination is. If you\u0027re only a few degrees, it won\u0027t matter much at all. If you\u0027re in a polar orbit with the RAAN (An/Dn axis) aligned with Eeloo\u0027s radial directions...you\u0027re going to have a trickier time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re inclination is above 60 degrees, and you have some time to spare (you may want to backup a bit from your launch window to give some time) then you can try a series of 3 burns to and see if they provide better results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

To do this, go into map view and tilt the camera so you are looking through Eeloo\u0027s orbital plane into the sun. Now pan the camera around until Eeloo\u0027s orbit line crosses Dres\u0027 orbit line. Make sure you find the node that is closer to the Eeloo\u0027s apoapsis, this will reduce the delta-V required to drop down to Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Wait for Eeloo to reach this point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Launch from Eeloo and apply enough delta-V so that your escape trajectory is in a solar retrograde direction and your periapsis is at the altitude of Dres. This should also be at or very close to the ascending/descending node through the orbit of Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) enter solar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Set Dres as target and look at the \u0022closest approach\u0022 indicators. If they are almost right on top of each other add a manoeuver just in front of your current position and tweak to get an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) If the closest approach is a long way away, warp around to the intersection and then put a manoeuvre node slightly BEHIND your current position in your solar orbit. This represents a manoeuvre almost one complete orbit later. Do not touch the handles, just plonk the node down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) The closest approach indicators will now move to represent the closest approach as a result of that \u0022manoeuvre\u0022, ie, on your next orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) If the closest approach gets slightly closer, add ANOTHER manoeuvre node further behind the first one. This now represents \u0022two orbits ahead\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Repeat step 6 through 8 until the closest approach is very close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) Now adjust the handles of the *first* node you put down until you get an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you repeat steps 6 through 8 and the closest approach \u0022jumps\u0022 a long way past the point where the orbits cross it means your orbital periods are such that it will take a very long time until you get a close approach (or possibly never!). If this occurs perform a small burn at the intersection point. This will change your orbital period without changing the intersection point.
