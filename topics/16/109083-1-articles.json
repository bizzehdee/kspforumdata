I have no idea whether it\u0027s a bug or I just don\u0027t understand whatever new mechanism that the fuel line uses.\n\nCrafts are all stock.\n\n[Mjtest ship](http://sta.sh/01e5c8cfc9uo): This is the asparagus staged one, you can see pretty quickly that they aren\u0027t draining evenly, they\u0027re also draining in a wierd way. Also, go straight up a few kilometers so that the boosters drop off without colliding into a wing or engine, then do normal gravity turn. KJR is likely required to keep it from breaking apart.\n\n[Tankwierdness ship](http://sta.sh/02w9309z03o): I tried to crossfeed the orange tanks so that they would drain evenly, but they end up doing the same kind of thing, not draining evenly and in a balanced way.\n\n[Fueldraintest](http://sta.sh/012sd1ws2yjh): It\u0027s upside down for test purposes, just run the engines for a bit and then stop, you\u0027ll see that the tanks are draining from the bottom (what would be the bottom if it were pointing up) and they aren\u0027t all draining evenly.\n\n[Fueldraintest no fuellines](http://sta.sh/02o4v6r1bbx): Identical to the previous one, just doesn\u0027t have fuel lines. It\u0027s to serve as a control and to show what I mean.\n\nCan anybody help with this? It seems like one of those not quite confirmed bugs and one of those things that are just rumored, but it\u0027s not rumored for me, I\u0027m having the issue right there."},{"CreatedByName":"SDEngineer","CreatedById":101148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:34:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m at work, so can\u0027t look at the craft files right now, but there are a few pointers that you might want to check. Your mention of \u0022crossfeeding\u0022 and the tanks draining \u0022oddly\u0022 suggests that you may have some fuel lines pointed the wrong way. Orientation of the fuel line matters - the side you connect first when placing a fuel line is the \u0022fuel donor\u0022, and the side connected last is the \u0022fuel receiver\u0022. Making a mistake when doing this will lead to all sorts of problems, particularly if other lines are actually placed correctly. You can see the fuel line orientation if you zoom in close (there are little arrows pointing the direction of the receiver).\n\nAlso, generally, you want to keep the fuel line situation simple. KSP is known to do odd things if you try to connect multiple donors directly to multiple receivers. One donor to multiple receivers is usually fine (i.e. a central fuel tank feeding multiple radially attached engines works fine), as well as multiple donors feeding a single receiver (typical asparagus staging for example, where the central tank is typically going to be fed by the two final radially attached engines, or onion staging where the radial tanks all feed the central tank), but if you try something like having each of the asparagus radial stages feed the central tank, and each radial stage ALSO feed the next radial stage in the asparagus sequence, the fuel behavior will likely not behave as expected.\n\nOne final caveat - never connect two tanks directly together in both directions (even through a chain). For example, Tank A feeds Tank B, and Tank B feeds Tank A, or A feeds B which feeds C which feeds A. If you wind up with a circular connection the behavior gets very unpredictable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T20:46:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SDEngineer**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:44:46Z","Content":"Well, the asparagus staging one is done the standard way of asparagus staging and yes I check the fuel line directions."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T23:19:31Z","Content":"\\*bump\\*\n\nAnybody else able to help?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T00:22:19Z","Content":"I tried \u0022MJtest EveKerbin\u0022.

Those extra fuel lines though was an attempt to get it to stay balanced.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T00:35:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 12:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"tbob","CreatedById":137896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:45:42Z","Content":"I built an asparagus last night to loft my mun base (14 Kerbals, Party on the Mun!) and I had a similar problem... looked good up to about 1km then the base kicked sideways as one of the mainsails cut out early.\n\nTurns out one of the central feeders was connected to.... a strut.
