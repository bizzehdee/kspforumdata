Any reason of why this happened? My settings are all the way down as my computer is terrible. I use mods so this isnt a bug report, more of an inquiry just to see if this happens to others or if its something I can work around somehow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thepielord","CreatedById":58568,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T19:56:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif your rover is moving fast enough it will break your solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T19:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEve\u0027s gravity is several times the gravity of Kerbin. Even very slight bumps can dislodge attached stuff. My first landing on Eve resulted in detached engine, fuel tank, landing gear... Nothing exploded. It just dislodged. It was funny, but disappointing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rassa Farlander","CreatedById":63627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanding was fine and there wasnt really and bumps or ridges that I could discern from any surrounding terrain. Could my graphic settings turned down all the way make it so I cant see said bumps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Railsmith","CreatedById":27174,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes. I noticed that having terrain details down made driving rovers anywhere rather treacherous--they would seem to \u0022catch\u0022 on seams between polygons and hurl themselves into the air as if they hit a massive speed bump. This was generally pretty destructive--I\u0027m glad I have a computer that can handle slightly better terrain now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must have hit a bug in the ground. Its something you gotta get used to. The only solution is autosaving often. Theres a similar bug between the spaceplane hanger and the astronaut complex where while driving a rover it will glitch and flip around/breaks stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the terrain detail also changes the surfaces used by the physics engine. After changing it to low to check something, I\u0027ve noticed my Mun base(previously hanging from a crater wall) lying on almost flat ground, kerbals could walk around like it was regular flat terrain - the crater simply wasn\u0027t there anymore. After changing the terrain detail to normal it was fine again. So I think this actually doesn\u0027t have much to do with terrain quality setting - the ground will be where it appears to be anyways. It almost certainly is just the high gravity on Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T21:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah it has nothing to do with the graphics, its the game it self bugging. I remember one of jupiters moons was also same thing. You get off the ladder and the kerbal is waist deep in the mud.I planted a flag on that planet, 2 minutes later the flag got destroyed... same thing with eve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
