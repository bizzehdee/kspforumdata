I want to use ion engines and nuclear engines to send a craft to Duna. Now, burn times are larger than my orbital period, so I was thinking why not do multiple burns.

As 5thHorseman says, you don\u0027t need to bullseye the centre of the window to get a near-perfect-efficiency transfer, and being a couple of degrees off course costs practically nothing to correct as long as you sort it at the Kerbin end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T05:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI prefer to stay under the radius of the Mun\u0027s orbit ... you don\u0027t get all the delta-v you would going WAY out there, but you get most of it (maybe 800\u002B m/s), a shorter orbital period, and no chance of running into the Mun.
