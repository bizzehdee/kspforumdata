(Also, the yaw monitor in the lower left deflects as expected, so again it appears the issue is with the TB\u0027s reversed response to a correct command.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a known bug?\u00A0 Or is something corrupted in my install somewhere?\u00A0 And how do I fix it?\u00A0 Locking gimbals prevents the undesired gimbal behavior, but reaction wheels by themselves really don\u0027t provide enough control authority around max-Q (flip-and-tumble is NOT my friend, no matter how much Jeb and Val enjoy that roller-coaster feeling!), and the whole point of this exercise was to get rid of fins.\u00A0 The most satisfactory solution is to fix the TB\u0027s nozzle response, but I\u0027m at a loss as to even where to begin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=================\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I should probably add, this game is mostly-stock.\u00A0 Beautification mods EVE and Texture Replacer (but the only non-stock textures I use are suits so I can distinguish professions easily, no part textures), KAC, and Claw\u0027s Stock Bug Fix/StockPlus.\u00A0 The latter is the only one that I would think could affect craft behavior, and I saw the \u0022yaw west until speed is high enough for aero surfaces to \u0027bite\u0027\u0022 behavior long before I ever installed that one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-14T21:30:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2016 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T22:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might need to go to support/staff, because you seem to have found a bug...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T05:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell dang.\u00A0 I was really hoping that someone would tell me something in the config got corrupted, and provide a quick-and-easy way to fix it.\u00A0 ::grumble::\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how do I move this to a different sub-forum?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T06:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a known bug with the Twin Boar, which results in the engine having no roll authority despite the nozzles gimbaling in the correct direction. \u00A0However, the result you describe is different than the reported bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, could you please post a screenshot of the vessel you are seeing this with?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T08:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76862-rexkramer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002276862\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76862-rexkramer/\u0022\u003E@RexKramer\u003C/a\u003E that was fixed in 1.0.5.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T09:10:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOP...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just tried putting this craft into orbit with just a TB...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KeQqcqx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KeQqcqx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorked fine without fins.
