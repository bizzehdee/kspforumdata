I\u0027m guessing that the distribution is random for each game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to do is to edit \u0022something\u0022 in order to make the hex around the SC contain ore but I don\u0027t want to install something like hyper edit as perhaps the temptation to use that for other things would be too great. All i\u0027d like to do is have the particular hex have ore so that I can learn about mining and rocket part construction before I send up massive great ships to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d greatly appreciate someone letting me know what to do.

The major differences between the 2 systems is resource distribution. Kethane\u0027s system has discrete deposits of various resources randomly distributed around planets. This distribution changes on every planet in every new game. Either a location is part of a deposit and has the resource, or it isn\u0027t has zero. Plus, you can consume all the resources in a deposit in a relatively short time. OpenRecources, OTOH, usually has at least a trace amount of most resources everywhere on a planet, although there will be local concentrations or \u0022hot spots\u0022 scattered about, and these are NOT random but hand-fitted to go logically with the planet\u0027s terrain, so are in the same places every game. Plus, you can\u0027t use up the resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf these, I MUCH prefer the OpenResources system for a number of reasons. 1) I can usually test things at KSC; 2) it makes base location selection MUCH easier; 3) industrial consumption of resources can continue more than 1 or 2 iterations; and 4) scanning for OpenResources uses SCANsat, which is way better than the Kethane scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 is a real biggie. Consider Laythe which is mostly ocean with only a handful of small islands. The way the Kethane system works, you\u0027re guaranteed to have 90-100% of your resources in the water and the mod provides no way at all to extract them, and the rest will likely be very inconveniently located and quickly consumed. Thus, it\u0027s often impossible to do anything on Laythe with the Kethane system, and when it is possible, it\u0027s a huge hassle and won\u0027t last very long anyway, so is hardly worth the trouble. Which is a totally buzzkill. It was this more than anything else that made me switch from Kethane to Karbonite. I made numerous attempts to colonize Laythe with Kethane and its resource system pretty much scuppered them all. But because Karbonite is OpenResources, you can find everything you need, in inexhaustible quantities, on conveniently located islands. PLUS this mod also allows resource extraction from the oceans. YAY!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads in its default form is set up to use the Kethane resource system. HOWEVER, on the 1st page is a link to a 3rd-party conversion that switches EL to use Karbonite, and RoverDude, maker of Karbonite, is working on making this part of his own mods. I have tested this in its current state (not yet updated to 0.25 when I checked) and it worked fine. So, I consider this a very viable option. At the very least, it will give you at least a trace amount of ore at KSC right off the bat so you build a base rover and drill right through the runway to get it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T14:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you aren\u0027t averse to further mod use, last I checked TAC Fuel Balancer lets you fill kethane tanks when you\u0027re on the launchpad/runway.

Of course that won\u0027t help you test mining rigs but you can do the construction part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryds","CreatedById":108453,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T08:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, thanks for all the info!

Here are some examples from various games of mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/hjVE2f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3818/10715874056_89169b5af4_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210715874056_89169b5af4_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was the 1st time I tried it and it was by far the best distribution I ever got. Note the deposit on the big island nearly on the equator at the left edge, plus a few others on relatively large, conveniently located islands. Problem was, none of those convenient deposits was very big, so they didn\u0027t last long. With Kethane, the big deposits tend to be at higher latitudes than you might like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/kQFrYE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/13021667154_30dacb8e00_o.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002213021667154_30dacb8e00_o.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above is much more typical of a Laythe Kethane. Nearly everything is uselessly underwater and where there is Kethane on land, it\u0027s only on very tiny amounts of land. Either it\u0027s on minscule sandbar shoals or \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eextremely\u003C/span\u003E small slivers of big islands, VERY difficult to drop landers on. And where there is a large patch of Kethane on land, it\u0027s almost always in moutainous areas with sheer cliffs instead of beaches. Plus, next to nothing is on or near the equator, and the majority of land deposits will be too small for extended use anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty much the same everywhere, actually. Laythe is just the extreme example but you have the same general problems of inconvenient locations and limited amounts everywhere, even places like Duna with no oceans. And then there\u0027s the excruciatingly boring, time-consuming chore of scanning for Kethane in the 1st place, due to its hex grid system. Ugh! I eventually reached the point where I only scanned between \u002B/- 30^ latitude to minimize the time required, on the theory I\u0027d never use any Kethane further off the equator than that anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, Kethane isn\u0027t suited to large-scale, long-term use by permanent bases and colonies. It\u0027s best thought of as a way for small, short-term exploration ships to refuel themselves a few times and never come back. If you want to build permanent, self-sufficient bases, and consume resources on an industrial scale, Karbonite is far and away superior in all respects. Except that Eeloo doesn\u0027t have a drop of it, it\u0027s got Karborundum instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T13:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn kethane scanning, it does indeed take a bit of waiting if you want to do a thorough scan.

Be profligate with your fuel and you\u0027re going to use up the easy stuff and have to move on to more difficult-to-exploit deposits, just as humanity has done with Earth\u0027s natural resources.
