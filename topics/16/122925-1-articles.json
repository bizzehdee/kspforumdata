Instead, what matters more is Mach 1 (a bit over 300 m/s at Kerbin sea level): a good rule of thumb is to stay under it until you\u0027re over 10 km altitude, then floor it. A useful ascent profile is something like this: Accelerate as hard as you can up to around 300 m/s. Then back off the throttle and gradually accelerate up to 350 m/s or so. When you get to 10 km, punch it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe longer explanation is below. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeaway points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPost-1.0 is different from pre-1.0.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, any advice you hear that comes from before May 2015 is pretty much worthless now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETerminal velocity doesn\u0027t matter (much) anymore.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore 1.0, the game used a simplistic aero model that resulted in a couple of things. One was that all ships had the same terminal velocity regardless of size, mass, or design. The other is that the math worked out simply (and coincidentally) so that \u0022ascend at terminal velocity\u0022 was the most efficient answer. However, it doesn\u0027t work that way anymore-- the math changed, and there\u0027s nothing special about terminal velocity for efficiency. In fact, you\u0027ll generally do better for most rocket designs to climb at faster than terminal velocity for the first few kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMach 1 \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E matters now.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the old pre-1.0 model, there wasn\u0027t anything super-special about Mach 1; aerodynamic drag just climbed smoothly with the square of velocity.

On a typical ascent, the drag coefficient is at its maximum while the rocket passes through the velocity range of about 300-400 m/s. I like to keep the accelerator pegged and just blow through Mach 1 and keep accelerating. The less time I hang around peak Cd, the better. And, besides, I don\u0027t think the drag losses are enough to worry about; for a well designed rocket they shouldn\u0027t be over 150 m/s total. The rocket should be given an aerodynamic shape but, other than that, I don\u0027t see a reason to fret too much over drag losses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T17:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you watch the numbers in KER you\u0027ll discover that while ascending upwards from the ground it would be very hard to reach terminal velocity.
