I can see them in map view but that does me no good when attempting to land, or go to each of the 5 required sites?

So yes, double clicking one of the target locations puts a direction marker on your navball. Then when you are landed close, you zoom in and see which direction you need to go. At that point it would be best if you had a rover, but you can hop there with a lander, too. Hopping is just a little tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T07:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69507-geschosskopf/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002269507\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69507-geschosskopf/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Geschosskopf\u003C/a\u003E answered the question perfectly already, let me add that if you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E frustrated with not being able to see waypoints outside the map view, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94432-112-waypoint-manager\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethere\u0027s a mod for that\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T14:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent!
