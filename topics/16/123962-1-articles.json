But do have a bit of fuel reserve a few hints, in order of importance - all with the goal of adding a rescue mission and making that as easy as possible:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Make the orbit in the same plane as kerbin (inclination = 0, removes a whole step of an approach)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Make the orbit near circular (makes approaching much more easy as the delta-v becomes independent of the time when you do it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Make the orbit as *small* as possible. NOT as close to kerbin as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Step 3 seems counter intuitive: but a smaller orbit means kerbin \u0026amp; the rescueing craft pass each other more times: giving many more potential times to do a hohmann transfer. When the orbit is near kerbin\u0027s size you might have to wait 10 years before you align up correctly, and you\u0027d have to do a two step (first decrease the rescuers orbit from kerbin\u0027s orbit - then increase it again). Making planing more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beatz0121","CreatedById":148730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T22:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow!

When you get into the Sun\u0027s sphere of influence, you should be able to do what you need, then burn very slightly retrograde to slow yourself down. Kerbin should catch up with you and you will fall back into its sphere of influence without too much hassle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T23:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t relaunched yet, I sent an unmanned science probe on my first sun mission, and got lucky enough to get a chance at an Eve encounter as well.

That\u0027s just how fast you\u0027re going around the sun, and it doesn\u0027t matter. What matters is your velocity relative to Kerbin. Unfortunately, there\u0027s no easy way to see that directly, since when your target is a planet (as opposed to a ship) you can\u0027t put the navball into \u0022target relative\u0022 mode to see. (It\u0027s annoying, they should fix that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as long as you didn\u0027t leave Kerbin\u0027s SoI with much velocity, and as long as you haven\u0027t been outside it a really long time, then your Kerbin-relative velocity will be quite low and it\u0027s easy to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could always send an unmanned probe: fast, light, cheap, doesn\u0027t have to come back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, one very nice benefit of sending a kerbal is for the experience. Peeking outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI is the only way to get past level 2, so it\u0027s worth it for leveling up before you go on grand adventures out into the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple recipe for a mission outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI and back:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Launch to LKO normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Do a prograde burn that\u0027s just barely enough to escape Kerbin. That is, life the apoapsis up just enough that it grazes the outer boundary of the SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Wait. It\u0027ll take a couple of weeks to get out there. You leave the SoI, you\u0027ll be going very slowly, with a Kerbin orbital velocity under 200/m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As soon as you\u0027re outside the SoI, point the nose of your ship directly at Kerbin, and give it a medium-hard shove. Doesn\u0027t have to be huge, just a few hundred m/s will do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Pretty soon you\u0027ll be back in the SoI. Arrange for reentry and landing as per usual.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
