I think that the most effective way of doing it is to first build the ship you want to dock things to. Then build the attachment ship in the same room as the main ship. Separate the ship from the main ship and save it as a subassembly. Then if you make an unmanned ship and load the subassembly into the scene and attach it, you should have the correct spacing required because it should have been built and measured in the same room as the main vessel. I found that attaching ships with large mass to two docking ports is easier than attaching a lighter ship to two docking ports because the magnetic attraction bumping that happens when you go to dock. A heavy ship won\u0027t bounce around and should attach as one, while a lighter ship might bounce off slightly and not attach properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Both docking ports have to attach at the same time in order for this to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Both docking ports have to be aligned to within a few centimeters or each other in order for them to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If both of the docking ports don\u0027t dock, then you might have to undock and then fly about 50 - 100 meters away and then try docking again in order to get all of the docking clamps to engage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with my design that worked, some of the docking attempts took 2 - 4 tries before I got both of the docking clamps to work. Now that we have subassemblies, you should be able to make the docking craft and save it as a separate part and not have to fiddle with the alignment like I did with my Moho rescue station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note: if you\u0027re using up to 4 docking ports for a craft, it can be very difficult to dock them all properly because you have to rotate all of the ports to the perfect alignment and the S.A.S. system can cause trouble with this. If you use pure R.C.S. then you have to make sure to align everything perfectly and kill all velocity before moving in for docking otherwise the docking ports will be off and won\u0027t dock.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-05T16:38:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2013 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T22:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to be aware of: even if multiple sets of rings indicate that they are docked, between two assembles there can only ever be one \u0022official\u0022 link at full strength, and the others are significantly weaker and may part under stress, even while continuing to claim (on their right-click interfaces) that they are docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T20:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi !

This second idea is that ports will connect, some will fail, plugin then detects this failure, then tries again to undock them all with zero ejection force and retries. After each iteration, ports will align closer and closer until finally all ports are aligned and are in \u0022Docked\u0022 state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem with this second approach is how to determine if all needed ports are indeed connected, because what if player creates a geometry that has one intentionally port slightly out of alignement ?

This makes it possible for the engine to figure out physics effects for every part on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to couple multiple dock ports from one component to another creates a loop in the logic flow. Now, instead of the docked vessel just being a branch through the one docking port, it tries to create a loop through two or more ports instead, conflicting with the linear nature of the engine\u0027s physics logic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can sort of get multiple ports to align and \u0022believe\u0022 that they\u0027re docked sufficiently enough to serve your purpose thanks to the magnetic attraction feature of the ports, and due to their proximity and general alignment at contact, but the reality is that the physics calculations are still doggedly proceeding through only one of the ports. If you have a ship with a very high T/W ratio available on the \u0022top\u0022 docked section, you might see the evidence of this for yourself when you fire the engines on it, and it swings wildly away from its connection, along the one dock port that was actually considered to be properly and fully connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest option is to use Docking Port Sr where possible, and quantum or docking struts where not.
