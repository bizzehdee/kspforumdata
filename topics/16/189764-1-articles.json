Your satellites need relay-type of antennas, not direct-type, otherwise they wont help extending the reach of signals, they merely respond to your Space Center. The time warp in this case is not the culprit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fenceingmadman","CreatedById":201226,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-24T01:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe comm net goes red and says not connected and I am useing relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-24T03:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRed almost always means you ran out of electricity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-24T09:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbe cores consume electricity, not fast but continuous. But if a craft is not in physics range then it doesn\u0027t consume \u003Cstrong\u003Eany\u003C/strong\u003E electricity. (It also doesn\u0027t generate electricity, but that doesn\u0027t seem to be your problem.) So if you have a probe with that doesn\u0027t generate electricity for whatever reason - because it doesn\u0027t have solar cells, the solar cells are not deployed / in shadow of parts of the craft or a planet, or whatever - and you switch back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or another (far away) craft and time-warp there, then it will still have some battery capacity left. But if you do that time-warping while focused on the probe, then it will run out of ECs quite fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-24T22:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add to the above, putting your probe cores on \u0022hibernate in warp: auto\u0022 solves many problems (probe-lems?).\u00A0 It should really be the default IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
