The asteroid is as yet untapped. I have plenty of storage space for ore, plenty of electricity, good contact between the drill and the asteroid, more than sufficient cooling. The drill deploys just fine but when I click \u0022Start Asteroid Harvester\u0022 it just flashes a thermal efficiency number then does nothing. The status reads operational, but I cannot extract any ore. This is my first genuine attempt at mining, so I assume I\u0027m missing something simple. I would appreciate any advice on the matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAri\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: \u00A0\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI figured it out. It is kind of a long story though. I have two asteroids attached to the station and I already drilled out the second one using a different ship, but it took forever so I decided to build a refinery ship to make the process go faster on the second asteroid. I forgot to put the ore container on that vessel, and that was when this drilling problem seemed to start. I sent up an ore container and docked it to the station via a docking port, still no luck, so I assumed it was a problem with the fuel crossfeed, after playing with the docking ports for a while I decided to just send up a second refinery vessel with an ore container on board. When that failed I began to assume it was a problem with my ship that I was overlooking. The game must have tagged the whole station as ore deficient when I finished with the previous asteroid so the drills think there is nothing there. As soon as I undocked the other rock from the station, the drills fired up just fine.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KKrZbsk.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/KKrZbsk.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-19T18:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2017 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aristarchus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESolved it!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-19T10:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the looks of the picture, your drill is positioned too high up, and not making contact with the asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-19T11:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm. \u00A0No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it.

One of the biggest class (F I think) and 2 others a lot smaller.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll of them have been drilled at least a bit before addition to the station, none of them was however empty.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInitially, drilling was working fine. I am pretty sure (not 100% though) that the only drills I activated were the one \u0022into\u0022 the biggest rock.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA bit later, I noticed drilling had stopped, and drills refused to start again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAt this stage, I noticed one of the little asteroids was empty.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf I undock the empty asteroid, I can mine again on both the big one and the other small one.

Drilling takes into account one of the asteroids only, whatever the position of the active drills (as long as it is below asteroid surface). In my save file, the asteroid emptied was the last in the vessel block. I tried putting the part corresponding to the big asteroid after the emptied one to see if it could solve it, but the game did not like my experimental surgery operation \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running a modded install, so I am not sure the behaviour would be the same in stock. I might try it and fill a bug report if it does, but finding 2 asteroids and dock them can take a bit of time. I can use cheats to change orbit before docking to help things a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
