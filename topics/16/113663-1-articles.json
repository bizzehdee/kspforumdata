Possibly launch a craft over a few launches and assemble in kerbin orbit. In a lot of ways the answer really is more boosters, since you have to launch more fuel into space for the voyage. After unlocking the ISRU converter it gets easier, since you can refuel in flight by mining ore.\n\nEDIT: here is a screenshot of my craft which is in Jool orbit. While there are plenty of methods that work, maybe this will give you some ideas\n\n[http://imgur.com/e6GpR3D](http://imgur.com/e6GpR3D)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T02:42:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 02:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jkool702**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:47:47Z","Content":"Nice rocket!

Thanks for the rocket ideas, but I was also talking about how I actually travel there, as in intercept an orbit and such.\n\nFirst of all, put yourself in a nice parking orbit around Kerbin, at say, around 80KMs. Next, place a maneuver node somewhere along your orbit, and go prograde until you leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI (sphere of influence). From there, select your target - I recommend Duna, as it is easy to reach, land on, and take off again - and continue pulling on the prograde node until the apoapsis intercepts Duna\u0027s orbit around the sun. If you do not achieve an intercept, go back to the space centre and accelerate time until you find yourself in a good alignment. From there, it\u0027s essentially the same as intercepting and orbiting the Mun or Minimus, except the main orbiting body is the Sun, not Kerbin. I should also say that you should download an essential mod called \u0027Kerbal Engineer Redux\u0027, as this will give you the performance of your rocket and spacecraft, which is essential in knowing if your spacecraft will be able to even make it to a target, whether you\u0027ll have enough fuel to land, come back, etc. As I\u0027m terrible at explaining things, I suggest you go to Youtube and watch Scott Manley, the god of all things KSP, as he\u0027s done countless videos on this nature of gameplay."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T03:02:43Z","Content":"Thank you Jkool!

Exactly the same principles, you just need to escape Kerbin\u0027s SoI first.\n\nAlso.. strictly speaking, you don\u0027t need to establish an orbit of Kerbin first.. You can just point straight up and keep on firing, though in the end you\u0027re not saving a heap of dV. If it\u0027s a planet further out that you\u0027re aiming for, take off \u0027forward\u0027.. ie launch right at sunrise and go straight \u0022up\u0022, which equates to Kerbin\u0027s prograde path in its orbit around the Sun. When you accelerate out, this will mean you\u0027re going faster than Kerbin and therefore climbing into a higher orbit. For planets inside, the opposite. Wait until sunset so you\u0027re on Kerbin\u0027s retrograde and again head on straight so that you\u0027re slowing down and dropping closer in in the solar system.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T03:28:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mic\\_n**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T03:27:08Z","Content":"Not exactly, I was having some trouble with that in the tutorial Mic."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T04:10:29Z","Content":"[http://ksp.olex.biz/](http://ksp.olex.biz/) phase angle calculator, tells you the best positions the planets should be in to make a transfer"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T04:30:01Z","Content":"The post above provides the technical info you\u0027ll need, but for the basic concept:\n\nYou know how burning prograde raises the other side of your orbit, while burning retrograde lowers it? And when you go to the Mun or Minmus, you burn so as to place your apoapsis ahead of the target, at the place it\u0027s going to be when you get there instead of the place it\u0027s at right now? And how when you leave the Mun or Minmus, you want to burn backwards along the orbital path of that moon so as to bring your periapsis in towards Kerbin (because you\u0027re burning retrograde relative to Kerbin, even though it\u0027s prograde relative to the Mun)?\n\nIt\u0027s like that, just bigger, with one complication:\n\nWhen you\u0027re figuring out which way to aim your initial burn, you want to think of it as if Kerbin itself was the ship. So, if the planet is closer to the Sun than Kerbin (e.g. Moho), you want to leave going backwards along Kerbin\u0027s orbital path. In other words, solar retrograde. If the target is higher than Kerbin (e.g. Jool), you want to exit Kerbin burning along its orbital path: solar prograde. Kinda like what you do when you\u0027re returning from a moon, just on a bigger scale.\n\nThat calculator linked above will give you phase angle and ejection angle. Phase angle is the \u0022where it\u0027s going to be when I get there\u0022 bit. It tells you what day to do the burn on. Ejection angle is the bit that aims your escape to either solar prograde or retrograde; it tells you where in your orbit to light the rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:43:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not exactly, I was having some trouble with that in the tutorial Mic.\n\nThen I\u0027d suggest working on that first. Maybe not quite as exciting but the mechanics are exactly the same and it\u0027s not as huge an effort to \u0022get going\u0022. Replace Kerbin with the Sun and the other satellite you\u0027re trying to meet with another planet, and the concepts are the same. It\u0027s also really useful if you\u0027re wanting to do anything like a return mission or drop a little lander down to the surface of a moon or something and bring it back before progressing onto another body.\n\n\\* Establish an orbit in the same plane as your target. That means burning \u0027down\u0027 (purple down-pointing triangle in your navball) at the Ascending Node or vice versa until the angle is ideally at 0.0 (*ideally* ideally \u0027NaN\u0027, which is like SUPER zero, but \u0022close enough\u0022)\n\n\\* Extend one point of your orbit to touch (not cross) the orbit of your target. Ideally, start your burn opposite the nearest \u0027node\u0027 of your target\u0027s orbit, so you\u0027re either pushing your Ap up to its Pe or reducing your Pe down to its Ap (unlikely if you\u0027re coming up from the surface of Kerbin to dock with a satellite, but what you\u0027re going to be doing transferring to an inner planet.) This should give you a single set of red markers to indicate the location in your orbit where your closest approach is (it\u0027ll be at the intersect of the two orbits) and another to indicate where the other object will be at that point. Two sets of orange and brown markers means your orbits cross. Not a problem in itself, but it\u0027s easier to follow and learn if you\u0027re only dealing with a single intersection.\n\n\\* If you\u0027re in a lower orbit, you\u0027re following a shorter path with a quicker orbital period, so you\u0027ll \u0022catch up\u0022 to that object with each orbit. Orbiting higher will let it catch you.\n\n\\* Once those two markers are close, create yourself a manoeuvre node just before that intercept and adjust your prograde to fine tune it... As you adjust faster and slower you should see that \u0022target position\u0022 marker move closer or further to your closest approach. You want to push your orbit so that those two markers get as close as you can get them.\n\nAt that point if you\u0027re doing a planetary transfer, that\u0027s quite possibly going to be \u0027close enough\u0027 to put you into that system\u0027s SOI, and you should be able to do some aerobraking to get captured and go where you want inside the system. However for a \u0027docking\u0027 kinda meet-up, you still need to zero your relative velocity. You can either do that with another manoeuvre node just past that \u0022meeting\u0022 intercept that speeds up or slows down to match orbits and keep that \u0027target position\u0027 indicator in the same spot, or by switching your navball to \u0022target\u0022 mode, waiting until you hit your closest approach (when your distance to target starts increasing again), lining up your retrograde marker there and burning until your relative velocity with the target hits zero.\n\nTo dock from there you need to point back towards your target and creep up on it. Properly balanced RCS or at least strong SAS is invaluable here. Watch your target indicator and prograde indicator and keep them both aligned (preferably over your centre marker). Line up your docking port with the target and hope it doesn\u0027t bug out ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s a tricky concept to get your head around, but muck around with it and you\u0027ll get the hang of it with time and practice. Don\u0027t try to go too quickly, and just do one thing at a time. It\u0027s really easy to get things wrong in a hurry.\n\nBasically, play with manoeuvre nodes and see how changing your orbit in particular directions at particular points in your orbit impacts your rendezvous."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T05:46:38Z","Content":"Wow, what a cool calculator!
