I figured I would send the core module, titled Pandu, up into Kerbin orbit first, and send the landers and probe later (cookie if you can guess what I\u0027ll call those five items). I had initially planned to attach the landers to the core radially, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZIhujsq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZIhujsq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeemed simple enough until I realized that it is likely that my landers will have varying weights and will throw off the CoM causing my ship to spin out of control when I make my burn for Jool. So then I had the idea to make it so I could attach the landers in line with the CoM like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tzxWKFx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tzxWKFx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that seems all well and good until I realized what kind of structural limitations that places on my landers as they need to have an accessible docking port on the top AND the bottom. Also, ideally, they would have Clampotron Sr docking ports so that they might interface with the ones on core ship. I realize my core ship doesn\u0027t absolutely need to have Sr. docking ports, but I\u0027ve been on a kick of using appropriately sized parts and adapters lately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how might I attach four landers to this ship? I\u0027ve also considered stacking them on the front end, but then my beloved Kerbals would have an obstructed view from the cockpit. What\u0027s the point in going to Jool if you can\u0027t even look at it thru the window?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T05:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from trying to build the landers so they\u0027re at least roughly the same mass, one neat trick is build the mothership with more tankage than the mission requires. Then what you do is de-fuel the heaviest lander into the mothership tanks so that its wet mass matches up with the fully fuelled wet mass of the second heaviest lander (which will be docked to the opposing radial docking arm), and like wise the other radial pair. Then once you\u0027ve reached your destination you can fully refuel the landers from the mothership tanks before releasing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/m8zhn9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m8zhn9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis for example is my Jool fleet with 3 landers. The big Tylo lander on the nose (that\u0027s another trick, use the nose docking port of your mothership if you have a ship that\u0027s radically different in mass to the rest) leaves the mothership during Jool aerocapture and head to Tylo while the mothership and two landers go to Laythe. The smaller lander then go to Bop from Low Laythe Orbit while the medium lander land on Laythe, launch and refuel from the mothership orbiting above and then head to Vall. After that all three landers take off and re-join the mothership at Low Jool Orbit. Pol didn\u0027t exist back then so it doesn\u0027t get a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn both the trip to Jool and back I would trim the assembled fleet by offloading Laythe/Vall lander fuel into the mothership so that that lander is the same mass as the Bop lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other trick is to break the heavy landers into multiple stages stuck together via docking port (eg a descent stage and a docked lightweight ascent stage, or an orbital tug docking with a lander). When docking you can then break up that lander into component pieces to better distribute that weight around the mothership. At destination undock all the pieces to reassemble the craft before it heads off on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://103.imagebam.com/download/PZRidsFI8w5ioFrDsgjYow/25596/255950423/screenshot1170.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1170.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my Gilly lander and its nuclear tug stage reassembling in Low Eve Orbit. Gilly\u0027s low gravity means I can have a tiny RCS only lander, but the heavy gravity of Eve and Gilly\u0027s erratic orbit means I need a powerful tug stage for it with a lot of delta-V. Since the combined lander\u002Btug is much heavier than the Eve rover on the opposing docking arm what I did is install a docking port on the bottom of the rover and move the Gilly lander to that side, thus balancing things out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T09:54:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother way is to use drop tanks for balance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put fuel tanks out on decoplers, might be an idea to put them radial on your ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ing7Lbe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ing7Lbe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ing7Lbe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrain tank and disconnect after dropping lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T10:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECompletely redesign your ship for the landers to dock in a middle of two stacks of fuel tanks, engines and other components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoin the stacks with struts, crew modules or anything else you want to bring along and dock you landers - in the line of COM and COT - to these \u0022bridges\u0022 between the two \u0022drive sections\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill require a hell of a launcher or quite some docking in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save mass and parts you could reuse one crew and equipment module and dock it to the different land- and ascent-modules designed for the different bodies you are visiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggested mods: Fuel Balancer, Crew Manifest, UbioZur Welding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdith tells me, that I always wanted to built such a vessel myself, but I seem to procrastinate to much - and have to many things in mind that I also want to build ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T11:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can compensate for imbalanced radial payloads by having the lighter one further out, away from the center of mass.
