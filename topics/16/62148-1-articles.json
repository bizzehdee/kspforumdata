I think the mod should move this to suggestions instead, because i think it would be great in stock, if the controls for it got worked out. kinda like the long arm the shuttle(or was it ISS?) has for moving big parts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ You forgot solar panels. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garek","CreatedById":73214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to create a bearing by putting a ball of outwards facing landing gear inside a ball of structural panels.
