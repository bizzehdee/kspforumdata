Parts started exploding at 60km, and by the time i reached 40km, everything was gone. \u00A0Tried it a few times with different heights, but it didn\u0027t make any difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point I basically accepted that it was never going to aerocapture, so set it up to do a simple braking burn at a higher periapsis. That just led me to a different even stranger issue, with the asteroid basically not existing when i start to burn, no matter how low my throttle is. \u00A0It would clip my ship about halfway into the asteroid, then both my ship and the asteroid go up into a giant fireball. Have tried different braking maneuvers, but it seems like nothing works at all once I\u0027m inside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo at this point I\u0027m pretty much stumped, is there anything different I can try, or something that needs to be fixed in the save file perhaps?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T00:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is interesting. It was my impression that no asteroids of any size provide aero shielding. But it sounds like your class D ones did. Odd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should definitely take the thing a little ways down into the atmosphere for the enhanced Oberth, if for no other reason. But keep things retrograde, not prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe clipping thing is obviously a bug. I\u0027ve never seen that happen\u00A0myself.
