I decided I\u0027d try to use MechJeb to get there at first, so I can see what it does about having to adjust itself because of Minmus\u0027 orbital plane(is that the right term?) not being level with Kerbin\u0027s or Mun\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a ship that I\u0027m pretty sure will get there and back...with a couple problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) In transferring to Minmus, my final booster stage runs out of fuel and I have to stage out to my lander stage, using fuel. Now, I had to do this with my Mun lander and it was no problem. However, being that the burn takes longer and that my landing engine doesn\u0027t exactly have the \u0022oomph\u0022 that the others have, this takes a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) When MechJeb gets to the \u0022Mid course adjustment\u0022 stage, the whole thing just goes to heck and I have to end it. It never makes the proper adjustment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI highly suspect that it isn\u0027t a problem with MechJeb, because I used the MechJeb pod on top of someone\u0027s anti-matter engine add-on to land on Minmus and come back, and did it with no problems whatsoever, same orbit height, ascent paths, aps, peris and everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m thinking that it\u0027s my ship that I have built...well...wrong. I\u0027ll attach the .craft file for someone to look at and see if they can tell me what I did to make MechJeb not send this thing to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers to you all, and thanks in advance to anyone that can help me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH]32964[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T03:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts probably taking too long to raise your AP to minmus height. This means MJ knows it needs to adjust but it took solong for your engine to get there, your now out of position and MJ cant compensate and gets confused. Long story short - a failed transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour transfer engine needs to be a little stronger. I build three stages into my rockets. A lifter \u002B kerbin circulariser, a transfer \u002B mun/minmus circle and then a lander. I can then tune the fuel and engines for each phase of the mission because the requirements really are quite different.
