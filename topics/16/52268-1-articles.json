As the fuel in them gets used up, they detach and you don\u0027t loose engine power, because there\u0027s no engines on them. Once the fuel burns down to the grey tanks, they start to drop off with the staging, but they all fuel the central tank. If I wanted to make this more efficient, I would use the small grey tanks only for the other engines and double up on the orange outer tanks. You could even add radial engines to increase power, and put more engines on the girders, while adding more fuel to the outside that drops off once it\u0027s spent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T21:19:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 09:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YourEverydayWaffle","CreatedById":83957,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T21:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELifting more parts isn\u0027t too hard.
