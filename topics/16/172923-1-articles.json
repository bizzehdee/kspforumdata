I\u0027m using MechJeb, but only when the margin of error that could lead to mission failure is within tolerable limit, such as while in orbit, interplanetary transfer, etc (My rule is NEVER USE MechJeb while inside atmosphere or suborbital trajectory). Yes, I had to babysit MechJeb to ensure that my mission goes smoothly, I only manually override the control when there\u0027s operation that must be done ABSOLUTELY by me. For example: A common usage for MechJeb for me is sending station parts. During launch, ascent and orbit, the rocket is fully under my control. Then after the stable orbit achieved, I let MechJeb to take over control for rendezvous, but I watch the whole process to ensure that things goes smoothly and to make sure MechJeb did\u0027t use too much fuel than necessary.

Sometimes you didn\u0027t build up enough speed during launch, and sometimes the stage you\u0027re using doesn\u0027t have enough oomph to keep rising when horizontal. You can raise your nose a bit to counter this, or start your circulation burn a little earlier. Then, of course, there\u0027s the launch that can be fine-tuned and the ship itself can pretty much always be optimized a bit more.
