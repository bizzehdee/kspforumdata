I like making big ships and would love to be able to place a few extra reaction wheels and not have to wait a few minutes just to turn my ship around without RCS.

Standard SAS will now be reaction wheels to add more torque in all 3 axes and ASAS will serve as the computer controler unit that tells them what to do when engaged.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T19:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo the SAS units produce torque around their own centers of mass or around the ship\u0027s center of mass. i.e. if I used a tri-coupler and placed 3 SAS units, how would the torque from each of those add up?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
