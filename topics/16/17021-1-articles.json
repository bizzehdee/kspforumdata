As the inclination changes, slide along the blue-brown border to stay between the green markers. For descending node, it\u0027s a south burn. To stop at 6 degrees use, map view and stop the burn when your blue orbit line matches the purple Minmus one... or use MechJeb that tells you your inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Just make sure Minmus\u0027s plane matches the photo. If it is positioned the other way, going from top left to bottom right, your plane will be opposite Minmus\u0027s. Ideally you want to launch just before Minmus\u0027s plane flattens out, rather than just after, for the best timing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tested this repeatedly with some small 1man craft and found the fuel difference to be negligible. On my test craft after getting to minmus with an inclination change, avg fuel left was 551.7L, by using the inclined orbit method, avg left was 557.2. Fuel was read at the moment there was a Minmus encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, you can then wait for Minmus rise to do your injection burn as well.
