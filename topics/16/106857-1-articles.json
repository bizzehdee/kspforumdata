Even if you don\u0027t consider the real world scientific problems with \u0022making xenon\u0022, it makes sense as a gameplay element. Ion engines are crazy efficient, way more efficient than anything else in the game, so it makes sense that, as a drawback/trade off for the efficiency, you can only get it from Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:44:04Z","Content":"To be fair, in real life we don\u0027t have a magic box that can convert any asteroid into LF\u002BO either. \n\nI still really don\u0027t see that it\u0027s any different making Xenon than LF\u002BO (in-game that is). Not being able to stops you being able to make a one-stop-shop refuelling station.

Maybe an even higher tier IRSU converter that fits only into a Mk. 2/Mk. 3 fuselage and instead of converting rocks, would skim Jool and get maybe 1 Xe per 200 intakeAir. Too tiny to make into a mod all by itself, perhaps a possible roll-in to a larger mod that adds air, food, water, etc. consumables. \\*offtopic\\*"}]}
