Research is not progressing and the science missions I do get are generally well beyond my abilities. For example, I frequently get missions to test equipment I have not unlocked yet. Is there a way to get more, do-able science missions?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-06T23:09:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting a test equipment mission will temporarily unlock the required part. It will be locked again once the mission is successfully completed. Accepting such missions without completing is a technique that can be used to have access to parts higher in the tree when you are short of science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-07T00:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I don\u0027t ever consider contracts as science opportunities.

As 5th Horseman said -- the best method is to unlock science instruments and then take them around the system and perform\u00A0experiments in new places. This should allow you to progress your research.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs James Kerman said, part test contracts always give you the parts you need to complete the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that -- the way contracts work is that as you complete them, you gain reputation.
