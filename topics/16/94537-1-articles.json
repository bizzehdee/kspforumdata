I just discovered MechJeb and am trying to learn how to auto-orbit around Kerbin. I have my unmanned probe and enable the Auto Ascent and set the orbit to 100 km (I\u0027ve also tried 90 and 80). I engage auto pilot and launch off. Once I launch, the probe accurately reaches the apoapsis at 100km, and then I see a node get created and it\u0027s correctly set to orbit Kerbin at 100km (give or take a few km). However, when the rocket approaches the node where you should start up the rockets again ...nothing happens. The ship just starts falling back down to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that because maybe my ship isn\u0027t build very well, or am I missing something?
