Solar panels have to be controlled by solar regulators (which they themselves take up some of that power) or they will surge the system and your big fancy rover is now a lead brick. With the solar regulator impeding the amount of power being given, it\u0027s diminishing returns. Meanwhile most engines, even electric ones, need a jolt of power to get started initially. It\u0027s easier to maintain momentum then to create it from nothing.
