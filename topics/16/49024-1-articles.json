Basically, if the experiment makes it back to Kerbin and is recovered, you get 100% of the value (but could potentially complete fewer tests) or you can transmit the report back, but that report has less value to the scientists than recovering the entire experiment would.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T20:45:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecertain experiments give you 100% scientific value when transmitted (like crew reports). Others only offer a fraction of a return. So thinks like sample gathering and goo experiments lose relevance when transmitted as opposed to be returned to the ground and recovered. Try doing good experiments and save them, but dont transmit them. land the craft safely and recover. you will get 100% of the scientific data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fraczus","CreatedById":31354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T20:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo fly back to the Kerbin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fraczus","CreatedById":31354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T21:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EF**k I landed few minutes ago and I saw this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3IWIyCd.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/3IWIyCd.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E400 science for 1 mission! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just have to share it with you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
