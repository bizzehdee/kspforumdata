The trajectory should show it going around the Mun and back to Kerbin. Be sure to practice in Sandbox with patched conics though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T22:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe said minmus... not Mun..

It\u0027s possible, but you\u0027ll need near perfect precision. You need to burn so that your AP is past Minmus, and you pass through Minmus in front of it. You\u0027ll want to start as low as possible, and you\u0027ll need to use maneuver nodes (PreciseNode is a near must to).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wcmille","CreatedById":151345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T21:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you launch from KSC when KSC is at the Minmus-Kerbin ascending or descending node, you can launch into the same inclination as Minmus without much extra work by aiming for 84 degrees or 96 degrees during launch (depending on the node). Once you have the same inclination, free return works just like Mun and is easy to find through trial-and-error with Maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is typically most fuel efficient to circularize as low as you can. I like to use 75km as my launch orbits, because I like a little margin above the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
