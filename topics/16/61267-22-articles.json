lot of things from KSP, and i usually end up being called \u0027the smart guy\u0027 everytime in physics class.But anyways: here are a few of many things i learned:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- To calculate delta-v, \u003Cstrong\u003Emultiply\u003C/strong\u003E the \u003Cstrong\u003EISP\u003C/strong\u003E of your engine\u00A0with the \u003Cstrong\u003Enatural logorithm\u003C/strong\u003E of the \u003Cstrong\u003Eqoutient\u003C/strong\u003E of the \u003Cstrong\u003Edry\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Ewet\u003C/strong\u003E mass of your craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003EDon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E use MechJeb too often.While the autopilot is\u00A0really handy, it will take a toll on your piloting skills.You will eventually rely too much on the autopilot, and be \u003Cstrong\u003Edependent \u003C/strong\u003Eon it in a later stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Learn to take advantage of the \u003Cstrong\u003EOberth Effect\u003C/strong\u003E.Whilst orbiting\u00A0a moon that orbits really far away from it\u0027s parent planet, burn out of it\u0027s SOI, and set the initial periapsis around the parent planet\u00A0the lowest you can get it without entering it\u0027s atmosphere, \u003Cstrong\u003Eif\u003C/strong\u003E it has an atmosphere.Once outside the SOI of the moon, warp to your periapsis and burn.By doing this, you consume the least amount of fuel when leaving it\u0027s gravitational influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- If you want to make your orbit\u0027s more perfect, set your thrust limiter on your engine really low, go to a point approximately \u003Cstrong\u003Einbetween\u003C/strong\u003E the apoapsis and periapsis, then burn \u003Cstrong\u003Eradially or anti-radially\u003C/strong\u003E, depending on which side you are on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- When building planes, put your wings \u003Cstrong\u003Ea bit\u003C/strong\u003E farther back to prevent constant stalling.Side fact: \u003Cstrong\u003EDon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E overuse the \u003Cstrong\u003EAdvanced Canards\u003C/strong\u003E, as your plane will have to strong lift and will flip your plane upside down on takeoff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- When departing for other planets, know your \u003Cstrong\u003Ephase and ejection angles\u003C/strong\u003E.This prevents you from wasting a crazy amount of delta-v on getting to a place that\u0027s basically right next door to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- ALWAYS REMEMBER TO ACTION GROUP YOUR SOLAR PANELS!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- DON\u0027T FORGET THE SOLAR PANELS!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Opt for a minimalistic design.Build rockets that have just enough fuel and safety countermeasures\u00A0to get you somewhere and back safely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Always have an extra battery or two\u00A0onboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mostly learned these things during my rookie years, back in 0.19, all the way\u00A0up to 0.24 (no kidding).Here\u0027s one thing i said when i first joined this forum around 2 years ago.Back at the time, i knew very little about how KSP works.I literally asked why my game wasn\u0027t budging, because i was on the dark side of the Mun with zero eletricity.YUP.THAT HAPPEND.Anyways this a really lenghty
