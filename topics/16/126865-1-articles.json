When reentering, you \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E as much drag as possible to bleed off speed quickly before heat kills you. My technique for this it to point radial\u002B, presenting the belly of the plane to the airstream and dramatically increasing drag and rate of deceleration, as well as spreading the heating over the entire craft instead of concentrating it in the nose. As the atmosphere thickens it will become tougher to stay pointed that way, but a high angle of attack will still be helpful.
