Keep in mind, the actual shuttle\u0027s SSME\u0027s can gimbal to around 10.5 degrees up or down in pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the largest gimbal range for a stock engine is maybe 2.5 on the Poodle, which itself doesn\u0027t really generate much thrust. In order to do it with a low gimbal engine you\u0027re going to have to pre-angle the engines so that they\u0027re thrusting exactly through the center of mass, and then, ensure that the center of mass barely shifts as you consume fuel. In theory, you might be able to have a series of engines pre-angled at different angles and turn them on/off via action groups, but your timing is going to have to be pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I wish you luck. It won\u0027t be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - Just for a picture to make what I\u0027m talking about more clear...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tg2reJC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tg2reJC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2 - I just noticed Sirine\u0027s post. Like all of those shuttles, you could follow the Soviet Buran style \u0022shuttle\u0022 design and have the external tank carry it\u0027s own engine. That\u0027s going to make the center of thrust balancing a lot easier since then the shuttle will only have to support it\u0027s own mass, and not that of the fuel tank as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-09T02:39:16Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2013 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Firov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T02:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot... 100% stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59664-Tetrarch-Space-Shuttle-%28Carries-Payload!%29?highlight=shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59664-Tetrarch-Space-Shuttle-%28Carries-Payload!%29?highlight=shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59599-Working-75x75-Space-Shuttle?highlight=shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59599-Working-75x75-Space-Shuttle?highlight=shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36120-Space-Shuttle-Atlantis?highlight=shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36120-Space-Shuttle-Atlantis?highlight=shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55538-100-Stock-Space-Shuttle?highlight=shuttle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55538-100-Stock-Space-Shuttle?highlight=shuttle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xzxvrx","CreatedById":57321,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T02:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out EJ_SA on Twitch (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/ej_sa/profile\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/ej_sa/profile\u003C/a\u003E), he builds massive stock shuttles, with working doors and everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice would be to angle the engines on your orbiter (if you are going off the design of the US shuttle)to get your center of thrust to go through your center of mass.
