When you get to around 30 minutes to your launch window, return to the craft in orbit and burn. Alternatively, launch a small satellite to a very high orbit (say 1000km) and warp from there. If you are afraid of missing your launch window use the Kerbal alarm clock mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T04:44:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 04:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Awaras\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XoX","CreatedById":60908,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T04:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright.

I actually moved my station out to 650 before it grew too large. I basically used the opportunity to get it\u0027s fuel storage tanks full while it was still small and then moved it out there. I will have to modify my fuel transport vehicle to start refueling missions but it has two full orange tanks sitting at 650 right now so that will be a while.
