I\u0027m confused as to how to operate them. In the assembly at SPH or VAB and you right click on a rapier, it gives you the various options; Automatic or Manual switching, Toggle mode, on or off, ETC. Do you leave it on Automatic or what? I\u0027d like to be able to control them via action groups. Also, what arrangement of fuel tanks are needed, jet fuel vrs. rocket? Is there a specific tutorial somewhere for this? I would appreciate any help. thanks, One Spaced Cowboy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T22:47:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedCowboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T01:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust leave it on automatic. It makes it really easy to fly with one. How much liquid fuel you need vs oxidizer depends on how you fly it. If you take a steep ascent path straight to space and don\u0027t bother speeding up much under the engines before they switch to rocket mode, you might only end up using around 30-40 liquid fuel per engine, but if you pack on several air intakes and spend a while building speed in air breathing mode at 25-30km, then you\u0027ll use a lot more, like maybe 100 or more per engine. Once it switches to closed cycle, it burns just like a rocket, and liquid fuel and oxidizer run down at the same rate (with the 9:11 ratio).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey start out weak on takeoff, and you might need more of them than you would of other jet engines to get off the ground, but once you get past around 10km, their thrust starts picking up, and they are rather powerful in the uppermost parts of the atmosphere at very high speeds. They can run on a bit less air than the turbojet engines, but rather than fit less air intake, you should fit the same amount and use it to go faster before switching to rocket mode. Once in closed cycle/rocket mode, they are less efficient than most rockets but rather powerful, so you should have no trouble getting to orbit after that if you brought enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find the RAPIER engines make jet/rocket/wing SSTOs so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T09:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs thereaverofdarkness explained, RAPIERs are a hybrid engine that operate as a Jet engine or a Rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAutomatic or Manual switching\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf set to Automatic the game will automatically switch between Jet and Rocket mode, based upon availability of IntakeAir (ie. if starved of air, they switch to rocket mode).
