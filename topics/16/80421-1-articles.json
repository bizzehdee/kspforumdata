These usually make it to orbit with a bit of fuel left. The basic core uses the giant decoupler, 2 S3-14400 tanks, and 1 S3-3600 tank, along with a KS-25x4 cluster. So I simply attach 16 radial parachutes, along with a probe core, and some control systems. Splashdown is vertical at just above 9m/s... then all the fuel tanks cave in due to their low impact tolerance. How do I recover giant rocket cores? I\u0027m thinking of 2 ways to engineer this-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MOAR CHUTES!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MOAR CHUTES organized to have the stage land sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also make sure to attach batteries and an RTG to ensure a controlled landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo which of these options makes more sense? I think the sideways landing does, because when the stage tips over in the water in a vertical landing, the tanks will probably get destroyed.

In KSP the impact tolerance is tested for every part when you land in the water. Land on, er, land and it\u0027s only the ground-touching parts that are checked. Girders, if you need them, have a very high impact tolerance so you can safely dustdown at a higher speed - although I still aim for 5-10m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Russoft","CreatedById":111646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T19:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMore chutes, landing legs, and possibly even a powered landing (in the last few meters).
