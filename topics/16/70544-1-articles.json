Essentially you attach four liquid fueled boosters around your central rocket using radial decouplers (though you can also do it with six). Next you set up the fuel lines such that two of the boosters are feeding their neighbours and these \u0022neighbours\u0022 in turn feed the central rocket. All five of these rocket engines are going to fire at launch. Thus two of the boosters will drain first, their neighbours next and lastly your central rocket stage. Then you manually adjust the staging of the radial decouplers such that the first boosters to drain are decoupled in the first stage (after launch), and their neighbours in the next. The overall effect is that you get the benefits of four boosters while your central rocket is fully fuelled at 20-30km above the surface.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bearsh","CreatedById":107549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T02:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright guys thanks for all the replies, I\u0027m sure to be trying out asparagus staging!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
