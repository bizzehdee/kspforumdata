I have begun designing my drilling platform for a refueling base on Mun. I know Minmus would be easier but... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe platform will be permanent. I plan to truck the fuel to a shuttle. My platform plan is to start with an engineer in a cupola, then use two large ore holding tanks and four drills. I learned real fast that if the drills are mounted too close to the ground it will shake the platform unmercifully. Raised them and added struts, just in case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove the tanks is the ISRU. On the sides I\u0027ve mounted duel Rockomax X200-32 empty fuel tanks (half an orange tank each). Above that is an empty RCS tank. I mounted the side tanks on a structural pylon but will probably change these to eliminate the possibility of accidental decoupling. I ran a fuel line from the holding tanks to the LFO tanks. It works though maybe it would without them? Couldn\u0027t find any mention of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 4 large radiator panels for heat control - is that still necessary? Doesn\u0027t matter, they look cool. I also have enough gigantor solar arrays to completely power the platform during daylight hours and fully charge the battery. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the point of all the previous ramble - how do I power this at night? At the moment I have single Z-4K. At 4000 units with drills drawing 15/s each, I can watch it quickly depleting once the sun sets. I doubt I could carry enough batteries to matter. The alternatives I see are fuel cells which require LFO to work (seems to defeat the purpose) or just running out of juice (down time). Would it be better to only have one drill but multiple platforms with more batteries? It looks like it takes a very long time to mine and convert fuel, so I was trying to speed things up. Is there a clever way to keep things running around the clock?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T01:14:10Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Shirt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T19:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not against mods, I\u0027d recommend the Near Future lines of mods, particularly Near Future Electric, which includes Nuclear generators that can run for many many years.
