I\u0027ve only successfully pulled a single one out of it\u0027s deathspin to land it, and it\u0027s frankly INFURIATING me. I simply don\u0027t understand why spaceplane SSTOs do this. Are there any SSTO designers out there that have had this problem with earlier designs and worked out a solution for yourself? Considering this seems to happen to all my planes no matter the size or shape, I don\u0027t think my craft themselves are the problem, I\u0027m guessing either it\u0027s the overall \u0027wide wing/delta wing\u0027 design shape I stick to or there\u0027s some other unknown mechanic or problem I haven\u0027t addressed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help from the better/most knowledgeable SSTO designers on what causes this and how they fix it would be really appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddendum: I\u0027m a stock player.

At take off I assume your plane flies stable, CoL just behind CoG. But as you expend fuel your CoG will shift. Possibly to behind your CoL. While in space this is totally irrelevant but as soon as you hit atmo again your CoL comes back into play. If it is indeed in front, your plane will almost certainly flip and loose control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo check this drain all fuel tanks in the SPH to the level they are when you reenter the atmosphere and pull up the CoG and CoL markers.

I could have used a bigger tank in the middle but then i wouldn\u0027t have been able to fly out fuel balanced. Note that the structure at the rear end with the 3 fuel lines is actually attached to the middle tank (kinda tricky). Due to the fuel pipes fuel is first flown out of all 4 aircraft fuel tanks simultanously, then the small ones between the aircraft tanks, then the front and end tank in the middle and then the center tank. And the CoG is precisely in the center of the center tank. This ensures, that the CoG never moves, no matter how much fuel is already flown out. This is also important since there are 3 more engines below the craft for VTOL operations in vacuum (visiting moons, Moho etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1greywind","CreatedById":82369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T11:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use more than one fuel tank, make sure that your engines drain fuel evenly from each one.
