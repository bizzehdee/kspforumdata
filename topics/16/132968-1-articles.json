The center of lift is well below the center of mass\u00A0 just as all those youtube videos said, but it won\u0027t do the trick.

Again, the youtubers seem to do just fine. Even if I place the center of lift very near the center of mass, it\u0027s still so cloggy to controll that getting into orbit becomes a real difficulty with a limited amount of fuel.

Using just the one Reliant, (no gimbal), and 4 boosters (which also do not gimbal), set lower than the nozzle on your Reliant, AND using those small solid fins (no adjustable control), AND that they are set so high up on the boosters, I would try AV-R8s also, set nearer the bottom of the boosters...
