Not sure how far you\u0027d be willing to go with aesthetic change, but I was thinking that balancing out the rear with an equally heavy (and extra engine) part angled downward might be the way to go. You\u0027d have to elevate your landing gear but other than that I don\u0027t think instability can be helped as long as your CoM, CoT and CoL are all offset from eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks awesome though, well done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shrike42","CreatedById":61104,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T02:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGet your wheels straight and flat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Syhrus","CreatedById":64839,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T02:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour flipping issue is thanks to your COT here. Because it is slightly up from your COM, the engines will cause the plane to tilt backwards under thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your COL is close, but forward of your COM, which helps for takeoff, but at high speeds actually causes your plane to become more unstable, as the nose will try to lift up. Couple this with the aforementioned tilt induced by your engines, and you\u0027re gonna have a bad time anywhere faster than 100m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurning on the runway is caused by a glitch in the Spaceplane Hangar\u0027s \u0027symmetry\u0027 option. For reasons unknown to science, if you place something using symmetry mode it has slightly more drag/weight/Element Zero (I actually don\u0027t know what is increased) than its symmetrical partner. This effect is not noticeable in flight, but on the runway, where things are more precise, you will drift off to your favored side of building. You can counteract this by either building your crafts one side then the other when using symmetry (place 1 set of wings on the left, then the next set on the right) or by using ASAS to keep the craft stable on the runway until you reach takeoff speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the wheels falling off, I\u0027d take a guess that has to do with the platforms they\u0027re mounted on.
