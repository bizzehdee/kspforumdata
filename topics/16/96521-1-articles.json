The first is a \u0022rescue\u0022 lander, capable of landing on Eve, retrieving 3 Kerbals, and then returning to orbit. The second is an interplanetary rig (also carrying extra monopropellant for the lander), which is meant to act as a tug to pull the lander to Eve. I have managed to become reasonably capable at establishing/matching orbits, so that I can launch the rig, match orbit with the lander, intersect it, and zip right up to it within a couple of hundred meters no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere it all is falling apart is once I get within 100m. My lander, Ray, is in a slightly tumbling orbit. My big rig Venkman can match it up to a point, but once the two get close enough they continue to close and separate so quickly that by the time I\u0027ve switched ships, set the autopilot to target, (the docking ports on both ships), and it lines up, the other ship is unaligned and either closing or falling away so rapidly that by the time I\u0027ve switched ships, set the autopilot to target, and it lines up, the other ship is unaligned and either closing or falling away so rapidly that... and on and on until its a crash or a realign that starts the whole cycle over again. Ray\u0027s out of monopropellant and Venkman\u0027s still lugging the structurally awkward get-into-orbit stage so it\u0027s a bit of a hippo ballet anyways, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m wondering is, (and apologies if this has come up before; I did a lot of searching and couldn\u0027t find a thread or answer anywhere), is there a way, when setting the autopilot on one of my two ships to \u0027target\u0027, to get it to keep autopiloting towards the target once I switch to ship two. If ship one would keep pointing itself towards the docking port of ship two (and Jeb is piloting ship one, the lazy sod) while I was in charge of ship two and telling it to keep pointing itself at the docking port of ship one, poor Bob and co would have already been home from Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s do-able, how do I do it? And if it isn\u0027t do-able, it might be worth sticking into a future update maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T07:12:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou just need the ship you are not flying to remain still (i.e not be rotating). It doesn\u0027t need to be being piloted towards you, it just needs to be not tumbling. (I guess it is technically possible to dock with a tumbling ship, but its pretty difficult).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can achieve that by switching to the target ship, engaging SAS (just using the basic \u0022Stability\u0022 option) then waiting for it to stabilise. If you have RCS enabled it will likely waste a lot of mono-propellant if the ship is big and heavy. The best thing to do is disable RCS and let SAS get it stable just using reaction wheels. It may take a while but it will eventually stop rotating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen switch to the other ship and dock with it. It won\u0027t start rotating again by magic; it will remain still unless you hit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have the patience to wait for SAS to get the ship stable a quick \u0022cheat\u0022 is to time accelerate for a moment (hit \u0027.\u0027 then \u0027,\u0027 straight away). A limitation of the game\u0027s physics engine is that rotation is not modeled during time acceleration, and will instantly get set to zero. This is not such a cheat as it appears, since the same thing happens any time the ship is out of physics range (e.g. you go back to the KSC), so it would happen sooner or later anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t already have it I recommend Navyfish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod.

Aim across the port as best you can and use SAS to keep you facing retrograde, with navball in target mode. Might take several loops, but eventually you\u0027ll get really close.

If your ships are drifting together/apart that means their relative velocities are not matched. Not only is it necessary to get the two craft close together in the orbit, it\u0027s also necessary to kill essentially all the relative velocity before you can attempt docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key for me was understanding the markers on the navball. Once you are in target mode {click the velocity readout to change modes}, the yellow markers (prograde/retrograde) show the direction of your relative velocity and the velocity readout at the top of the navball shows the value of the relative velocity. Once you are getting close to your target, you need to bring the relative velocity down to zero and then start the docking process. Bringing relative velocity to zero essentially means you are just matching orbits extremely closely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the two craft are \u0027floating\u0027 next to each other, you can start orienting them the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.

When you are close, you need to make sure that your nav ball is in target mode and that you burn retrograde. This has two effects. the first is to kill the relevant velocity between the two ships. The secondary effect is that by doing this, you are also matching the orbits more closely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeroWolfe","CreatedById":135323,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T15:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s got it, thank you one and all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T15:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood stuff \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T14:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that I found to make docking so much easier was getting the prograde marker in the center of my target marker...
