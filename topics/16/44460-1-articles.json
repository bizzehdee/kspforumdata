Things to watch out for are separating your fuel stacks too far using girders, you can actually make a more stable rocket having the whole thing streamlined, though it can be difficult to attach the parts. I\u0027d say it\u0027s far easier than the effort of actually flying the ship to Jool, so it seems worthwhile. Also try not to put several small objects on using symmetry, or several little fuel tanks. Make simple stacks with large fuel tanks. Use a single inline RCS tank and a single inline battery. Plan your strut placement carefully so you don\u0027t waste struts, but don\u0027t be too frugal with them either. Struts process easily and keep your ships rigid which also makes processing easier! If it wobbles, put struts where it is wobbling. And if you want to get really frugal with your part count, you can put on a single set of 3 or 4 RCS-thruster blocks centered around the ship\u0027s average center of mass (considering how it will change during flight) instead of a set at each end. This allows you to rotate and translate smoothly with RCS while using fewer thruster blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t throw lights all over your ship! It looks great and is oh-so useful for seeing the thing at night, but murders your processing speed.

Trying to minimize part count on an all-in-1 thing usually means having to reduce or eliminate the capabilities of its various components. Plus, it takes forever to do burns with its nuke engines because it\u0027s so heavy and they have such low thrust. And finally, you\u0027re putting all your eggs in 1 basket so 1 failure can scupper the entire expedition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a flotilla, you can optimized each component payload (lander, rover, probe, Kerbal can, etc.) for its job without worrying about its impact on the other components, so usually end up with more capability overall. This is especially true when going to place with 1 or more moons because you can send specialized stuff directly to the target moon instead of having the delta-V for that side trip rolled in with that for every other part of the mission. Then, because you\u0027re keeping the components separate most of the time and only bringing a couple together at once for brief periods, you never have a lot of parts in 1 place. The downside is, you usually have to do more launches and dockings to get a flotilla off the ground than with an all-in-1, and of course you have to do multiple transfers, captures, and whatnot, plus probably more dockings at the destination. But OTOH, because none of the ships involved are that big, these maneuvers aren\u0027t that big a deal and the more of them you do, the better at them you become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my own messing around, I\u0027ve found that I can build all the capability I want, plus some lagniappe for emergencies, into no more than about 30 tons, usually rather less. So I have a standard non-asparagus ascent stage that will lift 35-40 tons and send almost every component up with that. I\u0027ve also got a standard transfer tug I launch the same way. This consists of the 3-section fuel tank with a big nuke engine on 1 end and a docking port on the other (I think the tank and engine are KSPX). Even after burning tug fuel to rendezvous and dock with a mission component, I\u0027ve still got over 4000m/s delta-V for even my heaviest components (and lots more for the lighter ones), which is enough to go pretty much anywhere. If I want to send something home, I either set up a Kethane system or, because I\u0027ve got several of these tugs in the system, I can pool the remaining fuel into 1 for the trip back if none of them have enough on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T09:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to thank you all for the wondrous help!
