When you have an \u0022unpaired\u0022 stabilizer like that (i.e. fin on top doesn\u0027t have corresponding fin on bottom), it can cause problems because it uses its actuator to try to help you with roll, and ends up inducing yaw. I can imagine that this might be exacerbated in your case because your craft has very little aerodynamic roll authority (just those two little canards, and they\u0027re close to the ship axis so they don\u0027t have much lever arm to work with), which might cause your vertical stabilizer to grab a large share of the roll authority with tragic results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, consider what happens when your vertical stabilizer tries to control your yaw. Let\u0027s say the plane has deviated so that its nose is pointing slightly left of center, so SAS tries to use the stabilizer to turn you to the right. This will make the plane roll to the left (since the stabilizer is unpaired). So SAS will try to correct to roll right. And if you haven\u0027t disabled roll authority on the stabilizer, it\u0027ll try to use the stabilizer to roll the plane to the right, which is directly fighting against the need to yaw right, so you\u0027ve just neutered your yaw authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also advise adding some ailerons out near the wingtips on your big delta, to give you some aerodynamic roll authority.

Also structural fuselages in front of your tanks can help by using the relatively heavy cockpit to shift the CoM. In addition to all that you can add smal fuel tanks to the front of your plane, lock these and then tweak fuel levels (dunno if RCS build aid actually detects locked tanks though) or experiment in the editor a little. Remember where your CoM is when full (maybe mark it with a massless part) and then empty most of the fuel, simulating how much you have left upon reentry. Then shift the fuel around to find the fuel configuration puts the CoM back where it should be. Then after your reentry burn but before reentering the atmosphere use TAC-Fuel Balancer to dump any excess fuel and pump the fuel to where it should be. I used to have an enormous SSTO (~380 tons on the runway) that could get 60 tons to orbit. To make it fly with any payload weight I stuck the wet CoM dead centre of the 24m long cargo bay. When leaving the atmosphere I pumped fuel around to shift the CoM, thereby pitching the plane (similar to the SR-71 Blackbird) because I had nowhere near enough pitch authority. Upon reentry I had a few disasters until I figured out that I had to pump ~7000 units of fuel right to the front to make it stable when dry. This had the added benefit that I could send it into a controlled crazy and uncontrolled spin if I overshot KSC by too much, dumping about 1000m/s in a few seconds, and then pump everything as far forward as possible to make it superstable and let it recover itself. Pump it around a bit again and I could fly it down to the runway safely.
