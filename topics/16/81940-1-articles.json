No problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I finally got all the parts like the clampotron sr. to build my station. It went up in several sections. It seems to be solid, no wobble. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ridiculously huge. I had a bigger more complex one in the old .23 version. The game has been slowing down when I get close to the station. Not totally surprising. I\u0027ve turned down the rendering from fantastic to good. Turned down the texture to half res. I installed a mod that was supposed to... reduce and pre load the textures, in any case it\u0027s supposed to reduce memory usage. But it\u0027s still running a little slow. Not a problem. I can deal with that. But now it\u0027s like the game is stuck. You can move the camera around, click on things, change to the orbital map and back. Every thing works but you can\u0027t leave the station. Hit escape, the menu comes up, click on space center, the button pushes, but nothing happens. Stuck. You can then resume flight. That works, as does settings. You can\u0027t switch to another ship. You can\u0027t save. And I think that\u0027s the real problem. The F5 save button does not work. I think it can\u0027t save to go back to the Space center. Turn off the program and reload and the last ship has not docked yet. Like it reverted slightly. Can\u0027t save?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running out of ideas, at least ones I can find searching. Not great at searching. What else should I be trying to do or should I just give up on the station? Here\u0027s a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epic, if I can get it too load. Does it look ridicules to you? I mean I might be able to get by with less solar panels but I was actually hoping to expand it farther.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i61.tinypic.com/jhdhu1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jhdhu1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T04:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should probably go in the Support thread.
