Minmus? Can you do a rendezvous/docking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you want to make a Kerbin --\u0026gt; Jool transfer with a periapsis at roughly the altitude of Pol\u0027s orbit. This is a case where aerobraking is not the best option because maneuvering in Jool\u0027s gravity well is fairly expensive. Once you\u0027ve reached your Jool periapsis, burn until you are just captured by the planet and adjust your orbit\u0027s inclination at the highest altitude (slowest speed) orbital node you\u0027ve got. If the orbital nodes are at high velocity points of the orbit and off by a significant amount, it might be cheaper to make a massive adjustment at apoapsis and bring one of the nodes out to a higher altitude, lower speed point in the orbit where it can be corrected more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the ship, there\u0027s not much to it. If you\u0027re going with a 1 kerbal vessel, you can use the Mk1 command module, an ASAS, an X200-32 fuel tank, and one LV-N engine. Use the long trusses to extend your landing gear past the nozzle of the LV-N and you\u0027re set. The ship as described has nearly 10 km/s of delta-v and masses roughly 20 tons. If you can get that into orbit as is, it is more than capable of getting you to Pol and landing (~2km/s to get to Jool, ~2km/s to be captured at Jool, ~2km/s to rendezvous with Pol, ~200 m/s to land.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you would want to save as much fuel as possible for the trip for the inevitable deviations from the ideal, but if you need to use part of the delta-v to get to LKO you could also add a docking port and refuel before departing for Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T22:55:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 10:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jason Patterson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomondclaw","CreatedById":67011,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T14:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks you guys I\u0027ll try that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
