Easiest to design since everything\u2019s there, but hard to get where you want it due to the sheer size and mass. Very expensive craft and one failure will lose the entire thing, but only needs one (admittedly LARGE) rocket to get it there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe modular mining base: why send everything at once when you can break it down into bitesize pieces and send them all separately instead. Send the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converters, drills, solar panels etc. separately and then stick them together on site.\u00A0Assembling a mining base on the surface isn\u2019t easy with just stock parts because the terrain is rarely smooth and flat, but you can usually find a reasonable area (or one of Minmus\u2019 flats) and connect them up by using wheels to drive them into each other. Multiple vessels that all need some parts (command, power, control, rockets to land, wheels etc.) and multiple launches make it a more expensive option overall, but it\u2019s a lot more flexible and lower risk as losing one module is only part of the total and a replacement is cheaper to build. Requires precision landing skills to land within close proximity of previously landed modules, but since you\u2019ll need wheels to attach everything on the ground \u201Cclose proximity\u201D can be a few kilometres away. You can also expand it if you need e.g. more drills or more power generation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe featherweight fueller-upper: Make one small mining module with the bare minimum of equipment to operate the system. Cheap, easy to launch and land, but the small drills aren\u2019t as efficient and the 1.25m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converter is horribly wasteful (it has a 10% fuel yield from the same amount of ore compared to the 2.5m) so it\u2019s more of a prototype/baby\u2019s-first-mining-base option to dip your toes into off-world fuel production. Make it a rover and add a surface detector and it would make a good prospecting vessel or a mobile fuel station to fill up other small vessels to extend their operational life.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe space-assembled super-base: much like the modular base, but you attach everything together on orbit before landing. Only really feasible for places with low gravity and no atmosphere since the assembled base will likely have centre of mass/thrust/drag imbalances that would make controlling it much harder on larger bodies, but docking in space is much easier than docking on the surface especially with 1.12\u2019s rotating docking ports.
