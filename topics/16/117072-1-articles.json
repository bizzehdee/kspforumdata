Though the turboramjets are using fuel from the rocket-stage too. It\u0027s not the first time I\u0027m facing this problem, but circumventing this effect wasn\u0027t a problem with smaller, or more sane crafts. Though here it hurts greatly.\n\nI have the following sub-ideal ideas to fix the issue:\n\n- manually closing off and opening the rocket fuselages (too much hassle, has to be a better way)\n\n- manually transfering fuel from the jet-stage before firing off the rocket engines (even more hassle, less time, minimal chance of keeping the CoM at the center)\n\n- placing the wings on decouplers to stop crossfeed (not sure it would work, even more instability could be fatal, too tempting to just jettison them )![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n- fuel lines from jet tanks to central rocket tank... (wait, I just thought of that one. Is this the solution I\u0027m looking for?)\n\nIt feels getting this to orbit would require a better solution. Got a better idea?\n\n\u003E ![EbRYNnK.png](http://i.imgur.com/EbRYNnK.png)\n\n[Craft file link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzRZoyJRTOWPQU1qMUZrLVkwdDg/view?usp=sharing) - Beware!

As long as the jets leave me with a minute plus burn time in fuel, I have plenty of time to transfer jet fuel. Since I always disable oxidizer flow on the front tank for aerodynamic stability for the early part of the burn, it\u0027s not like all fuel is immediately available to burn regardless.\n\nThe only space plane design of mine that does use the drag adding fuel lines uses the jet pods for (almost) all rocket fuel storage. I like the aesthetics of keeping jets to the same stack as intakes and keeping the rocket fuel in the same stack as the engines would have made the craft too long (the primary craft feature was 2.5 module long Mk2 cargo bay).\n\nI am considering bumping it up to 3 modules (the nuclear tugs that are its capstone cargo barely fit), but I\u0027m unsure of how that would affect design balance. I laugh because the craft was initially designed to lift scan-sats, but I realized that I could extend the design to handle tugs and reduce my fleet count. Since the proving flights it has become my go to lifter design.\n\nSadly, with RAPIERs just unlocked, it\u0027s probably time to build its successor. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll find a good 6 node configuration to replace the 4 turbo, 2 spike engine array. I\u0027ll still try to niavely replace the turbos with RAPIERs first though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T19:44:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:59:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Rockomax \u002B quad-adapter\n\nIndeed, such helps but that\u0027s a career plane, just after a rushed unlocking of the turboramjet.
