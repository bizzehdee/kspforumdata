Lets just say I had to quarantine the craft. Luckily I had a quicksave of my hard mode 0.90 career because the craft had infected my ship assembly station. At first I couldn\u0027t figure out what was going on... The station would de orbit and crash with my recovery pods... Second try my pods would keep getting thrust from the engines without animation or fuel consumption and with zero throttle, burning and burning until it would escape kerbin after I had first set up a suborbital...\n\nLuckily I figured out the pods were causing the issue so once I undocked the original module it could be pushed into suborbital with a tug...\n\nThere\u0027s a Kracken in there to be harvested but damn if it would be in my career save!!! I named the ship with tag (quarantine).\n\nBe careful with your symmetry... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nPS: Don\u0027t judge me haters for quicksaving my hard mode... do you like losing a multi-day mission and half your funds to the NAnan Kracken???

I barely use 6x in my career games but everything is possible in sandbox mode. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T21:37:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 09:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spaceBrezel**"}]}
