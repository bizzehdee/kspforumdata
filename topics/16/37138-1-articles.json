However during its re-entry it started to flip around and was unable to regain control. Now I cant get back into orbit (trying to find the perfect balance between weight and speed but that will take time and practice). However when I at least escape the atmosphere, I see if it will do fine in re-entry. None so far have had good gliding re-entrys and all go into a unrecoverable flip around 20,000m. What do I do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T05:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that the CoM is shifting backwards as you consume fuel.
