But I was just over-controlling and also trying to go in too many directions at once. After making a total hash of my 1st few EVAs (I\u0027m talking accidentally de-orbiting Kerbals, slamming into the target ship and sending it spinning wildly, and/or requiring like 20 minutes and 50% EVA fuel just to negotiate a 15m distance between 2 nearby ships), I eventually got the hang of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I do EVAs like I\u0027m maneuvering a ship to dock. I do just a gentle love tap on a single direction control. Then I coast in that direction until I\u0027ve gone far enough, then a single gentle love tap back the other way to stop. Then 1 tap in a new direction, and so on until I get where I\u0027m going. Works like a champ and now EVAs to me are 2nd nature, no trouble, take no time, and barely use any fuel. Although like HoY said, camera angle is critical sometimes because you don\u0027t have 1st person POV. But just remember, the WASD keys move EVAing Kerbals relative to the direction you\u0027re looking, so you can\u0027t really change the angle much without throwing off your maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m quite happy for the EVA thrust being as high as it is. This lets me jetpack to the top of things on other planets, especially useful for when I forget to put a ladder on the lander \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-07T02:21:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with your analysis; the EVA pack does feel a little overpowered.
