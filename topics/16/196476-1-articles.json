The motors and hinges that do extend/retract operations will often freeze up or fail. So, IRL, if you successfully manage to extend some gizmo then you never want to touch it again, because the process may never work again. So they usually don\u0027t even build anything to be retractable. It just extends and then locks into place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-23T07:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for ingame - there is no danger of leaving things extended during burns, unless the extended thing extends in front of the nozzle of one of your engines.
