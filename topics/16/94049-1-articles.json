You will have to check it occasionally, though. My first Laythe landing was a one way trip and I landed in water. Determined to walk on the surface, I looked where the nearest land is and started swimming, I set some weights on the Shift and W keys and went to sleep. Several hours later I was swimming parallel to the coast line I had aimed for. Well, I made the kerbal swim in the right direction again and after about a total of 4-5h at 4x timewarp the kerbal made it to the shore. I guess the direction changing must have had something to do with the planet rotation or something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough if it\u0027s only 5km, then it probably won\u0027t have much of an effect, but you never know...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T23:09:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Exrayfishx: I actually found the Kerbal animation\u0027s a bit derpy sometimes.
