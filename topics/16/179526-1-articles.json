For that I now first used the Nerv engines as they are so efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have built a few in my opinion quite nice spacecrafts after watching many videos on youtube and I successfully landed on Dres and even Moho already (without returning though). However during these missions and also my current mission to Moho with a new or modified spacecraft I ran into a problem that didn\u0027t seem to occur in the videos I\u0027ve seen. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s somehow caused by the Nerv engines or whatever but whenever I set a maneuver,\u00A0 no matter how big it is, the curved Delta v bar to the right of the navball is completely or half red and the estimated burn time is completely wrong aswell. When I start my burns at about half the time to the maneuver as the estimated burn time so that the burn splits into 2 equal sections before and after the maneuver node, my resulting orbit is quickly WAY off the planned one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t find out how to add screenshots but my burn is about 600 delta v and I have about 7000 with my current spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know what\u0027s the reason for this .... bug? This way I can\u0027t go to Moho or at least it\u0027s never as efficient as in the videos I\u0027ve watched.... annoying\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-04T14:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNerv engines don\u0027t seem to play nice with the new DeltaV burn time bar implemented last patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Specifically multiple Nervs I think? you might be alright with just one.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d wager a hotfix is incoming soonish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-04T14:48:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2018 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerTorge1208","CreatedById":192984,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-05T06:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223481163\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179526\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221541342897\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154640\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rocket In My Pocket\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Rocket In My Pocket said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNerv engines don\u0027t seem to play nice with the new DeltaV burn time bar implemented last patch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Specifically multiple Nervs I think? you might be alright with just one.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d wager a hotfix is incoming soonish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went back to version 1.4.5 and rebuilt my spacecraft, everything seems to work out without a problem there so it has to he because of the version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the information !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
