You (mostly) only get science for actual science. \n\nOne of the first steps for me was to send small, cheap science bombs (goo!) to as many biomes as I could reach. Don\u0027t forget that you can run every type of experiment from the launchpad, the runway, and every building at KSC to collect some science. Once you\u0027ve made enough to unlock the surface sample ability, this can be a pretty significant boost. \n\nAdmittedly it was a lot tougher to get my feet off the ground (as it were) than in previous version careers, but once you get used to the gathering, it starts to fall into place."},{"CreatedByName":"Ulzgoroth","CreatedById":142295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:56:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.0 is kicking my butt.

If you\u0027re having trouble getting launch to space to work, a few 1.0 key notes:\n\n-Don\u0027t go too fast in the lower atmosphere. You will have stability and heating problems. And don\u0027t even try to turn more than the tiniest bit at those altitudes.\n\n-Once you get to 20-25km the air is thin enough that you can tip over to orbital prograde safely.\n\n-High atmosphere drag is very low. Flying at 60km for a while building up orbital speed won\u0027t hurt you much.\n\nOh, and if your rocket doesn\u0027t look streamlined, there\u0027s a good chance it isn\u0027t, and that can make things worse in the low atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why is there so little science reward for such hard early contracts? 1 science point for a mun flyby?
