If you take a look at the Hybrid Ion Engine mod pack we used those and an assortment of power generators to keep it going. Unfortunately, we all failed at making it stable enough for an enjoyable flight because there is no way to create a counter thrust. What I mean by that is if you tilt forwards, the adjacent engines tend to overpower it and you lose control. If there was a way to vary the thrust on the engines, it would be very easy! I know I won\u0027t be of much help, but I suggest you keep trying using lots of lift capable surfaces and balance it out and see how it goes! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T15:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there some way to make the thrusters keep it balanced so it doesn\u0027t tilt at all and then use RCS or a different thruster to move it about without tilting the craft?

If you used action groups and something like the radial mounted little tiny orange engines, can\u0027t seem to remember their names at the moment, than their small thrust combined with the main engines could counteract it to some point and MAYBE, in theory, make it somewhat more controllable.
