The immediate solution was a glider as light rovers are notoriously bad on Eve and making a rocket capable of reaching the target on a ballistic trajectory would take very large amounts of deltaV. The problem is, when I try to take planes/gliders to Eve (even ones that are tried and true on Kerbin) they get up to speed and they start to shake. Go slower and I stall, maintain speed and I shake right out of the sky. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play a stock version of KSP (no FAR or similar). I have my center of lift slightly behind and above my center of mass and I have a reaction wheel on it.

The best cure is to turn SAS off and adjust the trim of the plane so that it flies more-or-less stably without that or constant control-input. Hold the \u0027mod\u0027 key (alt on Windows) and the WASD keys to adjust trim, alt-X to reset it. I find that a lot of planes work best with positive (up, alt-S) pitch trim of 1 - 2 notches on the control-indicators at the bottom-left of the screen. The thing is to just check what your plane does without SAS and use trim to counter it - so if it goes into a dive on its own use pitch-up, if it does a back-flip use pitch-down, etc. You might have to re-adjust trim every now and again as your speed/AoA or fuel (if applicable) changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that a tendency to back-flip often indicates that there is too much drag ahead of the CoM.
