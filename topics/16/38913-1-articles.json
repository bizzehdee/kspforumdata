They landed intact, and are just floating in the middle of the ocean. I want to bring them back to the ksc, and use them again, but there is no longer a \u0027end flight\u0027 button. Is there another way of getting them to a different flight?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T22:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to go to the tracking station, select the flight in question, and select \u0022Recover\u0022 and it will bring your Kerbals back.
