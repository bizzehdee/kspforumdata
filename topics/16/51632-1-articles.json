Specifically, how TWR and Delta-V interact. Obviously, a ship with TWR of less than 1 can\u0027t get off the ground, and isn\u0027t going anywhere, regardless of how much Delta-V it has. But it seems like there should be a curve above 1 where Delta-V is less useful than the flat numbers suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, it takes somewhere around 4500 delta-v to get into a stable Kerbin orbit, right? Now, say I have two ships with this delta-v value. One has a TWR of 2 (easy orbital ascent, right?) and the other has a TWR of 1.01. Now the latter is going to burn most of its fuel just trying to accelerate at all, right? Where\u0027s the changeover between \u0022burns all fuel and hardly goes anywhere\u0022 and \u0022reaches orbit fine\u0022?

Turn at 45 degrees along 090 and hold that course until the apoapsis is 30-35 seconds ahead, then start following the navball. Meanwhile the TWR will continue to rise as the atmo gets less dense and the rocket gets lighter; eventually it\u0027ll get above the 2.2 mark, which is where folks say you start losing delta-V to atmospheric drag. That\u0027s when you throttle it back into that 2.0-2.2 range. And you keep doing that. Once the apoapsis is greater than 45 seconds ahead, you can start burning horizontally (090 along the horizon). Continue to monitor the throttle - actually, the best way to keep checking this is the gee meter; you want it near the top of the green zone without climbing out of there. Kill the burn when the apopasis is about 10k above where you want it (you\u0027ll probably still be in significant atmo when this happens; this compensates for the drag as you coast), then burn like normal for orbital insertion when the time comes; I usually do this at one-third thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T15:37:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T16:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually, the SSTO rocket would still do 4500 m/s of delta-V for orbit, but you have to be a little more careful about how you pilot it.
