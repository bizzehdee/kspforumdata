It also helps to transfer any available fuel to the forward-facing end of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third issue is getting your ship ready to land, which means getting oriented right, ditching the heat shield, and getting chutes to deploy.\u00A0 You may find that when you detach a heat shield, it flies up an into your ship (since the shield is much lighter/draggier than the rest of the ship).\u00A0 There are various ways of dealing with this, like using separatrons or similar to dislodge it, or dropping the heat shield while it\u0027s facing sideways or up.\u00A0 Oh, and chutes tend to get glitchy on Eve.\u00A0 In particular I\u0027d be leery of saving while your chutes are out.\u00A0 Trying to load that save may cause... problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fourth issue is landing your ship in one piece.\u00A0 You pretty much have to hope for a landing site that\u0027s flat-ish, though the more stable your lander is built, the less of a big deal this is.\u00A0 The high gravity and heavy masses involved have a habit of breaking landing legs.\u00A0 Options here are to include extra legs in case some break, design very sturdy legs (looks like you\u0027re on this), and/or use engines to soften the landing as much as possible.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then once you\u0027re landed, if you want to plant a flag and all that, you\u0027ll need a way to get your Kerbal to ground and back.\u00A0 Many people like to put a small crew module at the bottom of the lander so the kerbal can be transferred close to ground.\u00A0 .\u00A0 It\u0027s common to put everything not needed for the ascent (chutes, landing legs, Kerbal egress, etc) on decouplers and drop it before taking off.\u00A0 Ladders are not recommended unless you ditch them before takeoff, since they\u0027re very draggy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all that, you\u0027ll likely be starting out with a large, convoluted package on the launchpad, but it\u0027s still essentially a regular launch.\u00A0 Strategic use of fairings may help with aerodynamic and heat issues.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I like to do -- a typical Eve lander (including yours) tends to have some very powerful, efficient engines packed on it.\u00A0 I like to put\u00A0those engines to work on the Kerbin launch and/or transfer to Eve, with detachable fuel tanks, instead of separate engines from those stages.\u00A0 This can avoid even more size and complexity, but it can require some unusual designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-14T17:56:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

Aero forces can easily overwhelm servos and prevent them from moving, or even break parts off. What you want to do is design your servos in such a way that they are\u00A0minimizing induced drag. Don\u0027t try to push a wide surface face-first directly into the airstream. For an Eve airbrake, perhaps you can have pistons that extend backwards with fins attached, to move the\u00A0center of pressure further aft. Then another set of pistons attached to the first perpendicularly, to push them horizontally outwards like an umbrella.
