To do that, I\u0027ll need to make a reentry heat shield / capsule combo for my lander, something like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(this is Curiosity\u0027s descent capsule, by the way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/61602000/gif/_61602404_mars_2_nasa.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022_61602404_mars_2_nasa.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any mods which I could use to make this in KSP?

The transfer bus will remain in orbit, so that the return capsule can dock to it for the flight home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-turbine495\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T22:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it won\u0027t be nearly as fancy as the real Curiosity rover\u0027s entry* shell, Procedural Fairings can be used to make nice shells: in this case, you\u0027d probably put a fairing ring just on top of your heatshield (perhaps use Deadly Reentry with the heat transfer coefficient set to 0.1 or something), another fairing ring at the top, and whack on a fairing to one, which will stretch to the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
