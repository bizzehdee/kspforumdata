Putting more engines in the front increases the mass of the ship. By \u003Cu\u003Ea lot\u003C/u\u003E! Engines are heavy. Putting unnecessary engines like that is gonna deeply hurt your deltaV budget. And it would bring no gain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add insult to injury, having those engines in \u0022front\u0022 would not remove the need to rotate the spacecraft, because the direction that your spacecraft will be facing when you eject from kerbin is \u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E the direction you\u0027ll need to make the capture burn. You make the kerbin ejection burn, then you time warp to the target planet, and then you won\u0027t be aligned with whatever other planet you went to. You still have to rotate the spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, don\u0027t think you can get away with \u0022smaller engines\u0022. Depending on your target planet and trajectory, you may well find that the capture burn is more expensive than the ejection burn. And having weak engines to do it will result in loss of efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-27T23:06:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224123307\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207938\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221651066223\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes, you can - but why would you want to do it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I\u0027m new at this.
