It\u0027s just too top-heavy. I tested it with just the orange tank and corresponding booster and it flipped out almost immediately so I figured maybe it had too much drag (I use FAR), so I added the fairings on the scaffolds and a large third stage to boost it up to where the atmosphere thins a bit- but it burns straight as an arrow \u0027til I ditch the stage, then flips out again. I added the SRB\u0027s to try to lower the CoM, to no avail, and I tried adding fins to stabilise but they actually made it worse...
