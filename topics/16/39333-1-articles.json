I have been playing vanilla since the patch and for the first time ever (non-modded fresh installation) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you don\u0027t like long stories just skip to the end....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I managed to land on the Mun and deploy my rovers. I promptly hopped in my rovers that I had jettisoned previously from 50m above the lunar surface during my descent and used my landing gear to flip them off their sides. This is when chaos broke loose. My rover shot up in the air at least 5m and upon hitting the surface my Kerbal came flying out. The rover began spinning nearly in place like a top on it\u0027s front headlight, I musta watched it for at least 5 minutes as it spun and spun in place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I finally decided that it may be a bug so I close out the game and relaunched it. Upon the continuation of my mission I found my kerbal by his rover (or what was left of it) which had stopped spinning, but on its side, he promptly hopped inside and tried to flip it once again launching the rover 5m into the air. The rover then began it\u0027s slide down the slight slope on which I had landed. It went down the slight slope up a intermediate ridge on a crater rim and launched itself over the edge. At this point the rover was tumbling on it\u0027s side, round and round until it finally came to rest at the bottom of the crater, my kerbal left behind half way up the crater wall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He turned on his RCS pack and flew down to his rover once again, hopped inside, and flipped it over and began his long ride back to the lander (which was way tricky). It seemed like as soon as the rover hit 2m - 3m per sec the rover would want to launch itself in the air but he was diligent and gently tapped the throttle as he climbed the steep slope. He rolled it multiple times and drove half way while popping a wheelie but he finally made out over the crater rim. My kerbal followed a flat valley back to the landing site he managed to get up to about 6m per sec but once he cross that threshold the rover repeatably tried to launch itself into orbit. Upon arriving he parked the busted up rover he had retrieved and the not so busted up rover that he deftly maneuvered to it\u0027s wheels. and planted his flag in the name of all Kerbals..... First Kerbal on the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E But to my question has gravity changed on the Mun, is this a bug, or something else? I have driven rovers on the Mun in past versions but with this version I can barely go anywhere without spinning endlessly, flipping end over end, or sliding down ground that isn\u0027t where the ground texture is showing.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had watched other people playing on twitchtv, and they seemed to be having similar problems. Rovers spinning in place endlessly, tow vehicles lifting up into the air as their towing rig (scaffolding and docking clamp) would slowly be pulled to the Mun\u0027s surface. Was entertaining to watch, little jr. docking clamp lifting up a medium sized rover. If it is a bug hopefully it is fixed soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T09:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo it hasn\u0027t changed, most likely is that you haven\u0027t remapped your controls or are using staging mode, and that the new control wheels are getting you to spin by applying torque to your ship.
