My plane keeps veering to the left on take-off, it is not due to Landing gear issues. The tail for some reason turns drastically left (WITH or W/O \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E), and when I correct it then turns a ton right. I have tried multiple tail configs and it either does the same thing (tried two tails W/o tail wings, same thing), OR the plane won\u0027t take off. at all. I cannot figure out why it does this, I\u0027ve never experienced this before, any help would be great!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*I also tried disabling the tail controls to see if it changed anything, and it did not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPicture 1 - I didn\u0027t touch the controls at all, only throttled up the engines, it did this on it\u0027s own\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPicture 2 - after veering off the runway, I corrected right and it over corrected by a ton and veered right, subsequently flipping and crashing.

In fact, it even has an entry in this forum\u0027s FAQ. Unfortunately, there are many causes that can all produce approximately the same bad outcome. From landing gear splaying from being overloaded, to wheelbarrowing, to fuselage flex, to insufficient yaw control authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, as far as I\u0027m concerned, the most common issue that causes runway veering is \u0022excess drag at the front of the craft\u0022. Players learn this lesson fairly early on for rockets -- to achieve stability you want low drag at the front, and high drag at the back. Otherwise your rocket will not fly straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut most airplane designers do not realize that exactly the same issue happens with wheels on the ground. If the drag/friction at the front of the plane is too high compared to the rear landing gear, your plane will veer on the runway. The automatic fiction control presets do not take this sufficiently into account sometimes. So the fix is to go into the editor for your plane, select the front landing gear to open the menu, switch \u0022Friction Control\u0022 to Manual, then slide the slider down to something below 50%. You may need to slide it all the way down to 0. At the same time, if you wish, you can increase the friction at the rear by 20% or 30% too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that doesn\u0027t fix the problem, then you may need to post a copy of your plane\u0027s craft file here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clubasquirrel","CreatedById":144642,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-23T10:16:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh my god, Thank you!
