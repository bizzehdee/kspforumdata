Not on a top of a rocket, but from the ground by a klaw. My usual moar booster approach seems to be failing. Can\u0027t lift my dummy payload.

But was I close? Did it just need one more booster? Guess I should admit I was never an engines-guy, not to mention the math concerning them. So... What propulsion would you use? Have some such lifter at hand?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T03:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am confused.

From personal experience they\u0027re not as powerful as say, some of the SRBs and\u00A0rocket engines. However the problem with those lies in the fuel consumption. If you\u0027re not intending to go very far, i\u0027d recommend them.
