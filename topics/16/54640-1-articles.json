I ran into a bit of a snag though as i needed extra spacing for everything to have enough room. I used a TT-70 radial decoupler with a modular girder segment on the outside then tried to strut the crap out of everything. Most of the time the launch seems to be going good but i\u0027ve yet to make it into orbit. One time i\u0027ll be going straight up then all of a sudden one of the boosters will break off and start passing me with no warning. Or i\u0027ll get to the last stage and start the gravity turn and the torque seems to tear one of the last 2 boosters off. Any advice on how to accomplish this better without everything just falling apart? Also seem to be having issues with the whole craft going in and out of time warp. Just trying to get the timing right to get to jool. Everything goes fine and then i take it out of time warp and everything goes boom.

Consider: When one set of boosters is almost out of fuel, the column mass is extremely low. But it still has all those engines at the bottom pushing it up, meaning it wants to accelerate really really fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, your central column is still very heavy and still only has the same thrust to weight ratio it did at liftoff, meaning it wants to accelerate much more slowly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou therefore get very large shear forces acting on your radial decouplers, and the outer columns tear off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way you can improve your integrity on this rocket is to attach the modular girder to the central column and then the decoupler to the girder, rather than the other way around as you have it now. The decouplers are very flexible, so right now the girder is acting as a lever, magnifying the \u0022wobbliness\u0022 of the columns. If you put the girder on first this will be reduced. Yes, this does mean you will have slightly ugly girders left on your central column after ejecting your radial stacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother useful technique is to cross-stitch your radial columns to your central stack with struts. IE, instead of having the strut run horizontally, run a strut from the bottom edge of the radial column up at an angle so that it connects to the centre stack at the same height as the top edge of the radial column. Then put another strut that crosses this one. Then do the same on the other side of the column.
