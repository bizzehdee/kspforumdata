Hell...I had one survive a 2,000 meter fall intact; popped the tires, of course, but that was it. She\u0027s a good, heavy design that illustrates the important points of rovers - build them with a low center of mass and give it a wide axle track. SAS helps keep it from flipping - in all my time driving the Hound, she has never flipped over on Kerbin and only once on Mun (and in that case, probe-torque rotation helped upright it again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some other rovers I\u0027ve designed.
