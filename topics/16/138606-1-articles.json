Long story short, I have landed a rover (ugly as hell, just trying to experiment) and another module craft, I got them to dock but now while docked the rover no longer will move (the wheels don\u0027t spin at all) however, when I try to turn, the wheels will pivot left and right. I have tried everything I can think of but am not sure what I am doing wrong.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is hard to tell from the image, but the rover utilizes a \u0022forklift\u0022 type of design with landing gear on the end of the platform to raise and lower it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xBzh81i.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xBzh81i.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcinco","CreatedById":163235,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T01:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel so stupid, somehow the brakes were switched back on after docking?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-01T03:09:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had that happen to me also.
