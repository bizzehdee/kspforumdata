So I slapped a giant tank on it (right now its just a pod with 4 small fueltanks and small engines) and dV also goes up. Now, obviously, the engines won\u0027t lift the huge tank, yet dV is still there. So I was wondering, how do you compensate for that mass? I am trying to make a Mun lander with different stages and escape pod in case the guys need to abandon the base and go home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T00:56:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 12:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amoun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T00:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve already answered it yourself: Adding more mass reduces the thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR). Going below 1.0 TWR makes your rocket stay on the pad instead of lifting off. Of course adding more mass will decrease your total delta-v, but the impact on TWR is much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for mass compensation, this should be obvious: You add more engines to gain more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps this might still be a little too advanced for you, but in case you\u0027re feeling adventurous, you can try my online engine layout configuration calculator to work out engine configurations given a specific payload mass.

So say you have TWR of 1 and a dV of saaay...(whatever) 2000. If your TWR drops to 0.8, does dV automatically become 0?

In reality, you want a bit more than that or you will be fighting gravity for too long, wasting fuel in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal delta-v is not dependent on TWR, though. TWR is just that, thrust divided by mass. Delta-v on the other hand is a function of your engine\u0027s specific impulse and dry/wet masses of the vessel. It does not matter if your engine is slow (low thrust) or fast (high thrust), as long as the specific impulse (fuel efficiency) stays the same. You will just be accelerating faster/slower, but the total potential change in velocity stays the same with equal specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amoun","CreatedById":74485,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T00:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@blizzy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, just played around with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlapped a giant tank, TWR went below 0 and dV dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I see what you mean and that makes sense.

Once you\u0027re in space, you can get by with TWR as low as 0.1-0.2, if you don\u0027t mind splitting up your burns into multiple parts. When making landers, the minimum TWR you need to take off or land is equal to the ratio of the body\u0027s surface gravity to Kerbin\u0027s surface gravity. For example, Duna has a surface gravity of 2.94 m/s^2 compared to Kerbin\u0027s 9.81 m/s^2, so a Duna lander would only need a TWR \u0026gt; 0.3 to be able to take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re trying to get a lot of dV, a good rule of thumb is to use the nuclear engines for any ship larger than a few tons.
