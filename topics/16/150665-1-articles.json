This box also included a little bit of text telling you your distance from this nearby object. Not sure how far away it would start to pick stuff up, but it was significant, at least 10-20km. Since I installed 1.2, I\u00A0never see the little green target box indicator at any distance. This makes rendezvous in orbit a lot more difficult for me, since I usually guide myself to the encounter for about the last km with at least a little help from visuals. In orbit, however, especially in the dark, you can\u0027t see anything small (say just a basic capsule on a rescue-from-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003Elko\u003C/abbr\u003E mission) until you\u0027re something like 25m from it. So you have this impossible task of flipping back and forth between map mode to check distances and back to the piloting screen so you can control the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been looking for a setting somewhere that turns this off and on but haven\u0027t found anything. So then I wondered if it might have something to do with the new com stuff? or maybe it has to do with something in career mode that I haven\u0027t upgraded/researched yet? Anyone else had this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodhern","CreatedById":144074,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T13:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may be thinking of the F4 key.
