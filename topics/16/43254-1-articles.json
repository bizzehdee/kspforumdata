However, I doubt that this actually happens because all materials get softer and weaker if heat is applied to them. So, eventually, the rocket engine would melt, and explode.

They were initially designed to a certain maximum thrust spec, which was designated as 100% thrust. Later, in testing, it was found that they could safely produce more thrust than originally designed. Rather than redoing all the documentation, programming, etc. to set the new max safe thrust at 100%, they just kept the original max thrust value defined as 100% and designated new higher thrust values at over 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat wouldn\u0027t really carry over to KSP where engine thrust ratings are defined in-game and no one\u0027s writing procedures for anything. If an engine were changed or modded to produce more thrust, its new higher thrust would still be 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
