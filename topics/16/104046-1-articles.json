Launch weight was going to be subtracted from the score, so basically using a spaceplane was the way to go, since recovered weight would be subtracted from the original launch weight. So I came up with a new way to do things, I built docking tugs, solely for the purpose of docking the various modules to the station.\n\nAnyways this is what my docking tugs look like.\n\n![C7L3knS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/C7L3knS.jpg)\n\nI had two main criteria for them to fullfill.\n\n1. Longterm autonomous operation (solar panels, batteries, a probe core [hidden inside the 1.25m -\u003E 2.5m Adapter] and tons of RCS to keep the number of refueling runs to a minimum.\n\n2. Low part count. I am using them to build a truly huge station and can\u0027t afford to waste any parts. Kept it down to 16 apiece\n\nThe tugs each hold 2400 units of monoprop and have a lot of torque due to the large SAS module. I also use two of them together, since many of my payloads are very long and very heavy making one tug on one end completely impractical. \n\nI dock one tug to each side and then monouvre the payload into position in front of the designated docking port, kill all relative velocity and then slide the tug which is in the way out of the way and just push forward gently :3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T17:12:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheXRuler**\n  \nPics up now"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T16:01:20Z","Content":"All monoprop is the way to go for station building tugs.

That way you have equal RCS force on both ends and balance is no longer an issue. Barring that possibility I will pump fuel from one tug to the other in an attempt to better compensate for the unbalanced payload (**remember to balance out fuel levels before disconnecting the tugs!!!**). Another possibility is to disable one set of thrusters on one of the tugs (the one further away from the CoM) and balance RCS force that way.\n\nSince each tug has not only eight RSC thrusters but also a reaction wheel the control authority is usually enough to compensate a slightly offset CoM, providing you use precision controls for translation (enabled by pressing caps lock)."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:35:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s tricky and perhaps impossible to make one that is balanced for all possible loads. I try to do all translation in the fore/aft directions when using a tug.\n\u003E Another option is to put RCS thrusters on your payloads and have them draw fuel from the tug.\n\nThis. I always try to treat each module as if it had its own internal RCS source. This way, when something connects with RCS they are fairly well balanced. It won\u0027t be precise, but usually close enough. Combined with a torque source, it\u0027s good enough to take care of most anything. As long as the amount of RCS TWR is kept fairly constant, things should stay relatively balanced.\n\nEDIT: FYI, so long as RCS is placed symmetrically and has no rotational offset there\u0027s no need to calculate the RCS TWR for each direction. Total thrust/weight will give you just as useful a ratio... it doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s being divided by three or four or more (so long as \\*all\\* vessels that will be connected have the same symmetry mode). If you\u0027re connecting one vehicle with 8-fold symm RCS to one with 4-fold symm rcs, you need to account for the difference in TWR. Again, none of this is \\*exact\\*, but it\u0027s usually good enough that getting it more closely matched doesn\u0027t end up making any noticeable difference (especially when torque is present from other sources).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T18:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T18:35:53Z","Content":"Putting RCS on payload increases part count.

Also the wings/nose/tailfinns tend to get in the way and since your the payload is inside the cargo bay it would be necessary to devise some system of getting the payload out of the cargo bay without decoupling it from the spaceplane, ince sticking monoprop tanks, a probe and RCS thrusters on every payload means wasted payload capacity and more parts (at least 10 per payload, not counting batteries and solar panels).\n\nIn general a disposable system is perfectly fine.\n\nAlso, don\u0027t use monoprop to go interplanetary, it is horiffically inefficient (low ISP).
