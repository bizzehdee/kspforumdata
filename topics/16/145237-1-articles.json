They recommend that you set throttle to max while in Kerbin orbit, and keep pushing it until you get a trajectory that meets up with the planet (e.g. Duna). I tried, and failed, a lot with this method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I prefer the much easier method of getting out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Kerbin first, where I depart from roughly the same place and keep the throttle open until I am on an escape trajectory. Then once I am in an orbit around the Sun, I plan and execute the Duna-intercept. Around the Sun, I can move the maneuver node along the Solar orbit, so if the planets weren\u0027t aligned correctly, I can correct this by just moving it ahead by a few days (or even a year if I launched at a rather bad moment). The ship will just follow along at roughly Kerbin\u0027s orbit, until it gets to the node, where I throttle up and get my Duna intercept. Maybe I am a newbie, but results with this method have been more successful, and certainly less frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know of the Oberth effect, which says that I should accelerate when at the highest velocity (in this case that would probably be in low Kerbin orbit), so my strategy is a little less efficient, but in my opinion quite a lot easier.
