Your plane will need a positive angle of attack on the wings, a slightly upward attitude for them, in order to develop lift. Is your plane set up so that when resting on the runway the nose is slightly lower than or equal in height to the tail? Then it will instead develop _negative_ lift and glue itself down. You won\u0027t be able to rotate to a positive angle of attack and develop positive lift until the runway falls out from under you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should have a neutral or slightly positive angle of attack when resting on the runway. Also, your rear gear should be fairly close to your CoG (as seen in the SPH), with control surfaces located _behind_ them so that they have a lever arm to lift the nose - if they are too far back you won\u0027t have enough control force to rotate up.

However the caveat is that while on paper you may have enough thrust, when push comes to shove you may not be able to breakthrough the high drag zone around the transonic speed boundary. A single RAPIER and all it\u0027s associated bits and bobs (ie fuel and enough intakes) is probably going to run you around 9 tons of mass. (Just cobbled together a rapier using mk 2 tanks it\u0027s 9.3 tons!)

You need to place your landing gear closer to the center of mass, right behind it. Think of the plane taking off as a lever. If the fulcrum is too far back, you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have enough leverage to push down on the back and raise the nose. If this doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t cut it, consider adding some control surfaces at the front (but be careful that it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mess up your center of lift, you might need to move your main wings further back if you do this). Definitely forget about adding more wing and engine. For a successful SSTO plane you want to keep weight and drag as low as possible. Edit: Also make sure you have elevators on the tail and are not relying on the elevons on your main wing. The further back your elevators are the better they\u0027ll work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You probably read the 40K number in an outdated tutorial. With the current aero, your jets will definitely flame out at around 25K if not earlier, no matter how many air intakes. Also, the shock cone intakes are actually better. Fly a test rig with two identical crafts only changing the intake and you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll see for yourself. One intake per jet engine is plenty; don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t spam the intakes, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll only give you unneeded drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, not sure if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a typo on your part but it says here you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re using aerospikes for the initial ascent? You want to use jets or RAPIERS in air breathing mode for that. Yes, it is important to understand the performance profile of the engine you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re choosing. I think the max thrust paramaters appear in the SPH if you right click on the part in the parts menu. Make sure you design your ascent profile to make the most of that sweet spot. For SSTO\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s generally the rapiers are better because they have highr thrust at higher speeds, which is where you want it if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re trying to get to orbit, with the added benefit that you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need a separate rocket engine, which is heavy. The only reason in my experience to use turbojets is if you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break the sound barrier; since RAPIERs need higher speed to deliver their max thrust, you can sometimes find they won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t give enough thrust at low speeds to push Mach 1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn an ideal flight profile, I usually switch to rockets when I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going ~1400 m/s and slightly above 20km. I would say your speed is more important than your altitude at this point. Focus on building up speed. Oh and try n ot to burn up! If you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re burning up, you need to ascend a bit steeper to spend less time in the thicker air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. This is a known issue with no know solution thus far. You can mitigate it by turning off SAS and using trim, or with the Pilot Assistant mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Another useful trick I just remembered is to help the SAS by not allowing it to over correct. Example: You want to pitch up, so you press \u0027S\u0027. As soon as you release the button, the SAS will try to cancel out your control input by pitching back down, only to pitch back up when it realizes it overdid the pitch-down, rinse and repeat. This causes a feedback loop that results in bobbing. You will see this happening if you pay attention to the arrows at the bottom left. What you need to do is give an additional quick tap on the \u0027S\u0027 button immediately after you release it the first time, so you don\u0027t give the SAS a chance to pitch down so much. Alternatively, pitch up to your desired attitude and then immediately after releasing the \u0027S\u0027, quickly tap the \u0027F\u0027 to temporary disengage the SAS for an instant. When it comes back on, it\u0027ll try to hold the current attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T14:48:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A_name\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T14:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also click on my Pro SSTO badge for a challenge with lots of current builds for 1.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T14:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E3.

Deviations from your present pitch attitude will cause the pitch to try to return the pitch to where it was, sometimes with enough force to cause the nose to bob back and forth between nose above flight path and below flight path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry adjusting the COM to COL markers. I would suspect your COL is too far behind your COM, so try moving the COL forward, closer to the COM, and see how that affects handling.

Thankfully, KSP is not 100% accurate regarding how supersonic flight affects aerodynamics. IRL, as you transition from transonic to supersonic flight, the effective COL moves aft, creating additional control quirks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, try changing the relationship between COL and COM. Be careful to ensure that as you burn fuel the COM does not move aft of the COL, but try to get the COL closer to the COM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are very good points, but you also want to make sure your COL stays behind your COM even when the fuel is empty. Sometimes it\u0027s hard to do so without having to resort to pushing back your COL, so you\u0027re forced to fly a plane that\u0027s too stable in the initial phases of the flight. A solution to this is to have more drag on the top half of the plane, or the COT slightly under the COM. Both of these will give your plane a natural tendency to pull it\u0027s nose up, partially overcoming its inherent stability in your favor. Be careful when having the COT not in line with the COM though. It can be a real headache when in space if you don\u0027t have enough SAS or RCS to hold your nose straight during orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wingnutt","CreatedById":146587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T16:03:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHMM, yes this makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll move the COL forward a bit and leave SAS off\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkMechanic","CreatedById":140327,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T16:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wingnutt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wingnutt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Nose bobbing when adjusting pitch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is far and away the most annoying.
