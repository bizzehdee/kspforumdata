What I want to know is if this drop of force between parts can actually be calculated mathematically to be used to plan lithobrakers in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brainlord Mesomorph","CreatedById":110905,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T11:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built a lander once with small extra fuel tanks the protruded past the engine cone.
