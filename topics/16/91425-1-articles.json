With test missions and explore body missions, these are always possible if you build a craft and start the mission in time. If the Kerb has been deorbited, died or recovered \u0027some other way\u0027, then this mission becomes impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mission I can think of that comes close, therefore, is the mission to test launch stabilisers in places other than Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also would expect the mission to be failed, but does it fail immediately, or does it fail when the timer ticks out?

As I say, I\u0027ve not tried this method, so I could certainly be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T03:14:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have landed him, save first and then try to recover him.

I have been getting the exact same issue. Nobody in orbit to rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to add insult to injury, this is after I built an antimatter powered spaceplane using B9 and KSP Interstellar that can get to Laythe and back without refueling!
