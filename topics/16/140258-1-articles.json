I\u0027ve landed a probe on Laythe that was nearly vaporized, but managed to land. (BTW, I\u0027m in sandbox but I still bring along things like a thermometer because it\u0027s just fun to see) but anything else is basically impossible. I tried to make a bigger probe to land on Tylo or something, but my transfer ships just don\u0027t have enough Delta-V. Even when I do my burns from Kerbin orbit, where they are the most efficient, it still doesn\u0027t work. Forget about coming back. My transfer ships have plenty of fuel, and they use efficient engines, like nukes or LVNs. I have Kerbal Engineer,(The mod) but I can\u0027t get my ships\u0027 Delta-V above 5000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is my real question: can anyone show me some examples of their Jool ships, or at least tell me what I\u0027m doing wrong?
