Just ran a quick test: of the two 1x6 panels, the one with casing radiated twice as much heat. The Gigantor, 12-15 times as much as the cased 1x6 (better when hot, that is, it works best when you need it the most). The 275kg swept wing was better still, like twenty of the small panels.\n\nBy weight, the wing wins. It seems that the wing is much better at picking up the heat; running hotter, it can then radiate more. Still, sustained operation will require like 1000kg worth of wing for every engine. Mount them as close to the engine as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:57:39Z","Content":"This ship can run 6 nukes for 30\u002B minutes until it runs out of fuel.

The most effective way to control heat is to mount the engines on a big tank of cold fuel. Trying to control heat with solar panels only buys you insignificant gains.
