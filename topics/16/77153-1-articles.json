What\u0027s also very significant for planes (in addition to fuel load) is the Thrust to Weight, intake to engine, and the Lift to Mass ratios. Everything sort of needs to scale up. Unless you already overbuilt the plane to start with, adding 50% payload (or 20% depending on the point of view)after the fact is a bit difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll usually get better results if you start out with the payload and mission tasks as the focus of designing, then make a craft capable of that.

There simply is no straightforward way to calculate this for a spaceplane. For a rocket, yes, you broadly follow the rocket equation but the engines that efficiently lift 47 tonnes are probably not the same as you\u0027d use for 67 tonnes so, yet again, you can\u0027t just take a working model and expect it to still work after adding just payload and fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
