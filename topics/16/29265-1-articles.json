Click on the assign button and move the axis you want. There\u0027s no dropdowns or anything. One thing to note is that there\u0027s multiple flight modes in the game, so if you map the joystick for the Staging mode (which is used for most of the time in flight) you will need to reassign all the axis for the Docking Mode as well.
