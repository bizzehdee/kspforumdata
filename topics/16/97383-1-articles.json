And next time, revert to the VAB, not to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips with experimental parts can\u0027t be launched directly from the launchpad but they can be loaded and launched from within the VAB. This is so if you do the part test by sticking the experimental part on the side of your standard rocket, you can go back later and remove the experimental part and keep using your standard rocket. But the launchpad itself just tries to stop you from launching with parts you haven\u0027t researched yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
