Then you can have Jeb or Val take the driver\u0026#39;s seat while Bill comes along for the ride. He will get the experience even if he does nothing during the flight. You could also research probe cores with pilot abilities and use those, but they come later in the tech tree than the first passenger pod, Mk1 Crew Cabin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo train your kerbonauts you take them around the solar system. There was a thread about the most efficient training regiment somewhere. I forget the details, but I am sure planting flags on Mun and Minmus and visiting interplanetary space for a moment was more than enough to get five stars.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T11:49:46Z","Content":"\nIIRC The training program is: Orbit the Mun, plant a flag on Minmus, then pop into solar orbit then land back on Kerbin.
