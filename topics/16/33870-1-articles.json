I\u0027ve tried adding wings/fins, and I get the same thing, except the fins at least attempt to stabilize. Even then, the anti-roll is pegged to one side. I originally thought it was my lander designs, or my satellite designs, or whatever I\u0027m launching into space. But I\u0027ve deleted everything. I\u0027ve started over. I\u0027ve built the most minimalistic large lifter I possibly can, and I STILL get crazy spin.

I\u0027ve had that one induce spin even in orbit with nothing active. Also turn off gimbal on the outer engines, adding fins would be the icing on the cake I think. Asparagus staging does usually induce a bit of spin, but nothing horrible, give the things I listed a try and see if that helps at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T08:12:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry replacing your probe core with a command module for a test flight, see if that helps. Probe cores have a rather low rotpower (this particular one has 0.5, thats a tenth of the rotpower of the weakest command module). Potentially add a normal SAS module, these act as torque wheels for the purpose of rotation stabilisation. As said above, turn off gimbal on the outer engines and add fins :-).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, try turning off your ASAS module and controlling it manually, and see if you have the same problem. ASAS modules are a bit... quirky in the current version \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all else fails, add two of the radial mounted Rockomax 24-77 engines, but point it sideways to generate torque to stabilise your ascent. They\u0027ll use a bit of fuel, but they\u0027ll (hopefully) stabilise your roll. If they add too much torque, just point both downwards untill you get the right amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T08:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the rolling only happen when you\u0027re under thrust?
