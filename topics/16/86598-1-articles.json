I\u0027m using MechJeb to show and control my acceleration, though it seems like it\u0027s a Kerbal problem rather than MechJeb. As I never took physics in high school this is kinda new to me, but I found Kinematic Equations online, and the one in particular that was relevant is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVelocity(final)^2=Velocity(initial)^2\u002B2*a*d\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plug in the values I\u0027m looking for, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E260m/s^2 = 0m/s^2 \u002B 2 * a * 4200m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApply the exponents,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E67600m^2/s^2 = 0m^2/s^2 \u002B 2 * a * 4200m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEliminate the 0 because it\u0027s 0,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E67600m^2/s^2 = 2 * a * 4200m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplify the right side,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E67600m^2/s^2 = a * 8400m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDivide both sides by 8400m to end up with,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.047619048m/s^2 = a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow looking at MechJeb\u0027s acceleration (that I assume it\u0027s reading from Kerbal itself) and forcing it not to exceed that, my rocket doesn\u0027t even leave the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure how Kerbal calculates acceleration, but at some point I figured I\u0027d try adding in 1G of gravity to see if that was what was confusing me, leaving me with 17.85426905m/s^2, but even if I bump it up to 20m/s^2 it never reaches the velocity I want at the altitude I want. Am I using this math wrong? Is there some other math I should be using?

If you want to actually lift off the ground, your acceleration has to be AT LEAST 9.81 m/s^2.
