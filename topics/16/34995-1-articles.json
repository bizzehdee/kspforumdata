I\u0027ve got this lander that uses two arms to hold two mini rovers. I\u0027ve deployed them on Minmus and the Mun. The idea is that they have little RCS jump jets in order to drive back under the lander and re-attach. Everything works perfectly, except the clamps won\u0027t actually clamp. They sort of hover and hold the rover an inch or two away from actually clamping. I\u0027ve jiggled the rover, pushed it up into the clamp, turned it 180 degrees, etc, everything I can think of to wiggle the rover into position. But the clamps won\u0027t actually grab. You can see the magnet doing its thing and holding it in place. Even when I release all the RCS, the little rover just hovers being held by the docking magnets. But no clamp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the lander with two rovers attached:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j0RRUQ0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022j0RRUQ0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an up close shot of the docking port holding the rover but not actually clamping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ijzAfVT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ijzAfVT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LC0IF3Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LC0IF3Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you see that tiny air gap between the docking ports?
