Once you unlock docking ports, you want to start designing ships that can perform multiple tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing LV-Ns? design a transfer stage so it can work as a re-usable tug. If you can get it to orbit, try and think of a way to re-use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink \u0022what do I already have up there that I could use on this mission\u0022, and \u0022if I leave this up there, can I use it for anything else, or is it just going to be junk?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had previously made a SSTO that could haul 100 tons to orbit... I could just use that, one size fits all (I can\u0027t imagine needing more than 100 tons for a payload in LKO, that can\u0027t be launched in two peices) - but I didn\u0027t like using it because it took so much of my time to get something to orbit - the SLS nasa parts were much quicker and simpler ways of getting my stuff to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently using small SSTOs to launch small probes, using a 1 size fits all appraoch there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the way I see it, its a combination of customizing your ship so you don\u0027t go \u0022overkill\u0022 ever time with thousands of m/s of spare dV - and modular design so you can get re-use out of stuff that you\u0027ve already got in orbit (sure you could deorbit it near the KSC and get a near 100% refund, but to use it again, you\u0027ve got to pay to hoist it back into orbit - mainly the sort of thing I re-use are LV-N modules with a small fuel tank, probe core, and docking port, which can rendevous and connect with a payload that has the needed fuel. No more payng to lift nearly 5 tons of LV-Ns into orbit anymore (for a pair of them).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T21:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bobnova\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bobnova\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s for FAR so you\u0027ll need to add another 1.1km/s of boosters to make orbit, but this was my first manned Mun lander in 0.24:\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErm... last time I checked you needed \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E dV with FAR to get into orbit, not more...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halaberiel","CreatedById":115985,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T22:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, the way I see it, its a combination of customizing your ship so you don\u0027t go \u0022overkill\u0022 ever time with thousands of m/s of spare dV - and modular design so you can get re-use out of stuff that you\u0027ve already got in orbit (sure you could deorbit it near the KSC and get a near 100% refund, but to use it again, you\u0027ve got to pay to hoist it back into orbit - mainly the sort of thing I re-use are LV-N modules with a small fuel tank, probe core, and docking port, which can rendevous and connect with a payload that has the needed fuel.
