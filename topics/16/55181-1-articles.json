You can also use a bi-, tri-, or quad- coupler by attaching a clamp-o-tron to each open port. However, if you use the second method not all the ports will attach in the VAB, you will have to wait until the ship loads. Also, if you not adverse to using mods you can get Kerbal Attachment System to add struts in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jollyroger6969","CreatedById":94549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T14:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECouplers!! Now why didnt i think of that! And indeed. My Quad ship design failed turning into a pinwheel in space!
