The plane conjunction is very close to periapsis and apoapsis. You want to make an encounter with an atmosphere-possessing object in a 10AU circular orbit on the ecliptic. You have the forecasting power and patience to have this be a high-velocity encounter (to wait for the orbits to line up and do an aerocapture/impact, rather than trying to circularize), but not to hit a bullet with a bullet and do it off-plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you raise apoapsis first, or correct inclination first, or do some phased process, or does it not matter? How would one determine this? How about for other plane conjunctions, N degrees off from the periapsis and apoapsis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst piece of the puzzle I know from very basic orbital mechanics is that inclination is better corrected at apoapsis than periapsis.
