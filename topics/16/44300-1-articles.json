With an higher payload like 140 kg the 48-S7 win earlier all the way down to 20 liter fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have to use two or more radial ants because of twr restrictions then landing the 48-S7 wins even with only an oscar tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion, for small engines use the 48-S7 unless you just want to put an probe into correct orbit after dropping from carrier, her the ant is nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor heavier payloads than probes going longer than Minmus, use the LV-N.

It takes input from the console, so you\u0027ll need to run it through the command prompt using the \u0022java -jar \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;\u0022 command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit takes three inputs: The T/W ratio you want, the minimum vacuum dV that you want, and the mass of your payload in tons. It will output a table of the more popular engines (I\u0027ll eventually add all the engines) along with stats on each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important numbers are the last ones on the table, Engines Required and Fuel Mass. Engines Required is the number of engines your ship must have, and Fuel Mass is the amount of fuel you need to have, in tons (including the tank, assumes the 8/9 fuel ratio of the large tanks). If either of these numbers is negative, that means that engine physically cannot provide that T/W ratio and dV, so you\u0027ll want to reduce one parameter or the other. The best engine for the job is either the one with the least Engines Required (if you\u0027re shooting for low part count) or the least Fuel Mass (If you\u0027re shooting for smallest mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy program works in three steps:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Figure out how much mass each engine can lift while still maintaining the given T/W ratio. This depends only on engine thrust, engine mass, and target T/W.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use the inverted rocket equation to figure out how much mass can be payload while still meeting the dV requirement (that is, the payload fraction). This changes depending on the above max load and the given dV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Divide the payload mass by the payload mass/engine to figure out how many engines and how much fuel is required to lift your given payload. This uses the previously calculated payload fraction and the given payload mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis approach is analytic, so it should be perfectly correct (barring any rounding errors). If you build your ship with the given instructions, it should meet or exceed both the given T/W and dV you provided. Also note that this program is meant for designing interplanetary stages only. The difference in engine ISP in-atmosphere means that your ship will have less dV than what my program predicts, so if you try to design a launcher with it you\u0027ll need to pack extra dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably throw together a thread for it tomorrow, along with a version with a proper GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
