I have no real idea how to launch it to the target height of 300 kilometers over Kerbin...attaching big rockets with big engines isn\u0027t a problem, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be remotely controllable if I place rockets on the sides--the center of thrust is directly below the center of mass, but as soon as I launch whole thing tips over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T01:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe crazy part of my brain whispered \u0027skycrane\u0027.

Your set-up looks interesting and I\u0027m going to try it out when it\u0027s not 4:40 AM. But I should note that your dock recreation is symmetrical, while my dock (intentionally) isn\u0027t. I guess I could make it symmetrical, if I reconfigure the intended habitable modules, but I\u0027d prefer to keep the design as-is if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hold on, that download site seems to have a lot of pop-ups (a few are getting through my Adblock), link changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-15T02:46:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2013 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kimberly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T02:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kimberly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kimberly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut I should note that your dock recreation is symmetrical, while my dock (intentionally) isn\u0027t.

But I\u0027d suggest the same approach just with attaching the center stack below your dock\u0027s center of mass. Symmetry isn\u0027t the real issue, it\u0027s center of mass. If you can get an attachment point right below it, you should be fine sticking any stack of boosters below it. Problem with having rockets on the sides / around it is as you\u0027ve noticed it tipping over if it\u0027s not symmetrical/CoM centered between boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single attachment point below your CoM would likely be the easiest way, then a lot of struts to secure the payload to the lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
