It occurred to me that by using rotors as hubs and either fuel tanks or fairings as wheels, we could make some absurdly large wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Okhin","CreatedById":201182,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-12T18:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use Action Groups axis for that, and link the max-RPM of the rotor to the Wheel Throttle Axis. Or to the Main Throttle. Don\u0027t forget to set the torque on max.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need to set one half of the rotors on counter clockwise rotation, and to add some hinge for direction (map them to the Steer Wheel Axis).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, you will need to add something on parts to protect them from impact. The grip pad seems perfect for that, and exists, in fact, for this exact reason. However, what you do not have with the rotor is differential speed (the wheel inside the curve rotating a bit slower than the one outside of the curve), traction control (but you could play with torque) or friction control (so either your wheel will slip, or they will stick on the ground).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you can have \u0022close enough\u0022 systems with rotors, but you won\u0027t have exactly the same control as you have for wheels (but I think the wheel system is really weird in KSP)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vv3k70r","CreatedById":208078,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-10T09:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
