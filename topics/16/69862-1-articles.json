It\u0027s probably more of a flight profile problem. It appears that you have three TurboJets and seems you have plenty of intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, you\u0027ll want to get up to the 20-25km point as quickly as possible. That\u0027s where your engines will produce the most thrust and the atmosphere is pretty thin. I try to hit 350 m/s at 15km, and 650 m/s at 20km. Start to shallow your climb to keep accelerating as much as possible in the 20-25km band. You\u0027ll want to be at least 1,000 m/s around 24 km. Make sure you keep climbing up though though because if you start to descent it becomes a pain to get climbing back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point you\u0027ll need to start throttling back so that your engines don\u0027t flame out. You may even want to consider putting the two outboard engines on an action group to shut them down (toggle them actually, so you can use the same key to turn them back on). That will prevent asymmetric thrust flameouts which will cause your craft to go out of control. If you shut down just the outer two, you\u0027ll have more air available to the center one and you can keep the throttle up higher. I usually aim to be around 1,600 m/s at 30km. Keep working the speed up as you climb, but try not to stagnate at one altitude for too long or you just end up wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt becomes a balancing act of flying fast enough to keep intake air high, but not stagnating and burning off all your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T21:14:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T21:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re going to pull out snippets of quotes and provide information, at least don\u0027t make it sound like we are lying.\u003Cp\u003EIn your own post you said that my comment of AoA doesn\u0027t matter, then go on to make it sound like forward facing intakes are worse because of AoA.

If the intake is open, drag coefficient increases with speed but the intake facing again doesn\u0027t matter, even thou the amount of airflow generated will vary.

Control surfaces don\u0027t thou I think. They still produce lift (possibly the same scalar value) but the direction vector can do some weird things (I haven\u0027t tested this properly but I\u0027m pretty sure placing cannards backwards make them work differently).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note the amount of lift the wings produce is proportional to the longitudal vector component of such wing, that is if the wings is rotated 45deg along vertical axis it will produce less lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne important thing coming from that is the yaw problem. If you place the wings symmetrically rotated i.e. backwards (giving them more sweep) they will not only work at reduced efficiency, but they will create roll forces with any amount of yaw, since one wing will produce more lift than other (yawing right will roll the craft right with positive wing sweep). The same thing happens IRL but since in KSP wings don\u0027t produce lift when sideways to airflow, the effect is stronger)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther fun fact about wings: they produce lift at the center of mass, and for most wings it is at their base, so for example if we have two wings, one angled up, one down placed close to the roll axis, one on each side, they will produce small amount of roll torque, but if we just flip them around, attaching by their tips, the torque will be huge even thou the wing surface is roughly in the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T00:33:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nao\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar errors\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T01:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E(As we hijack the thread...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, Nao is right.
