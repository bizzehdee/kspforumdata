I personally think Tylo is much harder than Eve. Tylo\u0027s gravity is roughly similar to Kerbin, but it has no atmosphere, so you cannot use parachute and must use engine to slow down for landing, and use it again to escape, making a trip very tricky, especially during landing with engines, where if you burn too early, you waste a lot of fuel, while burning too late leads to a crash. On Eve, your craft can be 100% fully loaded with fuel since landing can be done with parachutes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s for me though, you might have different view about them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome tips for Eve:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-your priority during ascent is to get out of the atmosphere ASAP, since it\u0027ll reduce drag and increases your engine efficiency\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-if you don\u0027t mind some docking, leave the return vehicle in orbit (with enough fuel to get back to kerbin), then use the ship to land, do some stuff and get back to orbit to rendezvous with return vehicle to get your kerbals back to kerbin.
