With the release of 1.0 and discovering that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy growing stable of single-architecture vehicles would no longer fly, I stopped playing KSP -- cold turkey -- thinking that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would \u0022solve the problems\u0022 later.

Then maybe there are those\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elike me who want a simplified environment that teaches you real things by offering graduated challenges but leaves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplenty of room for imagination, creativity, innovation and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs engineering is my day job I can tell you it is detailed, hard, tedious, repetitious, boring, frustrating and exhausting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhichever kind of Kerbonaut you are (see above), KSP has taught you much more about e.g. solar systems or orbital\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechanics than you ever could imagine have learned anywhere other than NASA and given you that education broadly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas well (which you would not get at NASA which is why engineers there relax at home (or at work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) flying missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein KSP!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to avoid worthy challenges!

For a SSTO that\u0027ll increase quite a lot, however, if you have a two-stage design the second should generally have an initial TWR of less than 1.1. From launch you should, I suggest, be starting your gravity turn by the 1km altitude and/or 100m/s velocity - which should be around the same sort of time with that launch TWR. 5 degrees is not a hard limit either, you can turn further from prograde while you are relatively slow because i) there simply isn\u0027t the atmospheric drag to make you flip yet, ii) prograde will move towards your current heading quickly because there isn\u0027t much existing \u0027prograde\u0027 to adjust. The important thing is not to be turning too sharply once you\u0027ve built-up serious velocity. Hence a slow (5-degree limit) turn through the main part of the ascent. Since you\u0027re turning slowly you have to start early just to get pitched (or yawed) over far enough before your apoapsis has fully developed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what it\u0027s worth the old \u002710km altitude then pitch to 45-degrees, then pitch to 20-degrees when Ap reaches 50km\u0027 advice still provides good milestones, it\u0027s just that you want to be doing the whole thing as one smooth turn instead of in two sharp jerks. So, maybe kick your gravity-turn off with a 10 or 15 degree turn while you\u0027re low and slow if need be, then continue to turn slowly within the 5-degree limit so you\u0027re passing 45-degrees around 10km altitude. A continuation of the same thing should, more or less, have you at a very shallow pitch by the time your Ap reaches orbital altitude, leaving you with only a short circularisation burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still have a big circularisation burn with the 5-degree limit then you\u0027ve simply got too much thrust, getting you too high before the turn gets far enough. I\u0027ve never used MJs acceleration limiter, just adjusted engines as required. Incidentally, the TWR limit is only there so the 5-degree limit has time to turn you and that\u0027s only there so the vehicle doesn\u0027t flip. If it\u0027s happier (aerodynamically stable) with a sharper turn then by all means use one - what works is good. As has been mentioned in other threads though, optimising for launch-to-orbit dV is generally not useful compared to cost or payload ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotel26","CreatedById":139095,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T00:25:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
