(Including build a new station!) Then, when I dock, that becomes satisfied and the new station becomes unchecked.\n\nIs there a way for me to force completion or otherwise overcome this bug?\n\nPre-docking: ![Bp4kAhhZZcHXr7QRKJ1sWDptkRKhiXKZM4H2BW9XsGPFDJNZ8-Cw4IEXcILnal6_tjiyI5rPnIcEsi4=w1688-h891-rw](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bp4kAhhZZcHXr7QRKJ1sWDptkRKhiXKZM4H2BW9XsGPFDJNZ8-Cw4IEXcILnal6_tjiyI5rPnIcEsi4=w1688-h891-rw)\n\nPost-docking: \n\n![kIIXnhgMu8oYTr07-ml11UDrxjfeneNaK9XdXN-saMRQhRYEoSt-TEwvzB_KotuN1Jy8qKt5sa8z7YE=w1688-h891-rw](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kIIXnhgMu8oYTr07-ml11UDrxjfeneNaK9XdXN-saMRQhRYEoSt-TEwvzB_KotuN1Jy8qKt5sa8z7YE=w1688-h891-rw)"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T22:32:23Z","Content":"Interesting.
