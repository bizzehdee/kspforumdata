Then the left and right engines are both drawing from the right tank, causing it to deplete first. But then the left engine starts using it\u0027s own tanks while the right engine shuts down and won\u0027t draw from the left. Is there some rule to fuel flow that I\u0027m not getting, or is it just being weird?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T05:17:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 05:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:33:51Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s just being weird.

I\u0027ve also seen some wacky behavior from clipped parts, although that has been spotty.\n\nAs Dman979 suggests, I would first try pulling the ship apart, and rebuilding it (or just rebuild it from scratch) and try again. If you are using any internal parts to attach the fuel tanks too, it would be helpful if you let us know (some of them crossfeed, but the rules underneath that can be strange sometimes).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"SignalCorps","CreatedById":134795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:59:33Z","Content":"It might have something to do with mirroring and added multiple parts at once.
