The 2 heaviest parts I \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed \u003C/strong\u003Eto move are 4.5 tons, so I need at least 5 kerbals around the object to move it next to what I want to attach it to; a lander that needs adjustments in order to land and return from Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is extremely difficult considering the fact that you can\u0027t control multiple kerbals at once, and the vicinity the kerbal(s) need to be around the object is quite small. Does anyone have any advice on how to move things this way? Once I switch to a different kerbal, one has already moved too far away from the object to help, and I can see me ripping my hair out constantly switching back an forth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to alter the mod to increase the weight limit in regards to grabbing and moving objects?
