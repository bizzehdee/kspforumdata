After half a dozen crashes in ironman mode, and having screwed around in my playground a while, I finally realize why I just can\u0027t get the blinking planes to balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe core on one end weighs in at .1t. The TurboJet at 1.2t. Run out the fuel and you\u0027ve got a tail sitter and a plane that loves to flip on landing approaches. The cockpits, on the other hand, weight in ~1.2t, thus balancing the craft. Mk2\u0027s are twice the weight so you\u0027ve got balance for your double Turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, without significant mods (such as the one that lets you create weights), has anyone built a stable reusable SSTO drone plane? Other than fuel or cockpits, the only thing I can find that\u0027s roughly even weight is another engine. I\u0027m trying to do this in under 30 parts due to upgrades. Right now, I\u0027m thinking I can stick a FL-R25 on the front of it to balance off the wings, since I don\u0027t use monoprop and there\u0027s part limit concerns for things like fuel transfers and a \u0027last tank\u0027 up front. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else done this with ease, and if so, can I ask what trick(s) did you use?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T21:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor stuff like that I usually put the wings right at the very back, so that they are almost attached to the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T21:27:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou end up with a lawn dart that way at launch, though, due to the fuel sitting up front, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T21:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to balance the weight, but rather the leverage.
