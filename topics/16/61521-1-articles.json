I put one on orbit and now I have a ball floating in space. I\u0027m not really seeing the usefulness of them. Am I missing something. I see the purpose of landers, rovers, and sacrificing kerbals to the science gods. What can I do this satellites? Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"therover8511","CreatedById":102188,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I have seen, which may be wrong. There was some need for a \u0022communications satellite\u0022 in earlier builds to either enhance or speed up communication. I have only played since the most recent build so that info is only limited to a few references I have seen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations! You have something in orbit. But really, as far as KSP goes at the moment, there is no reason or advantage to using unmanned spacecraft. Some mods that require communication relays, etc, would be best with probes, but for your average mission, collecting science is better w/ Kerbals. The only true advantage is they weigh quite a lot less than capsules, so you can have different designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T22:11:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou have a feeling of self-acomplishment.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E that\u0027s really it... something in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could make a refueling satellite... that\u0027s as far as satellite function goes on ksp. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liowen","CreatedById":94498,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T23:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI make a small one that I can switch to for time warp, since doing that at the launch pad has had some issues for me in the past.
