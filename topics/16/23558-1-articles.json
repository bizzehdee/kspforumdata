It\u0027ll use a fair amount of the tug\u0027s fuel, but I\u0027ve had no problem with it and using maneuver nodes to get an intercept. In times when I\u0027ve been impatient, I\u0027ve actually managed to get to Duna despite being on the other side of the sun with half the tug\u0027s fuel left over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should get your tug and lander into orbit around 600k meters, and dock them. Then it\u0027s just waiting for the long burn time and time warps after setting up maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T21:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou add a docking port and make that two X200-32s and you\u0027d have enough gas for a round-trip flight.
