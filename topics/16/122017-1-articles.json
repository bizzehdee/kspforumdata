I throw a K-J-S-U chart in there, it gets much more complicated with three planets but fast windows are there. I Haven\u0027t found a good K-J-S-U-N window yet, either Neidon or Urlum is in a bad spot when the other planets are good, at least during the first 30 Kyears or so that I\u0027ve looked in. As someone noted, in our Solar System the outer 4 gas giants repeat positions roughly every 179 years (very roughly, after a couple of repeats Uranus gets too far out of place) so you might have to search a similar period in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-30T18:29:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2015 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PLAD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T18:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had luck finding a window like that so far and just go straight for Sarnus.
