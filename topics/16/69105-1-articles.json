First time took ages, but for second time I used Alarm to tell me when planets will match, and then do the nodes myself. Which worked ok. However, I still dont know how to fine tune the approach to planets from far away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) How to focus on the intersection point of the map, i.e. so that I can zoom in there while creating nodes - that way I could see how close I am to the planet while adjusting nodes much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How to fine-tune the approach to planet from far away?

You can click on any PE or AP marker (both from real trajectories or ones created by maneuver nodes) to lock it onto the screen; you will no longer have to mouse-over it to display the altitude and it will continue to display as the altitude changes provided you don\u0027t end of up a collision course. It\u0027s a little tricky sometimes depending on where the marker is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u003Cstrong\u003EAnything\u003C/strong\u003E MechJeb can do can be done manually. Anything. MechJeb is not a magical cheating tool, it\u0027s an autopilot. The further you are from a part of an orbit you want to change, the more any burn at your current position will change it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003Eeasiest\u003C/em\u003E way to do it manually is to, ideally, do that thing from my (1) and then very slightly burn in any direction. If the altitude or close encounter or whatever you want moves closer to where you want it to be, continue to burn very slowly in that direction until it stops getting closer. At this point change direction and repeat. The idea behind \u0022very slightly\u0022 is that you\u0027re trying to save as much dV on the encounter as possible, and don\u0027t really want to lose much effectively guessing your way to an improvement - since fine adjustments will make huge changes to an orbit at a distance even 0.1m/s can be enough to tell you whether or not you\u0027re going in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the way I do it, anyway. I suppose there must be some way to determine more or less where you need to burn without so much guesswork, but before someone says \u0022Scott Manley has a tutorial on it\u0022, he used this strategy as part of Interstellar Quest a couple of episodes back \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure someone can explain this far more succinctly than I can, but that\u0027s the general idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T11:22:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 11:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Epthelyn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrection made, credit to FenrirWolf :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T11:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Epthelyn: The ARM update actually added new functionality to the map view that makes your first point much easier to accomplish.
