Basically what has happened is that after a quite kerbalish trip to jool I had lost alot of the ship leaving Jebediah as my only crew. After landing I placed a flag for the first time and realised I had forgotten to add a memorial to all of the poor kerbals who never made it. So I took down the flag and then realised that I now have no flag. I was wondering if I could edit my save file or something to give Jebediah a flag to place as I do not really want to make another trip just to place down a flag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help in advance. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uml\u00FCx","CreatedById":69703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T08:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou just have to enter your capsule and leave it again. then jeb will have a new flag to plant \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T10:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you take jeb out to the flag and take it down with him he will also pick the flag back up so that you can plant it again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: thread moved to how-to\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
