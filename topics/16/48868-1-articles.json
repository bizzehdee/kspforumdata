It also uses less power per transmission cycle. So if the 16 takes 10 seconds and 50 electricity to transmit the results from an experiment, the 88-88 will take 5 seconds and 100 electricity to transmit the same data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you have two sets of results to transmit at the same time, then two 16s will take 10 seconds and 100 electricity to transmit both sets simultaneously, while the 88-88 will take 10 seconds and 200 electricity to transmit each set one at a time. Something to bear in mind if you like to run multiple experiments at once and electricity load is a concern.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steamypete","CreatedById":60577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T12:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis does not make sense to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo obviously the commutron 16 is always the best choice because it uses less power. It takes longer to transmit but who cares about waiting 10sec or 20sec.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have liked it better if there was a reason to choose the 88-88 because it gives you more science. Then the extra power usage would be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogface","CreatedById":75396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T12:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eare they all the same range?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
