They are fun to design and pilot, and occasionally can be used to bring lighter, more regular payloads to orbit, but piloting them takes considerably more effort than a rocket, considerably more time, and landing takes a lot effort too. And it\u0027s as easy if not easier to botch the ascent too. Sure try them because they \\*are\\* fun, but for launches with actual payloads I recommend a different kind of SSTO - rockets, like the [Cygnus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123195-Cygnus-family-Recoverable-SSTO-Rockets-from-15-to-300-tons-%281-0-4%29) family.

The Spaceplane option would take you to level flight at 10000m, though the climb angle may be too steep for some planes. Then when in high-speed mode start a climb by changing the target height and switch to Ascent Guidance when you switch to rockets. It will likely need a different ascent curve setting.\n\nThe transition speed will depend on the plane. The switchover needs to be on an Action Group and needs to be at peak speed. Waiting for a flame-out wastes speed. There\u0027s some rapidly diminishing thrust before flame-out, the air-breathing mode losing intake air, and the plane slows down.\n\n1000m/s air-breathing may work out as a little too fast a little too low\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACexcess heating\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACand 800m/s with a little more altitude might be a better option. It\u0027s possible that the initial rocket-phase climb angle needs to be higher than you had with air-breathing to get out of the major heating.\n\nIt\u0027s good if the pitch control is balanced, not too slow but not too fast to be precise. With a good design, manual pitch control can do better than MechJeb. Roll and yaw need to be stable. Splitting a control surface into two parts and switching off one part at speed can help. If there\u0027s a pitch oscillation with MechJeb excess control authority may be the reason.\n\nGet onto the heading you want early, before you go supersonic.\n\nTime of flight from ground to orbit will be different. That can affect launch times for a rendezvous. Orbital inclination changes can be expensive, Do it right and you will be in the same plane, and simple phasing orbits are all you need"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:30:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Lets just go with the OP\u0027s desire to work on a spaceplane and assume that SSTO is shorthand for \u0022SSTO spaceplane\u0022 in this thread, please.\n\nTrouble with that, as posts 3, 5 and 6 all pointed-out is that the OP says he wants to use a SSTO - of whatever flavour - that\u0027s easier to build than a rocket and easier to fly than a plane.

Its performance surprised me. It should all be stock parts, and there could be a lot of fiddling.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr7lb247rucaws1/White%20Arrow%20Spaceplane.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr7lb247rucaws1/White%20Arrow%20Spaceplane.craft?dl=0)\n\nAnd here\u0027s a picture of the White Arrow in orbit.\n\n![AOtkIUr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AOtkIUr.jpg)\n\nI hope the .craft file loads, it should be all stock components.\n\nWhat startled me was the performance. I was getting 1450m/s in air-breathing mode, and reached a 100km orbit with 980m/s deltaV. Practise might improve that a little. How close do you let things get to overheating during the air-breathing phase? And things were happening fast enough to be worrying.\n\nAnyway, with SAS on it is stable. Pitch and throttle and the only controls you need. I was keeping fuel pumped forwards because earlier planes had bad instability, and it was possibly too much. I could see the canards maintaining nose-up position, and that means drag. But that\u0027s the main reason the small fuel tanks and batteries are where they are.\n\nToggling the Rapier\u0027s operating mode and the intake were on an action group.\n\nI started rotation about three-quarters of the way down to runway. Gear up and a gentle climb. between 5 and 10 degrees. Full throttle, of course. It went supersonic between 3000 and 4000m, and I levelled at about 6500m. I think it\u0027s a good sign that the nose stuck close to the prograde marker on the navball. Once the speed was in the 600-650m/s range you can start a gentle climb. That\u0027s when the acceleration started getting exciting. I started a fast climb, the acceleration continued, and that\u0027s when I noticed it was a bit nose heavy.\n\nI ended up cutting back the throttle to stop the speed increasing. I was maintaining the speed. With a rocket you\u0027re in the gravity turn at that sort of speed and altitude combination, and I didn\u0027t want to pitch up too much. Eventually I was back at full throttle, getting more altitude, and switched to rocket mode as the speed dropped slightly.\n\nAfter that it was more like taking a rocket to orbit. \n\nI could deliver a small satellite to orbit, and that might counter the nose-heaviness. A radial decoupler in the cargo bay might be enough. It\u0027s a one-man craft, and I\u0027m not sure that there would be so much useful science in LKO by the time you had the tech to build it. Could you replace the cargo bay with crew space, and how would you fit a docking port?\n\nWho was that who suggested a couple of command chairs in the cargo bay, and transfers to the space station by an EVA?\n\nThe starting point for the re-entry is tricky. If you use SAS to align prograde the deceleration is slow. A ten-degree pitch-up will have some noticeable effects. I\u0027ve used 90-degree pitch-up above 40km. Starting from the far side of the big desert seemed way too far, but I was way too high as I passed over the big mountains. I got low enough to restart as a jet, with fuel for 15 or 20 minutes of power. Still too high, and I was too nose-down to successfully land. I crashed on the runway.\n\nRemember, the Rapier is an engine that doesn\u0027t generate electricity, so you need batteries."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T09:17:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What startled me was the performance. I was getting 1450m/s in air-breathing mode, and reached a 100km orbit with 980m/s deltaV. Practise might improve that a little. How close do you let things get to overheating during the air-breathing phase? And things were happening fast enough to be worrying.\n\nAs close to overheating as possible. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nSince reasonable spaceplace have too low a TWR for reaching 1400-1500 m/s in a climb, you\u0027ll have to balance heating up with accelerating (in level flight) low enough to have time to pitch-up.\n\nIn the end the trade-off is between speed and angle of climb when leaving air-breathing territory. Shallow climb means drag for longer but higher speed means less rocket dV required to reach orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T09:35:32Z","Content":"The one tip that made my day concerning spaceplanes (thanks again Rune) was, that breaking Mach 1 above 10.000 m is the essential point, no matter how you get there.\n\nR.A.P.I.E.R.s and lots of llifting surfaces are your best friends."},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T09:50:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The one tip that made my day concerning spaceplanes (thanks again Rune) was, that breaking Mach 1 above 10.000 m is the essential point, no matter how you get there.\n\u003E R.A.P.I.E.R.s and lots of llifting surfaces are your best friends.\n\nLifting surfaces produce drag. It\u0027s like air intakes. You need enough air, but there\u0027s a drag penalty.\n\nIt\u0027s a toss-up whether to wait to 10000m before Mach 1. At that altitude acceleration can be a bit slow until you\u0027re well past Mach 1. The real Concorde usually went supersonic at the equivalent of 6000m.\n\nI had a look at the velocity and atmosphere curves for the engine, and Mach 1.4 looks to be one of the critical numbers. But I am not sure that I am reading them right.\n\nLifting surfaces will reduce your take-off speed, but high-speed jets can have pretty high take-off speeds."}]}
