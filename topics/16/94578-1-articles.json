I\u0027ve been trying for well over a few hours with no luck. On launch i attempt to switch over to the map stage to view my apoapsis and begin planning a manoeuvre and both my vessel and the apoapsis marker are greyed out in my career mode. However if i switch to a sand box mode it works perfectly. Is there any fixes to this, do i need a part for the vessel to attach, do i need to click something in my tracker? It\u0027s driving me barmy at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T17:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/323\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBeta than Ever FAQ\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhere are the orbit markers?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn career mode, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to upgrade the mission control and tracking station buildings to gain access to all the map screen functions, but you do start out with basic orbital tracking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T17:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame as Master Tao.
