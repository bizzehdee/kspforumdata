Zeblote hit the nail on the head. I tried it again, lost control when I decoupled and then went to the space center and there it was. I drove it a bit and then was able to redock it. You all solved both my issues. I love this community, you guys are the most helpful I have ever run into and you have my sincere thanks. Here is a pic of my rover. Its not much but I hope to use it and explore the Mun and Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/8319/ijm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ijm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T23:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBe careful driving it on Minmus. The very low gravity there means it won\u0027t have much grip and it\u0027s easy to hit a bump and crash if going a bit quick.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
