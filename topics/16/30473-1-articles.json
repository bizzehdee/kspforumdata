I think I\u0027ve passed the tests, as I\u0027ve managed to land a terrified Bob on the mun and got him back home in one piece, and I managed to dock a bunch of awkwardly shaped objects of non-descript scientific purpose together while orbiting our lovely mudball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing the ambitious lobber of things into orbit that I am, I now started construction of a multi-piece space station- using quad docking ports as my OCD does not allow angles smaller than 90 degrees. Also I felt the need to reinforce the main structures with struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve docked three parts so far, and the whole thing is starting to lag as soon as I approach visual range. This, of course, not only reduces fun, but also makes it quite difficult to dock anything else. I\u0027m assuming this is due to an increasingly large parts count- I roughly estimate it reaching 1000 parts, and I\u0027m not even halfway yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy workaround so far is using mechjeb to handle some of the docking, although he struggles with the quad ports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is twofold:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. What can I currently do about this large parts count lag, aside from, obviously, keeping part count down? I\u0027ve tried decreasing graphics settings but this has little effect- as physics and parts are CPU-based.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What has the future of KSP got in store for large part count lag? Will it be drastically improved, or am I best to forget about my ambitious plans and stick to smaller ships for now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record- core is 4GHz, 8GB of ram, using a Gforce GTX 560 TI, running windows 7 64bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your feedback, I\u0027m looking forward to contributing my bit of insanity to this community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xraybroadcasterfromvenus","CreatedById":68687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T12:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade an astonishing discovery- there was in fact a construction on the station that was CAUSING the lag. For some strange reason, the quad docking ports were the culprit! I\u0027ve modified all the sections of the station by replacing the quad ports with the new big port, lobbed \u0027em all into space, put them together, and the lag is back to normal levels. Very odd indeed, as the quad ports were perfectly identical and should\u0027ve docked up properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question still stands though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim guessingthe quads had struts to hold things together making for approx part count of 13 - 17 parts per coupler ( more if struts used to attach the coupler to the supporting part ). so a parts saving of 15 or so average for each docking port replaced by the one large dock. adds up quickly and you should be lagging again in no time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not much you can do about part count, indeed anecdotally it seems it might be scaling non-linearly (twice the performance ups your usable part count by less than twice). As far as I know the developers haven\u0027t speculated on what sort of performance improvements they think they can reasonably achieve in this area but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the rest of the game is built around 200-300 part vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xraybroadcasterfromvenus","CreatedById":68687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T20:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProcyon- you are indeed correct, the quads did have struts, making a single dock worth 17 parts. I\u0027d say your conclusion would be correct, if it weren\u0027t for my actions today: I\u0027ve now hooked on an additional few modules, surpassing the parts count lost by the ports. The original lag really was very, very bad- enough to wonder if something was wrong. I can only suppose the quads developed minor differences during installation and subsequent loads, thus causing significant stress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt matters little now though, I\u0027ve switched to using the big ports, and am using a little mechjeb trickery to get the connection angle right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEndlesswaves- that would be great.
