Ignore fuel already burned to get to Mun, assume both transfers begin with same amount of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that, if your desired ejection angle was 150 degrees for example, then if Mun was at 150 degrees relative to Kerbin prograde, that burning Mun prograde would effectively have the same result as burning at 150 degrees from Kerbin. And since you\u0027re already travelling faster relative to Kol, it would require less \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if MechJeb factors this in to its calculations, but I\u0027m taking a gamble right now and travelling to Mun. Maybe I can see when it schedules the transfer burn.

If you\u0027re going to Duna, for example, you\u0027ll only need a 250 m/s or so burn to depart the Mun, then another 200-300 m/s burn at kerbin periapsis to get the desired ejection velocity (not certain of the numbers, when I do this I usually use Minmus).
