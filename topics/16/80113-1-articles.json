In orbital rate, you put your spacecraft into a slow rotation, to keep it \u0027facing forward\u0027 in its orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking in KSP is generally thought to be easier in orbital rate. However, setting up orb-rate can be tricky, not least because going into time-warp automatically puts you into stellar inertial. The way to side step the issue altogether (at least if you have a nice symmetric docking port) is to have both spacecraft pointing normal to their orbital vectors, as others have pointed out in this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T15:33:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T15:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOTOH, if your docking takes so long that this sort of orbital effect becomes an issue, you really need to polish up the speed of your docking.
