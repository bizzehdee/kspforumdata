The setup is very simple, a MK16 chute on top of a MK I command pod with a heatshield on the bottom. I did a mission to the moon and back this morning and everything was fine, the same pod survived (without any problems). I just tried returning from the moon with the exact same setup and the chute was destroyed, even though the pod was oriented the right way, all the way. This happened to two different craft (good bye Jeb and Valentina...) A third craft had the radial chutes next to MK16, and they didn\u0027t burn up. I never used deadly re-entry, as the first time I used it it was extremely bugged, and I never looked at it again. I hoped now that Squad made it stock it would be without these strange bugs... apparently not... Worst thing.. there is a craft heading for Duna with the MK16 chutes... It was designed to use them, so those Kerbals are also heading for a certain doom (first time going past minmus since 0.19), Ah well, hopefully there is another small fix before the next 20 ingame days pass ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:01:20Z","Content":"Are you deploying them while re-entering?"},{"CreatedByName":"archnem","CreatedById":135259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:02:28Z","Content":"Yah in 1.0.2 re-entry is for serious now."},{"CreatedByName":"chunes","CreatedById":142605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:03:39Z","Content":"CanadianVendingMachine, I believe Kaiz0r is saying the parachute is burning up before even deploying it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chunes**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaiz0r","CreatedById":68389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:19:59Z","Content":"Yup, just tried again, with the shallowest of re-entry\u0027s I ever did.

Either with space to bring him home or an experienced (level 1?) engineer to repack his chute.\n\nI doubt it\u0027ll work, but aerobraking at around 40-45km on a few orbits to bleed off some of your velocity will reduce the total heat your chute will experience.

That will prevent them from deploying until that pressure (may even need to be higher). It\u0027s \\*basically\\* in bars; 1.0 is sea level, 0.0 is space... the pressure meter can tell you what the value is at a given altitude.\n\nTo be specific: it\u0027s the \u0022Min Pressure\u0022 bar that appears at the top of the chute\u0027s right click context menu. Not the \u0027Altitude\u0027 bit. The \u0027Altitude\u0027 is for FULL deployment, and \u0022Min Pressure\u0022 for partial deployment.
