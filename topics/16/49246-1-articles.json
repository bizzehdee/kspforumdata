I waited a bit before opening chutes (I think I triggered them around 4500 m MSL or so), and slowly floated down towards the surface. The spacecraft\u0027s service module (all that remained at this point) consisted of the basic one-man command pod, with the 90-size fuel tank and an LV-T30, as well as four mystery goo modules and four landing legs, all placed in radial symmetry. I pressed the button to extend the landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI blinked, and I missed it. But before I even knew what was happening, everything below the command module had disappeared into thin air. There was no explosion noise, just *poof* gone. I did see a couple of very small debris pieces shooting toward the ground at incredible speed, but that was it. In addition, I had suddenly switched from a 140 m/s fall to about a 50 m/s climb, causing my parachute to disappear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully, whatever force pushed me back up also pushed me slightly over the coastline, allowing Jeb to make a rather sloppy but survivable splashdown. But I\u0027m curious. I think this happened around 3000 m MSL, but I\u0027m not one hundred percent sure. Has anyone else had this happen, or know how to prevent it? Cause although random explosions can be fun, I\u0027d like to keep my crew alive if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KatzOhki","CreatedById":73492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the chutes fully deploy at too fast a velocity they can either tear off or cause parts of your ship to dislodge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPressing F3 will bring up the flight log. Beyond that the only thing I can say is your craft sounds like it could be prone to breaking, have you flown it more than just that once? Kind of sounds like your chute(s) fully deployed and you had a unexpected disassembly, potentially due to clipping or the legs attempting to deploy at the same time you got a phantom force sending you on your way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t really advice you more than attempting to recreate it so you can figure it out, or mount less stuff on your command module.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheWanderer","CreatedById":57804,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esounds like too much weight on teh chute, or moving too fast when it deployed\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
