It occurs at very low altittude (1200-1800m) I can slow it down by removing two of the fuel lines, but that leads to two of my shuutle engines shutting down and this just causes loss of control at higher altitudes. Please help me out, I really want to make a working shuttle for once!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my shuttle, the fuel lines I ment are the ones leading from the external tank to the shuttle side tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9ncMW8ph.png\u0022 alt=\u00229ncMW8ph.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see: loss of control here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1QB4Y7ih.png\u0022 alt=\u00221QB4Y7ih.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need the craft file, please just ask\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T11:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne option to reduce it at least a bit is to remove the girder between the decoupler and the orange tank.
