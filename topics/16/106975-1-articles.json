I also ran into overturn problems, though on my first shot I managed to get it into orbit with lots of fuel to spare in the core launch stage (the engines were rather toasty, however.) All I did to compensate was to periodically turn on piloted SAS to hold the vector until after my altitude increased, then released it to allow the nose to fall, then reactivated, etc. I think I did that three or four times, and yes, the first was way before I got to 2400m up.\n\n[http://imgur.com/YOZCKzb](http://imgur.com/YOZCKzb)\n\nI get the impression that you built this in career mode, given the tech. The main issue that I see is that it\u0027s a needlenose pair of capsules providing only so much heading authority against such a thick trunk of a launch stage fuselage. With your stationary fins shedding away with the LRBs as well, it means that the much heavier ass end is winning.\n\nMake no mistake, however, this *is* flyable as is."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:20:41Z","Content":"Well, I\u0027ve played with old stock aero, NEAR, and FAR... and it seems the new stock aero is inclined to prefer a slightly steeper/later turn than FAR/NEAR, but much sooner than old stock. I\u0027ve found (and this is just loosely based of some limited experience) that the best results are obtained by starting gravity turn around 2-4km, gently edging over with an angle of attack that\u0027s no greater than about 5 degrees at most (maybe 10 occasionally). Try to minimize mach effects, and shoot for around 65-70 degrees at 10km. After 10km you can slightly increase your angle of attack with less fear of flipping. Try to aim for about 40 degrees at 30km, and continue bringing the prograde down until about 45-50km. Whenever the navball switches to \u0022orbit\u0022 mode, you can essentially take any angle of attack, just try to get out of atmosphere somewhere around 45s to 1 minute to apoapse. You can do further, but it\u0027s harder to keep it low without burning radial-in... of course if you\u0027re aiming for a higher initial orbit, then by all means raise that apoapse.\n\nA couple tips that help me out. \n\na) Always have \\*at most\\* one gimballed engine (or at least decrease gimbal limit on the others), this decreases SAS-wobble significantly.\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Consider using control surfaces \\*only\\* for attitude control below 35km, will eliminate wobble... take advantage of the new aero.\n\nc) Strut \\*through\\* fairings. I know, it looks derpy... but it works. And since the fairings don\u0027t auto-strut, it\u0027s quite necessary. This can easily be done so long as the payload is smaller in diameter than the launch stage (which it should be). Run struts from the size adapter to the payload in whatever way is convenient. I\u0027ve launched payloads attached by docking port with struts and had no wobble.\n\nd) Always use control surfaces/wings on the lower end of your rocket. If in doubt, test it out. You may need larger wings for bulkier payloads that induce more drag.\n\nEDIT: e) \\*Never\\* use follow prograde SAS setting during launch... it\u0027s derpy \\*especially\\* if it\u0027s given more attitude control than it needs. If you find that when you click the \u0022hold \\*\\*\\* mode\u0022 button, where \\*\\*\\* means radial-in, maneuver node, prograde, etc.... with sas on and your ship gets twitchy and can\u0027t seem to point exactly where it\u0027s supposed to (slightly off to the side), chances are high that you have too much attitude control... try decreasing by turning of some reaction wheels.\n\nEDIT: The \u002210 degrees at 1km\u0022 is highly dependent on your TWR. For people used to playing old stock souposphere which rewarded much higher TWR... this is a valid strategy. If you\u0027re using a lower launch TWR of closer to 1.8-2, the method I described is much better. Also, the only time turning SAS off for a \u0022natural\u0022 gravity turn will work is if you have sufficient lift. Since your rocket is built in 4x symmetry, it will produce less body lift. It also has nary a wing to speak of, which is why your nose is dropping like a rock (probably combined with a lack of attitude control authority and/or low TWR). If you want a more \u0022natural\u0022 gravity turn, build in 2x symmetry and launch with flat side facing the direction you plan to turn in. Wings are good too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T00:28:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:32:21Z","Content":"Your TWR is very low, 1.16 at lift off, and then you stage right as it\u0027s starting to build up.
