It\u0027s basically laid out like the Ravenspear Mk4 (stock) with a central body and two outrigger engines, the major difference being the outriggers are separated and supported by \u0027chime\u0027 wings along the central body and I am using Rapier engines. The central body has 2 engines and the outriders have 1 apiece, and each section has an equal amount of Fuel/LOX to support each engine (the center has twice as much fuel as it supports 2 engines.) and some extra fuel in each section for the air breathing part of the mission. The setup works great during the air breathing section of the mission, as each section uses the spare fuel provided there for same. My problem starts after the engines switch to closed cycle, the center uses all its oxidizer (while ignoring the Fuel), and the outriggers use the Fuel up (while ignoring the Oxidizer), and as there is some extra fuel in each section the center engines cut out first (for lack of oxidizer) while the outriggers keep running thanks to the spare fuel from the air breathing part of the mission. There are no fuel lines between the sections, so how the heck is this happening, and how do I stop it?! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any reply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T10:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought is of symmetry.

I suspect the issue is that a fuel tank that does hold a particular resource does not draw that resource from its parent if it is surface attached (not node to node, e.g. any tank attached to a wing) but a tank that does not hold a particular resource will draw that resource from the parent. So, if you use any parts that just hold liquid fuel then they can draw fuel through the wings from the main body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures (or better, your craft file) would be a big help in diagnosing the exact cause. You will probably have to add some fuel lines to force the fuel to drain in the way you want (and you may need to reorganise some of the part connections too).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LMC","CreatedById":99695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T09:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like a recursive search error.
