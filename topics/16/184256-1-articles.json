Because what you have described is a docking manoeuvre, where they physically connect. Rendezvous simply means that you are stationary within the vicinity of the target vehicle, in other words, not\u00A0moving\u00A0and close to the target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on where the docking ports are located, and the location and number of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters determines how hard it is to dock the ships. An image would really help, as the design of the craft is kinda important to the ease of docking. If the docking ports are on the front of the ships, it makes it significantly easier.\u00A0All I can say now is\u00A0it\u0027s just patience and very slow approaches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dan Kerman","CreatedById":193616,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-05T13:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used this guide to help me... now I rendezvous and dock like a boss.
