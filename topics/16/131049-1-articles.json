For the first, you could be having phantom forces from the model that are causing them to accelerate. Also, try to detach them so they\u0027re either prograde or retrograde from you. If you eject them closer to or farther from Kerbin, they would be in a different (and eccentric) orbit, but for things that start off very close, i would expect the effect to be small.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the other question, You want it high enough that you can be in a lower orbit to catch up with it in a reasonable time. You want it low enough that it doesn\u0027t take a huge amount of fuel or a very capable rocket to get there. But game mechanics has more to do with this than I would like. In a high orbit (300km? 500?) the game will not render the planet in as much detail, which will cut down on lag. Also, in a higher orbit, you can time warp at a higher rate. If you\u0027re waiting for a launch window before you leave the station, and that window is three months away, you don\u0027t want to do that at 100km. I don\u0027t build them as often as I used to--since they added the NASA-inspired parts I don\u0027t have much need to assemble and refuel ships for interplanetary shots--but when I do, I usually put them at 300-350km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222386214\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454160613\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267878\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gary_P\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Gary_P said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter it got into view and stopped, if I left it go the target will float away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you be more specific?\u00A0 Float away \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehow fast\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you mean, like, \u0022visibly fast, with a relative speed of many centimeters per second or more, so that in a minute or so it\u0027s gone a long distance\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr do you mean \u0022they don\u0027t stay permanently there, and if I let them sit for several hours or more they eventually drift apart\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are two different things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you mean the second one-- i.e. a really slow drift that takes place over multiple orbits-- then that\u0027s normal and pretty much unavoidable, in real life as well as in KSP.\u00A0 Two things that aren\u0027t actually docked together will \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealways\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E eventually drift apart, since in practice they\u0027re never in exactly the same orbit as each other.\u00A0 If one of them is in an orbit that has a period that\u0027s a few seconds longer than the other, they\u0027ll drift.\u00A0 And getting the periods \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eexactly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in sync is practically impossible, unless you HyperEdit them or something.\u00A0 The moral of the story is that \u003Cstrong\u003Eit\u0027s not possible to leave things parked next to each other\u003C/strong\u003E, at least not long-term.\u00A0 They \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewill\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E eventually drift apart.\u00A0 The only way to leave things together is to leave them docked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re talking about a much faster drift, i.e. fast enough to show up as a relative velocity on the navball, what relative velocity are you observing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gary_P","CreatedById":67878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnark, I\u0027ll do a test and time it and see.I didn\u0027t have time to switch to the other vessel and dock them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222386481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022131049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454178978\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267878\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gary_P\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Gary_P said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnark, I\u0027ll do a test and time it and see.I didn\u0027t have time to switch to the other vessel and dock them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno...
