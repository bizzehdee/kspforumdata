Remember, you can build stuff in space to make bigger ships. However, sometimes smaller is better. You should bring the minimum you need with you on interplanetary missions. You also should refuel larger ships in orbit, so you can bring up the fuel separately on a specialty ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmaller is better if you want cost-effective rockets. I cannot stress this enough. Send the smallest ship that will complete the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of how to get more bang for your buck (hopefully in the figurative sense) I have a few tips. I highly recommend use of lots of solid boosters in initial takeoff, as even without recovering them they are far more cost-effective. This is not to mention the punch they pack. The LFBx2 is also a very nice way to asparagus in more takeoff power. Ideally you want to break atmosphere as fast as possible without exceeding the terminal velocity for your craft. This usually means having a thrust to weight ration of 2-3. You may want to configure your ship that you have to initially throttle down a little to maintain this, so you can punch it once in the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, you can refuel your ship once it\u0027s in orbit if you are launching bigger interplanetary vessels. This is important, because there is a limit to the maximum cost-effective weight, and using your final stage tanks twice can really save on weight. Finally, while making massive launch platforms SSTO is a real pain, it\u0027s quite easy to send up fuel in an SSTO or an SSTO with boosters. This can save you LOTS of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou already discovered that fins aren\u0027t necessary, so that\u0027s good. Fins are only necessary if you have no other means of control.

If they\u0027re full tanks, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u0027s 123 tonnes of fuel in the boosters and \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E164 tonnes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E in the core\u003C/strong\u003E. And if they\u0027re not full, the assumptions of the design might not hold because the mass ratio of the tanks you\u0027re using isn\u0027t 9:1 - it\u0027s 8.2:1. Your options are to change your tank setup - three orange tanks and an X200-16 will give you what you need - or to reduce the amount of fuel in the S3-7200s to about 90% (that should be, if I\u0027m doing the math right, 2916 units of liquid fuel and 3564 units of oxidizer each) and take out that topmost S3-7200 in the core. This is assuming you swap out the dual Mainsails with a single KR-2L in any case (two mainsails are 12 tonnes, a single KR-2L is 6.5 tonnes, so the KR-2Ls fall in the \u0022more efficient\u0022 category in this case).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll tell you what - I\u0027ll go ahead and replicate your booster with the tweaks I\u0027ve proposed, to see if just adjusting the fuel will do the trick or not (I\u0027m concerned about hitting an early delta-v bottleneck).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind that Temstar\u0027s designs generally wind up with a 1.3 TWR in the core once all the boosters are separated. If you\u0027ve got that, you\u0027re golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, SSTO transporter spaceplane \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be an option as well. DocMoriarty has put out what I consider to be the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/223333-ksp-space-plane-construction-and-operation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edefinitive guide to transporter spaceplanes\u003C/a\u003E and his guidelines have proven themselves most useful in my own fights with flight. A good rule of thumb for a transporter spaceplane is a 25% payload fraction - so for a 150 tonne payload you\u0027d want to shoot for a 600 tonne spaceplane. His guide says that the max take-off weight per RAPIER engine is 13 tonnes...so you\u0027d need \u003Cstrong\u003E47\u003C/strong\u003E engines. All I can say there is \u0022good luck\u0022 if you wanted to try that route...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-02T03:12:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2014 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
