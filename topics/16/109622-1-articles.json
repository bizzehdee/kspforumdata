Nothing for the thermometer/science jr/barometer/goo in either low or high orbit. Then I flew another mission to the pole and landed on tundra and ice caps. On the surface, all the instruments gave different data per biome, as did EVA \u0027flying\u0027 and on the ground.\n\nis that a trend on other bodies like mun/minmus? I.e I only have to get one grab of science from high orbit, and one from low orbit (and EVA data in low orbit oer biome), then I have to land to get the rest?\n\nscience is quite confusing so I\u0027m constantly thinking I\u0027m missing lots\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T08:03:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 08:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrklaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T07:47:29Z","Content":"Try [here](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science#Possible_combinations_of_Activity.2C_Situation.2C_and_Biome).\n\nEDIT: And IMHO the Science Alert mod is great for learning what you are missing."},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T08:03:50Z","Content":"Perfect, thanks!
