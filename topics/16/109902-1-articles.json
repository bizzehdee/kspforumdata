I\u0027m not yet clear on the details, but I\u0027ve seen a pair of turbojets do that in 1.0.2, e.g. producing 140kN on one side, 120kN on the other, at the same time, resulting in a constant yaw battle while it\u0027s happening.

Mach 1 at sea level is just fine under the new aerodynamics, although not really a valid ascent profile if orbit is the intended destination (you don\u0027t want to be going for speed until you\u0027re above about 7,500\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310,000m, possibly even 15,000m, depending on the design)."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T05:47:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay, thanks a lot.\n\u003E Since I already have a crap plane out there that I\u0027m hoping to land, is there any advice for how to stop a spin when it happens?

Put them as far back as you can, and they\u0027ll shuttlecock you to a nose-first attitude every time.\n\nAlso, I\u0027ve noticed that a lot of times, locking your SAS can in fact cause a LOSS of control. It\u0027s too twitchy nowadays for high-speed aircraft. Set your ship up with the CoM and CoL like this:\n\n![lJImBNj.png](http://i.imgur.com/lJImBNj.png)\n\nWith the CoM and CoL located closely, like in the pic, you\u0027ll only need a little elevator trim, and you\u0027ll have a rock steady plane that is highly responsive to control inputs and can be easily hand flown, no SAS required.\n\nOh, and get the RCS Build Aid mod.

It doesn\u0027t matter if it moves a little, only that you understand how it moves, and that it doesn\u0027t leave you with an unstable plane. It is wrong, in my opinion, to artificially restrict your designs by making it a requirement that CoM does not move. Just be aware of the issue and know how the plane will behave, move fuel from aft tanks to forward tanks in orbit, before re-entry."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:34:21Z","Content":"Yaw is rotation about the vertical axis of an aircraft.
