It will let me go back to the station, but it didn\u0027t prompt me with like a finished mission thing or anything. Is that all there is to do?

Personally I think the next logical step after learning to orbit is to extend that orbit so that it goes out as far as the Mun or Minmus. Once you do that, learning to establish an orbit around either of those followed by a landing is both a worthy achievement and self satisfying moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shantred","CreatedById":78995,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T15:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for the wonderful suggestions!
