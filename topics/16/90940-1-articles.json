I\u0027d also be able to launch right into the inclined planes for rendezvous and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have kerbal engineer and I can determine the current angle to the AN/DN of the target using this, but the \u0022time to AN/DN\u0022 doesn\u0027t work right on Kerbin, I guess it thinks the \u0022orbit\u0022 i\u0027m on is straight to the center of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Kerbin\u0027s rotational velocity (for Kerbin 64k I\u0027m using the 24hr rotation speed, so at the equator at sea level the rotational velocity is 279.25258 m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I figure out the location of the Ascending or Descending node of Minmus, so I can compute the time that the KSC will arrive at the Minmus ascending node?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MockKnizzle","CreatedById":59616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T05:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty simple to just eyeball it. Zoom out in map mode far enough to see Minmus\u0027 orbit, and pull the camera down to look at Kerbin from the side. Then just spin around until Minmus\u0027 orbit passes through the center of Kerbin. Put your ship on the pad, and timewarp until KSC passes right under the orbit track, and launch northish/southish as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T05:32:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA reasonably-simple way to keep track of Minmus\u0027s nodes, usable in a completely-unmodded stock install (any data-displaying mod like MJ or KER should allow you to do something similar, but more easily). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need something in as perfectly-equatorial an orbit as you can manage. Put something (doesn\u0027t matter what, as long as it can do a bit of maneuvering) in low Kerbin orbit. Set Mun as its target, and match planes. Since Mun has a zero-inclination orbit, you now have a reference for Kerbin\u0027s equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, set Minmus as the target of your zero-inclination satellite. Voila--you now have a visual reference to Minmus\u0027s node line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor added fun, send out a Kerbal to plant a flag at the Kerbal Space Center, so you can easily see KSC from the map view also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use this: Get ready to launch when Minmus is 90 degrees away from its line of nodes. (Midway between the ascending node and descending node.) This ensures that when you make your transfer orbit along the node line, Minmus will be there when you arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most rockets, time from launch to LKO is something on the order of 5 minutes (your time may vary, depending on vehicle design and launch trajectory profile; airbreathers take quite a bit longer). So you\u0027ll want to launch a few minutes prior to KSC crossing Minmus\u0027s node line. To do a direct injection into Minmus-transfer orbit, of course, you\u0027ll want to launch at the node line opposite your Minmus-rendezvous point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with anything worthwhile (in KSP or in real life), it probably won\u0027t work perfectly the first time you try it.
