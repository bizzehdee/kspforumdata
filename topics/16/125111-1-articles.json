While your building your plane make sure you link the engines to action groups. Basically they allow you to activate commands with the number buttons on your keyboard. You can do all kinds of things like deploying solar panels and toggle engines and even reversing their thrust. So to make action groups click on the button on the top bar in between the crew tab and the parts tab and there will be a list of groups to fill with commands.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fluburtur","CreatedById":152556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse actions groups, simply put the \u0022reverse thrust\u0022 action of all the engine in one group and you can reverse all your engines with the press of a button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aluc24","CreatedById":152712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fluburtur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fluburtur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUse actions groups, simply put the \u0022reverse thrust\u0022 action of all the engine in one group and you can reverse all your engines with the press of a button.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, but what if one is playing Career mode and doesn\u0027t have Action Groups unlocked yet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowWhalley","CreatedById":149344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThankyou guys, action groups completely skipped my mind \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022aluc24\u0022 data-cite=\u0022aluc24\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, but what if one is playing Career mode and doesn\u0027t have Action Groups unlocked yet?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t use engines that reverse thrust.
