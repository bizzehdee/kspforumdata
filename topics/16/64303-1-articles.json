Using those little ladders can help. They aren\u0027t perfect, though, and you\u0027ll want to test the design on Kerbin before you ever launch it into space. That break-over point from climbing vertically to standing on a horizontal surface has stranded many a Kerman.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T19:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone that\u0027s exactly what I needed.

Look at the 2nd ladder down, not the one that goes to the capsule but the one that goes to the top of that FL-T100 tank-- a few degrees of tilt was enough to let the Kerbal scramble to the top of the tank.
