(That is needed to count as \u0022orbit\u0022, if the periapsis remained under 70k, even if your ship was in space, it is suborbital...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOften the VIPs demand to get suborbital flight on Kerbin as well as orbit around Kerbin (and I guess the smart guys at mission control extort the VIP for a few extra funds for that suborbital \u0022extra\u0022)... but the nice thing for you is that you can check the mission, and see if the \u0022suborbital flight\u0022 already has a green check, but the \u0022orbit\u0022 does not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, these type of contracts are really easy. Take off, orbit, land safely, get paid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mperonen","CreatedById":167393,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T04:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh yes it was the altitude, thanks!
