I dont have any mods that could add in asteroids except for maybe OPM and GEP (Grannus Expansion Pack), just added GPP (Galileio\u0027s planet pack) secondary (SO it orbits kerbol) yesterday so thats outta the question. Haven\u0027t found any comets yet even with a couple sentinels around eve and dres orbit.
