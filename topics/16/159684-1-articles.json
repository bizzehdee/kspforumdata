Joo\u0027ls window just came up and I had a couple of contracts, so why not... well, think again, Rosco, \u0027cos those phantom forces are back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got the problematic\u00A0ship\u00A0in a quicksave after I burned the node, so perfect for experimentation. I hacked\u00A0the ship (several iterations of it actually, to discard clipping) into a new \u0022un-modded\u0022 KSP (except for DMagic Orbital Sience, because the ship uses parts from it) and no drifting there. So\u00A0I then started adding\u00A0mods... one\u00A0mod, no problem, two\u00A0mods, no problem, three... ALL of them, still no phantom forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then did the opposite, started with the drifting orbit and all the mods and begun\u00A0removing them, one, two, same deal, ship\u0027s still happily drifting away from Jool... or not... last mod I tried and the problem was still there, only to disappear later on for no reason other than I restarted the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what else there is to do? What else could I try? Any suggestions? Logs say nothing about a problem that I could see, BTW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T05:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223032449\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159684\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493004258\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261065\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rosco P.

Are you adding and removing the mods in the same order each time? It is often easiest to remove half the mods each time, between restarts.
