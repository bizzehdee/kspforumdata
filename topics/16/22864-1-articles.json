Look for Payloader and Subassembly Saver/Loader. Payloader does a better job of joining ships, but it runs out side of KSP (though you don\u0027t have to close KSP to run it), and there are a few things you have to do while building (simple procedures, but it doesn\u0027t work without them). SS/L is faster, easier, and works right from the VAB, but it has issues with staging. Stage 0 in the subassembly gets placed in Stage 0 in the ship you are loading it into, so you are about guaranteed to have to fix your staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waerth","CreatedById":57167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T16:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was looking for this to, if fixing the staging is all you have to do than Subassembly Saver/Loader sounds the easier way.

I haven\u0027t gotten around to trying it, but I think I may have a solution. In your subassembly (I\u0027m thinking of a lifter subassembly here, since that\u0027s what I use it for the most), add 4-6 dummy decouplers to the top of the stack, and assign them to stages 0-5. When the subassembly is loaded, those decouplers will be in those stages in your ship, and can easily be deleted. Then the rest of the subassembly parts will be in stages 6-X. It should work in theory, but I haven\u0027t put it into practice yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T16:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso basically you want to use the same lifter design on your payloads \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C/em\u003E rebuilding it again from scratch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eget the subassembly loader plugin. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E but if you don\u0027t want plugins, better rebuild everything from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Procyon","CreatedById":57510,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T17:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have used it and it works well.
