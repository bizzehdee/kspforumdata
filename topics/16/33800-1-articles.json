It depends on how the force of thrust acts on the center of mass. If you have your center of mass directly above the center of thrust, simple physics dictates that the resultant motion is upward, with no horizontal motion.

I think that if the CoM is much above the CoT, the rocket will tumble when you start to do your gravity turn, as that will displace the force on the craft - before gravity turn, thrust pushes vertically upwards through the CoM, and gravity pushes vertically downwards through the CoM. After gravity turn, though, thrust pushes non-vertically upwards through the CoM, and gravity still pushes vertically downwards through the CoM. Now that i write it down, though, I\u0027m not sure if that would tumble the rocket...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T19:50:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, the aerospike drag bug claims another rocket!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPbhead:The aerospike is missing the drag info in its part.cfg file. As such, it uses the default drag (0.1), which is lower than most parts use (0.2). Because it is less draggy, it wants to be at the front of an object, so rockets using aerospikes tend to be dynamically unstable. This can be fixed by either adding the drag info to the part file, or using another engine (eg: LV-T30). Rockets with enough control authority can simply brute force their way through it, FWIW.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T21:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using the \u0027spikes, you\u0027ll want to use launch clamps anyway.
