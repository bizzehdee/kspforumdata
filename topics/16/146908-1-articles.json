Generally, if a mod adds a tangible asset - rocket parts, planets and so on - your savegame will need to wait for mod updates. If a mod adds only intangible assets - prettier graphics, a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readout, a timekeeping device - you can just strip them out and continue playing your savegame on a new KSP version. Of course, there are exceptions from these rules of the thumb, but in general that\u0027s what you can expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, an important insight when it comes to modding KSP is that \u003Cem\u003Eyou don\u0027t need to update when Squad does\u003C/em\u003E. If you build yourself a great modded setup for 1.1.3, and you start playing with it and invest many hours into it, then why throw that all away when 1.2 drops? You can just continue playing modded 1.1.3 without updating right away. (Okay, maybe you want the features of 1.2, but it\u0027s not like those are a limited time offer, right? You can still get them after you\u0027re satisfied with your modded career and move on.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to prevent something like Steam from force-updating your game, you can configure Steam not to do it... but an even better idea is cloning your KSP installation. KSP is not dependant on running a special installer, or being in a special place on your disk - you can literally just copy and paste the entire folder, and you can launch the game from the copy just fine (just not via the Steam interface, you\u0027ll need to launch the executable from the folder). People who are heavily into modded gameplay usually keep multiple parallel installations. Myself, I have one fully up to date stock install, one custom modded instance, and two test instances for debugging (I help out with Near Future, see signature). So you don\u0027t even need to choose between stock and modded. You can have \u003Cem\u003Eboth at the same time\u003C/em\u003E! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that helped to allay some of your worries. As for which mods to get: that depends entirely on what you\u0027re looking for. I personally group mods into four categories: \u003Cem\u003Eaesthetic\u003C/em\u003E mods, which make the game look or sound better (example: Stock Visual Enhancements); \u003Cem\u003Eutility\u003C/em\u003E mods, which add little tools that make your life easier (example: Kerbal Engineer Redux); \u003Cem\u003Econtent\u003C/em\u003E mods, which add parts that work in the context of the stock game (example: Near Future Technologies); and \u003Cem\u003Egamechangers\u003C/em\u003E, which either add completely new aspects and things to do to KSP, or take stock KSP mechanics and change them into something different (example: KSP Interstellar). Every mod I\u0027ve seen falls into one of those four categories. The first two can generally be added and removed freely,without affecting your savegame; the latter two will most likely cause something to break if your remove them from a save, and a select few cannot even be added to an existing savegame and demand a fresh start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsk yourself: what do you feel is missing in your stock KSP experience? And then start looking for mods that specifically address that. I guarantee you: along the way, you will find a great number of different mods that make you say \u0022I never knew I needed this in my life!\u0022 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T13:21:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said; start there, tell us what exactly you\u0027d like to do, and we can give you some suggestions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeantime, here\u0027s my mod list and why I play with those mods:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nToolbar: Makes organizing the mods I use a lot easier.
