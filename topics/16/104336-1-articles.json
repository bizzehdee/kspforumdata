Any time I use the offset or rotation gizmos to edit a part on a craft, it will stick just fine until I try to load that craft again from a saved file or after reverting to the VAB where all of the rotations / offsets are completely gone. Is this a common problem? Or could I be having a mod conflict? If the latter, what would be the best way to identify the culprit?\n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T04:46:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T20:56:27Z","Content":"The only time this plagues me is if the part I\u0027m trying to offset/rotate ends up clipping into a procedural part.
