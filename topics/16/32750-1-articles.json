One time they will launch fine and get my payload into orbit and other times they will seemingly randomly explode or break apart or have parts fall off of them. This is with no redesign to the rocket. One time it will launch, the next nine times something will go wrong, and then it will launch fine on the tenth try.

I\u0027ve launched successfully with it. But when I attempt other launches with it they end in failure. An engine will get knocked off when a stage decouples, or a radial decoupler will fail and whole engines and tanks will fall from one side of the ship. Other time solid boosters will come lose and fly up and into the rest of the ship, a single fuel tank will come disconnected but still stay in place causing one engine on one side of the side to run out of fuel before the other sending the rocket spinning uncontrollably, and then sometime it will just all fall apart in one spectacular fail. But then other times it will launch with no problems. All this without changing a single part of the ship. It\u0027s hard to diagnose the problem when something different goes wrong each time, and then just as randomly it will all of a sudden work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if anyone else has made designs with these sort of results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreenDragon","CreatedById":57759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T08:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReinforce those problems one at a time, this just means that there are several problems, start with at least one strut from the top of SRBS to the tank they are atached to to keep them from random decoupling. Decouplers not being strong enough elsewhere? They never are, struts are needed for reinforcement. Engines getting knocked off during decouple? Then add some decoupling srbs, you know, the tiny ones to push the part away before yor ships spins add the engine gets ripped off. Do all of those and then see if there are many more problems. This seems a pretty basic set of problems, one fixed by reinforcing the spots undergoing the most stress.

I muck about with complex designs when I feel for a change or when my crude launchers don\u0027t cut it but otherwise I stick to the same old proven design(s). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I was telling a friend last night how I build my main lifter (40 ton payload to 85x85km or so), I counted the steps in building it and it turned out to be 17 with struts and all (my favourite number to boot, coincidence?). Simple, fast to build, crude, but well balanced, only two stages, no radial decouplers or solid boosters, just simple raw red tank \u002B mainsail power with pancake staging, which I\u0027ve personally found to be safer than aspargus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone already mentioned, weak spots don\u0027t always fail. You can see it as that there\u0027s degrees of reliability, if it fails once in a blue moon then it\u0027s just odd chance of several factors aligning, if it fails as often as it works you have weak spots, if you can only manage to fly it sometimes then you\u0027re just lucky that the weak spots didn\u0027t fail that time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all down to your design process. Like GreenDragon here mentioned, struts are your friend. Generally just slapping something together and going on full thrust nonstop will end up in unreliable rockets.

This uses the same heavy lifter for the bottom stages but this time with a heavier payload. That made it into orbit no problem as well.
