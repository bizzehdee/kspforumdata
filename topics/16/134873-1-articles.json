So I launch one aircraft and drive it out of the runway\u00A0and then return to space center. But when I want to return, I get the message below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game cannot be saved at this point. Leaving now will set you back to the last saved state. The last save was 50s\u00A0ago. Are you sure you wish to proceed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I return to space center anyway and then SPH again and launch another aircrat. But then I get the message below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aircraftname\u0022 is already on the runway\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith options to either recover the last aircraft and launch the current one or abort the launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also tried quicksaving the first aircraft and then launching a new one. The quicksave won\u0027t work on the ground so I get the first aircraft in air and then quicksave and go back to SPH to launch a new one. But when I want to launch it, I again get the message the the\u00A0last aircraft is already on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I can\u0027t have two aircrafts\u00A0simultaneously on air. But from what I\u0027ve seen on youtube and also my own experience with having several spaceships\u00A0simultaneously in orbit, this doesn\u0027t seem correct.
