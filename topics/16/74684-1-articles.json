Then I built a lander, and grabbed the launch stage and put it underneath the lander. Then I decided to change the lander and I dragged it to the left side of the screen to delete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I did that, my subassembly that I had dragged out into the VAB became grayed out. I could no longer interact with it, move it, delete it, nothing. Additionally, the entire subassembly disappeared completely. In fact, the subassembly tab has disappeared completely, it\u0027s no longer there. I rebooted my game and its still gone. Why did this happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI experimented and it appears that dragging your capsule to the left side to delete it is a bad idea, it messes up anything left in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill experimenting, I guess if I drag a new capsule out then I can interact with what was in the VAB again. But I need my subassembly back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevermind, the subassembly tab is back and so is the launch stage subassembly I built. Either I\u0027m going nuts or the game is.

Everything else is, directly or indirectly, attached to that. When you disconnect parts in the VAB/SPH you can still move them around as the game expects you to either delete them or re-attach them, somehow, to the main assembly - and through that back to the root again. When you, instead, deleted the capsule there was no root part left and the game then refuses to do anything until you create a new one. As sub-assemblies can\u0027t be/contain THE root part the whole tab is hidden for the same reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the other extreme - the fuel-line thing IS a bug. It can also affect struts and some other small parts and means you have to check whatever you add from a sub-assembly carefully.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
