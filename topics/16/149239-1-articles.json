Yours was doing barely 1:1 from about mach 2 onwards, which means you need more heavy nuke engines to keep climbing once you\u0027re above jet altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure of the reason for this. \u00A0The fuselage diameter of both our craft is the same (2.5m widest point). \u00A0 You have four 1.25m engine nacelles besides the main fuselage, as do I. \u00A0Engine nozzles are a very draggy way to end a stack, but thanks to your use of clipping you only have one more nozzle facing the wind than I do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour design does have 25% more weight and 66% less wing than mine, \u00A0so at any particular mach number (mach 3 etc) it will either be at a lower altitude to get enough lift (resulting in more fuselage/nozzle drag) or higher angle of attack (more wing drag, more fuselage drag). \u00A0Is there any way you can add more wing area without spoiling her looks?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also probably loose the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports or hide them in service bays. \u00A0 Reaction wheels rock !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince you are now using the big converter, \u00A0it has 10 times the Ore \u0026gt; fuel conversion efficiency as the little one. \u00A0This means you should take off with full ore tanks and convert that to fuel for the Duna/Minmus injection burn in low orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, \u00A0I did make it to orbit with \u0026gt;3000LF on your duck, which \u00A0should be enough for a Minmus refuelling stop. \u00A0I\u0027d be more concerned about it\u0027s ability to land safely on Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nps. I wouldn\u0027t consider using Whiplash engines except as disposable boosters to be dropped at flameout altitude (they r quite cheap!). \u00A0This would dramatically cut down the number of rapier you need to haul around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
