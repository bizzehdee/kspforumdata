The most efficient way is to get it as correct as possible as early as possible. However, to hit perfection from LKO, it can be quite awkward to set up the node accurately enough and your final orbit around the Mun is unlikely to be exactly where you want it. A mid-course correction can then usually be done using RCS translation (orient your ship logically, i.e. prograde and roll to match the map view) or a very small burn. Then, during the capture burn, check the inclination again and if it is a long way off then leave the orbit very elliptical and adjust it at apoapsis as needed before finishing the circularising the next time round. The more elliptical you leave the orbit, the slower you will be going at apoapsis and the less dV you will use for the plane change (again probably small enough to do with RCS) though the orbit will take longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steve-S","CreatedById":74649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T03:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying something now and it looks like it will work fantastically.

From there I did a 116 m/s correction to get right on the pole, followed by 239 m/s to capture into low orbit for a total of 1234 m/s. If I had done the correction earlier it could have probably been done for about 60 - 75 m/s more then a normal trip to Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wsdkgnK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wsdkgnK.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b2w0q0y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022b2w0q0y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T04:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JenBurdoo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JenBurdoo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s pretty expensive delta-v-wise to get into polar orbit,\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing there, about 8m/s Thats how much your initial low kerbin orbit needs extra to be 2 degrees off equator, which supplies the right angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECircularizing around Mun from a polar approach, or returning form a polar orbit back to Kerbin, wastes another ~125 m/s, if you would otherwise have been using Mun\u0027s gravity to best advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot expensive at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- I can enter polar orbit of Kerbin, then do Munar injection from there instead of matching planes/Hohmann maneuver etc.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENONONONONO! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E worst possible idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- I can circularize orbit and change my inclination at the descending or ascending nodes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmmm, Wot?
