If you mean landing and return capable, i don\u0027t think that\u0027s enough fuel, but i\u0027m no expert. It probably can land though. Also, i\u0027m hoping you have landing legs on the other side too. One thing that i don\u0027t see are fuel lines from the outside tanks to the inside. Without them, you have all of that extra fuel that you can\u0027t even use!(unless you haven\u0027t unlocked those yet and just put the fuel tanks there to hold the capsules). definitely enough batteries though. Just to put it out there, that thing could probably return from minmus if you have parachutes.
