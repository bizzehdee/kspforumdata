I tried yesterday bringing Valentina back from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, but didn\u0027t seem to be able to pull it off. In fact, I just seemed to prolong the most dangerous part of her ride by coming in too shallow. I really thought I was going to lose her, but those new shields have amazing amounts of ablative material slathered on them. The thermometers radially attached to the upper part of the capsule weren\u0027t so lucky.\n\nOverall though, despite some of the expected buggy-ness, I am seriously impressed with Squad\u0027s new stock aero and heating system. They add to up to making for a great thrill ride. I\u0027ll probably still use nuFar, and Deadly Reentry, when they\u0027re ready because I like that level of realism, but I really think Squad did a bang up job on 1.0. So far it\u0027s shaping up to be my favorite update since we got bac9\u0027s lovely space center.\n\n![500px-Skip_reentry_trajectory.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Skip_reentry_trajectory.svg/500px-Skip_reentry_trajectory.svg.png)\n\n![6ZikFWr.png](http://i.imgur.com/6ZikFWr.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T17:45:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lincourtl**\n  \nMarking as Answered because it is, but it\u0027s still a great conversation.

You need to have an off set CoM on the pod that can provide lift. To what extent angling your heatshield off prograde with a symmetrical CoM does anything like that.. I don\u0027t know. \n\nSquad should do it like in RSS/RO. The pods get a \u0022descent mode\u0022 which shifts the CoM.

If you set your periapsis to the right height you\u0027ll fly past it during reentry and will start to gain altitude again.

That\u0027s the other way of doing it -- trading off shock-layer heating for time -- and it\u0027s a good one, especially when you\u0027re coming in from an interplanetary transfer. If I recall correctly, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter did successive aerobraking passes for almost five whole months!

Held the capsule at 10 - 20 deg AoA. No apparent lifting.\n\nTry this with a spaceplane: Do reentry, where at ca. 40 km altitude you suddenly increase your pitch to 45 deg or even more. See what happens. I managed to grind to a complete stop this way. I.e. after this braking maneuver my velocity vector pointed straight down but i lost only a few km of altitude. So from 20 km altitude i went down vertically. I\u0027m sure FAR would have sent me back to space again.\n\nLikewise during ascent, whenever i try to pitch up to pull out of a shallow dive, i loose a big chunk of my speed while still descending.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T06:15:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DaMichel**"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:20:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Doesn\u0027t the 1.25m heat shield greatly shift the CoM?\n\nI had applied the hot fix to the shield so that the pod flies stable heat shield first with SAS off."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:02:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Doesn\u0027t the 1.25m heat shield greatly shift the CoM?\n\nIt shifts the center of drag, but not mass. Even if it did, it would pull the CoM *down* (from the VAB perspective), so it would still be symmetric. Offset CoM means you need to pull it away from the rocket axis.\n\nWhy is it needed, anyway?
