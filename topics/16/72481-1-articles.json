You can do that by right-clicking on each one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Deactivate steering on the back tires, and turn it on for the front tires. (Also by right clicking.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Have your controls for rolling/pitching/yawing with SAS separate from your rover controls of turning/going forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can actually use SAS to counteract the tendency to flip. Like you said, I find that I tend to leave it on most of the time. If you take a sharp turn, adding roll torque into the turn also helps keep it from flipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Sounds like you\u0027ve already discovered workarounds for most of this yourself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally speaking, you want your rovers to only have what you need on them. So, for example, if you only ever planned on bringing Jeb down to ride in it, then avoid taking up the extra space/weight of having room for 3 kerbals. Of course, if you want a rover you can use for lots of tasks then design it to suit those needs. That may mean overkill for certain missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, on low gravity worlds (like Minmus) you actually want it to weigh MORE. That\u0027s because tire traction affects speed. So if your rover is too light then the wheels don\u0027t grip so well. Also, you can darn near launch yourself into orbit on Minmus by going up a hill too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m sure there are more things people will add in.

It took me several iterations, but I finally managed to make a design that is capable of full speed crashes at 4x physical time warp without damage (or at least, minimal). It\u0027s also able to flip itself back over. It\u0027s a rescue vehicle that carries a driver and medic, and has space for two patients. Practical top speed on level terrain is about 23 m/s.
