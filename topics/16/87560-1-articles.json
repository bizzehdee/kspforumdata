Have you limited them to specific axes or all they all still on default for all axes? It usually helps a lot to have each surface only act in 1 direction. If you leave them on all axes, most of them are poorly placed to act on at least 2 axes but by trying to anyway, they screw up the plane\u0027s stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, on a plane that size, it\u0027s usually not a good idea to have the rudder up above the fuselage like that. Better to put rudders on the trailing edge of the wing, so they\u0027re even with the centerline. This prevents the rudders from causing roll even if the rudders themselves are set only to work in yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, there\u0027s torque. Torque is wonderful for helping SAS keep planes stable but the SP\u002B cockpits don\u0027t have very much of it and neither does the Mk2 probe core except in pitch. I usually find it necessary to add a small cargo bay full of inline reaction wheel units and the RTGs to power them (IOW, it\u0027s a service module, not a working cargo bay).

That\u0027s a lot of roll authority if I set both of them to roll). For the most part, I don\u0027t have any issues with over rolling, since it has a slight dihedral design allowing it to stay fairly level in flight. The problem is more to where if I do exert some control over it, say pitching up or rolling one way or the other, it won\u0027t center itself anymore, and will constantly bounce back and forth along that control axis. If I pitch, it does a dolphin act and starts going up and down constantly, without any more input. If I roll, it does the wing-waggle dance for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slope of the place where the rudder is helps it stay straight.
