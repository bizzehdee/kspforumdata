Thought it makes slight bit of maintenance work, I build modular wings in rows leading away from the fuselage and then strut in columns. The reason is it makes it easier to build without accidentally missing a strut and seems to hold together better without as much flexing. Neither way is wrong, just preference. Plus, with the new offset tool, it\u0027s really easy to shift the wings forward and back to adjust CoM/CoL relationship. You just have to do it several times (3 in this picture, but this was a long time ago, my planes are much more efficient now and use far less wing)\n\n![h0rSEgG.png](http://i.imgur.com/h0rSEgG.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T23:19:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Veldez","CreatedById":140511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T12:41:30Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies. I made modular strips in rows and tied them together. The wings are now more or less solid.

It eliminates the need to strut wings even on larger designs. I have a Mk3 SSTO weighing 110t and able to lift about 45t into LKO. Naturally, its wings are huge, and without a single strut they hold together perfectly.\n\nThis mod also greatly reduces the need for struts in all yur designs, including rockets.
