I wanted to try landing on these mountains, specifically in the area circled in the screenshot, for... science! However, after like 10 tries, I am having trouble! I always overshoot it, and end up so close, just beyond the mountains! I am trying to do this without going into orbit, and I am very unsure of how to land in that approximate area, and would like to know how. How do I? Thank you! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![screenshot201.png](http://s7.postimg.org/5i1q4dgbv/screenshot201.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T00:36:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T23:54:41Z","Content":"Four letters: VTOL"},{"CreatedByName":"Venusgate","CreatedById":125730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T00:01:44Z","Content":"If we\u0027re talking just a rocket, you dont have to go as fast as you can. if you stay under 300m/s and 10km altitude, you should be able to recover your speed enough to make last minute course corrections."},{"CreatedByName":"MathmoRichard","CreatedById":113752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T00:18:47Z","Content":"The easiest thing would be a plane with parachutes."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T00:36:34Z","Content":"Thanks everyone, but I think Venusgate\u0027s suggestion was best, as I would like to do it with a rocket.

Landing on a mountain is another. A rocket is easy enough you just have to hit the right trajectory. kerbin is moving against you so that\u0027s why your probably overshooting.
