It occurred to me that it\u0027d be neat to use it in career mode, and stage various battles as I progress, but it\u0027s difficult to do so when I need to fund both myself and my enemy. I\u0027m wondering, is there any way (native in-game, modded, or even file-editing) to temporarily disable the need for funds to build ships, so that I can freely spawn in the enemy combatants and then re-enable when I want to launch my own?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T02:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could give yourself funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBackup your save if it is at an important point!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP folder \u0026gt; Saves \u0026gt; (yoursave) \u0026gt; persistent.sfs (open with notepad) \u0026gt; Ctrl \u002B F \u0026gt; type in funds \u0026gt; edit overall funds, science or whatever \u0026gt; file save \u0026gt; start ksp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBAM now you have money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats all,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS, PM if you have any questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T08:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also a contract pack for BD armory: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129973\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129973\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
