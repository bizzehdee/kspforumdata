I have question about transmitting data from a Sun Probe. I did a few experiments at about 2M km from the Sun, got some great science values, but the transmittable science was 0. I tried to transmit anyway, and after a successful transmission the dialogue said that I had transmitted 0 science. I had plenty of electricity, two of the unfolding dish-style antennae, and even tried transmitting closer to Kerbin. I was naturally bummed, and confused. Any ideas on why this happened? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReid\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T08:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing you have probably already done \u0022high orbit\u0022 solar science.

You have to land the vessel (intact) on Kerbin. Either landed on land or splashed down in the ocean. Then you have the option to \u0022recover vessel\u0022. This is what will recover the science experiments and provide you the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately you could send up a group with a mobile laboratory and then you could get a little bit more science by simply processing in the lab and transmitting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s really easier to put on the correct number of parachutes and land back on Kerbin to recover the vessel and the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The vessel doesn\u0027t technically have to be intact. As long as the module carrying the science survives; even if it breaks off it can be recovered with its science.

Were you able to gather science on Kerbin before you did anything else? I sort of assumed you had been doing science and unlocking parts up to this point. In the science popup window, there are two science bars. They will both show zero for any and all experiments if you are in sandbox mode.
