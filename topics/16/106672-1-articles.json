I searched on forum but could not find any post related. \n\nIs it possible that I am missing some weird detail on the contract? Or is it some sort of bug?\n\nPs: If there is already a post about it, feel free to give me a warning."},{"CreatedByName":"josh__ab","CreatedById":107365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:48:13Z","Content":"Have you accepted the contract from mission control?
