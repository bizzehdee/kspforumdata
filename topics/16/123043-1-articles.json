Not sure if you are doing this already, but when you have built your subassembly attach a part on top of the docking port, then reroot the craft from that part, then grab the docking port below and save that as the subassembly. This should allow the subassembly to attach by the port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I moved this thread over to Gameplay Questions and Tutorials, lots of helpful people here. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T00:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne more tip for connecting parts.
