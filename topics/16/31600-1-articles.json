I am building a space station and have a core in orbit already. I built a fuel depot /habitat and when I detach the large side jumbo tanks and mainsail, I loose all control of the spacecraft. I have a remote command module on top, then two hitchhiker cans and a jumbo tank in the center, below that, I have a decoupled and a half size tank and mainsail. I turn the jumbo tank and one rcs tank off in the center, to save it for the space station. I have two rcs tanks, one for flight, and one for the depot. All that is in the center. On the side I have jumbo tanks and engines, and solid boosters. When I detach the boosters it\u0027s fine, but when I detach the last side mounted tanks and engines the ship no longer responds. The center structure has clamp o trons and struts connecting the habitat and fuel tank. Is this why everything dies? Can I not send controls through the docking ports? Do the side talks transmit the controls, then when they are detached, there is nothing left to transmit through? Thanks,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zelnogrard","CreatedById":69119,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T06:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XtianApi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022XtianApi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... the ship no longer responds. ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you\u0027re running out of electric charge, unmanned control unit need it to respond to controls, otherwise they just freeze.

I indeed did have that problem before, but this time it isn\u0027t that. I checked the charge. I even kept the clams on on the landing pad, fired the engines, disconnected the first two stages within a few seconds and watched them fly off all crazy like, then would immediately lose all control, rcs, everything. I put one tiny strut between everything from the top down, and problem is fixed! I couldn\u0027t believe it. I don\u0027t know if it is one of those clam-o-tron ports that sometimes seats weird, or what. I am also using one of those large to small flat adapters to make the hitchhiker cans look better, maybe that is it. I would have to go remove the struts, and put them back one at a time to figure out what it is, and if it is more than one thing, then forget it. Have you ever heard of that happening? I didn\u0027t know struts could make all connections, like power and such. If I can somehow send you a save file or something, or you could just recreate it yourself. I can try to send a picture I suppose. It is crazy though. Tiny struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XtianApi","CreatedById":69504,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T06:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zelnogrard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zelnogrard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooks like you\u0027re running out of electric charge, unmanned control unit need it to respond to controls, otherwise they just freeze.

I\u0027ll explain the whole thing over when i am sure it didn\u0027t actually post. Anyway, thanks for the reply, I fixed it. It wasn\u0027t the charge, I tested it on the launch pad with the supports connected. Once I disconnected the first two stages, I lose all control. I fixed it by connecting tiny struts between every piece on the center ship to the piece next to it. It is either the clamp-o-tron ports, or the large to small, flat adapters I use to make the habitats look nicer. Any thoughts? I didn\u0027t know struts could transmit everything of a ship. That means you could use only struts to connect parts of a ship, haha. It kind of sucks, I don\u0027t want to worry about that. I thought, if it was connected, then you have all connections. Thanks. Let me know if you want anything additional, like a file, or pics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XtianApi","CreatedById":69504,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T06:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat the heck. my post is not showing. can you see my response?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XtianApi","CreatedById":69504,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T06:57:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh, I gotta wait for a moderator.

I had further weirdness of the same type, with the same ship. So, after I posted that I had \u0022fixed\u0022 the problem, I got it into orbit with only the center section left. I turned on the lights and they started burning up the battery at the bottom of the whole craft. Nothing strange there. Eventually, I did run out of charge in the command module, but I had a small side panel which charged it up once I came around to the sun. I thought it was weird that the battery at the bottom of the craft kept the lights going, even lights on the command module itself, but the command module charge died all the way. Imagine me, again having no control because the command module is dead, but still having the lights blazing. Furthermore, since the solar panel charged it back up, I noticed it also charged the battery up. So, if the battery can be charged by the solar, and the command module can be charged by the same panel, why can\u0027t the battery charge the command module? Weird right. Something is messed up between a connection somewhere, or there is a little glitch, or both. Battery on left of ship, command module on right, panel in the middle, panel can charge both, but they aren\u0027t sharing charge. There isn\u0027t anything in kerbal that moves power directionally right? Oh well, I\u0027m killing the ship and starting over. I\u0027m new to kerbal so just through tonight, i\u0027m already better than I was when I built this problematic ship. The problems are kinda fun, at least for a little while. thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
