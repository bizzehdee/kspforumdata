Hit Ctrl z and it is replaced in its original spot but the group of pieces you set aside is still hanging in the VAB greyed out. Attach that grouping to your ship. Rinse and repeat. With smart use of symmetry you can build large rockets quite quickly (ie 200\u002B struts where you only placed 8 of them yourself and the rest are copies)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know how many people use this but for me it has been a great timesaver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I was building a new pancake 21 main sale booster with 3 tanks on each booster and about 10 struts per booster. Building it 1 piece at a time would take quite awhile and even with with symmetry would be a pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead I put the first tank up and then built a complete booster assembly (including struts) that attached to it. I then detached the whole built booster from the original tank and put it to the side. I then hit Ctrl z and the booster was replaced but I still had the one I moved out of the way. I then attached it. Rinse and repeat with smart use if symmetry and 5 minutes later I had the 3x7 pancake rocket design I wanted. Best of all are rockets are strutted identically so you shouldn\u0027t have random failures from one poor strutting spot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sangi","CreatedById":71603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T16:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use the Alt key instead of hitting Z to undo. Hold down alt and click on the part that you want as the root for the piece that you are copying.

That is just my experience, and may be helpful in diagnosing your failed masterpiece.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kylania","CreatedById":71408,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T19:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow would you do this with multiple parts?

Before doing this you should move the part being copied to the side or somewhere easily accessible, and then watch for weird behavior once you move it because it will become \u0022unattached\u0022. There\u0027s also a mod to do this, I think it\u0027s called subassembly loader, but it\u0027s so easy to just open text files that I don\u0027t bother.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
