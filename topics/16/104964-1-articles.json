It allows you to plan your next route. So you drag the green icon toward the direction your aircraft goes. Eventually, it should have dotted lines with an orbit above 70,000 meters. Now when you get to that point (It should tell you bottom of screen) manuever node in: T- 15, Once when it gets to T- 5, Turn on your engines and set them to prograde with SAS. Go to the orbital map by pressing m, and watch your orbit (Blue solid line) expand out to eventually get into orbit. Now if this is a fuel issue. Use solid fuel boosters to get you out of orbit and you should be good. Hope this helps ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n-----Edit-----\n\nAre you playing career mode? If so, you have to eyeball the burn (Turning on your engines). Turn on your engines at the peak height of your orbit and circularize."},{"CreatedByName":"Helmseye","CreatedById":140608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T21:44:05Z","Content":"thanks guys!!!"}]}
