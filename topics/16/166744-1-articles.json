I\u0027m 150 days into a career, and I often have 5\u002B active flights at the same time, so it\u0027s not that I\u0027m doing anything wrong on my launches. Within the last few days I\u0027ve been trying to launch and if I fail, I\u0027ve been letting Mechjeb\u0027s autopilot do it. (which it doesn\u0027t seem is working properly. It won\u0027t throttle down to avoid going over terminal velocity.) That\u0027s been hit or miss too, but I did have it recover a launch where the rocket did a loop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis morning, I was launching a new station for a mission, and instead of docking in orbit I decided to launch it at 1 shot.To make a long story short,\u00A0 I launched it with 6 boosters in asparagus staging. Everything was fine during the initial stage, but went crazy after dropping the first pair of boosters. It did a loop and then started spinning like clock hands. It reached a peak height of about 26km. It dropped the second pair of boosters at around 12km, and remarkably they didn\u0027t crash into anything. By 8km, between rocket gimbal and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, mechjeb managed to get the rocket stable and pointed in the right direction, and successfully put the station into orbit, with barely enough delta-v to make the Mun transition and then do an insertion burn. (at least, I assume it will be enough. It\u0027s still in transit, but I have 750 m/s left\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat event convinces me that I\u0027m doing something wrong in setting up my asparagus staging.
