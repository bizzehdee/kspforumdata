For example in your pic if the nose turns to the right the top and bottom left thrusters fire. However the bottom thrusters are angled so a torque that isn\u0027t balanced is created because the bottom thruster fires up and to the left. You need either SAS to counter the torque or rotate the ship such that the active thrusters are symmetrical about the plane on which you are maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally this is a small-ish scale of the same problem due to unbalanced rcs placement for translation that plagues ships during docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps any.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"User Unrelated","CreatedById":74021,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit isn\u0027t that big of a deal when they\u0027re all docked together, I realize that if they\u0027re all at different angles like that, then it isn\u0027t going to work well\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut when on the way up, trying to fix orbits, and maneuver that whole tank/booster/satelite combo on the right, it just spins all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an SAS module in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a station today to go drop some landers on the moon, and scan for kethane, and I solved the problem by just using round parts where I want to put the RCS boosters...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1273.photobucket.com/albums/y402/UU92/KSP/d366ba32-f95f-469d-b6a5-ed45967a346f_zpsc34dc02b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d366ba32-f95f-469d-b6a5-ed45967a346f_zpsc34dc02b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is just something I\u0027m going to have to deal with\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah have to agree. that\u0027s not good symmetry, and if the RCS is also unbalanced then you\u0027re doubly hosed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso, first go get RCS balancer so you can get visual feedback on how to balance your RCS in the VAB/SPH.
