Welcome to the KSP forums. You\u0027re not crazy, the aerodynamics and a few parts have changed for the better, which have had the unfortunate side effect of breaking 1.02 and earlier designs.

Does the back of your plane bounce up in the air a bit as it spawns on the runway? That\u0027s usually a sign this is happening. I\u0027m not sure exactly how to fix it, but I found moving the nose gear around a bit seemed to solve the problem for me when I was having it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T22:41:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arkalius**"},{"CreatedByName":"goneblank","CreatedById":146913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:55:39Z","Content":"That actually does seem to help a bit.

You should put wheels closer to CoM. That way you won\u0027t push them into the ground when trying to pitch up. They are just too far back. Just imagine it\u0027s a lever and you\u0027re trying to push the nose up by bringing the tail down.\n\nSecond thing, you should choose a wing type that has pitch controls for you tail. The small fins used in the picture are not steerable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T23:32:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"goneblank","CreatedById":146913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T00:10:17Z","Content":"Once I was able to get off the ground it became clear that control was pretty lacking.

It should be behind the CoM (closer is better), but in front of your control surfaces. In your current design, the ailerons can\u0027t pivot around the rear wheels, instead they\u0027re just pushing the plane down on the runway. Moving the rear wheels forward and the ailerons back on the wing should solve your problems. \n\nAlso it looks like the plane will be pointing nose down when landed (cant really tell from this angle though). This will make taking off more difficult as well, it\u0027s easier with the nose pointing upward. \n\nHave a look at [keptins basic aircraft design tutorial](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52080-Basic-Aircraft-Design-Explained-Simply-With-Pictures) for any other airplane info, hints n tips."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T10:29:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also it looks like the plane will be pointing nose down when landed (cant really tell from this angle though).
