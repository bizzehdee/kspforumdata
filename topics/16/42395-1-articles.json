I left the rocket on the control pad and then proceeded to burn all of the fuel while checking the tanks in the stack. I believe I must have some of the tanks connected incorrectly as they still have fuel in them and when I dumped the fuel from them into the longest lasting rocket then it fired back up. I have to leave for awhile but I\u0027ll retry the design tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T23:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maddog10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maddog10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I activate the 4 rockets the first rocket seems to consume much more fuel than the rest.

Looks to me like you\u0027re probably using two T45 and two T30 engines. Are you turning them on all at the same time? Is the fuel amount the same in all stacks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027d want to do is remove everything below the quad coupler, enable 4-symmetry, then add the same tanks and engines downward. That way all stacks will be identical, which would solve any problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maddog10","CreatedById":78816,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T23:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJohnno,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The engines were the same but I realized where I went wrong. When I started deleting the fuel tanks I could see where some of the fuel tanks were connected to the fuel tank next to it but not to the tank above it. So I trashed the whole thing and started building from the nose cone down. Before I had gone from the bottom up and I think I was experiencing the issue with the Unity engine with the parent child relationships. Before I couldn\u0027t get the 4 way symmetry to work when adding tanks and it worked this time. Thanks for the advice as you were spot on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Maddog10\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
