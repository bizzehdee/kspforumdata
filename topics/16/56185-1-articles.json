So far i managed to connect a main docking port to side docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i cannot connect two MAIN\u0027s (like on the picture).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it somehow related to the dock ports covers? Can those two even be connected?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm doing docking manually. And yes, i do remember about setting the target and controlling from a point. Wierd thing is, when i managed to connect main port from vessel 1 to side port from vessel 5, just before connection i had to open the shield, otherwise it didn\u0027t work :S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/10gjy88.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210gjy88.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"canuckster","CreatedById":95193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T02:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you have RCS thrusters or something inside the docking port, it\u0027s hard to tell, take a better picture in the sunlight so we can have a better look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T04:28:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, but we\u0027ll need a clearer picture of the problem parts.

From my own experence I have one suspicion - when you turned on symmetry you may have accidently ended up with two docking ports overlapping each other on either 2 or 4 of the side mounting points. I\u0027ve encountered that unintentional duplication/clipping before with the hub part. Is there any kind of shimmering on the docking port, particularly when you move the camera? If so there is almost certainly a part clipped inside the docking port that is interfering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chantaz","CreatedById":96756,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T10:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere are two pictures :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/27z9fgw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002227z9fgw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/2eehe1w.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222eehe1w.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two station parts like this, pretty similiar.
