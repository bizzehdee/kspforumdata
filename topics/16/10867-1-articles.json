It has, say, an Ap of 100 km, and a Pe of 80 km.\n\nDepending on whether you want a 100 km orbit or an 80 km orbit, you respectively burn at Apogee facing the direction your orbital path will take you [prograde] [the yellow circle on your Nav-Con], you burn at Perigee facing the way you came from [retrograde] [the yellow circle with an X through it on your Nav-Con.]\n\nThat is as simple as I can put it. In Map Mode [M key to open in-game], you will be shown your orbit, and it will tell you how high Ap and Pe are."},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T01:43:17Z","Content":"Here\\\u0027s a visual representation.\n\n![CxfrC.png](http://i.imgur.com/CxfrC.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Magmaros","CreatedById":24858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:30:35Z","Content":"![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) thanks muchly ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) and if I want to swing it back out into an elliptical later on I just do the reverse?"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:32:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) thanks muchly ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) and if I want to swing it back out into an elliptical later on I just do the reverse?\n\nNow you get it! That\\\u0027s exactly right. Although really, thrusting in either direction will make it eliptical.\n\nAp and Pe are the most efficient points to burn at for changing your orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Magmaros","CreatedById":24858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:45:11Z","Content":"Oh, one other question, I was looking up how to get a geo sync orbit and I saw that there was an ideal orbital height and speed, I get how to set up the height now, but how do I go about changing the speed of my orbit without changing the height of it?"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T02:53:23Z","Content":"The way an orbit works is by moving fast, so as you fall towards a planet, you just miss it. So the faster you are, the more you miss it, and the higher your orbit. \n\nBasically, a certain orbital height, say 100Km, might require you to be going 2400 m/s. A 200Km orbit might require 3600 m/s. The two are proportional. As one rises, the other must too.\n\nMy advice is to ignore the speed, and focus on getting a circular orbit at the altitude required for geosync."},{"CreatedByName":"Magmaros","CreatedById":24858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T03:18:01Z","Content":"Alrighty, so if I can get up to where it should be for Geo Sync and circularize it, it should be at about the right speed for Geo Sync on its own?"},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-19T04:08:21Z","Content":"One thing I\\\u0027m wondering if everyone else experiences (i.e., is it the game or my weaksauce PC) is that the more circular the orbit gets the more the Ap and Pe markers dance about.
