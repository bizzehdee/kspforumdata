I\u0027m a bit confused about how construction works, especially WRT the Part Tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, when you attach a part to a vehicle, you are only attaching to ONE \u0022parent\u0022 part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is: does this apply to the strength of connections, as well as the \u0022logical structure\u0022? i.e. if I make four pillars and then put a roof on top, then for the purposes of physics, there is only one joint at one of the pillars?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only additional strength comes from struts, so from a strength point of view, you might as well have one pillar and struts, rather than four pillars and struts? Is that correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that some tutorials will cover this, but can\u0027t tell without watching hours of youtube!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-01T09:51:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2014 09:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Doozler\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T15:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe parts only connect to one parent part but docking ports can be used to help with this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BLFonsworth","CreatedById":106790,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T18:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilding a rover and then attaching it can be tricky, the base structure you get for the orver only connects to other structural parts on the large flat surfaces and cannot connect to the ends/sides, which limits your potential unless you add extra structural parts..
