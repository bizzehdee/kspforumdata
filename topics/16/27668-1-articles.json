When it was ascending both accelerometers read the same value (1.5g in this case, though it ought to have read 1g, since it was ascending at more or less constant, incredibly slow, velocity.) After killing the engines and allowing the vehicle to fall, the accelerometers dropped to close to zero (free fall) then rose back to 1g after it hit terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to think that this is measuring the CoM\u0027s acceleration only, and that it is not terribly accurate even there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocSnuggles","CreatedById":61258,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T04:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk... the diameter of the construction is about ~250m and one complete rotation takes about 38 seconds. If i do the math right there should be an acceleration of ~3m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = 0,3g at the side points.

The diameter now is about 100m and one rotation takes about 6 seconds.
