This will be the first time I ask a question regarding usage of a specific mod, and regretfully I will be doing this without access to either screenshots or craft files for now. If y\u0027all will bear with me, I can have both available later this evening (probably after 02Z).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve installed KAS, and for my first task I\u0027ve been attempting to build a combination tow cart / refueling tanker for my Auk VIII spaceplane. I do have some screenies of that craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tdc5XaU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tdc5XaU.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AOPbHHL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AOPbHHL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second shot is an updated version of the craft, one where I\u0027d ironed out most of the kinks in its original design (i.e. the first screenie). I have since made one addition to the craft, and its for KAS - I\u0027ve added a radial connector port on the aft RCS tank centerline, below the central engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my tow cart design is based on a Jumbo-64 tank. I\u0027ve added a probe core for primary control and a Mk1 Lander Can for Jeb to climb in and out of (figured out early on that I had to have a Kerbal present in order to actually plug in the cables if I wanted to do actual fuel transfer). It has a series of I-beams on the top with a winch and electromagnet on the end; this is meant to serve for towing. On the underside is another winch; this one is meant to act as the refueling cable. The idea is that after the plane lands from making a delivery, the tow cart puts it back at the beginning of the runway and refuels it to full, then gets out of the way. The plane then takes off for another mission. I realize I could just \u0022recover flight\u0022 and go from there; I\u0027m mainly just doing this for the lulz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m experiencing is that inevitably when I attempt to tow the plane anywhere, the plane inevitably tips up onto its engines and knocks off the rear RCS tank, rear fuel tank and centerline engine. I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s doing this, and I\u0027m concerned it has something to do with how I\u0027m attempting to tow it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my question is - for towing purposes, is it better to push or pull? And how would you go about pushing with KAS? And is there someway to fix the length of the winch cables so they hold tension?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a tool that is better for towing than the electromagnet? For reference, I\u0027m attempting to put it on the orange tank just forward of the rear engine/RCS ballast assembly. The I-beam assembly is long enough that it does have the reach it needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose while I\u0027m at it, is a Kerbal strictly necessary for plugging in cables and \u0022docking\u0022 two craft together?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T15:00:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI guess my question is - for towing purposes, is it better to push or pull?

Instead of using a Kerbal, you can put a grappling hook on the winch, take careful aim, and fire it at the ship to be towed using the \u0022eject\u0022 function. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never had much luck going with cables. Physics gets wonky around them, even if the connected ships AREN\u0027T moving. All kinds of phantom forces build up in the cable. I\u0027ve therefore found it better to do it in a series of drags. That is, connect the cable at 50m, park the towing vehicle, and retract the cable to drag the towed vehicle to the tow truck. Disconnect, drive the tow truck forward 50m, repeat. And all this is more trouble than it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, KAS is good for making fuel connections and adding struts to wobbly assemblies. It\u0027s also good for anchoring things to the ground and hoisting. But not so much for towing 1 thing with another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better option is to make an actual wrecker-type tow truck using Infernal Robotics. Make an arm that can grab the nosewheel strut and lift it slightly off the ground. Allow the wheel strut to rotate within the grabber. Now you can tow the thing quite well. You\u0027d still need KAS to refuel it, though, and it\u0027s advisable to do these operations entirely separately. Also, you might want to use the KAS pipes instead of a winch because physics doesn\u0027t hate rigid pipes as much as flexible cables.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T15:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMod support requests should go over here, for the record: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/13-Add-on-Requests-and-Support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/13-Add-on-Requests-and-Support\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T16:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, last question first.

The cables are nice but i don\u0027t use them in DOCKED mode. they get reeeeaaally wonky and explode stuff lots. For fuel transfer i always use the pipes. you have to have a pipe end point on each craft. use your kerbal right click an endpoint and select link. then right click the other end point and link again. it connects the 2 ships together. if your kerbal is in the way of where the pipe will be once the ends are connected (or any other parts) you will get an explosion. once you are done use your kerbal and right click the endpoint and unlink. bingo!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for towing... like Geschosskopf said... parking your towing vehicle and winching the payload closer is the best way to go. i expect your plane is flipping backwards because you are pulling from the bottom. it gives it a bit of upward force and its probably enough to tip it back on the landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei prefer the electromagnet. i always have problems getting the grapple to detach. then once its detached i can\u0027t get it locked back on the winch to eject it again. just annoying so i never use them. they are very nice for anchoring stuff to the ground though!! also the electromagnet you can set to a action group to have it turn off and release your payload. remember you need power for it... also for the winched to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T14:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPipes seem to have done the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ESNwUVb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ESNwUVb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane had tipped up onto its engines prior to this shot; I was able to use the electromagnet to straighten it out and I left it connected while I hooked up the pipe.

This eliminates the need for the winch cable and its wonky physics, so all you need is a fuel truck, not a tow vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal in taxiing is to have wheels with rover motors in them, which both move and steer.

Thus, you have to mount them so they\u0027re clear of the ground until the plane stops. It\u0027s possible to do this by putting the rover wheels on the sides of the fuselage beside the nosewheel mounted on the bottom, then retract the nosewheel to lower the nose onto the rover wheels. Or you can mount the rover wheels on Infernal Robotics pivots and swing them down.
