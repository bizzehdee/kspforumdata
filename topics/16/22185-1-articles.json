I have high hopes for this one and it\u0027s currently in route, but it has FAR more trouble orienting itself to prograde once the boosters come off at the end of the ascent stage than any of my previous rockets have. I added some RCS in the hopes that it would help, but I think that the ship is simply so massive that even those can\u0027t do much. The first two Tylo ships were almost as heavy, but neither had anywhere near this difficulty orienting itself for the circularizing burn.

I think my biggest problem was that I had plenty of fuel (I think I got there with over 6,000 dV left with Tylo II), but most of it was getting wasted fighting gravity and not enough was actually being used to slow me down. Shrinking the landers and adding thrust to them had a major payoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo I - 326 parts.
