This is a bug they have yet to fix, not sure why. I found that there are several workarounds including Deejay2000\u0027s method. I have discovered with the tank problem if I can get them to attach to any thing at all I can disconnect them and and they will usually bit not always attach correctly after that. I also noticed that the problem gets worse the more parts you have on the ship. To get around this problem is Usually do the tank and engine design work first and then to thrusters and connector parts lights fuel lines and so forth last. since they seem to have less of a problem with the symmetry issue. Also reloading the game seems to help at least for a while. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
