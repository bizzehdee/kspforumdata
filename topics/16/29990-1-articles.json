I always try to use a parachute system where a atmosphere exist. If you got enough parachutes it could work with nuclear engines in landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander(Base) will need struts too i think, for better connection of the side-pods. Always a question of how mutch fuel u use. And if you burn off your fuel at the landing with your lander, it will get leigther very quickly in the descend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Nuclear engine can handle the job, but as more mass your ship has, the longer the acceleration process will take. If you get a good window, you can use the gravity of Duna to break you a bit down in a long travel trajectory. The shorter your traveltime, the higher will be the end speed at duna approach and you will need more fuel for a break manouver. You could also use the airbreak technic at duna, but i didnt use it myself. Dont wanna use it until real heatdamage is in. Atm it feels more like cheating for myself when i use that way to get my main-ship slower at the approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because you dont wanna go back, you will actually only need the fuel of the nuclearstage for acceleration and deceleration. Hardest part will be breaking out of kerbal orbit, but it can be easy done when you use a support-rocket, like the leftovers from your launch-stage when you get into the orbit of kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, 1 can work, but you will need some descent skills in planning your route to duna. So actually if you use parachutes as support for landing, you can even use some of the fuel from your lander for the final deceleration. You will deffinitly need more then 1 parachute, thats for sure with that mass. But if you can reduce your mass by use up mostly all of the lander fuel before the parachutes get active, it would be a quit easy landing with parachute support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uberick","CreatedById":65954,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T13:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat lander(photo), should have about 2600 dv as it sits. If you swap those poodles with nukes, you\u0027ll get more like 5500 dv. If you swap out the three poodles with one poodle, you\u0027ll get almost 3000 dv. In this case, you only want to bring engines that will make your thrust to weight ratio on Duna more than 1; which for this ship means bringing one poodle or about three nukes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a proper Duna window, I want to say that the transfer costs a little over 1000 dv. Aerobraking will make capture at Duna free, so all you really need out of this lander(base) is enough dv to do a transfer and landing. Even 2600 dv should do this just fine. You will arrive at duna with over 1000 dv to spend on your powered landing. If your bring enough chutes, you can reduce the requirements for a powered landing to just a short burst in the last 100 meters or so to drop your descent speed below 10m/s. Don\u0027t forget to include drogue chutes, since the atmosphere on Duna is thinner, parachutes work at about 1/5 effectiveness!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, effectively, if you can get that lander in LKO, it should be able to take it from there. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T13:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with Uberick. Getting to the surface of Duna is very easy, especially if you\u0027re good about making use of aerobraking. Even without parachutes you should be able to use that base to get from LKO to Duna\u0027s surface in one piece. The easiest landing site is one of the dark brown maria near the equator. They have a low altitude (and higher atmospheric pressure/drag as a result) and are flat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally aerobrake twice, once just to get captured by the planet and then a second (and sometimes third) time to actually land. On Duna this is especially useful since the atmosphere is thin enough that it\u0027s easy to go far faster than terminal velocity for long distances. Two aerobrakes also allow you to adjust your inclination and more easily pick a landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T15:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheThing345\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheThing345\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, what engines on what stage to use?\u003Cp\u003EMy initial plan was to create an orbit and land with the 3 engines attached to the bottom of this, but I dont think 3 poodles are going to be enough... or?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna has a gravity of 2.94m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.
