At what point of reference would the skycrane/rover assembly measure the altitude AFTER the crane lowers the rover. Would your true altitude read from the skycrane or the rover? This is critical to know because the release of the crane could pose a problem. If the altitude is read from the point of crane then the crane could propel way to close to the surface when its suppose to have rope slack. Thus crushing the rover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you who have used mechjeb to do skycrane delivery , what method did you use to safely drop and ditch ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T00:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do it manually.
