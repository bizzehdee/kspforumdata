If you want to land, you will have to cancel out about that much speed, there\u0027s no way around this, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not tried it, but if you have the delta-v, I would try to raise your AP to Gilly\u0027s orbit, with the ascending/descending node at the apoapsis. There, your horizontal velocity will be small and you will pretty much only have to add Gilly\u0027s orbital speed by burning retrograde. (And cancel out the normal/antinormal speed component for the 9,5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 tilt.)
