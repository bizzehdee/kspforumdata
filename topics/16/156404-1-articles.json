But when I land the lander on the surface and then meet up with the command module again in orbit the second time, will that satisfy the contract? I\u0027d like to not have to build additional rockets just for the purpose of the docking and see if I can knock it out instead during another\u00A0contract mission.

I thought that the contract was suggesting an Apollo-like mission, with a Lunar Module and a Lunar Lander launched as a single expedition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for clarifying. I guess that I\u0027ll leave the Lander in orbit around the Mun then, and I\u0027ll pass by to pick it up later with a second mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
