After building a base on the Mun, I decided to go further to Minmus, and had wanted to set up a station there first. However, it\u0027s pretttyyy darn hard to get on similar orbits after every launch from Kerbin. I set my station up on a ~ 90 heading on Minmus (OCD strikes), but no matter how I try, I can\u0027t get another orbit similiar to it. Am I doing something wrong? Just to clarify, you go to Minmus like you would for the Mun, but only that you\u0027d change your inclination at Kerbin Pe right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sadron","CreatedById":61671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T06:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a lot more than 46km \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T07:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eegnio98, were you aware that Minmus is on an inclined orbit? Rotate the map view camera down until you are looking at the plane of Mun\u0027s orbit, then zoom out. You\u0027ll see that Minmus bobs north on one side of its orbit and south on the other side. That means that ships launched toward it from the equator will sometimes seem to arrive below or above Minmus. That\u0027s easy enough to fix, though. Halfway to the moon, check and see if you\u0027re going to miss above or below the path of Minmus\u0027 orbit. If you are going to pass below, point the nose of your ship due north (where the gold line meets the horizon on the navball), and burn until you are arriving at Minmus closer to its equator. If passing above, burn toward the south. You\u0027ll still need to do another plane correction burn when you get there (most efficiently, while passing over the equator), but this should get you pretty close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dictator Dan","CreatedById":62863,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T07:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry changing your inclination at your ascending/descending nodes.
