That holds. By 25,000 meters or so, the ship (typically, an Mk1 command pod with something like a cabin attached beneath) will tip over prograde and, if I didn\u0027t manage to bleed enough speed, the command pod will overheat and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like another emergency patch like 1.0.2 will be coming to balance these stuff...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T03:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll assume you\u0027re coming in extra shallow. A big thing with space planes now is you have to ride outer atmosphere with your nose as high as possible, 30-45 degrees on if you can hold it. You can also add one of the small radiator panels to bleed some heat away from problem areas. I was having a devil of a time and now I seem to make it without even seeing heat bars.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool! I don\u0027t know why it works, but it does. I had it in my mind that with an angle of attack that high, I would surely loose control and end up in a death spiral. But, like you said, I barely even got a heat bar, and with no radiators. And no death spiral, in fact, it was quite easy. Now, onto the next adventure. Man, thanks alot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
