The tutorial is a couple of versions old at this point, but if you slip a Z-4K battery (the big one) between the lander can and the RCS fuel tank, you should be capable of performing the mission in the current version without issue. Bear in mind that the tutorial teaches you to perform both the rendezvous and the docking on RCS thrust alone - a good way to learn the lesson of going slow, no doubt. When you get better at docking, though, you\u0027ll probably want to use regular bi-propellant thrust to conduct the rendezvous part (i.e. you\u0027ll still want RCS for the actual docking, but getting to that point goes a lot faster on regular thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T13:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELook up Scott Manley\u0027s videos on youtube, lots of really good ones.

Mainly because you usually have various options for how and where to make your RV, and it can be hard to know which is best.
