When building long ships in orbit as soon as I attach the front finished module to the build the entire thing start to wobble and jerk catastrophically until the ship breaks apart. Even with everything turned off (SAS, torque, etc.) it still does it. Suggestions? Seems odd that this happens because when I build large spacestations, the station does not exhibit this issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i59.tinypic.com/o5rzwj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022o5rzwj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-27T22:54:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2014 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-26T04:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t seen this specific issue, but KSP is known to be pretty buggy with large ships.
