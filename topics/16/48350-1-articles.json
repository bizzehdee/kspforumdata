I know I\u0027m not all that great of a pilot, so as a rule I add a 25% reserve to those figures. I then work backwards; say I\u0027m going to do a manned round-trip back to Kerbin mission. I know I\u0027m going to need a command capsule, a chute or two and some batts; that\u0027s the stuff I\u0027ll need to get my guys back. A service module comes next; this has the delta-V to get back from where I\u0027m going. I may or may not combine this stage with the lander; having done things the Apollo way for a while, I can say that a dedicated lander module allows you to land heavier payloads as a rule. Lander has enough delta-V to land and launch on its own, with no other payload. A transfer stage comes next; this has the delta-V to get the CM, SM and lander to the target and get it in orbit. The booster comes last and as a rule it\u0027s the largest piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECM - chutes, capsules, batts. Docking ports if necessary,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESM - RCS, return fuel and engine, solar panels. Nukes are recommended though I have also used Poodles with success on interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander - engine depends on the target and the mass of the lander. Usually an LV-909, though I have used large numbers of 24-77s to good effect (6 of those weigh as much as a -909 and have 2.5 times as much thrust). Poodles and even nukes on occasion. On low gravity worlds like Pol or Gilly, RCS is sufficient for landing; no, seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXfer Stage - Same as the SM: nukes are best for interplanetary trips but I\u0027ve used Poodles and even LV-909s successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBooster - Depends on how you set things up. Mainsails/Skippers usually, but I\u0027ve had luck with all engine types except the LV-1s and Ion engines (nukes even work if you pack enough of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, a mission is more dependent on its delta-V budget than available thrust in most cases. Figure out the mass of your payload, add any staging equipment and engines you have selected for a stage, then work Tsiolkovsky backwards (adding your payload mass to both mass portions of the equation - i.e. (M \u002B Payload / Md \u002B Payload) - and bearing in mind that for most fuel tanks their full mass is nine times that of their dry mass - i.e. M = 9 md - so you can substitute in that relationship). When you know how much fuel you need, add tanks that match that amount, then work the equation forward to see how well you did. If its unacceptable, try again. If it is acceptable, set the resultant total mass as the payload mass for the next stage and start the process over with that next stage, and keep working until everything\u0027s done. You can check TWR if you\u0027d like at any time, though it\u0027s generally necessary only for launch and landing phases. Add more engines if what you have isn\u0027t sufficient and recalculate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
