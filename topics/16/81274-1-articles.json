Or are the engines really effecient rockets that only burn in the atmosphere, and have no flames? If not, then I hope it gets changed. Maybe replace it with a subtle blue glow that goes out a foot or so, like real jets. Contrails would be nice to have appear maybe 20 meters back from the plane at altitudes above 10km, so I can buzz the tower without smoke obscuring my rear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T00:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou see contrary to popular belief jet engines dont run on liquid fuel, they are kerbal powered. Thats right there are kerbals inside little hamster wheel like devices turning the roters in the jets. The smoke you see is a result of the rubber on their shoes catching on fire from the friction. The kerbals need intake air to breath so when you get high enough they start passing out and you loose thrust, this also explains why jets dont work on duna or eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not actualy determined why the liquid fuel is there or where it goes as you fly but considering all the other crazy things kerbal engineers do I wouldnt rule out \u0022it looks cool\u0022 \u0022We had this part laying around\u0022 or \u0022Wouldnt it be funny if we spritzed this in their faces randomly?\u0022 as valid reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T00:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe temperature system has not been implemented so it is not accurate in any way. I think the devs had the exhaust cloud disappear at 20 km because the air is thinner, and only for that reason.
