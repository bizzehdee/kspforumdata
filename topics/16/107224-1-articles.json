Deviating too much from prograde will cause you rocket to flip due to aerodynamic forces.\n\nIf you have them, put fins on the bottom/back of the rockets (think \u0022arrow\u0022). This will allow you to deviate further from prograde vector for more aggressive turning.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOr just watch this video: \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_q_8TO4Ag0E?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaffa Cookie","CreatedById":139554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T18:47:19Z","Content":"Ah!

But here is the gist:\n\nDrag pushes on the nose more than the tail, because the Center of Mass is closer to the tail. If you deviate too much from the flight path, there is too much torque on your nose for your SAS to overcome and you flip.\n\nAlso, here\u0027s a video to help get you to orbit more easily:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pA1y5a5rnk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
