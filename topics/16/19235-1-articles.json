So I\u0027ve been enjoying the game a lot in the past few months. Sadly, I run at a slow pace, and only now am begginning to be able to land on the mun and come back. Sadly, I\u0027ve ran into a small problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to make a permanent munar base. One would think that is easier than going there and coming back, except I have the mod Zoxygene. I can get to the mun and come back, but the problem is, when I try to lower the drills, most of the times they break for some reason. Help with this would be appreciated :\\\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
