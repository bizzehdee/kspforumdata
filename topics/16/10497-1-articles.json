Here you will need to practice and familiarize yourself with orbital mechanics, namely learning to only thrust at AP and EP to save delta-V. This mission is nearly identical to the mission of Apollo 7. Once you can reliably put small spacecrafts into orbit and deorbit them safely, move onto stage 2.\n\nThis is the craft I used for stage 1:\n\n\u003E ![2f057qd.jpg](http://i47.tinypic.com/2f057qd.jpg)\n\n**Stage 2: Trans-Munar Injection and Trans-Kerbin injection**\n\nIn this stage you will apply knowledge learned from stage 1 to use to travel to the Mun without actually landing on the Munar surface. This means a mission of this type will involve first entering LKO. Then performing a TMI burn to place your PE about 60 degrees in front of Mun\\\u0027s orbit. Once there perform a retroburn to enter a Munar orbit. Then once ready fire your rocket again for TKI injection burn to return back to Kerbin. On arrival perform another retroburn to get into LKO before picking a spot for deorbiting. Don\\\u0027t be scared by the vast distances your ship will have to travel - the actual delta-V for for TMI and TKI are quite small when done right, gravity will do most of the work for you. This is the same mission profile as Apollo 8\n\nThis is the craft I used for stage 2:\n\n\u003E ![2j0kvfq.jpg](http://i45.tinypic.com/2j0kvfq.jpg)\n\n**Stage 3: Building heavy boosters**\n\nSince an Apollo style Munar orbit rendezvous is not possible (yet), the only way to land on the Mun and get back is to use a Direct Ascent mission profile which requires you to lift quite a large spaceship to LKO. Building reliable heavy boosters is not easy, both in real life and in KSP because the size of your rocket does not increase linearly with the payload. I find the best way to practice building big rockets is to aim to lift a big space station into LKO. Build the space station to a size bit bigger than the munshot spacecraft so when the time comes you can just scale down the heavy booster a little bit for the munshot. This is similar to the Skylab 1 mission.\n\nThis is the craft I used for stage 3, those things at the front are spacecraft docking arms:\n\n\u003E ![rho02c.jpg](http://i45.tinypic.com/rho02c.jpg)\n\n**Stage 4: Munshot**\n\nYou now have all the skills you need to go to the Mun and back except for one - powered descent. Unfortunately there\\\u0027s no way to build a LLTV equivalent (or is there?) to practice on Kerbin so the only way to learn is to actually do it. Once your lander is in position for powered descent do a quick save with F5 and backup your .\\saves\\default folder. Then keep at it using F9 for quickload if you crash until you land safely on the Mun.\n\nRemember, once you\\\u0027re on the Munar surface you need very little delta-V to take off and get back to Kerbin. So while giving yourself some margin of safety aim to build the smallest lander possible. This mission is the Apollo 11 equivalent.\n\nHere is my Munshot rocket:\n\n\u003E ![4lsv81.jpg](http://i50.tinypic.com/4lsv81.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackShadow03","CreatedById":19991,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T05:56:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That thing is way bigger than it needs to be.

If you can get something to land on the Mun, then you\\\u0027re practically golden.
