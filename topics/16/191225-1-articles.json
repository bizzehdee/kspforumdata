Some of the same radial decouplers\u00A0were listed in two different groups. This was especially misleading with engines since adjusting parameters were only applying, to say, half the engines (you should have seen that liftoff). Sometimes the symmetry also seemed to fixate around a single part when I didn\u0027t want it to (really want around the whole vessel), and pulling off and reattaching whole sections of the vessel was the only way to reset the behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EGiven all of this, it feels like a design like this is outside the normal parameters of what the game is expecting, or I\u0027m using the tools incorrectly (hence my original questions).\u003C/u\u003E I never would have thought to try a design like this, especially considering it\u0027s essentially squishing multiple parts into the same physical space. Feels a bit gamey and hacky, but then I noticed the first Mun landing\u00A0tutorial has radially mounted fuel tanks that provide two terrier engines.
