Everyone says they do, (even in-game) but I saw one snippet in the wiki that said as of 1.1 they do not provide a bonus to science gained from using recovering a vessel with data on it. (like a science jr with high orbit science data on it) I tried searching for answers in Google within the last month and week, but I wasn\u0027t getting a straight answer. I\u0027m going to finally head to the Mun for the first time, and need to know whether I should bring a scientist or not. Don\u0027t want to waste a whole bunch of science! It\u0027s already hard enough to get science as it is... Can\u0027t even get a rover or lander for the Mun landing without like 500 science! I\u0027ve only gotten like 100 total so far after like 30 hours and two restarts on my career!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-05T00:34:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2016 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Omnifarious\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-05T07:34:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m almost certain they don\u0027t - the scientist career description\u0027s been problematic for a while now.

Changing the biome or location makes it a different experiment, so you can collect goo in both high and low orbits, for example. You can get different EVA reports for different biomes in low orbit, but just a single non-biome-specific report in high orbit. Also, you can store multiple crew reports by going\u00A0EVA, right-click the pod and \u0027take experiments,\u0027 then store them back in the pod. You can then collect a new crew report. Of course, if you have an antenna and power you can just transmit crew and EVA reports for 100% science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-06T15:46:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2016 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by StrandedonEarth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
