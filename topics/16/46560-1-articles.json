You have to calculate with that. One thing is for sure, you will need a lot of SAS. The sas modules should be close to eachother, and to the command module. But i guess most of them should be on the orange tank, as you will want to get rid of those later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can assign keys to your the thrusers too, and at a later stage, you can turn on some of the spaceship\u0027s thrusters, as the center of mass goes towards it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the atmosphere, wings can help too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
