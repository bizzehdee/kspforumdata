Might just have been bad luck on my part so far, then, as I could swear I\u0027ve put a satellite into orbit (uncertain on an actual kerbal). I\u0027ll have to forge ahead and see what turns up. Thanks for the tip.\n\nDo you happen to know where in the game files I might be able to find confirmation of that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:52:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you happen to know where in the game files I might be able to find confirmation of that?\n\nI don\u0027t. I just know that I\u0027ve got rescue contracts after my second launch, and that completing either the sub-orbital or orbital starting contract seems to be what unlocks the non-starter contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:18:16Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know about the other game modes, but in career I think it\u0027s the first upgrade to the R\u0026D that allows EVA.
