I\u0027m not sure if I put it there in the orbit it should be for another contract or if I was going to fulfill this one contract but went to bed and left the last part of the mission for the next day...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo..., since all my sats are named \u0022sat4\u0022... (yeah I know, I should use better names, but), is there a way to know if the craft belongs to a contract already done? Date of launch is of no use, fuel seems to be a little low for the stage of the mission, but then again I kind of remember botching the orbit and having to burn a lot to change direction... or maybe not, I have been sending a lot of sats lately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T20:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always name my craft with the name of the test or requirement.
