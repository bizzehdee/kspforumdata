Bully for them! Now it\u0027s time for Bob to plant a flag and go home! The problem I\u0027m having is, the nifty little Gilly lander I designed and sort of tested in LKO thinks it\u0027s a rover: the controls are rotated 90 degrees. So I can fly visually-- point the butt of the lander at Gilly and burn; but as far as actual navigation (i.e. getting back to the old Ignorance I) I\u0027m a little flummoxed. Seems like I should be able to add (or subtract) 90 degrees from the navball, but I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out which 90. Can any of youze rocket scientists help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/VXpsHCn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VXpsHCn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VXpsHCn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T10:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, Gilly has a ridiculously low gravity, so you can go straight down instead of a more angled landing without using too much fuel. You can use this fact to your advantage: Since your craft thinks it is a rover, pointing the nav ball exactly at the horizon will position it so that the top is at the top and the bottom is at the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words: The 90 degrees you need to rotate lands you exactly on the horizon on the nav ball.
