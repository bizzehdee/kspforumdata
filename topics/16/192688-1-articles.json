I had the idea to add rotors so that i can turn the wheels out 90 degrees, so that I can dock rovers on all four sides of one rover and switch the direction I am driving by 90 degrees at the push of an action group. The idea being that I can build a modular mobile base. The action groups and rotors all work fine individually, but for some reason only one set of rotors will work if two or more rovers are docked together, period. The KAL editor will only appear as it should for one of them as well, like it erases the other ones when docked. Whats up with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: I have noticed I cant control the KAL on the primary rover at all after I have left it and grabbed another rover from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
