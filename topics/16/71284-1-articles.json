Once you\u0027re out of the atmosphere, how do you arrange to have enough LOX for the remaining fuel for rocket engines (or SABRE in rocket mode?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought at this point is that I should be using the \u0027fuselage\u0027 fuel tanks (or dumping LOX on the pad or whatever) such that I can carry -just- fuel for that, and have regular tanks disabled so that I have a balanced stock once out of the air, and getting as much speed in-atmosphere from those fuel-only tanks as possible before nudging out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresuming there was some of that fuel left - what would you do with it?

I simply run a battery of tests which may be boring to most but, I find quite fun. So, I use !science! to figure out how much or each fuel to take up. Having said that, my space planes are multi-role and I achieve this by designing around an engine core and adding range extension drop-tanks as needed on the mission. I test a number of drop-tank setups to get the balance right. If, on a mission, I have way too much jet fuel at the apogee of my suborbital then I\u0027ll do a transfer into a drop-tank and discard it prior to my orbital insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T06:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI test-fly -\u0026gt; I tweak -\u0026gt; I test-fly -\u0026gt; I tweak.

If its CoM shifts to far back and ends up behind the CoL, it will be unable to be controlled once it hits atmosphere. To far forward and it will become to nose heavy to do anything but lawn dart. This is expecially true in this case of my SVO-19 and all of my SVO line of craft, because they are also VTOLs and their CoM can\u0027t shift to far off of the verticle CoT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/v6Zgg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
