So how am I supposed to unpack this stuff?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo I really have to make sure I have ladders all the way from the ground to the cargo space so I can climb back and forth a lot to haul things down one at a time, and I can\u0027t use the jetpack to go back and forth?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, I have to say that\u0027s an arbitrary, meaningless, and frustrating difficulty element that adds no fun at all to the game... just sayin\u0027....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jodo42","CreatedById":68895,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-18T02:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just had a similar experience to you. I\u0027ll give you a stopgap solution that may or may not work, and my long term plan to not run into this issue again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs your cargo unit within reach of the ladder on the capsule? If so, here\u0027s how I did it (a very Kerbal solution)- EVA and while still on the ladder swap your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E pack and the deployable science. Then let go, fall to the surface in ragdoll mode, and deploy the module. Minmus\u0027 gravity is low enough that you won\u0027t injure yourself. Then, I lined my Kerbal up very carefully and jumped. As I flew up past the capsule I pressed F to get on the ladder. Rinse and repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will work on very low gravity worlds, but nowhere else, and your lander design might be such that you can\u0027t get close enough to your capsule to grab the ladder during the jump. You could try the same strategy but jumping directly to the cargo bay instead of the capsule ladder too, but you\u0027ll have to be quick about transferring cargo between inventories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the future, I\u0027m going to place my cargo bays low on the lander, down near the legs. This not only makes sense relative to a real-world design, since you wouldn\u0027t want to be carrying cargo down with you, it also lowers your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E a bit\u00A0some so you\u0027re less likely to tip. If you absolutely can\u0027t put the cargo bays low down on the lander, then yeah, I guess you\u0027d have to use ladders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-18T03:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0A few people complained about this when 1.11 first dropped, and I think there was a bug report opened, but several others chimed in with basically \u0022suck it up \u0026amp; deal with it\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 I did a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patch to change volume of the EVA pack, but I haven\u0027t tested it because my current career hasn\u0027t advanced far enough to have EVA packs yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBug report:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/27096\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/27096\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-18T03:25:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2021 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Cavscout74\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-18T10:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not an answer to the problem, but I just put cargo containers as low as possible.
