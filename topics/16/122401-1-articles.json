Either try tweaking all the fuel out to see where the dry CoM is or install something like RCS build aid which can show you both dry and wet CoM markers without needing to mess with the tanks. Also, at present, you may need to account for the fact that the drain is split equally between the tanks rather than taking a larger proportion from larger tanks.

A slight imbalance can probably be handled by SAS etc but as the fuel drains and the CoM shifts this might change. Also, as you get higher the lift generated will decrease and the lift is actually helping to keep the nose down (the lift force is trying to rotate the plane around the CoM).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T22:18:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T22:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPitch the plane in the hangar \u0026amp; check whether the CoM/CoL relationship changes, you may find CoL shifts towards CoM as you pitch.
