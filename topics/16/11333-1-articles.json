Though it was probably done very inefficiently so I have a few questions about mun travelling.\n\n1. Taking off from the mun decoupling the lower landing part (Apollo esque) and leaving the landing platform behind. When I do this my engine sometimes gets injured since it falls trough the decoupler and stops for abit and then I turn on the engine since I had to turn off the engine for my landing stage if you get what I mean? Like I have third stage landing engines and the stage after that decoupler and my take off engine. Is there a way for me to go from 0 engine power to 100 instantly?\n\n2. Getting off the mun smoothly? I just get an orbit and then do aposis or whatever to make my orbit towards Kerbin until I\\\u0027m in Kerbin orbit, its kinda inefficent. Anyone know a better way?\n\n3. Landing. Am I supposed to get a low orbit, even out my horizontal speed at like 1000m and then descent vertically all the way or what\\\u0027s the best way?"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:24:48Z","Content":"\u003E 2. Getting off the mun smoothly? I just get an orbit and then do aposis or whatever to make my orbit towards Kerbin until I\\\u0027m in Kerbin orbit, its kinda inefficent. Anyone know a better way?\n\nThe standard way seems to be to burn when your orbit crosses Mun orbit ahead of the direction of motion of the Mun, so that the ellipse extends toward the opposite of the direction of motion of the Mun. The length of the ellipse should be approximately 10 times the diameter of the Mun (guestimated from memory, your milage may vary). As you follow that orbit Apo will automagically move toward Kerbin so that you\\\u0027ll get inside its SOI.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Landing. Am I supposed to get a low orbit, even out my horizontal speed at like 1000m and then descent vertically all the way or what\\\u0027s the best way?\n\nI find it\\\u0027s easiest/safest to do a close-to-vertical descent from at least several 10\\\u0027s of km altitude. Most fuel efficient is to burn as late as possible, in practice you\\\u0027ll have to compromise unless you rely on a landing auto pilot.\n\nDownside of a low orbit (\u003C~10k) is that it\\\u0027s harder to aim the point of touchdown. \n\nDownside of landing from a very high orbit is that the surface of the Mun will turn below you by a significant amount during your descent.\n\nSorry, I can\\\u0027t help you with the decoupler problem at takeoff from the Mun."},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:39:26Z","Content":"Best method of landing is to put your periapsis very low (1-2km) and start your landing burn just before then (altitude varies according to how much acceleration you can put out). For the craft I fly, I start my landing burn at 5-7km.\n\nBest method of returning from the Mun is to do your TKI burn shortly after passing its prograde side. The trajectory you will have after the burn will not be an ellipse, it will be hyperbolic. The new patched conics system allows you to easily do this burn."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:40:17Z","Content":"1. Another approach is to use a crasher stage like in the Soviet space program. One stage was used for the lunar orbit insertion and the deorbit and braking burn. Then the Lander dropped it near the surface and used the same engine for the final decent and the ascent. This is more efficient, but it has a few disadvantage, especially if you are landing at a lunar base, because dropping a bomb on your buddies each time you land is considered bad etiquette.\n\n2. I take off by burning west (270 degrees) and firing my return burn when I arrive above the Mun\\\u0027s orbit vector point. This takes advantage of the Mun \\\u0027s orbital speed.\n\n3. The most efficient descent is to go down on a shallow slope and to brake at the last second. That is, however, extremely tricky and dangerous unless you go into some complex calculations about thrust, altitude, speed and time. It\\\u0027s easier to cut most of your speed higher up and to come down at a controlled descent rate."},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T19:44:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 3.
