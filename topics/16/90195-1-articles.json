This adds mass, cost and lag-inducing part-count and it is important to know that in stock KSP there is no aerodynamic benefit to putting things inside fairings. If you are using an aerodynamic mod (eg; FAR, NEAR) there is a benefit but it is probably outweighed by the mass of all those panels. Summary: if you want fairings, get a mod that provides them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T02:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo expand a little on what Pecan has said: You may want to take a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOpen-Source Construction Techniques for Craft Aesthetics\u003C/a\u003E thread and do a Control-F search for \u0022fairing.\u0022 I\u0027m convinced that some of those guys over in the Spacecraft Exchange are actually wizards, what with all the clever tricks they find for things like this in the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
