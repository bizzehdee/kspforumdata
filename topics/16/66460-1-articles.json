This way you can get Moho orbit insertion with under 2 km/s of delta v. However for this to work for flight from Kerbin you either need to have periapsis of Kerbin-Eve trajectory halfway between Eve and Moho (and you\u0027ll need some angle anyway if you want to get your Moho tranfer in 1 slingshot) or burn additionally during the Eve slingshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve once used double Eve slingshot to get to Moho from Dres (that was in a\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRw1ZojMhzo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, and I barely had idea if it will work with what fuel was there).
