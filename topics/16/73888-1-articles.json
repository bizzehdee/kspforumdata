What you can do to alleviate this is to build a larger rocket (to more closely match the width of the fairing) add fins on the bottom of your rocket, or lots and lots of reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordQ","CreatedById":102672,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T03:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem isn\u0027t that it\u0027s too top heavy, the problem is it\u0027s too bottom heavy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E In the VAB, check whether the Centre of Lift is behind the Centre of Mass.

Lack of rigidity will make things harder to control. You could resolve this by switching the upper stage to use Kerbodyne tanks. Even though they\u0027re less efficient in terms of tankage they may help make your rocket more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, I suspect drag is the issue. The rocket will want to fly draggy end backwards, so try adding some fins at the bottom to compensate for the fairing up top.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T17:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned above, Fins will help by increasing the drag at the aft of your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen are you starting your gravity turn? I\u0027ve had trouble like you\u0027re describing in the past, too, and found it mitigated when I started my gravity turn later and added tail fins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it looks like you have 4 x 2.5 m grey tanks in the central spar of the rocket. Why not use two orange tanks?

Big ones, by the looks of it. Slimming the fairing will also help, if you can. Reaction wheels may also help to fight the flip, but it needs fins to naturally fly straight, just like an arrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll assume the rocket is bending because it is flipping\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T21:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was just looking at your image and realized that your smoke trails beneath the engines are almost perfectly vertical, while the rocket is about at a 45 degree angle. If you\u0027re cranking the heading over that far that suddenly, the change in your angle of attack is going to be very high and that will cause aerodynamic instability. With big rockets in FAR, sometimes it\u0027s better to start your gravity turn early, and do it very very gradually to avoid large AoA in the atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may not be an \u0022optimal\u0022 launch trajectory because you spend a slightly longer time in thicker lower atmosphere, but IMO it\u0027s worth it not to lose control of your rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
