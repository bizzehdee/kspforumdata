The problem that i am experiencing now is that my engines stop functioning midburn - and by that i mean all engines, both 2nd and 3rd stage, and they wont start up again.\n\nSome background, i took 2 tourist missions that are exactly the same - orbit Kerbin, orbit Mun and orbit Minmus -, reason is, i had missions to fly by, orbit and collect data from both Mun and Minmus and told myself that i could take the tourists along and make more money out of the trip. So, i made improvements on a craft that previously used to orbit the Moon. First stage had 4 Skippers, 2nd stage with 3 Reliants and the 3rd stage with 1 Reliant - combined Dv is around 5k (which is actually more than enough).\n\nNow, here is where it gets weird (for me anyway), i completed the first tourist mission using the craft that i designed **without** any issues, all stages worked fine and was able to land safely on Kerbin again. Saved the game and proceeded to run the second tourist mission. Everything starts as per normal, i proceeded with my usual ascent profile (which i have to improve), completed an orbit around Kerbin and created a maneuver node for a Mun transfer. As i am burning my node for the Mun transfer (40 seconds\u002B), midway my engines would stop working. It can\u0027t be a fuel issue because everything says i have fuel, i am puzzled, thinking that it might be some glitch or the game might be acting up i exited to my desktop and restarted the game. But lo and behold, same thing happens on my second and third retry. As checked what went wrong i noticed that all Electric Charges on all engines are **ZERO**, that goes for 3 Reliants on my second stage and 1 Reliant on the first stage. I tried ditching the second stage thinking it would solve it but no, same, engines wont start.\n\nAs i try my fourth run on the mission, i noticed that my Electric Charge gets sapped slowly when my engines are **IDLE**, which i find weird because the only part on the ship that requires electricity is the Communotron16 and i haven\u0027t even activated that yet. Turning OFF/ON SAS and RCS doesnt help either. \n\nIm not sure, it has never happened before and dont know why its happening now, all along i thought Reliants didn\u0027t use Electric Charge. I haven\u0027t tried again after the 4th run, maybe i should rebuild the ship? Remove the Communotron16?\n\nAny ideas? Advise? Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T02:15:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by m1dane24**"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T06:13:13Z","Content":"Are you out of electrical power?

Right clicking on the engine doesnt show much other that \u0022Nominal\u0022 and a zero Electric Charge, for what its worth, all parts/module show ZERO Electric Charge when this happens. No Ion engines though, haven\u0027t reached that far in the tech tree yet ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAs for the alternators, yes, you are correct, they do generate EC when powered up and running and i did see them generating EC during these periods BUT as i stop my engines EC gets drained... slowly. I can see it go down from 41... 40... 39... 38... all the way to zero. And of course, i have to power them down when i create nodes and or drift/warp along my orbit. Do take note that i am basing all of these in Kerbin time and not real world time, because in KSP warping seems to make getting from point A to point B faster but essentially the same amount of time has passed, only faster - with this in mind you spend more Kerbin time idle than burning, which, as i stated before - my EC drains when engines are idle. And this i noticed in my fourth attempt because i let my craft drift along its orbit until all EC is drained then try to power up which i couldnt because there is zero EC.\n\nWith regards to mods, i have - KAS, KIS, KER, ScanSat, a few parts pack, asteroid day, alarm clock, near future (4x), station science, chatterer - not that much and no MechJeb and no RemoteTech.\n\nOnce i get home and start KSP ill post a pic of the ship with the necessary info so you guys can have a look at it and help me find out whats wrong ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAlthough, i am starting to think that it could be a bug/kraken and might just rebuild and/or redesign the ship.\n\nThanks!\n\nPS - does staging/decoupling need EC? Never really noticed that and well, last night when i was drained of EC i can still release my stages without issue"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T09:14:00Z","Content":"I\u0027m super confused how you can run out of Ec mid-burn with a Reliant engine, which has a 7 Ec/s production built-in. That is a LOT of Ec/s for stock KSP, the only thing that uses that much is an ion drive or perhaps an ISRU converter. Neither of which I suspect is on your tourist ship. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Running out of Ec while the engines are off, sure, there\u0027s ways to do that. Mid-burn? I\u0027d call it impossible.\n\nI\u0027ll echo the questions of others here and ask if you have any mods installed.\n\nIf you do not have any mods installed, can you try and share the craft file, so other people can try flying your mission and check what goes wrong?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T09:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 09:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T12:06:20Z","Content":"With a command module crewed by a Kerbal who is not a tourist you will always have control unless you are in timewarp.

I made a few changes on my initial craft and tested a few more things, instead of 3 i now have 4 Reliants fueled by 2 FL-T800 tanks on top of each other. The first picture shows the Fuel and Oxydizer gauge right after i ditch my first stage, if you notice one FL-T800 only has 50% Oxydizer left which is strange because i haven\u0027t even activated the second stage yet - as indicated by my staging sequence on the left. And same with the EC, notice that its already drained a little of the total EC and i have not activated anything that would require EC yet.\n\nAny ideas why this would happen?
