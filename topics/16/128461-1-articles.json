planes are pretty easy, though.\u00A0 The very basic parts you need (Mk1 cockpit, simple landing gear, wings, control surfaces, Juno engine \u0026amp; small intake) are very cheap \u0026amp; early on the tech tree, and it\u0027s not hard to build a plane with them that will fly okay.\u00A0 It won\u0027t take you to space, or even the upper atmosphere, but it can be very handy for tootling around Kerbin and gathering science from various biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get the hang of a simple Juno-powered plane that will fly you up to 12 km altitude or so, it\u0027s not much of a further step to stick a bit of LFO with a rocket engine (Terrier, if you\u0027ve got it) that can then enable you to do short hops up to the 20-25 km range, which is great for picking up contracts of the \u0022do \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;thing\u0026gt; \u003C/em\u003Ein flight above \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;18ish km\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E at \u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;place near

career decision.\u00A0 Heck, unlocking that node is worth it just so you can build a Juno-powered rover to gather science around KSC-- it pays for itself right there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, though, I agree with you-- for going to orbit, \u0022spaceplane SSTO or multi-stage rocket\u0022 is a big career decision (it involves investing in a different branch of the tech tree), and I\u0027d advise someone new to KSP to go the rocket route until they\u0027re more experienced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
