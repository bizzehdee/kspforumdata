This will give you a slightly higher speed, and wait to catch up with the stranded ship or person. Once you get within about 20km, you can start carefully steering toward the target with RCS, almost as if you\u0027re both not moving. The key is setting up the conditions and letting time do most of the work. It can take several orbits to get into position. Just be patient and keep using small burns.\n"}]}
