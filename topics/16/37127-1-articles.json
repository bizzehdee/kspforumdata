My bottom stage (the bit that gets me most of the way into orbit) is usually 12-16x radially symmetric Rockomax Jumbo64 fuel tanks (the 1440L ones) in asparagus configuration in two or so concentric layers with the Mainsail engines. The tanks are held on by the TT-70 radial decouplers that have a bit of extra space. I\u0027ve also tried the Structural Pylon for attachment/decoupling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, they always break before I can even get into orbit. One or more of the tanks come loose and fly up into the higher sections of my craft and blow it to pieces. Different tanks come off at different times. Sometimes they come off quite early, sometimes they come off late.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI usually end up trying to re-enforce the design with several EAS-4 struts. As I keep experimenting, and rockets inevitably keep coming off, I add more and more strut connectors. In the end, I have a giant web (read: mess) of struts going every which way, but it doesn\u0027t make the rocket any more structurally stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI once even saw a Jumbo 64 tank just fall off while the craft was docked, before I\u0027d engaged the engines. It was one of the outer ones, so no extra weight on it, and there were several struts connected between it and the inner tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother on-going problem is with TR-XL Stack Separators dropping the connection between the upper modules (with my command pod) and the lower modules with the engines. I add struts to try and hold the two sections steady, but this only works sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely love this game. I am a little obsessed with it. However, the fun part is up in space; not necessarily spending days and days trying to get my rocket up into orbit. I\u0027m starting to get quite frustrated. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a bug or if it\u0027s a problem with my designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running the latest version at this moment via Steam: 0.20.2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T03:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPicture would help a lot.

Usually I can make it launch after several hours of tweaking, but I agree it\u0027s a pain. Also, all the struts jack up the partcount.

If a part is strutted-out-the-wazoo and still breaking, it\u0027s possible that your struts are directing too much force through that part. In this situation, if you can \u0027route\u0027 some of the force through other parts it may help. I find tanks at the top of stacks (especially on asparagus stages) to be especially prone to this, and often I leave them nearly or completely without struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a means to redirect force, one effective technique I\u0027ve found here is to replace upper rockomax tanks on boosters with t800 tanks, stacked much higher to keep the same fuel load (1 x32 == 4 t800\u0027s). Of course, this only works on outer boosters where there is nothing above them. These taller stacks make fantastic supports to strut to your payload, moving more force to the top of your rocket in addition to stabilizing it against wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T13:51:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like you need more between tanks.
