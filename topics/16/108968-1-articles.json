It seems splashing down is not accepted as proper landing.\n\nDid anyone experience a similar problem, did I do something wrong here? I read there are some issues with docking and correct vessel identification, but I did perform docking between the Mun and Minmus landings and these steps are both considered complete.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T10:30:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 10:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketPropelledGiraffe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:28:05Z","Content":"It\u0027s just a label of your craft\u0027s state. It\u0027s kind of arbitrary if you ask me.

Once more some sub-optimal contract description, or rather poor contract scripting - both types of returning should count if you ask me.\n\nLet\u0027s see if I can find a backup save and hit Kerbin\u0027s desert in a second try..."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:49:24Z","Content":"Splashed Down and Landed are each unique states. \n\nFor example, you will get contracts to test certain parts while either landed or splashed down, and being in the water unticks the landed requirement. Essentially they are what you think they are. Landed is on land, splashed down in water."},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPropelledGiraffe","CreatedById":143863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T10:30:35Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen a \u0022splashed down\u0022 test contract since 1.0 - In my opinion these never made much sense and I had hoped they were gone. \n\nI guess it\u0027s good I am aware of the difference now and do not have to learn the massive extreme hard way by splashing down after working on a \u0022all planets grand tour\u0022 contract.\n\nAnyway, I gave it another try and managed to return to Kerbin\u0027s Highlands, mission accomplished."}]}
