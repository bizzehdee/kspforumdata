Yoour heading is shown on the navball as HDG). Good thing is to target the craft you want to rendezvous with and watch where it is on the navball - if it\u0027s anywhere other than directly above/below you, it will give you some notion as to where exactly you should be heading. Also realize that the planet is rotating, will impart this velocity to your craft and you will need to correct for that - if your target is at, say 45\u00B0 heading, you will need to launch to about 35\u00B0 - 40\u00B0 (because your initial heading will be to 90\u00B0)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Launch in the picked direction, rendezvous as usual\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope it helps \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T13:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved over to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeutherius is on the right track: Wait until KSC is underneath the target\u0027s orbit, set the rescuee as target, then watch the navball carefully during ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T14:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to calculate this mathematically, here\u00A0is a good resource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.orbiterwiki.org/wiki/Launch_Azimuth\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.orbiterwiki.org/wiki/Launch_Azimuth\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T15:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222434978\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133176\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456741406\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156179\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022berkekrkn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, berkekrkn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1-) How can I know, to which degree I should turn, in order to make my relative inlinction near \u00220\u00B0\u0022 with target orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125381-deutherius/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125381\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125381-deutherius/\u0022\u003E@Deutherius\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0said, wait until KSC rotates under the target orbit, the launch parallel with it (being sure to be going in the same direction as the target object \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: \u00A0Because you\u0027re not taking off to the east, you don\u0027t get as much help from Kerbin\u0027s rotation. \u00A0Thus, you\u0027ll need more fuel to get to the same orbital altitude for an inclined orbit as you would with an equatorial orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, MechJeb\u0027s Ascent Guidance can do this quite easily. \u00A0Put the rocket on the pad, go to the map, and select the target. \u00A0Then go back to the launchpad, bring up Ascent Guidance, select \u0022launch into target\u0027s plane\u0022 or even \u0022launch to rendezvous\u0022, engage the autopilot, and off you go. \u00A0But it\u0027s just doing the same thing as the manual method above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a more general case, if you need an inclined orbit at another planet or moon, that\u0027s very easy. \u00A0Just do the normal transfer burn in the equatorial plane. \u00A0Then at some convenient point along the way, do another burn to tweak your approach so your Pe at the target is over the north or under the south pole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"berkekrkn","CreatedById":156179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T17:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for answers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1-) This is the orbit of his vessel.

A little clumsy (as is the explanation, sorry), especially for higher orbits, but it can provide a fast and easy estimation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Not the most practical, but an easy solution would be to put a satellite exactly on the equatorial orbit (inclination 0\u00B0, always heading to 90\u00B0). Switch to that vessel, target the unfortunate soul you vowed to rescue and find out the relative inclination right on the AN/DN. Also possible with a vessel in polar orbit, but probably not a good idea for non-equatorial launch sites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Not much of a Mechjeb user, but I would probably try to play with the ascent path settings, or whatever it\u0027s called. Maybe you can set it to climb steeper and/or build the rocket in such a way that the first stage gives you a sufficient Ap, then just circularise with the second stage in one burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
