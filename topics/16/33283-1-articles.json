For putting landing gear on wings, I recommend turning off angle-snap so the gear are perpendicular to the wings. I have learned through lots of frustration that the ascent profile of a spaceplane is incredibly dependent on how much air your engines have, and how much thrust they produce. You should probably have about a 2:1 ratio of ram-air intakes to jet engines. For air scoops you should have about a 3:1 ratio. The problem where your planes spin out is caused by an asymmetrical flameout of the jet engines, that is one engine running out of air slightly before the other. The solution for that is to either have only one jet engine, or all of your engines in a tight cluster at the back of the plane. To address the high altitude control problem, always use RCS to help rotate your plane in the upper atmosphere ( \u0026gt;25km). To achieve orbit and have enough fuel for rendezvous, make sure to have at least 2500 m/s of delta V. I have not found too many good spaceplane tutorials out there, but you should still check out Scott Manley\u0027s video tutorials for KSP. You may want to try out Ferram Aerospace Research because it fixes up the aerodynamics in the game, so planes fly like they should. However, it may seem to make it too easy to launch rockets into orbit because they now take about 30% less fuel.
