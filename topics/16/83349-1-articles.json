I would really REALLY like it if I could make the game full-screen or at least maximize the window. I\u0027m led to believe there is a way to do this, but as I recall it\u0027s involved enough that I said \u0022forget it.\u0022 So I guess a better way to say it is I\u0027d like there to be a simple way to maximize or go full-screen. Like a functional \u0022Maximize\u0022 button on the window, or a function key that will take you to full-screen mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trainzack","CreatedById":100807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T03:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have anything to add to this other then that I misread the title as relativity, as in, the theory of relativity.
