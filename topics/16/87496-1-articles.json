Until then, the best thing to do is to increase the TWR one way or another by, for example, switching out the engines (I would replace the rapiers [the rapiers are only really useful for SSTOs; they provide little to no advantage to atmospheric jets and even have less thrust than the turbojet] with basic jet engines if you\u0027re planning to fly low in the atmosphere or turbojets if you want to be flying at high altitudes.

Now this doesn\u0027t mean you need to make the U-2 Spy plane sized wings or some other rediculous scaled wings, but you need more lift generating surface vs the mass of the craft. You could honestly get away with dumping half of your fuel and science gear and go for a lighter design.
