I\u0027ve seen a couple of thems just today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big trick with a plane to Duna is going to be designing it with sufficient delta-V to get there and back. By which I mean that once you shut off your jets, you\u0027ve basically got a rocket with wings. It\u0027ll need 1090 to get to Duna and 1920 to get back, say 3000 m/s of delta-V plus a reserve in case of screw-up. That\u0027s assuming you want to try to do a round trip effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far the Kerbin launch goes, you can handle it just like a regular spaceplane launch. Standard guidelines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 10 tonnes maximum takeoff mass per Basic Jet, 13 per RAPIER or 15 per Turbojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No less than .03 intake area per engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A 1:1 total lift coefficient-to-take off mass ratio\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 40 units of liquid fuel and about 25 units of oxider per maximum take off mass (this assumes the use of RAPIERs, so take it with a grain of salt). This should be separate and distinct from the fuel you\u0027ll use to carry out the interplanetary portion of the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll recommend nuclear engines as your spacefaring engines of choice for a Duna mission unless you can manage a really small design. Though they\u0027re heavy, their high Isp will let you get away with carrying less fuel than you\u0027d otherwise need.

In that case, he\u0027d probably want fewer turbojets, fewer intakes, more wings, and as much LF/O as he can possibly cram on there. It\u0027s probably possible to make something which can do both reasonably well, but I would still emphasize making a Duna spaceplane instead of an LKO spaceplane, and refueling from a separate SSTO in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027d advise against including Basic Jets at all: they\u0027re basically worthless for anything other than low-atmosphere, low-speed maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T21:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t diss the basic jet so hard; it can get you up all the way through the atmosphere on low technology tiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe turbojet is way better of course, but it\u0027s a higher tier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the OP: For lift, you\u0027ll need rather a lot more wings to land at Duna than necessary for liftoff at Kerbin (unlike the situation with Laythe).

As for doing orbit, you are most likely going to be best off with a jet powered rocket like design. Unless you are going to laythe, the jet engines are more or less dead weight that has no use whatsoever once you leave orbit, so use the bare minimum (or grab rapiers which can be used as good brakes provided you mnistime the brake burn on duna with a craft that needs to do this as it doesnt have the lift).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-14T17:00:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2014 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
