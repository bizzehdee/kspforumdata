Each engine has an SRB attached (so I can have nine Liquid rockets at the base). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow. With the SRBs the thrust in stage six is good but obviously they run out far quicker than the liquid rockets so when the SRBs deplete their fuel the rocket decelerates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if I could jettison the weight but keep the liquid booters in that stage running it would be much better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there a way to start both the SRB and Liquid in one stage but jettison the SRB while leaving the liquid rockets firing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m experimenting with the radial decouper but can\u0027t figure it out, plust it\u0027s super destable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goatler","CreatedById":1160,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T20:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8pGhe.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/8pGhe.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8pGhe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228pGhe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duk3luk3","CreatedById":506,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T21:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Goatler is trying to say: You can edit the staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zinfandel","CreatedById":933,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T23:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah thanks chaps.
