The docking worked perfect. \n\nThan I started the first module of my space station. For sure I tried to dock on that station. So by the distance of about 10 meters I opened the shield and deactivated the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\n\nAt about 3 meters the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClamp-O-Tron Shielded Docking Port\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClamp-O-Tron Docking Port\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 forced each other. I got a contact.\n\nAnd than I fast forwarded the time. And during that (about 10 seconds in real game time) the connection got lost. So the docking ship drifted slowly away from the space station. A reconnection was not possible. Therefore I checked the correct position of the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClamp-O-Tron Docking Port\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. It has the correct side up.\n\nI tried all the other \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClamp-O-Tron Docking Ports\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 from my space station but there they ports did not even try to get in magnetically contact.\n\nAfter some more tries I controlled the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClamp-O-Tron Shielded Docking Port\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 from the docking ship.\n\nAnd there I just get the message, that the port is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clooked\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\n\nI can not even close the shield.\n\nI also tried to fix the docking port followed the instruction from [kujuman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37215-Can-anyone-dock-this/page2?p=474111\u0026viewfull=1#post474111). \n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHOW TO FIX THE DOCKING PORT*\n\n*1. Go into the persistent.sfs file*\n\n*2. Search for a line which says \u0022state = Acquire\u0022*\n\n*3. Change to \u0022state = Ready\u0022*\n\n*4. Load up the game and dock with the port nearby.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\nThat did also not worked out.\n\nI can do an EVA but the status of the shield is still \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Clooked\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for me?\n\nBest regards"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T10:07:52Z","Content":"First of all, backup your save files before editing, always a good idea.\n\nWhat I would recommend is launching a new vessel onto the launchpad consisting only of a shielded docking port and a probe core.\n\nGive it a unique name and after setting it on the pad and opening the shield quicksave. Then go to your KSP-Directory\\saves\\quicksave.sfs and look for the docking port vessel. Scroll down a little until you find the thing that says \n\n    PART{         name=dockingport1 etc. etc.\n\nand search for this section\n\n    MODULE                        {                          then a crapload of text and code, finished by a curly bracket on the some vertical line as the opening one like so                        }\n\nCopy the entire MODULE section and paste it into the MODULE section of the dockingport on the vessel that you are having trouble with.\n\nSave your changes, exit and then load the quicksave in KSP. Simply recover the vessel on the launchpad and switch to the vessel which you wanted to dock, dock as usual.
