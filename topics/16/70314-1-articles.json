I don\u0027t know/remember how tylo orbits. If it\u0027s possible you could also try to get to your destination planet on the other side, Where you\u0027ll go pass laythe and jool and not tylo, Making it better so you can not have to worry about tylo. But that\u0027s the best i could do, I\u0027m sure HarvesteR Will work on this, Until then that\u0027s all i can say. Maybe try to get into an orbit around tylo then from tylo go to your destination planet, Other than that i don\u0027t know, Hope i helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T07:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you have to just accept Tylo\u0027s help whether you wanted it to begin with or not.
