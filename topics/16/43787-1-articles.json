I\u0027ve been trying to duplicate a \u0022Modular Girder Segment\u0022 with four \u0022M-1X1 Structural Panels\u0022 attached to it, but it won\u0027t let me duplicate the whole assembly; I can only duplicate the individual parts. I\u0027ve tried a few different things to see if I could turn it into one whole assembly and duplicate all of it, but I\u0027ve not figured out how to yet. So hopefully one or more of you can tell me how, if at all, it\u0027s doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-25T16:45:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2013 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MSG ANIMOTAKU\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T05:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to alt\u002Bclick the \u0022root part\u0022 or the piece that attaches directly to the rest of the ship.

Thank you good sir or madam. I tried that before but to no avail; I guess I must have done something a little bit different than what you told me.
