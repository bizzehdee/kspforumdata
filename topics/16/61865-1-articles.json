Got a nice station going with fuel tanks and docking ports for expansion on a near perfect circular orbit at 260 km. Now I couldn\u0027t do anything. When ever I past 0 m/s target speed the game bugs out and the target speed begins to to accelerate and decelerate peak pass 4000 m/s. At that point I couldn\u0027t switch to the station or go back to the space center. I either have to revert launch or load a quick save. Started a new save, same thing. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s because of the mods since I built the station with parts from them. I\u0027m using 2.5m ports and fuel tanks.
