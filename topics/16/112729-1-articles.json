I want to explore Kerbin\u0027s poles, but for that I would need a polar orbit, and I am having a bit of trouble with that. How do I achieve a polar orbit? I have heard that there are a few ways, but I would opt for the easiest. Any help is appreciated!

Either way though, you likely need more control authority to overcome gravity pulling down your nose, which you can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control fins.\n\nEDIT: A good turning profile is most of all to be smooth. How fast to turn over depends on TWR and drag, but a decent start is something like 45 degrees(\\*) at 15km, 22.5\\* at 30km, and 5\\* at 40km.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T03:47:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainApollo","CreatedById":145000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T03:44:44Z","Content":"Hm, only have gimbals and control fins for now, I will try to use those then.
