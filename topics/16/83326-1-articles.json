I\u0027ve tried googling this, and the only thing i can find is that the third stage (which was used to circularize) was used to get them to the Moon. As I understand it they DID NOT perform a plane change maneuver prior to this, and only changed their orbit to adjust from a free return to a lunar insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany clarification would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-29T23:59:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2014 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Taki117\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T22:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the Moon\u0027s orbit is pretty much in the plane of the ecliptic, ideally the inclination would be 23.4 degrees.
