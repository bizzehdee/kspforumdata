At Eeloo distances, orbital corrections are fairly minor and it shouldn\u0027t be hard to get an intercept - treat it like a really slow rendezvous. Granted, if you miss by a bit it can take ages to correct and orbit around to get an intercept, but it isn\u0027t particularly hard or delta-v costly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T20:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe angle is not constant with this eccentricity. I\u0027ll give you targeting recipe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) select any craft in Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) plot a maneuver node so it just escapes Kerbin with minimal relative velocity (you won\u0027t fly it, just use it for prediction)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You\u0027ll get solar orbit that is very close to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. Select the target body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) put a maneuver node on it, raise apoapsis to target\u0027s orbit and adjust your intercept by changing maneuver\u0027s position - time to this maneuver node is how much is actually left before the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) for such inclined targets as Moho and Eeloo you\u0027ll have to play with midcourse corrections as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be difficult for first time (try practicing with Jool or Duna first), but when you master this you\u0027ll need. Also you could go for transfer orbit with a bit higher apoapsis - it\u0027s slightly more delta-V, but for for Jool and Eeloo you might win even twice less transfer time for like extra 300 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Do not follow the plotted flight path. ust wait for the found window and go directly into transfer orbit.
