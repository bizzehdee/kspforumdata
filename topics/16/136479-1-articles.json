Either lighten the top parts of your rocket up, replace the engine with a stronger one (with more fuel if needed), or maybe start the circularization burn earlier. You may need to begin the burn when you hit 70k and continue burning for some time. With a lower TWR it can take several minutes to get up to speed. Sometimes you have to turn more radial as well later in the burn if you mess up and need to go \u0022up\u0022 again. Really wasteful on fuel, but it\u0027s better than crashing if you\u0027ve got extra fuel. Just turn back towards space (the blue part of the navball) until you\u0027re like at a 45 degree angle.

Mods that add a proper HUD give lots more info, like vertical and horizontal velocity. For example, when you\u0027re going up into space it starts out with \u0022surface velocity\u0022. That\u0027s actually a mixture of your up/down speed and your side to side speed. If you\u0027re going 300 m/s up and 50 m/s to the side it\u0027ll probably say 350 m/s. But that 350 m/s could just as easily be 50 m/s up and 300 m/s to the side. You don\u0027t know without a proper HUD.. it\u0027s annoying. Orbit velocity is similar - as you go up into space you\u0027re pushing yourself faster and faster upwards, and hopefully to the side as well. Your \u0022surface velocity\u0022 will go up and up, reaching like 900 m/s in the upper atmosphere. Eventually it\u0027ll turn into \u0022orbit velocity\u0022. This is similar, it\u0027s a combination of your speed in different directions at any one time. After you\u0027ve killed you first stage ascent engines and you\u0027re drifting to your apoapsis (highest point in the arc), you\u0027re no longer accelerating in the side to side (or forward) direction. However, you are being pulled downwards by gravity.. which is why you\u0027re moving in an arc. As you move up the arc you\u0027ll lose speed because you\u0027re gradually being slowed by gravity (like throwing a ball straight up into the air.. it\u0027ll go to its highest point, then slow, stop, and fall back to the ground). Your rocket slows in the up/down direction, so your \u0022orbit velocity\u0022 goes down. If you don\u0027t do anything it\u0027ll eventually start going up again as you start falling, you\u0027re speeding up in the \u0022down direction\u0022.. which you don\u0027t really want. Somewhat counter intuitively \u0022orbit velocity\u0022 also lowers when you speed up and move into a higher orbit. You sped up to get out there, but on the way out gravity saps all that speed away. When you do a circularization burn to raise your periapsis to a higher altitude it doesn\u0027t take much speed to circularize the orbit generally because gravity is weaker the farther out you go.. so higher orbits take lots of speed to reach, but are slow once you get there.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne other thing to keep in mind - pay attention to which direction you\u0027re burning in. Say you launch, get up to your apoapsis to do your circularization burn, burn prograde (forward), and bring your periapsis up above the atmosphere. You\u0027re now in orbit. You time warp around to the other side of the planet and get to your periapsis.. now you\u0027re facing retrograde \u0022backwards\u0022. Your rocket didn\u0027t rotate at all - but because of how you\u0027re moving it\u0027s now \u0022falling\u0022 backwards.. warp around the planet again, back to the apoapsis.. and you\u0027re falling \u0022forwards\u0022 again, facing prograde.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that I think about it, and hopefully this isn\u0027t the case, but the other thing that can decelerate you is burning retrograde (backwards).
