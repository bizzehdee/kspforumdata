It fits in a Mk3 cargo bay for delivery to another planet and it flies great - stable, insanely agile, flies as slow as 50 m/s or as fast as Mach 0.75, won\u0027t break unless I crash it, works with or without a Kerbal. Only problem is, I can\u0027t sort the landing gear out. I tried conventional (\u0027taildragger\u0027) landing gear with a single small steerable gear at the back and either the fixed \u0027stick\u0027 gear or the smallest rover wheels at front, but in both cases I get a shimmy on the takeoff roll and lose control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve not tried a tricycle gear but I\u0027d be worried about tailstrikes. I\u0027d consider bicycle gear and use a reaction wheel to keep it balanced, but I can\u0027t use only the steerable gear because they have no brakes. I\u0027m not sure if there are any parts I could use as skids that are durable enough but not really heavy, considering the whole plane only weighs about a ton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other ideas? I\u0027d prefer to keep the plane using stock parts, but mods aren\u0027t out of the question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-26T13:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not your gear configuration that is the problem.\u00A0 That \u0027shimmy\u0027 as you call is is the big problem with landing gear in 1.1.\u00A0 It\u0027s a bug, and there really isn\u0027t a good way to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-26T13:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCut down friction on the steerable wheel massively ( just manually raise it if you want to actually steer with the wheel ), and try cutting the spring rate a bit while leaving the damping.
