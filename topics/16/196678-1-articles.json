Are cargo bays and structural tubes water tight in the current game version? Also do structural wings hold together own their own or do they still have to be structed together?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Fistful Of Double Downs","CreatedById":207101,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-03T08:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dunno much about wings because aerodynamic flight is the devil, but when I tried getting to the bottom of the sea I found that pretty much everything is watertight and the only way down is to load up on parts with a density higher than 1. I\u0027m not an expert, but I think the game just assigns each object a volume when determining density and doesn\u0027t really care whether it\u0027s opened or closed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-04T03:07:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think anything changed for water in the last year. Strut behavior and general part strength seems to have gradually improved, but I don\u0027t know how much of that is due to my construction style improving, and use of mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost (all?) parts behave like they are watertight even if the graphics show water inside. Buoyancy is unaffected whether a part shows water inside or not. Almost everything floats and it\u0027s a struggle to stay underwater without ore for ballast (or using mods).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tested the stock water graphics in the latest 1.10.1 release (I use Scatterer mod for prettier water), but I think it\u0027s safe to assume that water behavior hasn\u0027t changed. It would be big news if we could carry water and make airborne firefighting tankers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStructural Wings\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLong wings still have a risk of flapping during hard turns, but I haven\u0027t needed the strut-everything approach in a long time.
