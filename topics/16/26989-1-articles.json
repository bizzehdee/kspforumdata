You can see some of my earlier posts asking for help..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- assuming u have the same inclination as target...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Basically, you need to watch your speed and where your \u0022Prograde\u0022 is. What I do, is this. From the beginning I get myself into orbit, I mark my target, and I set up a lower orbit if I need to catch up, or a higher orbit if I need to slow down. (This depends whether or not the target is in front or behind me in orbit.) I do this the second I detach my ascent rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Then I time warp until I\u0027m as close as I can get, sometimes you need to tweak it with maneuver nodes, but for the most part if your no more than 5-15km different in orbital height it will be close. Note it will take a few full orbits to get closer, but you will see each time around the planet you get closer and closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once I\u0027m within let\u0027s say 20km away from target, I switch from map view to ship view and switch my camera to \u0022Chase\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I slow down by burning Retrograde. You watch your target speed above your Nav ball to see this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once I get it to about 0.1 - 0.5m/s. I then turn the ship towards the pink prograde of the target and burn until I get the Yellow prograde to line up. Now this will need constant adjustment as you move closer. This is because of how orbital mechanics work and you constantly need to adjust your self. Once it gets too far off like your yellow prograde is on the edge of the Nav ball, I go find my Yellow Retro grade and zero out the speed again. Then once is slows to 0.1 - 0.5 I burn toward the pink prograde again. You may need to rinse and repeat this a few times, but you will get there. I had a hard time with higher speeds as I got closer so I choose to keep it at a comfortable 10m/s for anything under 2km. Some people are different, but I find this gives me a lot of time to make adjustments. Time warp is your friend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once you get closer I switch to docking mode. This turns off your engines and moves you to only RCS control. You toggle between Vertical/Horizontal/Speed adjustments to pitch adjustment. You hit space bar to move between the two. (Now keep in mind, by the time you switch to docking mode, you need to have your speed down to not much more that 1-1.5m/s depending on the size of your craft. You will spend too much Mono trying to slow down if your going too fast. )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now that your in Docking mode, you keep adjusting your ships trajectory (Prograde marker) with the WSAD keys to keep your yellow prograde aligned with the Pink target Prograde. (Note: in docking mode, the direction your nose is pointing does not matter, only where the yellow prograde is in relation to the pink one. This changes when you actually need to make contact, but I worry about pointing the nose only at the last 10m. Just don\u0027t let it go crazy) WSAD adjusts horizontal and speed and Left Shift and Left Control changes vertical. Keep in mind some times making any type of movement will change your speed to target, you need to keep it under control. Should your Prograde marker disappear you are at 0.0m/s and just need to hit W to speed up toward target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a video that helped me understand it a bit.

It\u0027s much easier to do this if they\u0027re already quite similar (particularly if they\u0027re in the same orbital plane; the map screen gives you the angle of relative inclination to your target at the ascending and descending nodes, which are the points where the planes of two orbits intersect) and if you\u0027re target is already in a circular or near-circular orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027d advise (if you haven\u0027t already done this): Put some RCS fuel and thrusters on the craft you\u0027re piloting. Once you get within \u0022eyeball range\u0022 of your target, RCS thrusters are much more versatile than your main engines. They allow you to translate (i.e. change your direction of movement without changing the way your nose is pointing), which is quite useful indeed for rendezvous maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Crossposted with Evermore.

To do that, with the navball in target mode, point to the retrograde indicator (the green (X) ) and burn, keeping a close eye on your velocity indicator. You should see it approaching 0.

Point toward your target vector indicator (the pink (o) ) and make a small burn to bring your speed up and close on the target. You want to adjust your vector until the prograde indicator (yellow O ) is over the target vector indicator, by overshooting the target vector indicator by a little bit, \u0027tugging\u0027 the prograde vector toward it. Once close enough, burn toward the target until your relative velocity is high enough to reach it in a minute or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve done that, turn around to face your retrograde indicator again, which should now be near the target retrograde indicator (pink Y ). As you get close to your target, start to slow down by burning toward your retrograde, but at the same time you want to be overshooting your retrograde a bit on the opposite side from the target retrograde indicator, \u0027pushing\u0027 the retrograde indicator toward the target retrograde indicator. This will fine tune your approach to intercept as you continue to decelerate and get closer, until you are right on top of it, at which point burn directly toward your retrograde indicator until your relative velocity reads about 0.2m/s or less. Congratulations, you\u0027re ready to switch to docking mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
