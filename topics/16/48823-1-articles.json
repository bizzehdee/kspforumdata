It\u0027s got enough power (and functioning solar cells), as well as some Mono-propellant and an SAS (which i had left active and might be why it\u0027s still standing how it should be).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T05:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are able to select the lander in the Tracking Station part of the game (and load that vehicle), press the Gear button at the top of your HUD (Heads Up Display).
