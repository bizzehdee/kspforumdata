When I look at the map, it seems like the intercept could work for when Duna is at the lowest point in it\u0027s orbit, but not for any other point.

To do that, you need to judge whether you are \u0022too early\u0022 or \u0022too late\u0022 at the transfer point (a quicksave and warping to rendezvous point is a good way to determine that). If you are early, burn between RAD\u002B and retrograde to shorten your orbit while still keeping it near the target, and if you\u0027re late, burn between RAD- and prograde - with those corrections, if the inclination is correct, you\u0027ll definitely get a rendezvous (as long as you have enough fuel for the correction burns).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lucidLemon","CreatedById":33691,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T20:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I understated the severity of how off course my trajectory is, it\u0027s not even close, despite phase and ejection angle and ejection velocity being matched almost perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only sending me around halfway the distance between Duna and Kerbin, but it definitely looks like it would intercept if Duna were at the lower altitude section of it\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou ninja\u0027d me olex, I hadn\u0027t really been able to access most of the forums due to lag.
