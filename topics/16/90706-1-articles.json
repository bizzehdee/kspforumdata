A bit much for that poor claw, as it seems: the vessel is swaying like a tree in the wind. Not too bad, really, like perhaps by one degree or at worst two. It takes like a minute to complete one back-and-forth motion. So in, which makes it tedious to figure out the average orientation. It doesn\u0027t ever settle down, even the tried-and-true method of entering/leaving time warp doesn\u0027t do the trick. So in terms of flex and wobble, this is almost a non-issue -- but for purposes of aligning my vessel behind the asteroid\u0027s center of mass, it\u0027s already way too much.

Instead, I just plot out a node beforehand, release my claw, orient the rocket to where it needed to be pointed at, then switch to docking mode so I won\u0027t lose the direction as I maneuver around the asteroid and grab it again, this time with the engine toward the correct end of space. Seems to be much faster and more stable for me. But that was because I didn\u0027t have anything else to assist the asteroid turn like you do with other SAS and RCS module attached on the asteroid.\u003Cp\u003EIf the asteroid already spin like hell, well, that is a whole another problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly how I maneuver large asteroids. Even very large asteroids are fairly easy to manage this way. Create a node, maneuver around the asteroid so the maneuver node and asteroid COM are aligned, attach, and thrust as required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a suggestion to get rid of unwanted rotation you induce as you thrust. Reduce thrust to zero, turn off RCS and SAS, and time warp briefly. Time warp stops rotation magically. It helps to stop rotation before you detach to maneuver around the asteroid, trying to reattach to asteroids which are rotating can be a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
