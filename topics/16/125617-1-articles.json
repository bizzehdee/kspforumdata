Rewarding the player for these things again with the milestones wouldn\u0026#39;t serve much of a purpose. The passive rewards were added in response to people being disincentivized to progress due to waiting on the contract system to generate any particular contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat might help, is not locking the Explores when the player visits the planet, and making them repeatable, but lowering the rewards a bit to compensate.
