IMO, Moho rotates so fast that there basically aren\u0027t transfer windows for it, and its high inclination makes traditional Hohmann transfers a poor choice. Seriously, please don\u0027t try Hohmann transfers to Moho... they make Jeb sad. There are two other options: Bi-ecliptic transfers, and braking orbits. Knowing when the Kerbin crosses Moho\u0027s AN/DN axis with the ecliptic \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E useful. For a bi-elliptic transfer, you want to escape kerbin at that time so your apoapsis is also on that that axis so your inclination change is cheaper. For an approach with a braking orbit, you don\u0027t even necessarily need to a plane change if your periapsis will intersect Moho along the AN/DN axis, but you made have a higher velocity relative to Moho when you\u0027re getting captured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the first time Kerbin crosses Moho\u0027s AN/DN node is around Kerbin day 50-60 (~ 12-15 earth days), and then every 1/2 Kerbin year after that.

That\u0027s great to measure from on day 1, but after that you have to calculate what angle Kerbin is at at a given time before you can use it as a reference. No good. So I do it like this (For reference I\u0027m looking from above the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, defined as the direction from which Kerbin appears to be traveling counter-clockwise around Kerbol.

From this we can compute when Kerbin passes through the plane of Moho\u0027s orbit,, since we know when Kerbin was at 180 degrees and we know how many degrees it travels in a (24-hour) day. This is what I think you want to know- Kerbin passes through the plane of Moho\u0027s orbit on day 21.74 and day 75.00, and every 106.5225 days after those times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You can\u0027t say that Kerbin is always in the plane of Moho\u0027s orbit on a given Kerbal-time (6-hour days) day, because a Kerbal year is an integer number of Kerbal days, but Kerbin\u0027s real orbit is not an integer number of days, so as the years go by you\u0027ll be off by more and more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I used my \u0027Lambert E\u0027 spreadsheet to figure out this data, get it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80978-Flyby-Finder-for-KSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. The page \u0027Calc positions\u0027 gives the x, y, and z positions of a planet at a given time as well as the anomaly as measured with the \u0027Kerbin-starts-at-180-degrees method. Look for the times that the z-position of a planet passes through 0 meters and see what \u0027approx absolute angle\u0027 it\u0027s at on that day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary I can give you the 1st UT day that Kerbin passes through the ascending and descending nodes of a planet, you would have to make a little calculator that adds Kerbin years to the 1st pass to determine all later passes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T21:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sirrobert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill easier than waiting for both the AN AND the transfer window to line up at the same time\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not waiting for the transfer window, just the AN/DN.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PLAD","CreatedById":104158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T23:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt struck me that it is a bit tricky to edit this spreadsheet from scratch, so here is some detail on how I used it to find when Kerbin crosses the plane of a planet, Eve in this example.
