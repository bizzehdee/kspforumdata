Such as the mun. You don\u0027t to add parachutes and you could decouple engines if you want. Make sure you add docking port for moving the parts together or build one big one and land it. Make sure your base is somewhere flat. Minimus and low gravity planets are recommended. Duna could be for amateurs.

The high gravity could also make in-situ construction more difficult. You can\u0027t use EVA packs on it.\n\nDuna is far easier to reach, has lower gravity and a thinner atmosphere, and has that \u0022I made a base on Mars\u0022 feel to it. You can\u0027t use jet engines there, but the atmosphere is thick enough for ion/efficient rocket powered planes. You can also use jetpacks on it, but just barely. Finding a landing site, however, can be a bit of a task, since most of the terrain is atrociously sloped.\n\nThe Mun gives you access to floaty gravity and is the nextdoor neighbor to Kerbin, making rescues quick and simple. The terrain is varied enough to be interesting, and finding flat parts isn\u0027t terribly difficult. Using rovers for in-situ assembly can be somewhat difficult thanks to the gravity, though. You\u0027ll have to stick to non-atmospheric transportation thanks to its lack of an atmosphere.\n\nMinmus has even sillier gravity and makes landing very large, otherwise awkward components a breeze.

Its closer and easier to assembly if you dont cheat your way there ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n2.

Refuelling stop? Laboratory? Holiday resort? Why do you want it on the ground instead of in orbit?\n\nBut as others have said: Minmus for easy, Duna for easiest interplanetary, Laythe for scenic. Laythe is easy to get up and down on if you\u0027re comfortable using air-breathing spaceplanes."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:20:46Z","Content":"As others have said, Minmus makes for a very good place to put a base for many reasons. If all you want is \u0022a base\u0022 and you don\u0027t know what all is needed, then Minmus makes for very fast turnarounds so you can fix problems, restart missions, send up other missions, or whatever is needed. Think of it as KSP Bases with training wheels.\n\nIn addition, if your base is to be a Karbonite and/or Extraplanetary Launchpads base, Minmus goes from a great choice to a FANTASTIC one. Topping off (or building and launching) your interplanetary ships from there can save you a TON of fuel, simply because you don\u0027t have to lift your interplanetary fuel off of Kerbin, you can lift it off of Minmus instead."}]}
