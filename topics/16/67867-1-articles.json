It weighs more, takes up more space, transmits less data per packet and uses more electricity to transmit each packet, yet it\u0027s further down the tree in career mode. Only benefit its a 0.8 vs 0.7 crash tolerance...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T16:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the antennas are highly unbalanced, the only thing the big one has better than the small one is transmit speed.
