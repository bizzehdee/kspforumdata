The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E problem is probaby the worst part. I\u0027ll notice the heading is drifting, even with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on. If I set to Prograde or such, it settles (kind of) on a point about 20 degrees below the marker. It\u0027s kind of intermittent but happens on a regular basis. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven without the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E problem it\u0027s hard to control craft as it seems to take forever to recover from small inputs, and this is with plenty of reaction wheels going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(29,33,41);font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-align:left;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:pre-wrap;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003EI\u0027ve played with dead band and sensitivity settings but not really having any luck.

Maybe try to recalibrate your stick in windows? Speaking of which, how does the calibration look? You know, that little window that shows you the actual input values? Is the cursor stable or twitchy or something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Extreme 3D Pro should work fine with KSP. But it is notorious for having some play around the deadzone, as many other joysticks of the same price segment do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso keep in mind that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is correcting your rotations for overrotation etc, so the little orange input markers in KSP can show some weird things sometimes. Try without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled, just a pod sitting on the pad, and the little markers should mirror your stick movement pretty perfectly if all is well. The behaviour you describe sounds a bit strange indeed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you can work this out somehow, a joystick is a very nice thing in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
