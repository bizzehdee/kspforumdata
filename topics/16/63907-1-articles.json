And in getting that up and running I looked at several solutions and found a combination that works really well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst issue is capturing the video. Most screen-capture software just dumps uncompressed or only mildly compressed video onto your hard-disk. Resulting in huge video files that require a lot of your PC to work with later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://download.cnet.com/Bandicam/3000-13633_4-75332824.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBandicam\u003C/a\u003E solves this (link to trial version, 10 minutes cap on video-capture). It compresses video on the fly which in this day and age of multiple CPU cores doesn\u0027t affect the gameplay all that much. Should the game be CPU heavy and tax all your available cores, Bandicam can instead compress to h.264 using the GPU, just as long as you got a newer nVidia card with CUDA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the latter, compressing on the fly using the graphics card, as War Thunder is quite CPU heavy. My graphics card though got processor power to spare, as I\u0027ve capped it at 60fps - the refresh rate of my monitor. So I suffer no frameloss when capturing in-game video using Bandicam (at 30fps and 1280x720 resolution - in-game is 60fps and 1920x1080). File sizes is about 1.2gig for 10 minutes of video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is video-editing. I got experience with Avid, so I\u0027d love to use that. But it cost an arm and a leg, plus pawning off your first-born. So not really an option. I tried using Premiere, but I found that tedious, as it had to convert from h.264 to whatever Premiere use internally. After a bit of digging, I found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.avs4you.com/AVS-Video-Editor.aspx?type=GoogleAdWordsSearch\u0026amp;gclid=CJSGheyw4rwCFQeQcgodAmsAQQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAVS Video Editor\u003C/a\u003E (free trial, if you buy you get 15 other tools in the bargain), that works really well with h.264 files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit lightweight as far as video editors goes, more for the home/casual user than the professional, but it gets the job done and is very cheap. No need to convert imported files and when the project is done it got presets for exporting into a format that is optimized for YouTube (amongst others). Really easy to work with, and you only need to render your video once - when exporting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-23T13:49:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2014 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zylark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling, links\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
