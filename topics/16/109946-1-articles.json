Don\u0027t forget to cancel your horizontal velocity before you touchdown. Your EVA pack can even get you to safely land on solid ground after you cancel your horizontal velocity so make sure to only have vertical velocity. If you ask me kerbals feels too tough, the landing felt too fast to me but my kerbal still survived with a big thump and dust cloud.
